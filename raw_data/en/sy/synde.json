Executive Summary Endeavour College of Natural Health ('Endeavour') is a dual sector learning and teaching institution which is currently classified through the federal regulator Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency (TEQSA) as a Higher Education Provider. It is Endeavour 's long term goal to be reclassified by TEQSA as an Australian University of Specialisation , which requires the delivery of undergraduate and postgraduate courses including Master and Doctoral qualifications by research . Prior to achieving this peak classification, Endeavour will aim to first be recognised as a Self-accrediting Hi gher Education Provider, and then as a University College. The latter of these two categories also requires Endeavour to deliver research degree qualifications . The delivery of research degree courses in any institution requires a solid research supportive infrastructure . Developing this infrastructure in an organisation which has not traditionally undertaken research activities requires a systematic approach to building up research capacity . Upon achieving Self -accrediting Higher Educati on Provider classification, Endeavour is to be primed to continue its progress ion towards University College and Australian University of Specialisation status. This requires that foundational work on infrastructure and capacity for research activities at Endeavour begin immediately . This Research S trategy presents a clear process to facilitate Endeavour in establishing valuable, meaningful and relevant practitioner -based research activities, and in doing so develop t he framework necessary to build towards its long term goals to achieve University College , and ultimately Australian University of Specialisation , status . The overarching aims of this strategy are to: Support the creation of new knowledge related to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) ; Critically examine Endeavour's practice and activities to inform future improvements ; Explore the risks and benefits of CAM for the broader community ; and Engage with key stakeholders within the health community and the general population to examine the p lace and role of CAM in contemporary health care . This strategy provides the scope for Endeavour to engage in a broad range of research activities related not only to its health specialties, but also its role in advancing excellence in specialised health e ducation and its potential to inform health policy. This document also provides an important nexus between teaching and research at Endeavour through the encouragement of quality scholarship and research activities. A number of important stages are descri bed within this strategy including: 1. Create a research positive environment: including developing a strategic relationship with the Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM), and revising the Mission statement, Academic G overnance structure and Graduate Outcomes statement to reflect the value and place of research at Endeavour 2. Build research capacity : including establishing an Office of Research within the organisation structure; and promoting research capacity with teaching academic staff 3. Foster networks and collaborative relationships : including establish ing a practice - based research network, forming an international association of compleme ntary medicine educators, and engaging with other key associations/organisations .

Facilitate research career pro gression for Endeavour graduates : including providing joint supervision of Endeavour graduates who matriculate to a Master of Philosophy and/or Doctor of Philosophy course with ARCCIM. 5. Develop a research program : including undertaking novel and significant research projects; supporting publication and presentation of scholarly work by research and teaching academics; promoting academic attendance and participation at research conferences; developing links with rese archers and academics in external institutions and organisations. Strategy outcomes and return on investment for Endeavour Implementation of this research st rategy will be stepwise over a 3 year period. Through this research strategy, Endeavour will develo p the framework, experience and expertise, both within the organisation and through external collaborative relationships, to become an internationally -renowned CAM organisation in the field of research.

Purpose of this strategy This document outlines a strategy through which Endeavour can build upon its current strengths and develop the research infrastructure, capacity and output to support the growth and advancement of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) within health care delivery in Australia and internationally. In doing so, this strategy will also facilitate the progression of Endeavour towards becoming an Australian University of Specialisation. 3. Background 3.1. The contribution of research in fulfilling the potential o f Endeavour College of Natural Health Endeavour College of Natural Health ('Endeavour') is a dual sector learning and teaching institution that offers vocational education and training (VET) qualifications and higher education qualifications in the field o f health sciences. The current strategic plan for Endeavour includes the transition to self -accrediting university college and ultimately as an 'Australian U niversity of Specialisation '. Achieving this goal requires multi -faceted transformations within the organisation. O ne such change is the development of research within the activities of Endeavour ac ademic staff and the college overall. 3.2. The research directions for Endeavour College of Natural Health Endeavour is an institution with diverse activities a nd aspirations however these all centre on supporting and promoting exceptional health practitioners through delivering the highest standards in education and training. With this in mind , the research areas included in Endeavour's research activities needs to be equally broad and encompass clinical issues beyond treatment efficacy . Professional issues (e.g. CAM practitioner perceptions of their role as a primary care provider, the impact of legislation and policy on professional activity, interprofessional and intra -professional dynamics of CAM practitioners, and characteristics and barriers to viable and successful CAM practice ) also require close attention and will provide valuable insights into the CAM professions of which Endeavour graduates will become members. Likewise, other issues such as motivations and barriers which impact on public use of CAM , and media re presentation of CAM , are also relevant and important research questions related to the wider context a nd contemporary practice implications of CAM. Alongside these broader clinical questions, research at Endeavour must also include an examination of the most effective methods for the delivery of CAM education as well as assessing innovative CAM education a pproaches to further strengthen this important area into the future. 3.3. The place of research in contemporary health care Evidence -based medicine (EBM) is the dominant paradigm which influences the policy and practice of many health professions and has been progressively implemented in health care settings since first described by Guyatt et al1 in 1992. Whilst the principles of EBM have been criticised by representatives from varied health professional groups since this time, this has only contributed to fu rther clarification, not modification, of the guiding tenants. A core principle of EBM is that health professionals should make clinical decision based on the best 1 Guyatt, Gordon, et al. \"Evidence -based medicine.\" JAMA: the journal of the American Medical Association 268.17 (1992): 2420 -2425. Australian College of Natural Medicine Pty Ltd (ACNM) trading as Endeavour College of Natural Health, FIAFitnation, College of Natural Beauty, Wellnation Research Strategy 2014 -2016 Effective Date: 21 Mar 18 Authorised by: ACNM Pty Ltd Board and ELG Board Version: 1.0 Page 4 available evidence, in the context of individual patient preferences and clinical experience .2 The definition of 'best available evidence' has also been clearly articulated and adopted by many governing bodies including the National Health and Medical Research Council (see Appendix 2 ). One outcome of the dominance and influence of EBM is the undervaluing of health practices which are u nsupported by research evidence, particularly by policy makers.3 This is most recently seen through a review of the inclusion of CAM practices within the private health insurance rebate scheme by the Federal gove rnment. Through this review, the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Baggoley, requested submissions outlining the evidence for efficacy , safety and cost-effectiveness of CAM practices. This process highlighted the gaps in quality evidence as well as cemented the commitment from the professions under scrutiny to further develop the evidence -base for their practices. The approach of EBM has also led to criticism by advocates of traditional practices within CAM due to fears that a focus on research will undermine t he place of traditional knowledge.4 This may be best overcome by involving qualified practitioners in the planning, design, implementation and analysis of research to ensure research questions are cognisant of traditional knowledge whilst maintaining relev ance to contemporary practice.5 Unfortunately, there is a shortage of qualified complementary medicine practitioners sufficiently trained in research skills to have the confidence or competence to address these issues. Likewise, there are few educational i nstitutions which both provide training to future practitioners and engage in practice relevant research across a range of therapies. Endeavour is uniquely placed to undertake this task and in doing so to become a national and international strength in th e future development of complementary medicine practice. 4. Research activities relevant to Endeavour A cornerstone to an effective research strategy of Endeavour is the commencement of research activities within the college itself and, in line with the div erse pursuits undertaken at Endeavour, any research strategy needs to encompass a range of research areas. These include but are not limited to: Health services research Education/policy research As such, prior to defining a research strategy it is important to consider the common research designs and methods within these two broad research fields in terms of their value to Endeavour's purpose and the capacity to undertake such research. The following list, whilst extensive , is not exhaustive and there are many other research designs which are both established and emerging that may also be useful and relevant for Endeavour's goals. 2 Sackett, David L., et al. \"Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't.\" BMJ: British Medical Journal 312.7023 (199 6): 71. -natural -therapies 4 Jagtenberg, Tom, et al. \"Evidence -based medicine and naturopathy.\" Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine 12.3 (2006): 323 -328. 5 Steel, Amie, and Jon Adams. \"The interface between tradition and science: naturopaths' perspectives of modern practi ce.\" The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 17.10 (2011): 967 -972.

Health Services Research Health se rvices research (HSR) involves the critical, scientific study of health - related issues and encompasses a range of related topics including :6 Outcomes and costs of health care delivery and provision; Health and health care behaviours; Decision -making; Service delivery and accessibility; and Interprofessional an d practit ioner -patient communication and other professional issues . Due to the multi -faceted nature of HSR, various research designs may be used and would be useful in the examination of CAM. The most common of these will be discussed in line with the levels of evidence described by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) , and considered in terms of Endeavour's ability to undertake such research. 4.1.1. Level I - A systematic review of Level II studies: Description : This is the highest level of evidence within the hierarchy of evidence and involves analysis of level II studies, which in most cases refers to a randomised -controlled trial (RCT). Value : A level I analysis integrates the findings of many studies examin ing the same intervention to determine its cumulative results (e.g. effectiveness, safety etc.) in a range of settings. Capacity at Endeavour : The resources needed to undertake this level of research centre primarily on research skills of academic staff or students. Through adequate research capacity building at Endeavour this is an achievable, cost -effective and beneficial component of any research strategy. The major limitation to this research is the paucity of quality RCT research related to the researc h fields relevant to Endeavour. Requirements : A number of key resources are needed for Endeavour to undertake this research design. These are: Research academic s to oversee individual projects Research skill development for academic teaching staff Access to full -text peer-reviewed journal articles Reference management software (e.g. Endnote, Refworks etc.) 4.1.2. Level II and III -1- A randomised/pseudo -randomised controlled trial: Description : This is a complex research design which requires substantial infrastructure and resources including, but not limited to: clinical practice rooms, treatment interventions (e.g. supplements, needles etc.), and placebo treatments/interventions. Value : A level II study is well -regarded in the research community although its relevance to CAM has been questioned by CAM researchers7. The aim of a RCT is to remove any factors which may confound the outcome of clinical findings associated with the intervention. Capacity at Endeavour : A portion of the infrastructure needed to undertake RCT research is already available at Endeavour through the student clinic. However, there is additional and 6 Adams, Jon, and Amie Steel. \"Investigating complementary and alternative medicine in maternity care: The need for further public health health/health services research\".

Australian College of Natural Medicine Pty Ltd (ACNM) trading as Endeavour College of Natural Health, FIAFitnation, College of Natural Beauty, Wellnation Research Strategy 2014 -2016 Effective Date: 21 Mar 18 Authorised by: ACNM Pty Ltd Board and ELG Board Version: 1.0 Page 6 specific research skills which would be required of academic staff, clinical staff, and students to allow this research design to be effec tively implemented. There are also substantial costs associated with providing products to study participants, and there is often a need to show cause for RCT research based on results from lower levels of evidence prior to undertaking an RCT. Whilst these barriers can be overcome there is a number of changes that would need to first take place and as such undertaking RCT research is a medium term goal. Requirements: A number of key resources are needed for Endeavour to undertake this research design. Thes e are: Research academics to oversee individual projects Research skill development for academic teaching staff Human Research Ethics Committee clearance Intervention/placebo Participants (unbiased, randomised) Measurement and assessment tools (e.g. valida ted questionnaires, pathology testing, diagnostic equipment etc.) Statistical analysis software (e.g. STATA , SPSS ) Access to full text peer -reviewed journal articles 4.1.3. Level III -2 and III -3- A comparative study with or without concurrent controls: Descriptio n: This level of evidence includes a range of research designs such as cohort studies and case -control studies. Value : Whilst this research design does not allow for controlling confounders to the degree afforded by level II and III -1 research it is able to, with a large enough sample size, identify results representative of a population. Capacity at Endeavour : The most significant limitation for Endeavour is the need to develop or access a database of individuals willing to participate in cohort/case -control study research. This is an achievable venture for Endeavour given the geographic spread of the campuses nationally and the volume of throughput in the student clinic. Nonetheless, it will take time to develop an adequate sample to undertake such research, and there may be a need to access other established databases for comparative/control data. Requirement s: A number of key resources are needed for Endeavour to undertake this research design. These are: Research academics to oversee individual projects Research skill development for academic teaching staff Human Research Ethics Committee clearance Participants (representative) Control cohort database for comparative analysis Statistical analysis software (e.g. STATA , SPSS ) Access to full text peer -reviewed journal articles 4.1.4. Level IV - Case series with either post -test or pre -test/post -test outcomes Description : This study design draws on data from multiple clinical case studies which evaluate the treatment effectiveness of the same condition. Consistent evaluation tools ( e.g. diagnostic test s, patient -reported outcome surveys) and clear documentation of client case history and treatment protocols are needed for cases to be included in this research design.

Capacity at Endeavour : There is substantial capacity already within Endeavour infrastructure to undertake this research within the student clinics. There is some need to develop the skills of students and academic/clinical supervisory staff to ensure compliance with the research design limitations however can be achieved through staff training and research skills workshops. There is also the potential for historical case series analysis by accessing existing case files, however, the value in thi s may be limited by lack of consistency of case taking, evaluation of outcomes and treatment follow up. Requirements: A number of key resources are needed for Endeavour to undertake this research design. These are: Research academics to oversee individual projects Research skill development for clinical academic staff Measurement and assessment tools (e.g. validated questionnaires, pathology testing, diagnostic equipment etc.) Human Research Ethics Committee clearance (if prospective study) Statistical ana lysis software (e.g. STATA , SPSS ) Access to full text peer -reviewed journal articles 4.2. Additional health services research designs In addition to the approaches described by the NHMRC additional research designs may be useful to Endeavour due to their relevance to CAM, their ability to be implemented with cost - restrictions, or their ability to be undertaken within the research capacity at Endeavour. 4.2.1. Whole Systems Research Description: Whole systems research (WSR) is an emerging research design which provides a framework to investigate the effectiveness of whole systems of health care, such as is seen in CAM practices such as homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathy and her bal medicine.8 In this research approach it is acknowledged that the effectiveness of treatment may be the result of more than individual products or therapeutic interventions, and may extend to the underpinning philosophy through which the treatment is pr escribed. Value: The WSR framework may be applied as a variation of a classical RCT design (Level II) and allow for comparison in outcomes for those consulting with a practitioner of a specific CAM and those undertaking standard conventional care, or no c are. The WSR framework may also be applied to observational study designs (Level III -1 and III -2). Ultimately, this approach to research has substantial po tential value for the continuation of CAM practice as it focuses on the outcomes of engaging with a practitioner that follows wholistic treatment approaches embedded in the philosophy of their modality, rather than reducing effectiveness down to specific treatment interventions. Capacity at Endeavour: Whereas the current structure of the student clinic limits the ability to carry out classical RCT research, the capacity for WSR is more achievable in the short term. There is still a need for research skill development for clinical supervisors, academic 8 Verh oef, Marja J., et al. \"Complementary and alternative medicine whole systems research: beyond identification of inadequacies of the RCT.\" Complementary Therapies in Medicine 13.3 (2005): 206.

Requirements: The requirements for this research framework will depend on whether it incorporates RCT, case -control or cohort study design (see section 4.1.2 and 4.1.3) 4.2.2. Qualita tive research designs Description: Whilst the more common health research emphasises large sample sizes and statistical (quantitative) analysis of results to allow for generalisable and representative results, qualitative research values deeper examination of perceptions and experiences of study participants resulting in rich and nuanced insights which supplement the broad scale but comparatively superficial data provided by quantitative research methods. Qualitative research methods: interviews; focus groups; literature analysis; and parti cipant observation. Value: Qualitative research will allow the exploration of a range of areas which may provide a strong foundation for understanding the place and relevance of CAM in modern healthcare. This could include a range of topics such as the per ception of CAM and its value by CAM users, the role and place of CAM (and other professional issues) from the perspective of CAM practitioners, public information and media discussion of the practice of CAM; and the decision -making processes influencing pu blic use (or avoidance) of CAM. Findings from such research would not only provide valuable insights but be vital in the development of quality quantitative research projects for the future. Capacity at Endeavour: Qualitative research employs low -tech met hods that primarily rely on methodological expertise. Following the development or acquisition of qualitative research skills with in Endeavour , qualitative research projects would be able to be readily employed in the short term. Requirements: A number of key resources are needed for Endeavour to undertake this research design. These are: Research academics to oversee individual projects Research skill development for clinical academic staff Human Research Ethics Committee clearance (if prospective study) Qualitative data coding software (e.g. N -VIVO, Leximancer etc) Access to full text peer -reviewed journal articles 4.2.3. Mixed methods research designs Description : An emerging specialisation in research methodology which does not necessarily use new methods but p rovides a framework for combining previously disparate methods from quantitative and qualitative research fields. Value : As the benefits of CAM may relate to more subtle measures than is commonly used in conventional healthcare, the combined use of qualit ative and quantitative methods through mixed methods designs may be particularly useful in capturing the relevant outcomes of CAM treatments. This method can also be successfully applied to other areas of health services research to provide both depth and breadth to our understanding of the research topic. Capacity at Endeavour : The capacity for Endeavour to undertake mixed methods research will depend on the specific methods being used, however given the variety of methods available, quality and meaningful research projects employing mixed methods designs are achievable.

Educati on/Policy Research 4.3.1 Causal -Comparative research designs Description: A causal -comparative research design seeks to find relationships between different characteristics or variables after an action or event has already occurred.9 This is achieved by comparing two or more groups of individuals to determine whether the action affected the outcome. This is somewhat different to comparative research in clinical trials in that the researcher does not attempt to manipulate the variables , merely observe them. Causal -comparative research also examines the outcomes after the event has occurred, rather than prospectively following the group. Value: Causal -comparative research design would provide an excellent opportunity to examine differen t delivery methods and compare subject or course outcomes between different groups. Capacity at Endeavour: There is significant capacity to undertake this type of research at Endeavour at present. There may also be future ability to use causal -comparative research to explore any differences in specified outcomes between different colleges. Requirements: A number of key resources are needed for Endeavour to undertake this research design. These are: Research academics to oversee individual projects Researc h skill development for academic teaching staff Human Research Ethics Committee clearance Participants - cases and controls Statistical analysis software (e.g. STATA , SPSS ) Access to full text peer -reviewed journal articles 4.3.2 Qualitative research designs Description : The qualitative research design methods relevant to education/policy research are similar to the health services research methods described above. In addition to those already mentioned, there are also some specific designs which are particularly appropriate to education/policy research including: most significant change technique; ethnography; and case study.10 Value : These methods would provide an opportunity to closely examine the specific practices, experiences and/or outcomes of settings rangi ng from clinical practices to educational institutions. Capacity at Endeavour : Assuming appropriate staff skills development and/or availability, there is number of areas within the range of Endeavour activities and settings (e.g. student clinic, classroom s, organisation/administrative activities, inter -campus/intra -campus activities) which would enable the use of some of these research designs. Beyond this, external sites and activities (e.g. other educational institutions, clinical practices etc.) could also be examined in the future however this requires the development of networks and collaborative links with external groups. 9 Salkind, Niel J. Encyclopaedia of Resaerch Design, Vol 1. Thousand Oaks, Calif: Sage Publications, 2010. 10 As distinct from a case study design in clinical/health services research, a case study in qualitative research is an approac h in which a case (or m ultiple cases) are explored over time using detailed, in -depth data collection involving multiple sources of information (e.g. observations, interviews, audiovisual material and documents and reports), and reports a case description and case based themes.

Strategy Aims This strategy aims to achieve the following outcomes: Create a research positive environment with the ethos of Endeavour Build capacity within academic staff at Endeavour to more effectively engage with, and undertake, research Foster networks and collaborative relationships with national and international research groups Establish a research fund to finance research activi ty Develop a cost -effective and comprehensive research program at Endeavour which aligns with the core values and Mission of the college Facilitate career progression for Endeavour graduates who wish to undertake research 5.1 Create a research positive enviro nment An important first step in including research within the overall activities of Endeavour is to modify the underpinning mission and governance structure of the college to be support research. This can be achieved through a number of marginal yet impor tant changes. 5.1.1 Develop a joint strategic relationship between Endeavour and the Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine Ensuring the long term viability of research activities at Endeavour requires the development of a self -sustaining funding model . For the majority of research institutions this is achieved through attracting external funding grants. The most prestigious research grants are Category 1 funding opportunities and these are provided by respected organisations (e.g. Department of Health and Ageing, National Health and Medical Research Council, and Australian Research Council). However, applicants are only eligible to apply for these grants if they are affiliated with a university equivalent research institution. For t his reason, a vital foundational step in creating a research positive environment at Endeavour is to develop a joint strategic relationship with a university -based research group. The Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM) is a research centre based at the University of Technology Sydney. It has the strongest track recor d in CAM research in Australia and is an international leader in the field (see Appendix 3 for more details) . ARCCIM is the only CAM research centre in the world which is directed and driven by methodologists (e.g. epidemiologists, health sociologists, and biostatisticians) in partnership with industry and practitioners. ARCCIM is the only centre in Australia that takes a broad critical approach which incorporates a research program that aligns with Endeavour's broad research interests. Most importantly, ARCCIM has the best track record in Australia in attracting Category 1 funding for CAM research. In addition, ARCCIM's Director, Deputy Director and other CAM research experts would be able to support the Office of Research at Endeavour to develop the research capacity of academic staff in the organisation. Furthermore, any postdoctoral research fellow operating through ARCCIM but based at Endeavour wi ll be underwritten by a number of internal UTS research intensive initiatives. 5.1.2 Amend the Endeavour Mission Statement In line with the inclusion of this new avenue within Endeavour activities, the Mission Statement will need to be modified. It is important that this modification clearly reflects the Australian College of Natural Medicine Pty Ltd (ACNM) trading as Endeavour College of Natural Health, FIAFitnation, College of Natural Beauty, Wellnation Research Strategy 2014 -2016 Effective Date: 21 Mar 18 Authorised by: ACNM Pty Ltd Board and ELG Board Version: 1.0 Page 12 importance of exploration , discovery , and the seeking of new knowledge which is inherent to any organisation that values research. 5.1.3 Modify the Academic Governance Structure Research and education are inter -linked and in any quality tertiary institution these activities can inform and enhance the evolution of the other. However, it is important that each functions independent of each other within the larger academic structure. This ensures that whilst they may afford improvements to the other, one activity does not overly influence or control the other's productivity or growth. W ith this in mind, there is a need to modify the current academic structure at Endeavour to clearly a cknowledge the independence of both research and academic interests. The modification needed within the academic governance structure is outlined in Figure 2. Figure 2: Dual Sector Tertiary Governance Structure This structure will involve the dissolution of the current Research Committee and the formation of a Research Management Committee . The Terms of Reference of the Research Management Committee (RMC) will reflect the new committee purpose within the context of increased research activities at Endeavour ( see Appendix 4 ). It is expected that the committee will be responsible for allocation of research funds through determinatio n of successful applications for awards, scholarships, reimbursements, grants and all other fund allocation associated with research -specific activity within the defined budget. The RMC will also be responsible for approving any research projects proposed to occur within the college (beyond the human ethics implications), as well as endorsing the structure of the Research Methods coursework to be delivered within academic programs. The RMC will manage research programs including future postgraduate and hono urs courses. Whilst the College Council (in discussion with the Corporate Board) will define the research priorities and Australian College of Natural Medicine Pty Ltd (ACNM) trading as Endeavour College of Natural Health, FIAFitnation, College of Natural Beauty, Wellnation Research Strategy 2014 -2016 Effective Date: 21 Mar 18 Authorised by: ACNM Pty Ltd Board and ELG Board Version: 1.0 Page 13 agenda for Endeavour, the implementation of the agenda will be the responsibility of the RMC. The membership of the RMC will include: One (1) external member with extensive research experience in a tertiary education environment (Chairperson) At least one (1) other external member with extensive research experience in a tertiary education environment and some legal expertise ARCCIM -Endea vour Research Fellow /Associate Director of Research Associate Director of Clinical Services One (1) Program Leader nominated by the CEO Up to (3) Academic staff representatives appointed by the College Council under the recommendation of the Office of Research to reflect national and discipline diversity , each holding a doctoral qualification and who are research active or in clinical practice Invited external member researchers as appropriate from time to time. The terms of reference and membership of the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) will also be revised (see Appendix 5 ) but this will be the responsibility of the RMC once formed. The HREC will act as a standing committee which report s directly to the RMC. 5.1.4 Update Endeavour Graduate Outcomes A necessary change to cement the value and place of research at Endeavour is a revision of the Graduate Outcomes statement. Endeavour considers research , clinical and academic skills to be important components within the higher education coursework at the college. As such, it is vital that this is acknowledged in what Endeavour graduates are expected to portray. In particular, the role of practitioner as researcher will be integrated into the standing Graduate Outcomes whether as consumers of research in p rofessional journals and industry communications, or as practitioners engaging in research directly through their own clinic or through enrolment in a research higher degree. 5.2 Building research capacity Endeavour's staged evolution from private college to self -accrediting university has seen the academic staff develop their skills in delivery of higher education courses significantly over the last 5 years. The next stage in capacity building for these core staff members needs to involve research skills development, which can be achieved through a number of initiatives varying from staff development workshops through to the formal establishment of an organisational unit within Endeavour which is dedicated to research activiti es. 5.2.1 Establish an \"Office of Research \" An organisational unit will be established which will be responsible for the co -ordination and administration of all research activities within Endeavour.

Initially, thes e links will focus on specific areas. 5.3.1 Appoint Adjunct Professor from external research institution : inviting an eminent researcher from an established research group and with research expertise alongside a track record in CAM research to hold an Adjunct po sition with Endeavour. Within this position the researcher will provide guidance and direction to Endeavour prior to the establishment of the Office of Research and continuing on through the initial stages of developing research activity at the college. Fo llowing this, the researcher will be invited to contribute insights and recommendations based upon their own expertise and experience to fortify the research agenda and outcomes at Endeavour into the future. Following this appointment, other researchers f rom external institutions who contribute substantively to the research areas of interest to Endeavour will be invited to accept adjunct appointments at the college. The specific characteristics of each adjunct appointment will be determined b y negotiation between Endeavour and the external research academic. 5.3.2 Establish a practice -based research network (PBRN)12: create a network of established and active clinics committed to developing the research evidence for CAM. This PBRN will provide access to qualified practitioners able to engage with research in all ar eas of Endeavour research areas. 5.3.3 Establis h a summer scholarship program : invite undergraduate students to undertake a summer research scholarship. The scholarships will be competitive and will offer a unique opportunity for students to obtain experience in health -related research and provide valuable insight into the research p rocess. The scholarships will be supervised by established researchers within Endeavour and the CRI. The scholarships will run for a duration of 8 weeks between end of November until late February (exact start and end dates are negotiated between superviso r and student). Applications will be open to students currently enrolled full -time in an undergraduate higher education degree. Whilst no pre -requisites will be expected of applicants, it is anticipated that successful students have a C redit average (GPA 5 .0) or above. 5.3.4 Found the International Association of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Educators (IACAME): create links with educators from top ranking CAM institutions internationally with the view to form an association . The intended goals of such a body are further develop the highest standards in educational methods for CAM courses and outcomes for CAM graduates, and increase scholarly examination of current and novel 12 A practice -based research network is a group with at least 15 practices and/or 15 clinicians devoted principally to the primary care of patients, affiliated with each other (and often with an academic or professional organisation) in order to investigat e questions related to community based practice.

ISCMR also facilitates an annual conference on CAM research (the International Congress for Complementary Medicine Research) which is the premier int ernational forum for the dissemination of CAM research. At present, ISCMR does not offer corporate membership. Individual membership is $90USD per person. 5.3.6 Engage with Australian & New Zealand Association for Health Professional Educators (ANZAHPE): as the association which represents educators involved in the training of health professionals without focusing on any one specific discipline, engaging with this association will encourage further scholarly activity (including research) in this core area of End eavour business. This association facilitates an annual conference and offers research seeding grants of up to $5000 for projects addressing research and development in the education of health professionals. Corporate membership, which includes up to 5 nominated individuals, is $880. 5.3.7 Establish the Endeavour Research Reference Panel : in response to the new and increased research activities at Endeavour outlined in this strategy there is value in establishing a panel of experts who will, either in totality as a committee or as individuals as needed, be available to provide guidance, advice and direction to the Office of Research and Endeavour more broadly. This will be achieved th rough establishment of the Endeavour Research Reference Panel. The panel will be positioned under the College Council within the current Academic Governance Structure at Endeavour. The membership of this panel will consist of experts in research methodolog y and governance who will be invited by the College Council. The invited members may be drawn from researchers who have been appointed adjunct positions at Endeavour . The activities of the panel will comply with the existing Academic Governance Framework g uidelines. 5.4 Facilitate research career progression for Endeavour graduates In line with the joint strategic relationship with ARCCIM , and the modification to the Graduate Outcomes statement, there will be capacity for Endeavour graduates to matriculate to a Master of Philosophy and/or Doctor of Philosophy course (depending on the ir qualification and experience). In doing so, they will be able to be supervised by the ARCCIM -Endeavour Research Fellow/Associate Director of Research . Co-supervision would also be able to be provided by the Director of Research and a methodological expert from th e research group as needed. This will not only facilitate the progression of interested Endeavour graduates towards research careers, but will also ensure additional huma n resources to undertake the wide range of research projects capable of being carried out at Endeavour. Current students will also be able to develop research experience by applying for a Summer Scholarship (as outlined at section 5.2.4). This will give s tudents first -hand experience of research and encourage those interested to undertake further research projects or programs of study in the future.

The aim of ARCCIM is to provide leadership for the CAM research field whilst providing a critical evidence -base to help guide policymakers, practitioners and patients with regards to CAM use and practice. Senior researchers within ARCCIM have a long history of working as a collaborative research team and represent broad methodological expertise. They have also been working to progress CAM research for over 20 years, both individually and as a group. ARCCIM has formal links and partnerships with national and international prestigious associations including: the International Research Leadership Program, Department of Primary Health Care, University of Oxford (UK); the Network of Researchers in the Public Heal th of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NORPHCAM); the Research Council in Complementary Medicine (UK); Public Health Association of Australia; Indonesian Public Health Association; and the American Public Health Association. ARCCIM is also an Ordina ry Member (one of only a select few invited across Australia) of the SAX Institute. In addition to these important links and partnerships, ARCCIM directors and research staff are also affiliated with the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (AL SWH). A collaborative project managed through the University of Newcastle and The University of Queensland, the ALSWH began in 1996, with an initial cohort of over 40,000 women. The project is funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ag eing for the purpose of exploring \"factors that influence health among women who are broadly representative of the entire Australian population\". To achieve this, the ALSWH project evaluates a number of aspects of women's health including health behaviours and risk factors; use of health services; physical and emotional health; socio -demographic factors; and life stages and key events. The findings from the ALSWH provide the Australian government with evidence -based data to inform the development and evalu ation of practice and policy in a range of areas related to the physical and emotional health of individual women in Australia. The ALSWH is recognised internationally as a valuable project which contributes to national and international knowledge in many areas of women's health. ARCCIM researchers have been instrumental in the inclusion of CAM data within the ALSWH surveys for all 3 cohorts for the last 10 years. The commitment to the examination of CAM shown by the core team of ARCCIM researchers is evide nced by their success in attracting competitive grant funding including over $7 million of NHMRC, ARC and other funding for their research (including 2 prestigious NHMRC and ARC Fellowships) in the last 5 years. In this time, the ARCCIM group have also produced a high volume of peer -reviewed research publications (500+) and prolific authorship of international research books (11 to date) including the first international reader on Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (Adams et al, 2012). In a ddition, the works (books, book chapters and journal articles) published by the ARCCIM team not only report a breadth of research designs and methodology, but also discussion papers which illustrate and articulate a clear vision to further develop the CAM research agenda in a Australian College of Natural Medicine Pty Ltd (ACNM) trading as Endeavour College of Natural Health, FIAFitnation, College of Natural Beauty, Wellnation Research Strategy 2014 -2016 Effective Date: 21 Mar 18 Authorised by: ACNM Pty Ltd Board and ELG Board Version: 1.0 Page 29 meaningful way.
