National Cadet Corps (NCC) came into existence on 15 July 1948 under an Act of Parliament. Over the years, NCC has spread its activities and values across the length and breadth of the country; in schools and colleges in almost all the di stricts of India. It has attracted millions of young boys and girls to the very ethos espoused by its motto \"unity and discipline\" and molded them into disciplined and responsible citiz ens of the country. NCC has attained an enviable brand value for itself in the Young India's mind space. 2. National Cadet Corps (NCC) aims at character building and leadership in all walks of life and promotes the spirit of patriotism and National Integration among the youth of the country. Towards this end, it runs a multifaceted training; varied in content, style and processes with added emphasis on practical training, outdoor training and training as a community. 3. With the dawn of Third Millennia, ther e have been rapid strides in technology, information, social and economic fields bringing in a paradigm shift in learning field too; NCC being no exception. A need was felt to chan ge with times. NCC has introduced its New Training Philosophy, catering to all the new changes and developments taking place in Indian Society. It has streamlined and completely overhauled its train ing objectives, syllabus, methodology etc thus making it in sync with times. Subjects like National Integration, Personality Development and Life skills, Social Awareness etc have alsobee n given prominent thrust. 4. The new syllabus has been in force for the last five years. The feedback, suggestions and various limitations have been broug ht out by different stake holders. This new edition being the outcome of these suggestions. 5. For the ease of both Trainers and Trainees alike, a summary and a list of various types of questions concerning the unit have been added at the end of each unit. The syllabus has been revised to make it cadet friendly, co lourful with large number of photographs, charts, pictures etc and visually appealing. It is hoped that this will facilitate better assim ilation and increased interest among the cadets. 6. The book has been the outcome of sincere de votion and relentless effort of the team Officers Training Academy, Kamptee duly steered by the Commandant. Our sincere gratitude and compliments to them. Any suggestions are welcome for its improvem ent in the future editions. 7. Contents of this hard work must form the basis of Institutional Training with explicit commitment.

NCC Song . The official song of the NCC - \"Kadam Mila Ke Chal\" was adopted in 1963. However, in 1974, a change was felt to catch the imaginat ion of the youth that descr ibes the true feelings of NCC. As a result the song was replaced by \"Hum Sab Hindi Hain\" which kept on playing in RDCs till the word 'Hindi' was replaced by 'Bhartiya' in 1980. The NCC song expresses th e feelings of unity in diversity and urge everyone to march towards the single goal - all being INDIANS.

In dians learnt how to cultivate the land with the help of pick axe. Indians learnt how to grow rice, b ananas, coconuts, brinjals, lemons and cotton from them. Indians started belief in rebirth, existence of god in Stones, the origin of creation etc from this race. The interesting stories in Mahabharat and Ramayan about Vasuki, the ruler in Patal Lok, the origin of the creation from snakes and eggs, inte resting stories about Ganesh, etc have been taken from the myths of this race. Perhaps, this race t aught the Indians, how to count the dates according to moon phases and fixation of festivals. (c) Dravidian Race . They were more civilized than the people of both the races which came to India earlier. Under their influence new Gods and new methods of worship came to India. The word 'Pooja' (worship), belongs to Drav idian language. The new Gods created under the influence of Dravidians were Shiva, Uma, Kart ikeya, Hanuman etc. Under the Dravidian influence, the number of Gods increased. Go ds and Goddesses, village God, fa mily God and other Gods of Hindu religion are all the result of their influence. The importance of the sacred places of worship 47 increased. They also preached the worship of trees, like worship of tulsi, banyan, peepal, and many others. It was the Dravidians who gave I ndians the festivals of Holi and Basant. (d) Aryan Race . Aryans made the greatest contributio n towards the development ofIndian culture. It is their mother tongue which is in use today in major parts of India. Their Vedas are the main roots of Indian culture. Fixation of adjustmen t among different castes through their principle of Varna system and the spread of civilization am ong the demons and wild tribes through Tapovan system were the contribution of Aryans. (e) Muslim Race . Muslims came to India after the Aryans . The influence of Muslims on various parts of Indian life has been very great. This infl uenced the Hindu customs, too in varied fields like dress, cooking methods, marriage trad itions, festivals, fairs etc. Es tablishment and functioning of the Maratha, Rajput and Sikh courts is the contribution of this race. (f) Influence of the British . The British deeply influenced allaspects of Indian culture. The spread of English language brought hundreds of English words into the Indian languages. The influence of western culture on the prose, novel, one-act plays and poet ry etc. in Indian literature is clearly visible. Western education created a wave of reformation in the whole country. The present form of administration is the outcome of the great influence of the Britis h ideology. The present economic organization, joint stock companies, managing agencies, big factories, production through machines, railways, telegraphs, telephone, aero planes and ot her means of communication were brought to India from the west. Religions of India 10. Hinduism . Religion for the Hindus is experience or attitude of mind. It is not an idea but a power and a life convicti on. It is consciousness of ultimate reality. Man becomes aware of God thr ough experience. The source of Hindu thought is the Vedas. The Hindus believe in meditation and yoga. The goal of religious quest is earned by intellectual and moral discipline. The Hindus believe in re-birth, spirit and salvation. Perfection in life as per Hinduism is attained through knowledge of truth. The theory of Hinduism lays stress on Bhakti, Karma and Re-birth. 11. Islam . Islam means Submission to Allah (God).The Quran, the holy Book of Muslims is revealed and crea ted being the eternal word of God incarnate. All the prophets from Adam to Mohammad and the books revealed to them are regarded as religious heritage of Islam. Muslims have to bear witness to the oneness of God. Message of Quran to observe prayer five times daily with a weekly Juma prayer on Friday noon. They keep dawn to dusk fast for purity of soul in the nint h month of Ramzan of the Islamic year. Muslims, who can afford, make pilgrimage of Haj once in life time. The Islamic teaching highlights the purity of life, charity to the poor and spread of brotherhood. Islam came to India in the 7 th Century AD. 12. Christianity . Christianity was founded by Jesus Christ. It is the largest religion in the world. Christ was born in 4 BC in Judaea. He started preaching about the kingdom of God when he was thirty. His activities roused the opposition of the Jewish high prie sts who accused him of blasphemy. He was crucified on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman Governor. Christianity preaches charity, love and p eace. The message of Jesus Christ is given in the Holy Bible. Christianity is not a religion but a way of life. It guides the actions and life for mental peace and love of humanity. Christianity came to India in the 1st century AD through St. Thomas, one of the 12 disciples of Christ. 48 13. Jainism . Jainism derives its name from Jaina (the Mahavira belonged to aprincely family in Vaishali. Jainism was established at 8th century BCE. At the age of 30 Mahavira renounced the world and spent 12 years in austerity and meditation in search of truth. At the age of 47, while meditating, he received enlightenment. As per Jainism teachings, anger, pride, deception and greed must be counteracted by the ten best virtues namely forgiveness, humility, straight forwardness, contentment, trut hfulness, restraint, austerity, purity, chastity and renunciation. To destroy karma, a monk has to bear all the trouble that might cause him pains. It is pure meditation which ultimately leads to liberation. 14. Buddhism . Buddhism was founded by Gautam Buddha who was son of Indian Prince Suddhodan. Budhism originated in the 5th century BCE. The sorrow and suffering of the world tormented his heart and he abandoned his house and started his pursuit for enlightenment. Gautam found enlightenment while meditating under a Pipal tree at the age of 42. Buddha preached that emancipation from the cy cle of re-birth i.e. Nirvana can be attained by the path of self-purificati on, with doctrine of love and mercy. Buddhism is a religion of kindness, humanity and equality. It denounces all claims to superiority on grounds of birth or caste. 15. Sikhism . God the original Guru imparted his message to his disciple Nanak, who having absorbed the divine spirit became the Guru himself. The message is known as Gurmat. He who follows the teaching of Gurmat is a pure person and is known as Sikh. The same spirit was passed on to the successive Gurus and ultimately the divine spirit has been passed onto the sacred script; the Guru Granth Saheb. The teachings of Sikhism say that God is one, equality in society and leading a life of purity are important. The institution of Gurudwara and common kitchen (langar) are noble examples of equality in Sikhism. Sikhism as a religion was established in the 15th century AD. PART- II: FESTIVALS OF INDIA 16.

India has produced great leaders during freedom struggle who have shaped the destiny of the nation. These leaders have had a great impact on the peopl e of the country and ther efore immensely contribute towards nation building. India attained independence in 1947 essentially because of the charismatic leaders who spearheaded the freedom struggle. Post-independenc e the Indian leadership has ensured India to be amongst the best developing countries and is staki ng its claim to be the permanent member of United Nations. Few very important leaders, who made a tremendous impact both within the country as well as in the international arena, are discussed here, AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the import ant leaders of freedom struggle in India. Bal Gangadhar Tilak 5. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was born on 22 July 1856, in a middle class family in Ratnagiri, a small coastal to wn in southwestern Maharashtra. His father, Gangadhar Shastri, was a noted Sanskrit scholar a nd school teacher at Ratnagiri. Tilak was a brilliant student and also very good in mat hematics. Since his childhood, Tilak had an intolerant attitude towards injustice and he was truthful and straight forward in nature. After graduating from Deccan College, Pune in 1877, Tilak cleared the L.L.B. from the Elphinston College, Mumbai. Later, he helped found a school that laid emphasis on nationalism. 6. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a social reformer and freedom fighter. He was one of the prime architects of modern India and strongest advocates of Swaraj (Sel f Rule). He was universally recognized as the \"Father of Indian Movement\". Tilak was a brilliant politicia n as well as a profound scholar who believed that independence is the foremost necessity for the well- being of a nation. During 1908-1914, Bal Gangadhar Tilak spent six years rigorous imprisonment in Ma ndalay Jail, Burma. He was deported because of his alleged support to the Indian revolutionaries, who had killed some British people. Following his growing fame and popularity, the British government also tri ed to stop the publication of his newspapers. 55 7. Tilak returned to India in 1915, when the political situation was fast changing under the shadow of World War I. There was unprecedented jubilation in Indi a after Tilak was freed and back in India. After seeing such a grand welcome, Tilak decided to re-unite with his fellow nationalists and founded the All India Home Rule League in 1916 with Joseph Baptista, Annie Besant and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The league had 1400 members in April 1916, and by 1917 member ship had grown to approximately 32,000. Its goal was swaraj. Tilak went from village to village, and expl ained the aim of his league to the farmers and won their hearts. He traveled constantly in order to org anize the people. While fighting for people's cause Bal Gangadhar Tilak died on August 1, 1920. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi 8. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 02 October 1869 at Porbandar which is in the present day Gujarat. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was a De wan or Prime Minister of Porbandar. His mother, Putlibai, was a very religious lady and left a deep impression on Gandhi's mind. He was a mediocre student and was excessively shy and timid. He married at the age of thirteen to Kasturbai. Later on in his life, Gandhi denounced the cu stom of child marriage and termed it as cruel. After schooling, he joined the Samaldas College in Bhavnagar. 9. Gandhiji sailed to England on 04 September 1888. He completed his Law degree in 1891 and returned to India. Gandhiji proceed to South Africa in April 1893. It was in South Africa that G andhiji's transformation from Mohandas to Mahatma took place. During his stay in South Africa , his life underwent a change and he developed most of his political ideas. Gandhiji decided to dedicate himself completely to the service of humanity. In 1906, in the course of his struggle in South Africa, Ga ndhiji, developed the concepts of Ahimsa (non-violence) and Satyagraha (holding fast to truth or firmness in a righteous cause). His struggle bore fruit and in 1914 in an agreement between Gandhiji and South African Government, the main Indian demands were conceded. 10. Gandhiji returned to India in 1915 and settled down on the bank of river Sabarmati, on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, where he founded an ashram called Sa tyagraha Ashram. In 1921, he gave the call for Non- cooperation movement against the ills of British rule . Gandhiji's call roused the sleeping nation. Many Indians renounced their titles and honours, lawyers gave up their practice, and students left colleges and schools. Non-cooperation movement also brought women into the domain of freedom struggle for the first time. Non-cooperation movement severely jolted th e British government. But the movement ended in an anti-climax in February 1922. An outbreak of mob vi olence in Chauri Chaura so shocked and pained Gandhi that he refused to continue the ca mpaign and undertook a fast for five days to atone for a crime committed by others in a state of mob hyster ia. Gandhiji was sentenced to six years imprisonment but was rele ased in 1924, on medical grounds. 11. After the outbreak of Second World War in 1939, Ga ndhiji again became active in the political arena. British Government wanted India's help in the war and Congress in return wanted a clear-cut promise of independence from British government. On 8 August 1942, Gandhiji gave the call for Quit India Movement. Soon the British Government arrested him and other t op leaders of Congress. India attained independence in Aug 1947 but Jinnah's intransigence resulted in the partition of the country. Communal riots between Hindus and Muslims broke out in the country in the aftermath of partition. Tales of atrocities on Hindus in Pakistan provoked Hindus in India a nd they targeted Muslims. Gandhiji worked ceaselessly to promote unity between Hindus and Muslims. This angered some Hindu fundamentalists and on 30 January 1948, Gandhiji was shot dead by one such fundamentalist Nathu Ram Godse while he was going for his evening prayers. The last words on the lips of Gandhiji were Hey Ram. He pr oved himself to be a true leader of the people. Bhagat Singh 12. Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1 907 at Banga in Lyallpur district (now Pakistan). From his early childhood, Bhagat Singh was imbibed with the family's spirit of patriotism. At the time of his bi rth, his father Kishan Singh was in jail. His uncle, SardarAjit Singh, was a great freedom fighter and established the Indian Patriots' Association. 13. On 30 October 1928, an all-parties procession, led by Lala Lajpat Rai, marched towards the Lahore railway station to protes t against the arrival of the Simon Commission. Stopping 56 the procession, police made a lathi char ge at the activists. The confrontation left Lala Lajpat Rai with severe injuries and also later led to his death. As reveng e to the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, Bhagat Singh and his associates plotted the assassination of Scott, the Superintendent of Police, believed to have ordered the lathi charge. The revolutionaries, mistaki ng J.P. Saunders, an Assistant Superint endent of Police, as Scott, killed him instead. Bhagat Singh quickly left Lahore to escape his arrest. To avoid rec ognition, he shaved his beard and cut his hair, a violation of the sacred tenets of Sikhism. 14. On April 8 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw a bomb on to the corridors of the assembly and shouted 'Inquilab Zindabad!' The bomb was not meant to kill or injure anyone and therefore it was thrown away from the crowded place. Following the blasts both Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt courted arrest. The British authority, while interrogati ng them, came to know about their involvement in the murder of J. P. Saunders. Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were c harged with the murder. Bhagat Singh admitted to the murder and made statements against the British rule during the trial. Bhagat Singh along with other revolutionaries was found responsible for the A ssembly bombing and murder of Saunders. On 23 March 1931, Bhagat Singh was hanged in Lahore with his fellow comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev. Bhagat Singh was cremated at Hussainiwala near Ferozepur, on banks of Sutlej River. CONCLUSION 15. The study of the lives and biogr aphy of our national leaders is very important and inspiring for all of us because, we can learn and imbibe some of the l eadership qualities of these great leaders. Besides we must also not forget the great sacrifices they have made in getti ng us freedom from the British . 57 LESSON PLAN : NI 4 INTRODUCTION TO CONS TITUTION OF INDIA Period - Two Type - Lecture Term - I (JD / JW) Training Aids 1.

(a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Importance of National Integration - 35 Min (c) Necessity of National Integration - 35 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. National integration means a feeling of toget herness and unity among the people of a country. It also means an atmosphere in which all citizens, irrespec tive of their caste, religion and region live together peacefully. It refers to integration in all respects, social political, economic and emotional. In an integrated country people share common goals. They all work togethe r and co-operate with each other for the prosperity of the nation. 4. National integration means that though we belong to di fferent castes, religions and regions and speak different languages, India is a secular democratic country and that we are all one. This kind of integration is very important in the building of a strong and prosperous nation. A unique feature of our country is that all the major religions of the world are practiced here. There are also great varieties in costume, food habits, and social customs. Geographically our land is diverse and there are amazing differences in climate. Despite all these differences India is a single political entit y, every part of which is governed under the same Constitution. The need for national integration was nev er felt before as it is felt today. The complex atmosphere and the worsening law and order situation in the country have led to the necessity of national integration. AIM 5.

India has a rich cultural heritage characterize d by tolerance, compassion and synthesis. After independence, our country opted for secularism and equal opportunity for all, but vested interests and divisive forces under the cover of communal organisations and political parties have been encouraging fissiparous tendencies to undermine the security, unity, and integr ity of India. They exploit and spread casteism, communalism, regionalism, religious bigotry, intolerance, linguism and so on, for their narrow and immediate interests and sacrifice national interests. To fight this gr owing menace, it is the sacred duty of every Indian to work for National Integration. 11. Presently, a sense of unity in India can be seen only whenever there is an external threat to the country. At the time of Chinese and Pakistani aggressions, a wonderful se nse of unity swept over the country. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that sometimes a bogi e, correctly or incorrectly is raised of foreign aggressions by certain interested parties. But we cannot always depend upon a threat of external aggression to keep up this sense of oneness. Our unity should depen d upon the surer foundation of cultivation of positive qualities of love and devotion to the country, tran scending the differences of religions, languages and geographical loyalties. 12. National integration is therefore a basic necessity for the following reasons:- (a) Maintenance of peace and harmony: Peac e and harmony between the people of a nation can be achieved only through the feelin g of togetherness amongst the people. (b) Growth and development of the nation: National integration is a process that must be equally understood by all citizens of a nation which will su bsequently lead the nation achieve the growth and development. (c) Law and order: Provision of equal rights and opportunities can be ensured only through proper awareness of the prevailing laws. It will lead to proper maintenance of law and order situation. (d) Culture and religious development: Our constitu tion permits practice of individual religion without hurting the beliefs of others. National integr ation is essential for developing mutual respect for each other's religion. (e) Dignity and self-respect of the nation: Every ci tizen must be dealt with equal dignity. Mutual respect and dignity will develop only if we believe in it and practice it. (f) Welfare and well-being of t he people: Welfare of the masses can be achieved only through proper understanding between the people and it c an be achieved through the process of oneness. CONCLUSION 13. It is the duty of each and every citizen of our c ountry to strive to achieve unity in spite of diversity and further maintain that. We must remember that ther e should be no divisions between different parts of the country. There is only one India of which we all Indian s are inheritors. We are Indian first and Indians last. The unity in diversity of which we are proud of can only be maintained if, we have the understanding and respect for each other's religion, customs and traditions. 67 LESSON PLAN : NI-6 FACTORS AFFECTING NATIONAL INTEGRATION Period - Two Type - Lecture Term - I (JD / JW) Training Aids 1.

(a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Factors Affecting National Integration - 35 Min (c) Measures to Achieve National Integration - 35 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. India is a country with innumerable diversities; an entity composed of many communities, races classes, languages and sub cultures. In any such nati on, there are many obstacle s to the achievement of national integration. In India, various issues/ factors are obstructing the growth of national feeling, viz. casteism, communalism, linguistic fanaticism, soci al disparity, economic inequalities and immorality, regionalism etc. In spite of all these limitations. India has developed into one nation by the influence of common territory, common history and common fight for freedom against the foreign rule. 4. When India came under the British, they fo llowed the policy of 'Divide and Rule' in order to perpetuate their authority over India. Consequently, the racial, the religious and the linguistic groups in India first began to disintegrate emotionally and psychologica lly and then, desired to separate territorially. This resulted in the creation of India and Pakistan and late r on Bangladesh. The integrity of the Indian nation has been facing increased threat day by day. There is dire necessity to improve National Integration so as to achieve territorial integrity, all round development and peace within the country. AIM 5. To acquaint the cadets about the factor s affecting National Integration in India. PREVIEW 6. The lecture will be conducted in following parts:- (a) Part I - Factors Affecting National Integration . (b) Part II - Measures to Achieve National Integration. PART-I : FACTORS AFFECTING NATIONAL INTEGRATION 7. The People of India are at cross roads today. A number of divisive forces are working overtime to put us asunder. The overzealous religious, linguistic and regional groups have by and large, adopted myopic 68 policies. For their immediate gains, they sacrifice country 's long term interests. There are several forces of disintegration in the country which are jeopardising the Na tional Unity. Some of the factors chiefly responsible for weakening the National Integration have been discussed in the succeeding paragraphs. 8. Cultural Aspects . The Indian society is multi-racial and multi- religious with a diverse culture. Indi an culture has given rise to various complications in the society. The mixed culture of today and the rich cultural heritage can prove to be the most effective tool for achieving National Integration. Unfortunatel y, the people are not being correctly taught and guided on these cultural aspects. It is often forgotten that we all belong to the same culture, whatever be its beginning. 9. Political Motives . For the sake of maintaining their status, po litical parties indulge in exploitation of the people in one form or the other. Such misguided peopl e tend to move away from the national mainstream, paving the way for insurgency and resurgence of religious fanaticism and fervour. 10. Lack of Education . Inspite of the political independence of the country in 1947, the people at large are yet to be liberated. Illiteracy is still rampant though being overcome slowly and gradually. Illiterates and unemployed are more easily misguided by the people with vested interests, due to their ignorance and lack of proper perspective. 11. Communalism . Religious antagonism has posed a serious challenge to national integration in India. Political manipulation has projected one religion against the other which resulted in communal riots, bloodbath, mutual distrust and disunity in the country. Large scale illiteracy and superstitions are responsible along with other causes for rise of communalism in the country. It is very difficult to promote national integration under these situations. 12. Casteism . Caste is an imported part of our social fabric. This was developed in the past on the basis of division of labour in the society. But now castei sm has segregated the society. Unity and integrity has become a challenging dream in a caste ridden societ y. The socially neglected and scheduled castes under the suppression of upper castes have less sense of feeling of unity. It becomes a problem for national integration. 13. Regionalism . There are several regions in India having their unique traditions, food habits, dress and languages. Each region differs from the other in one or other ways which leads to divisive tendencies within the country. People of one region compete with t he persons of other regions leading to conflicts and retards progress. Land disputes, language problem etc are some of the reasons which pose hurdle on the way of national integration. 14. Linguistic Fanaticism . Multi-linguism is one of the important ch aracters of India. India has fifteen officially recognized languages. There are about 1652 dialects which are spoken in India which shows its diversity. People of one language try to establish supr emacy of their language over others. When Hindi was declared as the national language, people of South Indi a resented against this decision. Language issue has become a barrier on the way of national integration. 15. Social Disparity . Social disparity among the people of different communities, castes and sometime within the community and caste, causes tension a nd imbalance among the people. Social disparity poses great challenge to national integration. 16. Economic Inequalities . Economic standard of people in a state depends on the fertility of land, resources available and manpower management. All the states are not equal in the above matter which leads to uneven economic progress of the people. Even in a state distribution of wealth is not pr operly done. Day by day poor are becoming poorer and rich becoming ri cher causing tension and conflicts. It is a problem for national integration. 17. Ethnic Conflicts . Ethnic conflict has hindered national integration. Whereas the modern concept of nationalism is closely linked with the conc ept of nation-state, schola rs have described another 69 prevailing notion of nationalism such as religious nationalism, ethnonationalism etc. Although political nationhood is denied to the Nagas, the Nagas unders tand themselves as nation in the sense of ethnonationality. The concept of \"ethnonationalism\" bes t defines the self-understanding of the ethnic groups in Northeast India in the various fo rms of their struggle for identity. 18. Tribal Identity . To a member of the Indian national mainstream, a Khasi, a Naga or a Mizo are tribals. The pejorative term \"tribal\" carries a denotation of primitivity and inferiority of the people for whom the name is applied. The attitude of the national mainstream that looks down upon the tribals is in serious conflict with the proud self-understanding of the tribals in the northeast. Such a pride is exhibited in their ethno national feeling. 19. Corruption and Lack of Character . Corruption in the country is on a scale that can belinked to the ants eating away the roots of the foundat ions. The lack of moral character and ethical values deprive us of the strength to overcome our own weaknesses. Comb ined together, corruption and lack of character have caused immense damage to the nati on, whereby people at lar ge have literally sold their souls (and the nation) for short-term personal and political gains. PART-II : MEASURES TO AC HIEVE NATIONAL INTEGRATION 20. Philosophy of Integration . Integration requires commitment in theory and practice, to work in a cooperative manner. It needs to be un equivocally understood that National Integration is a process, a growth anda development, in which every citizen has a common stake and has to equally strive for achieving it, continuously and vigorously. A sense of patriotism and nationalism alone is not sufficient for maintaining this high ideal; rather we have to keep working at it in a systematic manner all the time, always keeping in view the Nation before self. 21. Culture as a Unifying Factor . The process for evolution of Indian composite culture of today needs to be understood by one and all through its systematic education at all levels. Oneness of the country since time immemorial has never been in doubt. The messages of unity by Indian Saints and Sufis need to reach the common people of the country. The rich cultural heritage of India, in terms of the variety of languages, dialects, literature, arts, architecture, secular thoughts, customs and tradition s, food and eating habits, music, da nces, ethics and spiritual/moral values and so on, developed by all for understanding as to what India is. The existing sub-cultures of any part of the country simply form a part of the Indian culture. A portion can never be bigger than the whole. As such, the national perspective can then be understood and t he diverse Indian culture can contribute towards National Unity and Integrity. Some lesser known exampl es of prominent Indians perpetuating unity of the country are: - (a) Adi Shankaracharya established four MATH, one each at Shrungeri, Dwarka, Badrinath and Jagan Nath Puri, after travelling through the length and breadth of the country to perpetuate oneness among people. (b) Subramaniya Bharati, a poet, writer, thinke r, philosopher, comparable to any contemporary personality has written the following books, amongst many others: (i) Yesu Prabhu. (ii) Allah Mahan. (iii) Mera Guru - Guru Gobind Singh. 22. Promotion of Secularism . The spirit of secularism is highly ne cessary in our multi-religious society. Any sorts of activities creating communal reactions in the public mind should be prohibited. No discrimination among the people on the grounds of religion should be made. 23. Role of Politics . Politics needs to be separated from religion and strict laws enacted and enforced against exploitation of the common m an by the politicians and vested interests. 70 24. Ethnic Heterogeneity . It needs to be understood by all that ethnic homogeneity does not necessarily bring about unity, integrit y and prosperity. Unity is not uniformit y, in spite of our diverse ethnic groups, integration of the country is possible. 25. Dignity of Individuals . Every citizen must be dealt with equal dignity, irrespective of religion, region, language, caste, creed and socio-economic status. Mutual respect will develop only if we believe in it and practise it, rather than paying only lip service to it. 26. Socio-Economic Reforms . Provision of equal rights and opportunities has been guaranteed through our Constitution. However, its practice leaves much to be desired. The justice needs to be meted out equally and swiftly to ensure against frustrations and the fo rces of disintegration in the society. Eradication of the social injustices and the evils will automatically take care of the economic backwardness of the downtrodden and provide succour to all, particularly the backward classes. 27. Education. Adequate and proper education will cause mass awakening and provide equal opportunities to all. It will lead to improvement in understa nding others and reduce exploitation in the society. The curriculum needs to be evolved systematically, so that a well rounded personality of the individual emerges. Such education needs to be broad based through the following tiers:- (a) Family upbringing - SANSKARS. (b) Schools and Colleges - Social &Professional Education. (c) Society (i) Religious Bodies Socio - Religious cultural, ethics, morals and code ofconduct. (ii) State &Public Media Channelising of socio-religious- cultural thought process. (iii) Interaction with other Developing mutual respect, members of the Society. harmony & tolerance. 28. Indian History. It has always been the prerogative of the victors to write the History. However, it is up to the rulers of today (Indian Government) to include w hat it wishes to in the cu rriculum of the educational institutes. It is a known fact that Indian History has been badly distorted through the centuries. It needs to be rewritten and a correct perspective given to it, so as to highlight the phases during which we have progressed and prospered due to internal stability - Unity and Integr ity. The lives of certain saints, harmony and tolerance levels need to be studied in detail to understand the subj ect in its entirety. The lessons of history, which caused damage to the national cause, need to be underst ood to guard against their repetition, and others highlighted. 29. National Language. It needs to be ensured that the language should not become a barrier instead of a medium. The people should not be depr ived of equal opportunity, because of any language or the lack of it, particularly in securing Central Govern ment jobs. The tri-lingual formula of National, State and Link language is quite adequate for the time being. It is important that no language be enforced on any particular region, rather people be encouraged to learn additional languages as a matter of habit for better understanding of the literature and culture of other regions. 30. Nationalism and Patriotism. We have had a glorious past, but regrettably our \"today\" is rather hollow. We have a rich cultural heritage, but we hav e to keep building it up through dedication and hardwork. There is a definite need to inculcate the spirit of national ism. The ethical, moral and spiritual values need to be built up to act as deterrence against the fissiparous t endencies in the society. \"Society and Country before Self\" has to be the common motto for all to be followed in letter and spir it and it is in this regard that the National and State Leadership at all levels has to set personal example. 71 31. Proper Use of Media. The services of the Radio and TV mu st be intelligently used. People of different states must be introduced to each other's cultures and ways of life and common elements should be stressed upon. These will create an atmosphere of good will and mutual understanding. Media cut through all language barriers and reach the masses in no time whose potential is tremendous. 32. Political and Administrative Measures . Since India is a federal-democ ratic country, its integration in all respects should also be done in a democratic manne r. Each ethnic, caste, tribal, religious and linguistic group should have freedom for protec ting and promoting their own cultures and traditions. Analyzing the process of national integration in India, Prof. Rashe eduddin Khan has observed that it means cohesion not fusion, unity but not uniformity, reconciliation but not me rger, agglomeration but not assimilation, solidarity but not regimentation of the people constituting our polit ical community. Emotional integration with the development of a strong brot herhood among the people discourages the growth of separatism, regionalism or secessionism. CONCLUSION 33. We need national integration on permanent foot ing and this can be achieved by enlightening our children. All the children, during their formative years, must be taught that we all are Indians belonging to the one Motherland. We must not give too much importance to separate identities. Achieving national integration is a slow moving, continuous and long term work in progress which needs to be understood encouraged and practiced by every citizen of t he country especially the youth. 72 LESSON PLAN: NI-7 UNITY IN DIVERSITY Period - Two Type - Lecture Term - II (JD / JW) Training Aids 1.

India is probably the only country in the world where people belonging to different religions, castes and creeds, speaking different languages, having different cultures, different modes of living, different clothing, different feeding habits, worshiping different gods and deity live together in harmony and believe to be the children of one mother-Mother India. They ar e one nation at large. They are governed by one central authority, have one Prime Minister, one President, one Supreme Court and one Army Chief. This is why we say we have unity in diversity. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about t he concept of Unity in Diversity. PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conducted in following parts:- (a) Part I - India : A Land of Diversities (b) Part II - Fundamentals of Unity in Diversity (c) Part III - Releva nce of NCC in National Integration PART - I: INDIA - A LAND OF DIVERSITIES 6. The tremendous variety of land and people in the Sub-Continent is striking. It has every type of climate from the blazing heat of the plains to the be low freezing point cold of the Himalayas. The annual rainfall also varies from about 8 cms in Rajasthan to 1225 cms in Cherapunji (Assam Hills). There are also 73 great differences in soil, from the fert ile Indo-Gangetic plains to the vast ar id tracts of the Rajasthan deserts. Indian climate offers all varieties; namely, winter, su mmer, monsoon, autumn, spring - a clear manifestation of nature's different forms of joy. With its wide range of climatic conditions, the country has rich and varied vegetation, flora and fauna which fe w other countries of comparable size possess. India is an undisputed geographical unit, clearly separated from the rest of As ia by formidable natural barriers and boundaries, thus clearly defining it and giving it a natural identity and entity. 7. Geographical Diversities . Geographically India is a vast country so much so that even one of its states is bigger than many countries of Europe. But t he whole country is well bounded by nature. In the north is the Himalayan Range, the highest mountain range in the world. The Indo - Gangetic plains lay next to Himalayas; fertile and prosperous, feeding bulk of the pop ulation. The Eastern and No rth Eastern part of India has hills with thick tropical forests, generally inhabited by people of Mongol origin divided into various tribes. The Western Desert provide a natural barrier for the free movement. The lack of rains in this region prohibits prosperity. Southern India is peninsular, jutting into t he Indian Ocean and separates the Bay of Bengal in the East from the Arabian Sea in the West. On the periphery are the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. Thus it provides a natural geographical unity to India. Map showing Geographical Diversity The Western Desert Nothern Himalayan Region 74 8. History and Politics . Vindhaychal and Satpura ranges in the Central India are a natural barrier between North and South India. Cons equently, while North India took the brunt of invasions, South India generally remained insulated and independent from the rule of the invaders and settlers, including the sultans and mughals. Ironically, it was South India which paved the way for the European invaders who came in the grab of traders and decided to settle down and later rule this country, perhaps the only time when India as a whole was ruled by the invaders and settlers. 9. Culture and Religion . Today's Indian culture can be called a composite culture, which though predominantly a Hindu culture, comprise s of myriad streams of ot her cultures that have, over a period of time, come and mingled into it and having enriched it, became a part of it, India has about 15 officially recognised languages and about 1652 dialects s poken by its vast populace. India has a dozen ethnic groups, seven major religious communities fragmented further into m any sects, castes and sub-ca stes all living in its 88 socio-cultural regions. It depicts a varied life of people speaking different languages, having different belief, social values, in fact; a society comprising of many differ ent societies, it is the world's oldest and largest plural society, the like of which human history has seldom k nown. The size and richness of the land has permitted all of them to live and flourish together. 10. Through the centuries, people from different part s of the world came and settled in it; some to establish trades, others to conquer and plunder, and still others to carve out empires and beco me permanent residents of the country. All these people who came were of different ethnic groups and brought in the distinct stamp of their own civilization and culture. Some of these people were Aryans, Mongols, Sakas, Kushans, Scythians and the Huns. Arabs, Afghans and Mughals ca me as invaders but became settlers and made India their homeland. The Europeans, predominantly Britisher s, came as traders but became rulers. Different civilizations and cultures continuo usly inter-acted with each other and have given rise to the composite culture of today. 11. It has been most appropriately summarized in t he work of the most famous Indian poet, philosopher and a thinker of recent times. \"The Aryan, the Non-Aryan, the Dravadian. The Huns, the Pathans and the Moghuls. They all have merged here into one body. Today the West has opened its doors. And from thence come gifts. Giving and taking, All will be welcome on the shores of Bharat, Where men of all races have come together\". (Tagore: Bharat Tirtha) 12. India has all the major religions of the world, principal among them being Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and a large number of other faiths and sects. At least four of these major religions were born in India. The co-existen ce of all these religions have been a special feature of Indian culture and religious activity. In India, the inner voice of the seers played an important role in shaping the destiny of land than the iron rod of the rulers. There are innumerable instances where rulers have, after winning major battles left everything in search of Trut h. Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavira, Ashoka, the Great and Bhatrihari, all important rulers who left their kingdoms in search of inner light for mankind and for seeking salvation. Similarly, seventeen hundred years before the arrival of Clive on the soil of India in 1751 A.D, a number of people believe that Christ visited India (or sp ent his childhood) during his early life. Whatever be it may, the underlying fact remains that a number of religi ons, though radically different in their ways have co- existed in this country sinc e their very advent itself. PART - II: FUNDAMENTALS OF UNITY IN DIVERSITY 13. India is a nation having great diversities. The people who inhabit this nation belong to different races, communities and castes. They reside in different geogr aphical regions and speak different languages. They believe in and practice different religions and have vari ed life styles. But with certain shared fundamentals for national unity, the people of India can develop the feel ing of oneness in spite of all these diversities. 14. Spirit of Religious Unity . Apart from Hinduism we have the followers of Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity and Parsees. But Hindus fo rm the greater majority. There are, no doubt, different 75 factions, sections and sub-sections but basically all Hi ndus believe in the theory of Dharma and Karma. The theory of rebirth, purification of soul, salvation, heaven and hell holds good for each and every one. We celebrate the festivals like Holi, Di wali, Christmas, Id, Buddha Jayanti, M ahavir Jayanti etc unitedly. This provides unity in diversity. 15. Indian Philosophy . Indian philosophy was developed on Indian soil and not borrowed from anywhere. This has blended the various cultures together. There are diffe rences in overall conception of Gods and modes of worship. These ch anges have been gradual due to interaction of different groups. But the ultimate aim of achieving salvation and the fear of hell keeps them all bound together. 16. Ethnic Coexistance . A very important characteristic of Indian society is the coexistence of different ethnic groups. These groups formulated inter-g roup behavior. Hence there is no mutual interference as also no merging of their identity.There might be so me drawback in our constitution such as separate provision for different castes; particularly the ba ckward and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes but industrialization policy and agrarian reforms have gener ated a new inclusive cultur e. Members of different castes and communities and followers of different relig ions have come together in farms, factories and educational institutions. As a result different cult ures have been blended together thereby bringing unity among them. 17. Cultural Unity . We have a cultural unity in India in as mu ch as our philosophy of life; our customs, creeds and traditions are more or less, the same. The inst itution of marriage, the very foundation of a society, exists all over the country and most of the rituals and sanskars are similar everywhere. 18. Emotional Unity . Emotional unity plays its own part. The name of Bharat Mata brings us closer and closer together. In spite of different languages and di alects, sanskrit, the language of Vedas, brings us all together because sanskrit is the mother of all la nguages. The outstanding features of Indian culture responsible for bringing unity in diversity may be summarized as follows: (a) We Indians lay emphasis on spirituality, not on material wealth. (b) Religion has the most important place in India. We believe in Karma and Sanskar. Performance of duty is our religion. (c) Religious tolerance is the unique feature of relig ions in India. Hence there is less difficulty in coexistence of followers of different religions. (d) Hinduism which is practiced by majority of the population has the capacity to absorb all good cultures. It has either absorbed the immigrant cultures or has largely influenced them. (e) We have a very broad outlook. We preach and follow religion and spiritualism without ignoring married life and worldly things. (f) We firmly believe in freedom of though t and freedom of expression because such freedom enriches the culture which then becomes dynamic. PART - III: RELEVANCE OF N CC IN NATIONAL INTEGRATION 19. NCC creates awareness amongst the youth about the diverse heri tage of our country and fosters national integration. NCC cadets gain experience to li ve together and work in harmony with cadets of other states whom they have not known before. It helps in strengthening the unity as under:- (a) Ethics and Social Values . These are very important values in day-to-day activities on the ground and are the essentials of personality. NCC helps to cultivat e these values through which the spirit of unity and value of personal sacrif ice are ignited in the minds of cadets. (b) Cultural and Traditional Values . NCC organises various camps and group activities where ample opportunity is given to the cadets to closely watch the cultural and tr aditional shows of other regions. It provides the cadets wi th an opportunity to apprecia te each other's uniqueness and cultivate friendship. 76 (c) Discipline and Patriotism . A cadet is trained to give selfless service to society and be available anytime for national cause. NCC can be described as the disciplined, trained and motivated young force available for national se rvice. NCC provides assistance in various places as well as future leadership and participation in all walks of life. CONCLUSION 20. It is the duty of each and every citizen of our countr y to strive for total unity despite of diversities in culture, language and religion. We must remember that there should be no divisions between any religion or community. We must be really proud of the various geographical and other diversities existing in the country. It is the duty of every individual to strive and work in their own respective capa city to respect and promote the diversity of the nation. There is only one India of wh ich, we all Indians are inher itors. We are therefore - Indian first and Indians last. 77 LESSON PLAN : NI 8 SLOGANS AND IMAGES OF NATIONAL INTEGRATION Period - One Type - Lecture Term - I / II (JD / JW) Training Aids 1.

(a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Slogans of National Integration - 15 Min (c) Images of National Integration - 15 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. National slogans or images are intrinsic to the Indian identity and heritage. Indians across the world are proud of thier national symbols. They infuse a s ense of pride and patriotism in every Indian's heart. A nation is a community which considers itself one. It is held together by many ties like territory, language, culture, economic inter dependence etc. Thus a nation is a large group of people, sharing the same culture, language or history and inhabiting a particular state or area. National slogans cr eate major impact in the minds of adolescent children. It is one of the most effective methods of conveying a social message. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the National Integration through various images and slogans. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Slogans of National Integration (b) Part II - Images of National Integration PART -I: SLOGANS OF NATIONAL INTEGRATION 6. A slogan is a form of verbal logo. A slogan sums up what one stands for, one's specialty, the benefit, and one's commitment. It is especially useful to re inforce one's identity. A slogan can prove to be more powerful than a logo. People can remember and recite the slogan while they are unlikely to doodle the logo. For more than 100 years, countries have used slogans in their freedom struggles or revolutions. Many countries have used catchy phrases to tell the wo rld what makes their country unique or different. 7. Slogan is a memorable motto or phrase used in a political, commercial, religious or any other context as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose. They usually leave an ever lasting impact on their directed 78 audience. There were many famous Indian slogans, which have major contribution to India's independence and also during the is one of the most influential leaders of his time. He is popularly known as Netaji. This wa s the first commemorative postmark of our independent country, now used as a slogan and salutation almost everywhere in India . Vande Mataram - Bankim Anandmath by, Bankim Chandra written in 1882 in Bengali and Sanskrit. Being praise to the motherland, it has played a vital role in our freedom movement. Jai Jawan Jai Kisaan - Lal Bahadur Shastri 10. This is a slogan that awakens t he inner-most sentiments of patriotism in the hearts of Indians even in today. Acknowledging the efforts of our soldiers and farmers, this slogan gave a new dimension to the post independent progress of the country. Inquilab Zindabad - Bhagat Singh 11. This slogan awakened the feeling of patriotism in the youth of India during those days. The urge to lay their lives for their motherland and to free her from the clutches of British, this slogan had a rema rkable contribution in the fight for freedom. Swaraj Mera Janamsiddh Adhikar Hai, Aur Main Ise Le Ke Rahunga - Bal Gangadhar Tilak 12. A popular slogan adopted by BalGangadharTilak was coined by Kaka Baptista in our fight for independence. Not only did this slogan motivate people to fight for their rights, but also provoked the love for country in the hearts of thousands of people. \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Me Hai\" -Ramprasad Bismil 13. A patriotic poem by Bismil Azimabadi, later used as a slogan by Ramprasad Bismil in the freedom struggle challenged the authority of British rulers. Enlightening the need of the hour, th is slogan urged people to fight for what was right. 79 PART - II: IMAGES OF NATIONAL INTEGRATION 14. Some of the important images related to National Integration are as under:- CONCLUSION 15. Images, posters and slogans have a lasting impr ession on the minds of people. Hence it is an important tool for promoting National Integration. The NCC Logo is in itself an ex cellent example of national integration and is true to its image. 80 LESSON PLAN : NI - 9 ROLE OF NCC IN NATION BUILDING Period - One Type - Lecture Term - I (JD /JW) Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Projector, Char ts, Pointer, Black Board & Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Contribution of Youth in Nation Building - 35 Min (c) Role of NCC in Nation Building - 35 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Nation state is considered as a group of peopl e living in certain territory under one government. Nation building refers to all the efforts of the country and its people to stay united so t hat it can stay politically stable and peaceful which is essent ial for country's development. One of the major aims of NCC is to contribute towards nation building. NC C cadets being young and the future of the nation, have a special role and responsibility towards this sacred mission. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the role of National Cadet Corps in Nation Building. General 5. The youth of the nation are the backbone and the mo st powerful force within the nation. They are the hope of the future and can change the destiny of a count ry. History shows that the countries subjected to alien rule have without exception so ught the help of youth in times of crisis. The youth have also been instrumental in the change of gove rnments, whenever need for such a change was felt. They have always been in the forefront in the building of political, social and economic orders of society. Today's generation faces greater challenges in nation building due to the fo rce and pressure of internal politics and external conflicts. 6. NCC is the largest youth organisation in the wo rld. The National Cadet Corps (NCC) holds a golden key for all-round growth and transformation of our yout h. What began in the year 1917, as the University Corps, after many changes and overhauls through the years, has come to be known as the National Cadet Corps since November 1948. From a modest beginning, the NCC has blossomed into a truly All India Corps, covering almost all the districts in our country, including the Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep groups of islands. 81 Contribution of Youth in Nation Building 7. The vision of our country lie s in the hands of our youth. They are filled with tremendous energy and high ambitions. It will be a great wastage of human resources if the youth are not given an opportunity to exercise their talen t. Youth is that spark which needs no ignition. The spirit of patrioti sm ignited by youth of our nation keeps the country together. It has the power to defeat all separatist attempts by dishonest elements. (a) Political Measures . Today's youth can contribute i mmensely to the politics of the country. If a nation does not rejuvenate its politic al leadership profile it would become old in thought and slow in action. The youth are the future le aders of a nation. The opportunity provided at educational level to contribute towards politics should be encour aged. The youth should learn and clean meaningful politics. Then only the politics will be able to achieve greater national goals. (b) Security . The nation today faces severe securi ty concerns, both externally and internally. This problem can be solved only throug h proper channelizing of youth power into the national main stream. The youth are the pulse and strength of the nation and their energy and their balanced approach can help in bringing stability to the nation and help in thwarting selfish designs of the enemy. The thoughts and actions of youth have the power to enhance internal and external security of the country. (c) Social and Cultural . The youth have a special responsibility and should actively participate in the development plans of the nat ion. Youth should be acquainted with the major problems being faced by the country. They shou ld study the basic problem of health, AIDS, environment, nutrition, lack of education, economic backwardness, ignorance and dowry-deaths. Our society is experiencing a constant change and faces the conflicting ideologies of the past vis-\u00e0-vis the West. Our past with a shadow of casteism, superst ition and religious overture needs a balanced approach and the youth can play a very important role in educating the general public about the misnomers relating to superstition. They can encourage and ensure lateral, vertical and diagonal inter-mingling of people to mesh them into true citi zens of India. They can establish good rapport with the people so as to involve them in ac tive participation in social work which will help to make society a better place to live in. Also, the I ndian society with a large percentage of youth in its population must be made aware of the various soci al and cultural developments happening in the country. Every kind of social change or social unrest is consequently giving rise to various complexities in the society. While searching the history it is clear that youth can only bring the positive changes required for any society. Cadet's Role 8. The NCC has been instrumental in imparting quality training to millions of boys and girls and developing the personality of our yout h, many of whom have marched ahead in life and excelled in their chosen fields thereby, contributing immensely towards nation building and national integrity. Imbibed with the spirit of patriotism and selfless se rvice, NCC cadets have been contributing towards strengthening forces of national unity, equality and secularism This is an ever ongoing process and the organization remains committed to strive for its very best in this noble en deavour. Every NCC Cadet as an individual can contribute substantially in the process of nation building by adopting the following measures: - (a) Contributing to Adult Education . The cadets are trained on various subjects of national importance. This exposure helps the nation to have a trained pool of resources in imparting adult education in a country where illiteracy is widespread. (b) Social Service Activities . One of the major roles of NCC is to provide social service towards the citizens of the country. NCC has adopted community development activities .One of the major aims of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) is to provide some effective social service towards the citize ns of the country. NCC has adopted 82 community development activities with the aim of including amongst cadets selfless service toward the society, importance of self hel p, need to protect the environment and to assist weaker sections of the society towards their upliftment. This is done through various programs aimed at helping out society. The activities of the NCC to wards social service may include: (i) Tree plantation drives to ensure climatic balance. (ii) Blood donation camps aimed at collectin g blood to help out those in urgent need. (iii) Campaigning against the Dowry in the form of different Rallies. (iv) Pledge against Anti Female Infanticide. (v) Anti Leprosy Drive to educate people a bout the disease and also giving information about cure. (vi) AIDS Awareness Rally to spread information about this disease and also giving information about some prevention tips. (vii) Visits to Old Age Homes and spending some quality time there with senior citizens. (vii) Disaster Management & Relief at the time of war and epidemics (c) Promoting the National language . As per the directive principles of Indian constitution Hindi as a national language must be promoted throughout the country without affecting other languages.

Enhan cing Life Skills enables us to adapt to situations and people and helps us to lead a healthy and positive life. 10. The class will now be introduced to definition by WHO as \"Life Skills are abilities for adopting positive behavior that enable individuals to deal effe ctively with the demands and challenges of everyday life\". 11. There are ten core Life skills which help in enhancing the personality of an individual. They are as follows:- (a) Self Awareness . Recognition of self, our character, strengths and weaknesses, desires, likes and dislikes, and skills. Being aware of the good points about oneself helps young people build a sense of self-esteem and self-confidence. Be ing aware of their weaknesses will make young people willing to learn more. This also helps them utilize the opportunities available to them in relation to their abilities. Self-awareness is necess ary for developing a positive attitude towards life. (b) Empathy . Is the ability to be sensitive to another per son`s situation, to understand his/her concerns, worries, fears and needs and how they f eel. Empathy works wonders when we apply it to our relationships - with our loved ones, classmates, parents, friends, cousins and colleagues. It helps us move closer to solutions, to reso lve conflicts, and enhance our quality of life. (c) Critical Thinking . Is the ability to analyse information and experience in an objective manner. It can help us recognize and assess the fa ctors that influence our attitude and behavior, such as media and peer pressure influences. (d) Creative Thinking . Creativity is the ability to generate new ideas by combining, changing, or reapplying existing ideas. It helps us to lo ok beyond our direct experience, and to respond adaptively and with flexibility to situations in our daily lives. (e) Problem Solving Skills . Enable us to deal with problems in our lives in a constructive manner. The process of problem solving involves various steps. They are identifying the problem, exploring the available alternative and deciding on the best possible solution. 144 (f) Decision Making . Decision making is to choose from the varied options based on the existing knowledge of the topic under consider ation keeping in mind the positive or negative consequences of each of the option. (g) Interpersonal Relationship . Ability to establish positive rela tionships helps us to relate in positive ways with the people we interact with. This means being able to make and maintain friendly relationships, which can be of great importance to our mental and social well being. It may also mean being able to end relationships constructively. Positive relationships help in the growth of the individuals involved. (h) Effective Communication . Is the ability to express, ve rbally through spoken or written language and non-verbally through gestures and body movements, in ways that are culturally acceptable. (j) Coping with Emotions . Being aware of the predominant emotion that preoccupies the mind at any point of time, knowing how emotions influence behavior, and being able to respond to emotions appropriately. (k) Coping with Stress . Means recognizing the source of stress in our lives, recognizing how this affects us physically and emotionally, and acting in ways that help us control our levels of stress, by changing our environment or life style and learning how to relax. PART III : USE OF CORE SKILLS IN DAILY LIFE 12. Now the class will be in troduced to the practical use of core life skills through a daily life activity. (a) Activity - Life Skills In Daily Life . (i) Step 1 - Game Kho-Kho . Inform the participants that it is time For Kho-Kho a popular game in rural and urban areas. Both teams of boys and girls can play this game. Randomly divide the participants into two teams and ask them to organize the game and play. Observe the process adopted by the gr oups (who takes the leadership, how they organize themselves, now they interact with each other, whether they function as a team, what decisions are being made, body language used and how they carry on the game etc.). (ii) Step 2- Analysis of the Game for Understanding Life Skills . On completion of the game, initiate an interactive discussion to understand their experience in the whole process and their feelings while playing the game. The following questions may be asked:- (aa) Who took the lead? (ab) Who gave instructions? (ac) Was there team work? (ad) Was there any pressure on the team to perform? How did the team cope up with that? (ae) Was there a chance for the team to perform better than what they did? If yes, why? (af) How was the communication between the opponents? (Body language, sign language, shouting etc). (ag) Was there any new technique used in the game? (ah) If someone got hurt, how did the others feel about it? (aj) Who resolved problems in the team? (A player not moving fast enough or not actively participating). (ak) Who cheered the team? (al) Who pointed out the shortcoming of the game? 145 (iii) Step 3 .

The following story of \"Hunter and Pigeons\" will be narrated to the clas s and Life skills therein will be internalized through Brain Storming Session 14. Story of Hunter and Pigeons . (a) A group of pigeons enjoyed the fresh grains in a field every day. One day a hunter spotted them and decided to catch them. He spread a net in the field and waited for them to come. The pigeons were caught in the net. They realized that the hunter will take them away soon. The leader pigeon said, we have to get out. There must be a way out. Let us think. But they could not find a way out. The net was strong. Each pigeon tried to escape by pulling the net indifferent directions. But it increased the fear and confusion among them more than helping them. (b) A young pigeon said, Why don`t we all try and fly together instead of trying to escape individually? When we pull individually, we wa ste our energy. The leader pigeon was not in agreement. He said, \"No it may be difficult\". But t he young pigeon insisted that they try it once. The leader finally agreed when he spotted the hunter at a distance. When he said fly all of them lifted together and flew away with the net. The hunter ar rived at the scene to see the pigeons fly away together as one group with his net. 15. Life Skill Used by the Characters . (a) Self Awareness . The pigeons knew that they were in trouble and had to find a way out of the net. (b) Creative Thinking by the Hunter . Spreading grains under the net to catch the pigeons. (c) Creative Thinking by the Pigeons . Identified a creative solu tion of flying together. (d) Critical Thinking . The young pigeon identified that they were wasting energy and time by trying to fly individually. (e) Decision Making . They decided to fly as a group. (f) Effective Communication . The young pigeon assertively communicated his suggestion of flying together. CONCLUSION 16. Life Skills help in building self-confidence and se lf esteem and enable us to adapt to situations and people. Life skills are learnt from our own experience, perceptions, insight, stories, books, parents, teachers, religion, media, culture etc. Life Skills are present in every individual. To get the best out of them we need to sharpen them regularly. 146 LESSON PLAN: PDLS - 2 FACTORS INFLUENCING / SHAPING PERSONALITY : PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL Period - Two Type - Discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Charts, Marker Pens, Black Board, Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Physical and Social Factors - 35 Min (c) Psychological and Philosophical Factors - 35 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Personality is the characteristics and patterns of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, which make a person exceptional, one of a kind and exclusive to his or herself. People are different from one another, including identical twins they differ in fingerprints and personalities. A healthy self-image is the core determining factor of a strong personalit y. It is the sum total of your inhe rent and acquired characteristics. It is not necessarily something you are born with, but something you definitely need to take respon sibility for. It is primarily you alone, who can shape your personality and create your world. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the Fa ctors Influencing / Shaping Personality. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Physical and Social Factors Influencing / Shaping Personality (b) Part II - Psychological and Philosophical Factors Influencing / Shaping Personality PART I : PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS INFLUENCING / SHAPING PERSONALITY 6. Personality development is the development of the organized pattern of behaviours and attitudes that makes a person distinct ive. Personality is what makes a pers on a unique person, and it is recognizable soon after birth. There are many factors which influ ence/ shape an individuals' personality. Some of the physical and social factors influencing/shaping personality are enumerated below. 147 7 Hereditary . The traits and skills acquired by the parent may not modify the genes but just pass on to the children just as they are whichever genes carr ying hereditary trait is dom inant, the trait will pass on to the children from their parents just as it is. Fo r instance, the child inherits complexion, physique, intelligence, etc. from his parents. Heredity is indeed, an important factor in personality development. Almost every form of personality has been attributed to heredi ty. Today it is believed that hereditary traits are transmitted through the genes. Your personality can be influenced by the genes you may have inherited from either your mother's or your father's side or a combination of both. Apart from inheriting physical attributes, like height, weight and skin/hair colour, ps ychologists have ascertained t hat our mental aptitudes and temperaments which have the potential for influencing our personality are to a certain extent, hereditary. 8. Self-Development . Of the other factors, self-development is the most important factor that can influence one's personality. Self-awareness is the key; it entails believing in oneself and one's capabilities. It implies that despite one's family and environmental background or one's current circumstance, one remains in control/charge of moulding his/her personality. Su ch a person is aware that personality is a changing, evolving process and does everything poss ible to enhance his/her personality. 9. Environment . Our environment can also play a significant role on our personality. Right from early childhood through all the stages of development, our home and family, our school and teachers, our friends and colleagues at work, all exert influence on the dev elopment of our personality. Besides these, the location where we live and the society we associate wi th, the country of our birth and the culture we have adopted, are all critical factors that influence our personality. (a) Geographical Environment and Personality . Physical or geographical conditions influence the personality of the individual. People of cold countries are industrious and hard working. (b) Family Environment . Family atmosphere if disruptive will produce disrupted, delinquent, backward and maladjusted personalities. The number of members in the family, birth order of the child, emotional climate of the family, outlook of parents, cultural and ec onomic conditions of the family has an important bearing in personality formation. (c) Family Life Pattern . Family life, aims ambitions, as pirations and attitudes of parents; their emotional stability or instability; their overprotection or under protection of children- all these factors are important in personality development of the individual. (d) Early Childhood Experiences and Personality . Childhood experiences play a very important role in the development of the individu al. Tensions and emotional upsetting of early life influence personality development. Methods of breast feeding and toilet training do play a significant role in the personality development. (e) Neighbourhood . If the people in the neighbourhood are cultured and educated then the child may also grow into a good person. (f) Friends and Companions . Friends and companions greatly affect the personality of the child. Children of labourers go to third rate school an d play with half naked children in dirty streets or slums. They live amidst hunger and poverty. Ther e would be children who go to better schools and make friends and companions. The friendship of all types has a huge impact on the personality of the individual . good friends make good company. (g) School . School plays a vital role in the development of personality. (i) Teacher's personality, i.e. his attit udes, beliefs, ideas, habits, ambitions, aspirations, sentiments and emotional maturity affect the personality development of the child. (ii) Curriculum of school i.e. richne ss or drabness of curriculum also affects the personality of an individual. (iii) Methods of teaching and co-cu rricular activities also influence personality development. 148 (iv) General atmosphere in school i.e. congenial or uncongenial atmosphere influence personality development. 10. Education . Education falls into two categories; school smarts and street smarts. Thus, the most effective way of shaping one's personality is to hav e a taste of both types and experience both worlds. School smarts are the knowledge gained from school while street smarts are the learning that came from even the most unlikely sources. 11. Life-situations . Every person face many situations in his life which enables him/her to change his/her behavior. For example, a teacher may be rigid and strict with students but may not with his/her family. An officer may behave with the subordinates diffe rently as compare to his/her friends. Our situations in life are constantly changing and these can affect our personality in varying degrees. Some have greater opportunities in life like better amenities, better scho ols and greater advantages than others. Learning skills, life skills, communicative skills and language skills alt hough partially latent in some, can only be acquired through personal effort and gained through practice and experience. Hence it is our competence in handling life-situations that can positi vely influence our personality. PART II : PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL FACTORS INFLUENCING / SHAPING PERSONALITY 12. Psychological & philosophical factors play a big ro le in the functioning of the human behaviour and development of one's personality. These include our moti ves, acquired interests, values our attitudes, our will and character, our intellectual capacities such inte lligence i.e, the abilities to perceive, to observe, to imagine, to think and to reason. A healthy self-image is the core determining factor of a strong personality. Your personality is your identity; it is the sum total of your inherent and acquired characteristics. It is not necessarily something you are born with, but something you definitely need to take responsibility for it is primarily you alone, who can shape your personality and create your reality. 13. Past Experiences . Experience is one of the major deter minants of personality, it could affect a person either positively or negatively. For instance a person who has harsh experiences of say, being left behind, may display characteristics of distrust and may isolate himself from others. On the other hand, good experiences can fuel us either cons ciously or subconsciously to be motivated to work towards achieving the same results. People respond depending upon their experiences whether good or bad. 14. Dreams and Ambitions . Dreams and ambitions shape our personality in a way that it facilitates our goals. We start to set priorities and change the way we are in order for such priorities to be fulfilled. Hence, these aspirations are perhaps the strongest factors that develop our a ttitude towards work and career. 15. Self-Image . Each person views himself quite different from how other people perceive him. Thus, one's self-image usually breeds personality charac teristics that stick within the self-image. People who feel highly with their selves display a certain aura of c onfidence and make it always seem that they are a cut above the rest. 16. Values . Personality of an individual is greatly influe nced by the values a person strongly believes in. A person who adheres to high moral standards is a well-respected member of t he society. He is known for his integrity and is trusted by not only his family members, but also by his colleagues and friends. The characteristics of such a person hav ing a strong moral fiber ingrained into his character, can have a significant influence on the personality of an individual. CONCLUSION 17. In reality, you may be playing many roles i. e. husband/wife, mom/dad, son/daughter, teacher/ student, boss/employee; each of these enact different aspects of your personality and require a different set of behavior and responsibilities. A combination of the roles you play each day, becomes the sum total of your personality. Developing a fine personality can be within anybody's grasp. It can be attained through systematic steps in personal development. It can be the direct result of man's positive attitude combined with all the above factors. In the final analysis, it is your skill in maintaining a balanced approach to making your life healthier and happier. 149 LESSON PLAN : PDLS - 3 SELF AWARENESS Period - Two Type - Lecture Discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Flipchart, Marker pens, Pictures of / original gift items. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Dimensions of Self Awareness - 35 Min (c) Self Awareness through Activity - 20 Min (d) Body Image - 15 Min (e) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Self-awareness sounds very simple - after all do n't we know ourselves. But if we are blatantly honest with ourselves, we might become uncomfort able and experience stress since we will see our deficiencies and failure. Self-awareness is a unique hum an capacity. Self-awareness is the concept that one exists as an individual, separate from other p eople, with private thoughts. Self-awareness is a personal understanding of the very core of one's own identity. Self-awareness includes our recognition of ourselves, our character, strengths, weaknesses, desires and dislikes. It can help us to recognize when we are stressed or feel under pressure. It is oft en a pre-requisite for effective communications, interpersonal relationship and developing empathy for others. AIM 4. The aim of this class is to know various di mensions of self-awareness and to know one self. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Dimensions of Self Awareness. (b) Part II - Self Aw areness through Activity. (c) Part III - Body Image. PART I : DIMENSIONS OF SELF AWARENESS 6. Self awareness involves knowing ourselves and our personality, and accepting oneself inspite of our imperfection. It includes all aspects of our selves- our thoughts, emotions, like, dislikes, strengths, and weakness, knowledge the fact that though I am imperfect, but still I like myself since I am a good human being and possess many qualities. It acknowledges the fa ct that I may be imperfect, but still I like myself since I am a good human being and possess many qualit ies. To have complete self awareness one needs to concentrate on two aspects the first being how we perceive ourselves our strengths, weakness, abilities etc and secondly how others perceive us. Both the vi ews together gives a person a complete picture about one self. 7. Every person perceives oneself in three aspects as:- (a) The perceive self--the way we see that part of ourselves, 150 (b) The real self--the way we truly are. (c) The ideal self--the way we would like to be in that area. 8 Unhappiness and poor adjustments in persons are mainly because of discrepancies between the perceived and the real or ideal self. These unhappines s and poor adjustments are due to misperceptions of self which there by leads to discontentment. 9 The following dimensions of Self -awareness will be dwelt with as many people limit their self awareness to their bio-data which is usually things known by everybody . However at a deeper level there is so much inside each one of us that it has many dimensions:- (a) Self Realization . Self-realization is the ultimate of self-awareness when one realizes one self and the requirement of their existence in the world. (b) Self Knowledge or Self Exploration . This is a process through which we undo or explore ourselves. This exploration and und erstanding and knowledge about three important areas Physical self- Knowledge about our own body, Social self - Knowledge about how we relate and interact with society; whether we are social, extroverts or introverts; helping nature; empathetic, etc. Inner self - Knowledge about our goal s, dreams, aspirations, secrets, fears, etc. (c) Self Confidence . Self-confidence builds in from self-esteem and this is possible only when one is completely aware about ones abilit ies and limits. Success, appreciation, care, love etc, are factors that boost up the self-confidence. (d) Self Talk . These automatic thoughts can be positi ve or negative. Some of our self talk comes from logic and reason. Other self talk may arise from misconceptions that we create because of lack of information. This is the endless talks and conversations that runs through our minds through the day. This is also a strategy fo r raising ones' self-confidence if one practices positive thinking. (e) Self Motivation . Self-Motivation is what makes an individual work towards a goal or target, not for external reasons but because of his own internal will to achieve it. It is an important quality required by everybody to do vari ous activities like studying, working, earning and building relationships. (f) Self Esteem . Self-esteem or self-worth in cludes a person's subjective appraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positive or neg ative to some degree. Developing high self-esteem would improve our self-confidence, the way we look at ourselves, what we can do for ourselves, our well-being, our relationships and our happiness. (g) Self Image . Self-image is how one perceives himsel f-positively or negatively. Self- image is important because how one feels and thinks about himself affects the way he acts. Self-image about our body is called body image, which is very often a cause for low self-esteem. By body image one is keeping in mind both in ternal and external aspects of it. (h) Self Control . The ability to control your thoughts, emotions, urges, desires, fantasies, actions is called self-control. It is part of our will power, and includes delayed gratification. (j) Self Purpose . This is the ability to find a purpose fo r ourselves in relation to this world. What are our goals in terms of family, friendships, career, hobbies, interests. When taken to the extreme -what are our goals in terms of our own selv es in this world and universe - that is self- realization. (k) Individuality and Uniqueness . Every single human being is born in this world with different qualities inherent and later they acqui re some as they live and learn. This helps individuals to become unique in skills giving them an identity of their own. This describes their individuality and describes each and every person in a different manner. (l) Personality . Personality can be defined as the distin ctive and characteristic patterns of thought, emotion and behavior that define an individual 's personal style of interacting with the physical and social environment. Our personality has various dimensions, including our openness, 151 conscientiousness, nature, etc. There are numerous courses available for personality development. (m) Values . Value is a concept that describes the beliefs of an individual or culture. Love, care, courage, bravery, respect, integrity and compassion, and respecting our elders are examples of values. (n) Attitude . Attitude is a mind set the way we think and look at things. All of us at one time or another, express the three different types of attitudes: positive, negative and neutral. Attitude is the way you look at things. Half a glass of water may appear half empty tone and half full to another. (o) Character . This is defined as the collective qualit ies or characteristics that distinguish a person, including his reputation, morals and will power. PART II : SELF AWARENES THROUGH ACTIVITY 10. Activity 1 - Warming Up . (a) Step - 1 . Tell the participants to shake hands with others and ask each others names. Encourage each participant to shake hands with as many participants as possible within a minute. (b) Step - 2 . Tell the participants to share their feelings during the exercise by asking following questions:- (i) Did you feel comfortable while shaking hands with others? (ii) What stopped you to do this exercise? 11. Discuss with the participants that in this ex ercise, some people would have felt comfortable and some would have been hesitant to shake hands. To know why people feel the way they felt, it is necessary to understand oneself. 12. (Note : If shaking hands is not culturally ac ceptable just finding names and greeting in the traditional way - for example, saying 'namaste' or 'hello' may be sufficient. Modify the other steps accordingly). 13 . The Self Awareness life skills will be further internalized by another activity as follows:- 14 . Activity 2 - Open Your Heart . (a) Step - 1 . Give each participant an A-4 size paper. Ask them to draw an outline of a heart. Then divide the heart into four sections. (b) Step - 2. Encourage them to write down the following inside the heart. (i) Significance/ meaning of their name - in the top left section. If they do not know the meaning of their name, ask them to writ e their name vertically and then add a positive adjective after each alphabet. For example, if someone's name is AJIT then - A - Affectionate J - Joyful I - Intelligent T - Talented Name 152 (ii) Their likes and dislikes - in the top right section. (iii) Mention two good qualitie s they possess and two qualit ies they want to change - in the bottom left section. (iv) What others think about them (two qualities) - in the bottom right section. (c) Step -3 Ask the participants to come and fix the heart prepared by them on the flipchart/board. Let each participant take turns to re ad the contents of one heart. This exercise will enable the participants to come closer to each othe r and will help them come to know of their own/other's talents. Tell the participants that each one is unique and has distinctive qualities. Every person has his/her exclusive strengths and weakness. It is important to identify and accept the weaknesses of oneself to make an effort to change it into strengths. PART III : BODY IMAGE 15. The class will be explained about the body imag e how they have arrived at a particular quality of themselves and all about Body Image. (a) What is Body Image? Body image is the way we perceive our body. It also means how we believe others see our body. It is one of the fact ors that affects our self-esteem, and influences the way we accept or reject ourselves. It determi nes whether we feel attractive and confident in society. (b) What Decides our Body Image? Any external factors decide the way we view our body. These may be current fashion fads, role models, comments from parents, media and peer pressure. By seeing slim models in TV programs, girls get the impression that thin is in and therefore try to lose weight and go on diets. Wi th so many fancy advertisements for fairness Creams, a dark complexioned boy or girl may have poor body image. Boys may dream of developing muscles like their favorite film heroes. All these concerns are not from their bodies and that of their role model. (c) What is Poor Body Image? A person is said to be suffering from \"poor body Image\" when he/she focuses on the negative (real or im aginary) aspects as perceived by himself or herself about his/her body. The positive aspects are totally or partially excluded by him/her. He/she thus develops poor self-esteem. (d) What are the Harmful Effects of Poor Body Image? Poor or negative body image can produce a feeling of inferiority in the minds of a dolescents. It can also lead to anxiety, depression, withdrawal, and in extreme cases, suicide. A lot of money is wasted on attempts to change their bodies. Some people indulge in high-risk behavior, to prove that he/she is attractive to others. A desire to look like an adult also arises due to body image concerns. These may include smoking, consumption of alcohol, substance abuse and unsafe sex. Poor body image is also the cause of many eating disorders seen in adolescent girls and boys. 16 . Tackling Poor Body Image. (a) Enhance Self-Esteem . This can be done by peers, teachers, family and friends. The positive points of the adolescent should be highlight ed to him/her. He/she should be motivated to concentrate on personal strength not related to physique, e.g. hard work, determination, patience, courage etc. (b) Build Up Critical Thinking . Is physical beauty the only cr iteria for success/popularity? Even film stars have to work very hard to make a movie successful. Many successful and famous people may not be very good looking. (c) Build up Positive Qualities . Everyone has some positive qualities. These should be identified and highlighted e.g. cari ng, confident, hardworking etc. 153 (d) Understand Cultural Variation . The colour of skin and shape of body and facial features vary from country to country and even with in a country from state to state. The definition of beauty also varies from region to region. (d) Dispel Myths . Like 'being thin is in', 'fair & lovely', 'fair &handsome'. (f) Utilise Life Skills. Life skills like critical thinking and self-awareness can be utilized to promote or develop a positive body image. CONCLUSION 17. Self-Awareness is called the mother of all skill s. It is a thinking skill, a social skill and a coping skill. It is one of the most difficult skills to master. Many great saints spend their life meditating and looking inward but only a few like Buddha actually achieve co mplete self-awareness. Knowing others is wisdom but knowing oneself is enlightenment - Tao Tzu. Aw areness about our self is the first step towards creation. This understanding then gi ves us the opportunity and freedom to change those things you'd like to change about yourself and create the life you want. 154 LESSON PLAN: PDLS 4 CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING Period - Two Type - Lecture/Discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Flipchart, Marker pens, Pictures of / original gift items. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Critical Thinking - 40 Min (c) Creative Thinking - 30 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Critical thinking is an ability to Analyse inform ation and experiences in an objective manner. It helps us to recognize and assess the factors that infl uence attitudes and behavior, such as media and pee r pressure influences. 4. Creativity is the ability to imagine or invent so mething new. Creativity is not the ability to create out of nothing, but the ability to generate new ideas by combining, changing or reapplyi ng existing ideas. Some creative ideas are astonishing and brilliant, whiles others are just simple, good, practical ideas that no one seems to have thought of yet. AIM 5. To acquaint the cadets about the concept of Critical Thinking and Creative Thinking PREVIEW 6. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Critical Thinking. (b) Part II - Creative Thinking. PART I : CRITICAL THINKING 7. Critical thinking is not criticism, it's a link between positive thinking and creative thinking, and are very essential for positive and creative emotions and behavior. It is also called \"logical\" thinking and \"analytical\" thinking. Critical thinking enables us to Analyse information and experiences, objectively, and assess the factors that influence the way we think and act. Critical thinking is important for any of ou r crucial life decisions. What options do I have? What c an each option lead to? Is this really what I want? 8. It is the process of determining the authentic ity, accuracy or value of something; and is characterized by the ability to:- (a) Seek reasons and alternatives. (b) Perceive the total situation. 155 (c) Change one's views based on evidence. 9. Critical thinking involves l ogical thinking and reasoning. It also includes skills such as comparison, classification, cause/effect, deductive reasoning, and planning. After all, the quality of everything we do is determined by the quality of ou r thinking. It involves analyzing and judging the information provided, and then weighing the pros and cons and the consequences of any action. Critical thinkers gather information from all senses, verbal and/or written expressions, reflection, observation, experience and reasoning. 10. Critical thinking requires skills in:- (a) Analyzing the information and examining it in detail. (b) Thinking about different perspectives an d possibilities (c) Problem solving - considering available information before making an appropriate decision. (d) Reasoning - thinking logically; making links between ideas and information. (e) Evaluating - examining information, to assess whether it is useful, relevant, and reliable. 11. Critical thinking is about following attitudes:- (a) Open-mindedness - w illing to examine multiple points of views. (b) Flexibility - able to change your point of view. (c) Persistence - able to follow a line of reasoning. (d) Interpersonal sensitivity - willing to respect the opinions of others. (e) Intercultural sensitivity - respecting diversit y of culture, socio-economic variations, etc. 12. Critical Thinking Promotes Creativity . To come up with a creative solution to a probleminvolves not just having ideas. The new ideas being generated must also be useful and relevant to the task at ha nd. Critical thinking plays a crucial role in evaluating new ideas, selecting the be st ones and modifying them if necessary. 13. Critical Thinking is Crucial for Self-Reflection. In order to live a meaningful life and to structure o lives accordingly, we need to justify and reflect on our values and decisions. Critical thinking provides t h tools for this process of self-evaluation. 14. An individual with critical thinking skills is able to do the following:- (a) Raise pertinent questions, which are clear and precise. (b) Identify the relevance and importance of ideas. (c) Understand the logical connections between ideas. (d) Assess statement and arguments. (e) Detect inconsistencies and common mistake in reasoning. (f) Examine belief, assumptions, and opinion and weigh them against facts. (g) Listen carefully to others and give feedback. (h) Suspend judgment until all facts have been gathered and considered. 156 \u00b6 Figure A Figure B (j) Look for evidence to support assumptions and beliefs. (k) Adjust opinion when new facts are found. (l) Reject information that is incorrect or irrelevant. (m) Interested in finding new solutions. (n) Gather and assess relevant information, using abstract ideas to interpret it effectively. Draw well-reasoned conclusions and solutions after testi ng them against relevant criteria and standards. (o) Solve problems systematically. PART II: CREATIVE THINKING 15. Activity I (a) Step - 1 . Tell the participants that it is time for another interesting exercise. Make 9 dots on the flipchart as shown in FigA. Ask the part icipants to draw four straight lines through the nine dots without retracing and without lifting their pen from the paper. (b) Step - 2 . Give 5 minutes to the participants to do this exercise, and then ask them to share their drawings. Applaud those participants who could make the drawing correctly as shown in Fig. B. Tell the participants that the key to the solution is that the imaginary boundaries formed b y the dots need not be observed. Once freed from this re striction, it is easy to find a solution, as shown here. 16. Creativity encompasses the following:- (a) An Ability . Creativity is the ability to imagine or invent something new. Creativity isnot the ability to create out of nothing, but the ability to generate ne w ideas by combining, changing or reapplying existing ideas. Some cr eative ideas are astonish ing and brilliant, whiles others are just simple, good, practical ideas t hat no one seems to have thought of yet. Everyone has substantial creative ability. O ften all that's needed to be cr eative is to make a commitment to creativity and to take the time for it. (b) An Attitude . Creativity is also an attitude: the ability to accept change andnewness, a willingness to play with ideas and possibilities, a flexibility of outlook, the habit of enjoying the good, while looking for ways to improve it. 157 (c) A Process . Creative people work hard continuously to improve ideas and solutions, by making gradual alterations and refinements to th eir works. Contrary to the mythology surrounding creativity, very few works of cr eative excellence are prod uced with single stro ke of brilliance. The creative person knows that there is always room for improvement. 17. Characteristics of the Creativ e Person.A creative person has the following characteristics:- (a) Curious. (b) Seeks problems. (c) Enjoys challenge. (d) Optimistic. (e) Able to suspend judgment. (f) Comfortable with imagination. (g) Sees problems as opportunities. (h) Sees problems as interesting. (j) Problems are emotionally acceptable. (k) Challenges assumptions. (l) Doesn't give up easily: perseveres, works hard. 18. Activity 2 . (a) Step - 1 . Inform the participants that it is time to play another game. Take them outside where they can have a large area to work. Sp lit them into two teams (or more if the group is large). (b) Step - 2 . Explain that they are to create a long line on the ground or floor, using whatever they currently have on t heir bodies (they are not permitted to take off their clothes excep t shoes and socks). They are not permitted to get additional things, but w hatever they have tissue, handkerchief, watches, shoes, pen etc. can be used to make the line longer and longer. Their goal is to have a longer line than the other teams. (If peo ple are really creative, they will use everything possible and then lie down on the ground themselves to make the line longer). The team with the longest line is the winner.Initiate a discussion on how creative and critical thinking helped them in making their line longer. How creative and critical thinking helps in finding solutions to the problems? (c) Step - 3 . Initiate a discussion on how creative and critical thinking helped them in making their line longer. How creative and critical thinking helps in finding solutions to the problems? 19. Creative thinking means finding solutions beyond our usual or traditional way of reacting to a problem. We are often limited by our past experiences, and we dread to think differently. To go beyond the traditional boundaries of doing things, it is necessary to empower ourselves with more information throughnewspapers, radio, TV, classmates, teachers, relatives, friends, or even strangers. Research is the key to help us formulate ideas towards finding a creative soluti on. Creative thinking will enable us to find solution when it looks as i f there is no way out. CONCLUSION 20. Critical thinking is not criticism, it's a link bet ween positive thinking and creative thinking. Creativity is the ability to generate new ideas by combining, changi ng, or reapplying existing ideas. It helps us to look beyond our direct experience, and to respond adaptively and with flexibility to situations in our daily lives. 158 LESSON PLAN : PDLS - 5 COMMUNICATION SKILLS - 1 Period - Two Type - Lecture, discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Pointer, Charts, Black Board and Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 10 Min (b) Understanding Basics of Communication - 20 Min (c) Different Ways of Communication - 20 Min (d) Components of Communication - 20 Min (e) Conclusion - 10 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Communication is sharing ideas, opinions, thoughts, feeling and understanding through speech, writing, gestures or symbols betw een two or more persons. We are communicating all the time with others AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets with the basics, diffe rent ways and components of effective communication. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Understanding Basics of Communication. (b) Part II - Different Ways of Communication. (c) Part III - Components of Effective Communication. PART I : UNDERSTANDING BASICS OF COMMUNICATION 6. Communication is conveying a message - verbally, written or through the use of signs. If we do not talk with others, then they will not know what we ar e thinking and they will not be able to understand us. One will feel terribly lonely this way. 7. For some people, it is the problem of not know ing how to communicate. For others, it may be that they are too afraid to talk about their problems, shar e their views, and let others know what is going on in their mind. 8. In fact, without communication, our relationships wi th others are likely to be dominated by suspicion, guess work, misunderstandings and false assumptions. Empathy creates wonderful results only when we are willing to let others know how we feel. 9. Lack of communication breeds problems in our rela tionships. We tend to assume that others know what we want or how we feel. Then when they do not react as we expect they should, we get upset. We expect people to understand us. The truth is they do not understand us, if we choose to believe that ideas can get across at the unspoken level! All too often, the communication between us and our loved ones, is merely functional - out of necessity. We waste many opportunities to enhance our understanding of each other and improve our relationship. 159 10. For instance, if you are used to your mother cook ing every day, and assume it is her role to cook so there is no need to feel special about it, she may increas ingly find cooking a chore. Do you know each time your mother goes into the kitchen, she puts in her affe ction into the food by choo sing the type of vegetables or ingredients you like? Do you know that each time she dishes out the food; she silently hopes you will enjoy it and tell her how good it was? She may be able to tell from the way you gobble up the dal bhat, but nothing is more powerful than language at that moment if you can simply say: Mummy, it`s delicious, I love it You will make her day! You can do it every day to make her feel appreciated, even though it is not in your culture, or habit. 11. There are many such moments for us to express a ffection, especially to our family members. If you simply let those moments slip by, you will realize th at the fountain will dry up one day. Relationship, like a reservoir, requires constant nourishment. Imagine what would happen to the reservoir if we keep drawing water from it but there was no rainfall to top it up. Similarly, we cannot draw affection without investing affection. By counting to take relationships for granted , we will come to a crisis one day - when the reservoir has dried up. That is how thing begin to fall apart. 12. We often find people harbouring grudges agains t each other for being unhelpful, uncaring, not showing sufficient understanding. Many times we stop talking to people for long durations because of anger. This long silence is like a time bomb, which may expl ode one day at the slightest provocation. We all have a part to play in triggering its explos ion. If you can reduce your part, y ou are helping to diffuse the bomb. Long silence does not help to resolve problems. On the contrary , it breeds bitterness. When our heart is bitter, we cannot be happy and loving; even though we can suppres s the bitterness to pretend we are fine. If you do not begin to make a change though, the silent relationship pattern will go on from generation to generation. It will stay the same with your parents, either your future wife or husband, and your friends. PART II : DIFFERENT WAYS OF COMMUNICATION 13. Activity 1. (a) Step - 1 . Ask the participants to find a partne r with whom they haven't paired with before. When everyone has a partner , ask the pairs to sit together. (b) Step - 2 . Give two news clippings/messages to each participant. One of the news clippings should be relatively easy while the second clipping should be more difficult. (c) Step - 3 . Allow the first person a few moments to read the first news clipping. The second person does nothing at this point but sits quietly. The first person is then blindfolded and is asked to narrate what he/she had read. (d) Step - 4 . The second person who wa s listening will then re peat what he/she heard while the first person listens . Both partners will then check the news clipping to see if the information was reported correctly or if anything was missing from the narration. (e) Step - 5 . Let the participants swit ch roles by having the second person read his/her news clipping and then narrate it blindfolded to thei r partner. Follow the same process in Step 4. (f) Step -6 . Initiate a discussion with the help of following questions: (i) What have they learnt from this activity? (ii) How did they feel when they had to speak or when they had to listen while blindfolded - especially during the second it em, which was more difficult than the first? (iii) How did they feel being blindfolded when they were communicating with others? (iv) Was it different from normal communication? (v) What is the importance of eye c ontact when talking to another person? 160 (g) Step - 7 . Discuss the three different styles of communication - Aggressive, Passive and Assertive. Ask participants if they can demonstrate these three different styles of communication, how the body language, tone and cont ent changes with the style of communication 13. There are three ways of communication as under:- (a) Aggressive . They believe that everyone should li ke them; I am never wrong I`ve got rights but you don`t. They have a close mind and ar e poor listeners. They have difficulty in seeing the other person point of view, they interrupt and monopolize. They tend to dominate and put down others. They are bossy. While communicating they fr own, stare, talk loudly or have a yelling tone of voice. (b) Passive . The persons do not express their true feelings; they do not disagree and think that others have more rights than they do. Their communication style is indirect, they always agree and do not speak out and are very hesitant. While co mmunicating they often lack facial expression and stand with down cast eyes. (c) Assertive . The person believes he/she as well as others are valuable. They know that if they have rights then others also have rights. They are active listene rs and check on others feelings. They are action oriented, attentive, vocal, expres sive, good listeners, aware, supportive, persuasive, fair, open and consistent in behavior. Their expect ations are realistic. They have open and natural gestures. They maintain an eye contact while communicating. PART III: COMPONENTS OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION 15. Activity 2 (a) Step - 1 . Ask the participants to form pairs - encourage the young people to form pairs with peers they haven't pai red with before. When everyone has a partner have the pairs sit together. (b) Step - 2 . Then one of them should start by descr ibing to the other an important event in his/her life, which made him/her feel happy. (c) Step - 3 . The listener should say nothing, but should just concentrate hard on hearing what is being said. After a couple of minutes, as k the listener to stop listening. She/he could yawn, look elsewhere, turn around, whistle, do what ever she/he wants to show that she/he has stopped listening, although the speaker should continue to describe her/his story. After a couple of minutes, call \"halt\". At this stage, the speaker and listener should change roles. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 of the exercise. (d) Step - 4 . Initiate a discussion with the help of following questions:- (i) How did they feel as a speaker? Encour age them to compare telling their story to a willing listener and speaking with a non-willing listener. (ii) How did they feel as good and bad listeners? (iii) What are the characteri stics of good and bad listening? (iv) Could you make out from the body language of the listener whether she/he was listening? (v) What do you do when the person you ar e communicating with is not listening? (vi) What steps can be taken to communicate more effectively? (e) Step - 5 . Tell the participants that effective communication involves: (i) Verbal Communication (ii) Non-verbal Communication (iii) Listening 16. Effective Communicative involves:- (a) Verbal Communication . One person talks and the other listen to be able to react. The conversation can be informative, in the form of questions, a negotiation, and statement or open 161 ended questions, instruction, etc. And the situatio n can be formal or informal. In relationships, communication is usually informal. Speech problem, too long sentences, mumbling, speaking too softly, hearing problems, listeners interrupting the s peaker, loud external noises, etc. all hamper proper communication. (b) Non-Verbal Communication . Non verbal communication is that gives meaning to what is said and may communicate both appreciation and reject ion. It includes such things as tone of voice, a nod of head, using silence, frowning, smiling, body posture, touch, shaking of the head to communicate approval or disapproval, lifting of t he eyebrows to show surprise, distance between persons, playing with something in hand instead of focusing. Make use of body language to communicate effectively. Ensure that you appre ciate others through body language. React to what others say by nodding, smiling and generally showing you are listening. (c) Listening . During communication, one person talks and another person listens. The listeners must give attention to all that is said, without interrupting the speaker and react later in a relevant manner. Many people may listen but know what the full message is. Some people react to when only half is said. There are people who listen selectively, who miss much of the message and only focus on points relevant to him or her. Sometime we do not listen to our friends and other people; sometimes they do not listen to us. In ei ther situation, there will be a problem in communication and understanding. 17. How would we know if someone is not listening to us:- (a) Look somewhere else. (b) Interrupts communication. (c) Constantly looks at the watch. (d) Gets up to do so mething and returns. (e) Gives advice. (f) Talks to someone else. (g) Answers the phone. (h) Begins to do some work. (j) Does not stop doing work. (k) Says that she/he will be back in a minute and does not return. (a) Looks bored. 18. Components of Communication:- Source Message Receive r Channel Feedback 19. Why is Effective Communication Important to Young People ? Adolescence being a period of immense change, communication during this transitional phase of life assumes even more importance. Young people should be equipped to effectively communi cate with others regarding their feelings and emotions or decisions. Also, a young person who is in need of advice or who harbour s some fears, needs to talk to others and expr ess himself/herself. CONCLUSION 20. The ability to effectively communicate with other people is an important life skill. Through communication, people reach some under standing of each other, learn to like each other, influence one another, build trust, and learn more about them selves and how people perceive them. People who communicate effectively know how to interact with others flexibly, skillf ully, and responsibly, but without sacrificing their own needs and integrity. COMPONENTS OF COMMUNICATION162 LESSON PLAN : PDLS - 6 COMMUNICATION SKILLS - 2 Period - Two Type - Lecture, Discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Charts, Po inter, Black Board and Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Common Barriers to Effective Communication - 25 Min (c) Different types of Barriers to Communication - 25 Min (d) Communicate Tactfully - 20 Min (e) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Overcoming the many barriers to communicati on is more a matter of common sense, practice and effort than any specific skill. Essentially, being an effective communicator means having the skill to recognize if and when there is a barrier to communication and being able to resolve it. AIM 4. To understand the components and Barriers to Effective Communication and how to communicate tactfully. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Common Barriers to Effective Communication. (b) Part II - Different Type of Barriers to Communication. (c) Part III - Commincate Tactfully PART I : COMMON BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION 6. No matter how good and effective a communicator one maybe, yet the fact is that one does face certain barriers, from time to time, which forces them to work on becoming even more effective in their skills to communicate. Given here are the communication barrier s that occur while listening, speaking and in the case of non- verbal communications. 7. Listening Barriers . (a) Interrupting the speaker. (b) Not maintaining eye contact with the speaker. (c) Rushing the speaker to complete what he has to say. (d) Making the speaker feel as thoug h he is wasting the listener's time. (e) Being distracted by something that is not part of the ongoing communication. 163 (f) Getting ahead of the speaker and completing his thoughts. (g) Ignoring the speaker's requests. (h) Topping the speaker's story with one's own set of examples. (j) Forgetting what is being discussed. 8. Barriers While Speaking . (a) Unclear message. (b) Lack of consistency in the communication process. (c) Incomplete sentences or mumbling words and sentences. (d) Not understanding the receiver. (e) Poor eye contact. 9. The Other Barriers Include . (a) Assumptions, for instance assuming others see a situation same as you or have same feelings as yours. (b) Patterns / reverting to type. (c) Language - different level of meaning. (d) Erroneous transition, value judgment. (e) Use of negative words. (f) Perceptions- depending on mood, the re ceiver may misinterpret the message. PART II : DIFFERENT TYPE OF BARRIERS OF COMMUNICATION 10. Barriers of Communication may be divided as:- (a) Linguistic Barriers . (i) Language/words. (ii) Ambiguous words. (iii) Lack of clarity. (iv) Using technical terms. (b) Psychological Barriers . (i) Aggression. (ii) Inferiority. (iii) Symbol of status. (iv) Hierarchy. (v) Memory. (vi) Disinterest. (c) Environmental Barriers . (i) Disturbance/sound. (ii) Environmental changes. (iii) Lack of ventilation. (iv) Lack of space. (v) Distance from participants. ( v i ) T i m e . (vii) Physical discomfort. 164 (d) Sender and Receiver Related . (i) Depends on the mood (angry, happy, sad and depressed). (ii) Personality type of sender or receiver (soft spoken, harsh with others, impatient, arrogant, not listening to others, cannot take orders, meek, docile, fear of authority etc.) (iii) The level of trust one holds for the other person. (iv) Perception a bout the other person. (v) Value judgment (not effective, clever, hard worker, lazy) (vi) Lack of empathy (not bothering to under stand the situation the other person is in). (e) Content Related . (i) Content chosen is sensitive. (ii) Inappropriate for the receiver. (iii) Incoherently communicated. (iv) Use of words (too complex expression, use of unknown language or words, hidden meaning etc.) (f) Method Related . (i) Inappropriate method (e.g. use of writt en text messages with illiterate population). (ii) Loss in transmission (disturbance/noise). 11. Activity 1. (a) Step - 1 . Ask the participants to brainstorm on the effect of such barriers. (i) The communication may remain incomplete. (ii) The intended results may not be achieved. (iii) A 'communication gap' emerges due to the different perception that the sender (intended meaning of the communication) and the receiver (perceived meaning of the communication) have. (b) Step - 2 . Explain the factors that in fluence the communication gap. The factors that cause the 'communication gap' are many. They include - \u00be Hierarchy (not able to question hi gher authority for clarification) \u00be Conflict of interest ( e.g. personal in terest versus the parental expectations) \u00be The level of motivation that one holds. (e.g. I do not care, things can wait) \u00be Perception (e.g. Nobody understands me ) \u00be Psychological factor (e.g. fear of autho rity and power, anger about following rules) \u00be Stress (e.g. stress due to exams/work/per sonal pressure and hence misunderstand the communication) 12. Activity 2 . (a) Step - 1 . Ask the participants to add any more fa ctors from their personal experience especially related to interpersonal communication with mother, father, elder /younger siblings, teachers, at work etc). Ask them to expl ain how do they resolve or bridge the gap? (b) Step - 2 . Tell them, that it is important to identify the communication gaps and develop skills to bridge the same. End the sessi on by emphasising on the following key messages: (i) Communication is a basic skill and forms the foundation of all relationships. 165 (ii) The quality of communication often det ermines the quality of a relationship. (iii) We communicate to give inform ation, express our feelings, solve problems/arguments/conflicts, to show that we care, etc. (iv) Understanding how to communicate and learning how to communicate effectively in different situations protects young people from risks and risky behaviour. Reducing the Communication Gap 13. The following steps will help in reducing the communication gap:- (a) Plan ahead. (b) Involve others to contribute to planning. (c) Listen to the suggestions made by others. (d) Speak with purpose and be specific. (e) Justify your stand without upsetting others. (f) Have sense of humour. (g) Have empathy. (h) Do not be judgmental. (j) Do not underestimate the ab ility of others to contribute. (k) Observe the body language or the non-verbal communication of others. (l) Be transparent to inform others of the planned activities and get feedback. (m) Make modification in the plan to suit the need. (n) The words 'yes' and 'no' are very po werful. Learn to use them appropriately. PART III : COMMUNICATE TACTFULLY 14. The ability to deal with others without offendi ng, giving feedback without creating conflict, a keen sense for what is appropriat e, this is the skill of tactfulness. If yo u see the value of being tactful the following suggestions will help. 15. Always Communicate Tactfully . (a) T - Think before you speak. (b) A - Assertive communication. (c) C - Clarity of thoughts and content. (d) T - Tone and pitch of voice. (f) F - Focus on interests, needs of the listener. (g) U - Uncover hidden feelings. (h) L - Listen for feedback. CONCLUSION 16. Communication is a basic skill and forms the foundation of all relationships. The quality of communication often determines the quality of a relations hip. We communicate to give information, express our feelings, solve problems/arguments/ conflicts, to sh ow that we care, etc. Th erefore understanding how to communicate and learning how to communicate effectively in different situations protects young people from risks and risky behavior. 166 LESSON PLAN : PDLS - 7 DECISION MAKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING Period - Two Type - Lecture, Discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1 Computer slides, Charts, Pointer, Black Board and Chalk.

We make decisions every day. Some are made after careful deliberation, some made more hastily. Problem solving skills enable us to deal with problems in our lives in a constructive manner. The process of problem solving involves various steps. They are identi fying the problem, exploring the available alternative and deciding on the best possible solution. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about Deci sion Making and Problem Solving Skills. PREVIEW 5 The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Decision Making Skills. (b) Part II - Problem Solving and its Process. (c) Part III - Practicing Decision Making and Problem Solving. PART I : DECISION MAKING SKILLS 6. Activity 1 . What is Decision Making? (a) Step - 1 . Encourage the participants to think of any decision they have taken (or seen anyone taking) in the last one week and discuss how decisions are usually taken. Ask some of the participants to share their answers with t he larger group. Some possible answers are:- (i) Someone else takes it for them. (ii) Decide suddenly. (iii) Wait until someone else decides. (iv) Do what an older person says. (v) Don't take any decision at all. (vi) Think through the choices and then choose. 167 (b) Step - 2 . Ask the participants to sit in a circle. Walk around the circle with the cloth/paper bag in which you have put 8-10 small item s and ask each participant to feel the contents in the bag (no peeping into the bag). The participants should try to remember what they felt in the bag. Each participant is given 20 seconds (facilitator counts to 20) to feel the contents in the bag. When all the participants have had a chance to feel the contents in the bag, ask all the participants to share what they felt in the bag. T hen show the objects in the bag one by one. (c) Step - 3 . Initiate a discussion with the help of following questions:- (i) When you felt the objects in the bag, why did you feel that you could identify what they were? (ii) In spite of feeling the same contents, what made the participants identify some of the objects differently? (iii) Do people use past experiences to he lp them make decisions about issues that have occurred after those experiences? (iv) How can those experiences have a positive or negative effect on further decisions? 7. Decision Making . We make decisions every day. Examples of minor decisions which we take very often are - what to eat, what to wear or how to reach a place. Examples of major decisions which we take once in a life time are - what career to choose, when and whom to marry, where to buy a house, which college to go to etc. 8. Decision making is a complex process. Some deci sions are made after careful deliberation, some are made more hastily; some are made through our own will, some under the pressure of others. Our past experiences determine many of the decisions we make. Sometimes due to the past experiences we are afraid of doing things differently. 9. Good decision making depends on understanding the situation well, being aware of our choices and, above all visualising the co nsequences of our choices. 10. Some of the major steps to be followed while making a decision are - define the problem, gather and analyse the relevant data, postulate solutions to the problem, analyse the implications of each alternative, select and act on the best alternat ive, follow-up and modify the approach if necessary. PART II : PROBLEM SOLVING 11. Activity 2 . We introduce the topics to the cadets by following activity:- (a) Step 1 . Ask the participants, when faced with a problem, how do you react? Most of you try to escape from the problem instead of facing it. (b) Step 2 . You should always question yourself, \"Do I have problem?\" If you don't take any action to solve the problem, your ability cannot be im proved. Problems give us opportunity to evolve to our full potential. 12. Most of the people refuse to identify the prob lem, once we write down the problem on piece of paper, it will be easy to solve it with suitable solutions. 13. Usually, we always think about only problem not solutions. Once we define the problem clearly on paper, we analyse the problem and find the ways to solv e it. We have to adopt logical thinking instead of routine through the environment around us. 14. In general every problem has many solutions. So we should always find all alternatives and take the best one. 168 15. Problems are often opportunities in disguise. When we escape from problems, we give up the opportunity to develop our skills and potentials. Once we resolve our problems, we will find ourselves happier, more fulfilled, and more ready to confront new issues. Tackling problems involves the use of our mind. The process enhances our capacity to solve greater problems. PART III : PRACTICING DECISION MAKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 16. Activity - 3 (a) Step - 1 . Brainstorm with the participants on some problem situations young people encounter in their lives: Situations where they have to make decisi ons very quickly and think very rapidly. Some examples: (i) Your parents are asking you to quit school and stay home to take care of our younger brothers and sister s. You are very interested in studying - what is the best way to address this problem? (ii) An uncle comes to meet you at an untimely hour and you are uncertain of what his intentions are. What is the best way to resolve the problem? (iii) A friend asks you to distract the shop keeper so that he can steal something from the shop. What should you do? (iv) You are walking home from school - it is a very hot day. A stranger comes by and offers you a ride on his motorcycle (or a neighbour offers you a ride on his motorcycle). You are not sure of his intentions. What should you do? (v) You are driving with a friend and you meet with an accident. Your friend is hurt and is bleeding. What will you do? (vi) A friend has invited you to sm oke cigarettes. What will you do? (vii) A friend has asked you to steal mangoe s from another house. What should you do? (viii) You are taking an examination and your friend sitting behind is asking you to show your answer sheet to her fo r copying. What will you do? (ix) You are being bullied ever yday by your classmate in the school. What will you do? (b) Step - 2 . Tell the participants that everyone face s problems during all stages of their lives. Everyone must, therefore, make decisions and find solutions, but in order to make good decisions, we must practice - so that when we encounter that situation or similar sit uation we are prepared to handle it. 169 (c) Step - 3 . Divide the participants in small groups of 4-6 each and have each of the group pick one scenario (as given in Step-1 or a sc enario mentioned by the participants). When the groups have selected the situations, ask them to brainstorm and then prepare a role-play to enact the decision they have taken - one good de cision, and one decision which has negative consequences. (d) Step - 4 . Invite each group to present its role-play with the good and bad effects. Observe the participants' skills in problem solvi ng, i.e. analysing the situation and coming up with possible methods to solve the problem, eval uating the advantages and disadvantages to each method, and choosing the most appropriate method and reviewing the result. (e) Step - 5 . Remind the participants that everyone should keep an open mind during the discussion, listen to the presentation and learn from the suggestions of others. (f) Step - 6 . Also initiate a discussion based on following questions:- (i) What are the steps to problem solving? (ii) Do you think it is better for you to make your own decisions or to have someone else (parents, siblings, friends) make decisions for you? Why? (iii) Are there any problems that you cannot solve and need to take the help of another person? Why? (iv) Who are you able to tell your problems to? 17. Problems are not to be avoided or feared. Problems are part of life, and are there for us to solve, not evade. Problems left unsolved can bring mental stress and eventually affect our health. Problem solving skills empower us not only to confront our prob lems, but can in fact turn them into opportunities. CONCLUSION 18. Problems are not to be avoided or feared. Problems ar e part of life, and are ther e for us to solve, not evade. Problems left unsolved can bring mental stress and eventually affect our health. Problem solving skills empower us not only to confront our problems, but in fact turn them into opportunities. Whenever required cadets can take help from their trusted adul ts and friends in understanding their problem better and working at appropriate solution. 170 LESSON PLAN : PDLS - 8 EFFECTIVE USE OF TIME Period - Two Type - Lecture, Discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Pointer, Charts, Black Board and Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Essentials of Time Management - 20 Min (c) Time Wasters - 20 Min (d) Principles of Time Management - 30 Min (e) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION We all have one thing in common a 24 hour day. It is how we use our time that makes the difference. 3. Time is money because it is the only one you ca n't reorder or renew. Time is irreplaceable and irreversible. Few things are more important to us than learning how to save time and how to spend it wisely. Paradoxically, to save time you must spend time. Bo th time and money are lim ited resources. Therefore time (like money) is a valuable commodity. It cannot be borrowed, saved or squandered. Time is patently not money. You can make money; you can't make time. An old Chinese proverb says. An inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time. Time is really infinitely more precious than money. AIM 4 To acquaint the cadets about the E ffective Use of Time and its Management. PREVIEW 5 The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Essentials of Time Management. (b) Part II - Time-Wasters. (c) Part III - Principles of Time Management. PART I : ESSENTIALS OF TIME MANAGEMENT 6 Time management is a set of skills, tools, and systems that work together to help you get more value out of your time and use it to accomplish what you want. Successful people use time management to achieve outstanding results, both personally and professionally. The key to time management is to realize that you cannot possibly do everyt hing that there is to do; instead, you have to prioritise what you are going to do with the limited time that you have at your dispos al. Look in a mirror and you will see your biggest time waster. Until you come to grips with that rea lity, your personal time problems will remain. 7. Time management helps you to: - (a) Reduce or eliminate wasted time and effort so you'll have more productive time each day. 171 (b) Improve your productivity so you c an accomplish more with less effort. (c) Focus your time and energy on what is most important and make time for the things you want and value. Thus help you fi nd greater balance and fulfillment. (d) Improve your performance while reducing stress. (e) Set and achieve your long-term goals. PART II : TIME WASTERS 8. Time is like a precious jewel. It must be guar ded well and worn with discretion or you will suddenly realize that it has been stolen. Major time-wasters are:- (a) Mobile phone . Learn to control the mobile phone, or it will control you. Regard your mobile phone as a business tool, not a social one. Prac tice having quick, to the point conversations. (b) Visitors . When faced with the question: Have you got a minute? Don't fall into the courtesy trap of saying yes when you really want to say no. Learn to give a polite no, and then tell them when they can see you. A complete open door policy, which has been popular for some years, is not conducive to good time management. Try some of these techniques if a visitor overstays their time:- (i) At the finish of work, stand up. (ii) Let the visitor see you by looking at your watch, or your body language. (iii) Don't make eye contact with the chat ty one. Keep your head down and continue working. (c) Paper . The best guideline for paperwork is to either file it or toss it. We never use80% of the paperwork we keep. Computer printers produ ce over two and a half million pieces of paper every minute throughout the world. (i) Try, where possible, to make a decision about each piece of paper when you first handle it. (ii) Don't handle your daily mail until you are r eady to deal with it properly. If you take a quick look and then go back to it later, you've just doubled those minutes. (iii) Learn to read selectively. (iv) Learn to throw out what you probably won't need. (d) Lack of Planning and Fire Fighting . The best way to avoid crises is to anticipate them. Common reasons are lack of planning, unrealistic ti me frames, and reluctance by subordinates to break bad news. Tips to help you deal with the situation:- (i) Firstly, take time to think. Then ask questions. What is the real problem? Where possible, get input from more than one sour ce. What can you ask others to help with? (ii) Once you've made a decision, get on with it. Whoever hesitates is lost! (iii) What can be done to avoid the same problem happening again? (e) Socializing . Avoid extended tea-breaks, regular social lunch-hours, and unnecessary chats in the corridors. (f) Indecision . Caused by ignorance, fear, or lack of confidence in the facts. Improve your fact-finding procedures, and learn to listen to yo ur intuition. If we can learn to make decisions quickly, we save time. Successful people make de cisions quickly. They're not necessarily always right, but they do decide. 172 (g) Whatsapp, TV, Lap top, I Pad, Face book etc can be a huge time wasters. (h) Procrastination . Procrastination, which comes from the Latin word for tomorrow is the world's number one time-waster. Procrastinati on can best be defined as putting off the doing of something that should be done intentionally & habitually. It you suspect that you are prone to procrastination always ask yourself Why am I pu tting this off? If you can see no good reason - and don't confuse reasons with excuses brace yourself a nd take action this day. By off-loading today's work onto tomorrow you are simply storing up work for yourself. Start now by doing something today that you have been putting off. 9. The best tool to fight time-wasters is a firm dec ision to concentrate on the few things that, in a day, will make a long-term difference. People and opportunities waiting to waste our time, surround us. Any activity which is not, in some way, moving you in the direction you wish to go, is a time-wasting activity. PART III : PRINCIPLES OF TIME MANAGEMENT 10. There are some basic principles of time m anagement. These are given in the subsequent paras. 11. Develop a Personal Sense of Time . Make sure you know where your time goes. Don't depend on memory, it's treacherous. Put time under the microscope. You cannot manage time that is past. But you can examine how you managed it in an objective and realistic way. 12. Identify Long-Term Goals . The foundation of good time management is to first, find out what matters deeply to you - what it is you really want to achieve in life. Spend time on considering what are your own personal values? What really matters to you at this stage of your life? Remember, they must be your values no-one else's. In this, concentrate on f our key areas of your life - Self and Well being, Community and Humanity, Home and Family and Business and Career. 13. Concentrate on High Return Activities . In any organisation there are a few basic functions, which are central to its effective functioning. For a classroom teacher the high-return activity will be enabling the children to learn well. For a principal it will be empowering staff to be effective teachers by having a smoothly running school. Therefore, identify which activities are going to give you the highest return and concentrate on them. 14. Weekly and Daily Planning . Traditional time management teaching talks of daily planning, so why change?. If we mainly focus on our daily scheduli ng, we're looking at what's under our nose and we tend to become immersed in the urgent. Hence, from our monthly goals and objectives, plan a weekly focus. Planning on a weekly basis helps us to take better control of our lives. 15. Make the Best Use of Your Best Time . The quality of your attention or concentration varies at different times. You may notice that you habitually tend to be more mentally alert, at certain times of the day. 20 % of your time produces 80% of your high-quality output. The most important tasks in a day only take about 20 percent of our time and will make 80 percent of the difference to the smooth running of things. So, ma ke sure that you manage well that critical 20% of your time. Learn to focus on the vital few th ings which will make a long-term difference. 16. Make Use of Committed Time . You may sometimes complain that you lack time. But you have all the time there is for you. At work there is time wh ich you can choose to spend as, committed time. If you are alert you may find portions of it, which are actually free time. Think of an example of committed time in the last week, where you found unexpectedly that you had at least half an hour to spare. What did you do with it? Could you have put that time to better use? What w ould you need to have had with you in order to do so? 17. Manage Your Health . (a) Even a few weeks off being avoidably ill is going to involve you in a major waste of productive time. Depending on the nature of your illness, you may be able to use it in some constructive way. To give to your work and to others high quality time you must top up your energy levels. 173 (b) Do you get enough sleep? The norm is eight ho urs, slightly less as you grow older. You can function on much less, but your creativity is 15% down. Do you apply common sense to diet? The Golden rule is moderation in all things. Do you take exercise? Do you take holidays? Remember that you can do a full year's work in 11 months, bu t you cannot do it in 12 months. It is a good idea to spend some time just meditating. CONCLUSION 18. Time management should be fun. Keep it as si mple as possible. The good news is that you will never meet the perfect time manager. You are probably very good - now you could be better. The wonderful thing is that tomorrow's 24 hours now await you untouched and unwasted. You are now in a position to make more effective use of your time. Always remember, NOW is the keyword of time management. If you want to reap in the future, you have to sow now. And, Your Time Starts Now'! 174 LESSON PLAN : PDLS - 8 SOCIABILITY: SOCIAL SKILLS ETTIQUETTES AND MANNERS Period - Two Type - Lecture, Discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1 Computer slides, Pointer, Charts, Black Board and Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Etiquette & Types of Etiquette - 25 Min (c) Manners - 25 Min (d) How to improve Social Skills - 20 Min (e) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Etiquette, the manners and forms prescribed by custom, usage, or authority and accepted when people deal with each other, as correct or proper behav ior. Etiquette is necessary to have an effective and well groomed personality. It is considered as an everlasting impression on the people you meet.

To acquaint the cadets with the importance of Etiquettes and Manners in social life and how to improve social skills as NCC Cadets. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Types of Etiquettes. (b) Part II - Manners. (c) Part III - How to improve Social Skills. PART I : TYPES OF ETIQUETTE 6. Etiquette is a code of behaviour that delineat es expectations for social behavior according to contemporary conventional norms within a society, social class, or group. Rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of social interaction in any society. The various types of etique ttes are discussed below:- 7. Types of Etiquettes . (a) Social Etiquette . Social etiquette is how to behave in the society. (b) Bathroom Etiquette .

(c) Etiquette is essential for an everlasting fi rst impression. The way you interact with your superiors, parents, fellow work ers, friends speak a lot about your personality and up bringing. (d) Etiquette enables the individuals to earn respect and appreciation in the society. No one would feel like talking to a person who does not know how to speak or behave in the society. Etiquette inculcates a feeling of trust and lo yalty in the individuals. One becomes more responsible and mature. Etiquette helps individuals to value relationships. PART II : MANNERS 9. Some of the manners we've learned from ou r parents and teachers who try and implant us the importance of being well-mannered. At some point, our manners are categorized as good or bad depending on the society we live in and on the environment we grew in. Here's a list of some very poor manners we observe a lot (actually there's a lot more of them): (a) Eating with your mouth open. (b) Making loud noise and slurping sound while eating. (c) Picking your nose in the public. (d) Biting nails. (e) Spitting in the public. (f) Coughing and yawning and without covering your mouth. (g) Sneezing without covering your nose. (h) Acting rude and vulgar jokes in front of lady colleagues. (j) Not saying please and thank you. (k) Not saying - excuse me when trying to get pass someone. (l) Ridiculing someone for his physical limitations and shortcomings. (m) Smoking at prohibited places. (n) Barging on someone's room without permission. (o) Not saying-sorry when you bump into somebody. 176 10. Having good manners is not just about blending wi th the best; rather it is more about considering the feelings of others and taking responsibility. Take for ex ample when you eat in the restaurant or in public places, try not to chew with one's mouth open. The unpl easant sound and scene is repelling for others. In public speaking, we must not interrupt when he/she is talking. It is considered highly ill-mannered if you do not complete his sentence. These are just so me of the things we should avoid doing. PART III : HOW TO IMPROVE SOCIAL SKILLS 11. They say, a human being is a social animal, but the question is, does everyone possess social skills? Most of the people do not know the art of spea king. While some are just inept and incompetent, there are others who lack confidence and yet others wh o do not have mannerism and etiquettes. Having sound social skills is extremely important in the present times, given to the fact that interaction and conversation forms the basis for everything we do. If you also face di fficulty in interacting, remember, it is not the end of the world. You can improve your soci al skills by just putting in a little effort. However, you cannot be perfect overnight. It would take some time. Following ar e few tips on how to improve social skills. 12. Improving Social Skills (a) Be Yourself . Only when you are your own self do you feel comfortable. And it is when you are in utmost comfort that you indulge in free conversation and interaction. Do not change your inner self for anything in the world. Remember , humans have this innate quality of discovering whether a person is real or fake. In case y ou pretend to be someone you are not, you would be lonelier than ever before. (b) Be Responsible . One of the vital components of social interaction is to know that art of carrying yourself. It is very important for you to know what to do and how to behave in a social gathering. A person behaving in an undesirable an d unacceptable manner is usually avoided by people. So, be responsible for your actions and act according to the situation. (c) Be Open & Approachable . Imagine talking to a person who is an absolute introvert or extrovert! Extremes of personality often turn off people. Ideally, you should have a fusion of both the characters. While being too shy and withdrawn is enough to repel people immediately, being too loud and outgoing would not do much good eit her. Just strike a delicate balance between both the personalities and you would be t he star of the social gathering. (d) Be Attentive . The art of listening is a stepping ston e for conversation and interaction. Alas! Not many have it in them. If you would hav e attended a social gathering, you will know that everyone wants to talk, but no one is ready to liste n. So, the trick is to be an attentive listener and people would definitely talk to you. Also, do not interru pt or chip in a piece of advice or suggestion just when the other person is in the middle of a subject. (e) Be Polite . Being humble and down-to-earth is an excellent way to break the ice. It sheds off all the apprehensions and nervousness and gives a good impression. It would speak miles about your manners, personality and confidence . Apart from being polite, it is also advisable to be diplomatic. While being honest and forthright definitely pays, sugar-coating the truth is very necessary at times. (f) Be Aware . It is very important to be aware and observant of people's behavior. For instance, watch if the person you are talking to is comfortable with the specific topic. If he looks uncomfortable or is simply disinterested, just mo ve on to the next topic. In case he/she is not interested in talking to you completely, the best bet would be to move out of the scene. (g) Be Cautious . It is advisable to keep your sens es active. Do not shut your eyes, close your ears and numb your senses at the time of interacting. Keep a keen eye on who are your friends and who are your enemies. Do not conf ront everything to someone you have just met. CONCLUSION 13. The point of etiquette is not, of course, t he rules themselves but the comfort of the people concerned. Exhibiting bad manners and \"I don't care a damn\" attitude are the ones who are the social outcast. Manners that put a strain on others are no t good manners, no matter whose rules they follow. Remember, having good manners and etiquette can gravitate ever ybody towards you. 177 SUMMARY \u00be Personality Development means enhancing and grooming one's outer and inner self to bring about a positive change to your life which includes bo osting one's confidence, improving communication and language speaking abilities, widening ones scope of knowledge, developing certain hobbies or skills, learning fine etiquettes and manners, adding style and grace to the way one looks, talks and walks and overall imbibing oneself with pos itivity, liveliness and peace. \u00be Personality is the characteristics and pattern s of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, which make a person exceptional, one of a kind and exclusive to his or herself.

Leadership is infl uencing the thoughts and actions of other people. Everybody can improve his/her leadership skills by little thinking and practice. 7. Any leader will have certain distinguishing qualities demonstrated in daily activities that help him to earn respect, confidence, willing obedience and loyal co operation of his fellow beings. These qualities are best developed at young age. The effectiveness of l eadership can be measured from the amount of influence he is able to exert on the activities of a group towards a specific goal.

The following time plan will be followed:- (a) Introduction - 05 mins (b) Definition of motivation - 15 mins (c) Factors which motivate - 15 mins (d) Conclusion - 05 mins INTRODUCTION 3. Leadership helps the individuals to achiev e a goal while motivation is the willingness of the individual to stay with task until it is complete. Throughout the ages, we have examples of leaders and groups performing well beyond their known capabilities under the most difficult conditions. We read and hear of leaders exhorting their men to perform tasks which appear to be almost impossible. How did these leaders motivate their followers to accomplish tasks which were so difficult? AIM 4. To acquaint cadets the means adopted by leader s to motivate their followers to accomplish a task. PREVIEW 5. This lecture will be conducted in two parts:- (a) Part I - Definition of Motivation (b) Part II - Factors which Motivate PART I : DEFINITION 6. \"Motivation is the commitment and urge with in a member which makes him accomplish his task under all situations without thinking about the cost\" 7. A good leader understands this basic trut h and devices ways and means to keep his entire team always motivated. In a game of football or social se rvices field work, each member's motivation level is important for achieving the overall stated goals of the group. The urge or the force that motivates an individual comes from within. It is his will alone wh ich pushes him to the limits of his capabilities. PART II : FACTORS WHICH MOTIVATE 8. A study of human history has given us thr ee factors which help motivate any person. These are:- (a) Material Factors. (b) Intellectual Factors. (c) Spiritual Factors. 9. These factors generate pride in and team spirit in one's group. We shall look at each in some detail. 188 Material Factors 10. Material Factors are resources which are required to establish, maintain and enhance the basic quality of the life of the team and fu rtherance of their goals. A football t eam will require good and sufficient quantity of football boots, quality grounds, funds, kits for players etc. On ce the team is provided with the resources, the motivation level of members goes up .Lets consider an example. 11. Kitting Of RDC Contingent . Participation in Republic Day Camp is a prestigious honor for any NCC cadet .The Inter Directorate competition held in Delhi requires that the teams go well prepared and with maximum of resources. Some of the state Direct orates go out of their way to provide all the support and resources required by the contingent which invariabl y increases the motivation level of these teams .It has been seen that those Directorates who provide all the material resources have performed better in the Inter Directorate competitions. Intellectual Factors 12. These factors make an individual proud of his/her group and motivate other members to perform better in difficult situations. Let's look at few examples. 13. Malala, an International Activist . Malala Yousafzai, a girl born in a small village in Pakistan is an international activist for girls education. Her courag e, determination and zeal for her cause made her an international youth icon. She was shot in the head by Taliban for speaking against the ban against girl education and destroying schools in the region. With gr eat efforts of number of countries and individuals she recovered fully after long period of treatment. It made her doubly determined to fight for the education rights of girl students across muslim world. 14. She founded Malala Education Fund and opened a school for Syrian refugee girls in Lebanon. Pakistani citizens came out in support of her forc ing the Pakistani government to ratify the Right to Education bill. For her courage, bravery and zeal, she became youngest recipient of Nobel Peace Prize in October, 2014. Her acts of courage and selfless service have motivated million across the globe to emulate her feat. 15. Leadership Traits Shown by Malala . (a) Courage . She had the courage to speak against Taliban ban against girls going to school. Despite being threatened by them many time s, she did not stop studying or preparing for exams. (b) Determination .

She garnered support for her goal wherever she went and met famous personalities like Ban Ki Moon, Queen Elizabeth, Barack Obama etc. On her insistence, Pakistan government opened two senior secondary schools and a college in her area. 16. Case study of Tarh Peeju, Recipient of National Bravery Award . On May 19, 2016, 9-year- old Tarh Peeju attempted saving her friends Phassang Marry and Tarh Charu when they were trying to cross Pachin River at Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh. A student of class fourth at Alphabet Public School in Nirjuli, Tarh immediately jumped into the turbulent river and dragged both Marry and Charu to safety. While doing so she herself got entrapped by the st rong current and was dragged inside a whirlpool. She was swept downstream and drowned by the strong current of the river. For displaying unbelievable courage, sacrificing her own life in saving her frie nds, Tarh Peeju was conferred the National Bravery Award, the top National Br avery Award posthumously. 17. Some of the qualities of leadership exhibited by Tarh Peeju are: (a) Alertness . Tarh Peeju's alert mind helped her take quick action to save two human lives. (b) Courage . Jumping into the river was exceptional act of courage. (c) Sacrifice . Tarh Peeju saw her friends drowning and could not stop herself. She saved the life of her friends by riski ng and sacrificing her own life. 189 (d) Initiative . Peeju took the initiative and quickly reacted to what was to be done, without wasting time. Spiritual Factors 18. Our soul offers the highest inspiration for our extr a ordinary feats. It is the only factor which sustains a man when all hope is lost. The spiritual factor stems fr om group identity, pride in the group, team spirit, history and positive aspects of religion. 19. Religion has played an important role in motivating men. Alexander's men imagined they were playing the role of their many gods during his con quests. Krishna's advice to Arjun on the battlefield of Kurukshetra is a soul-stirring speech. Even today it insp ires and motivates men to war. It is the victory of the spirit which has led many physically and mentally challenged persons to take part and excel in various sports and other physical activities. CONCLUSION 20. There are three factors namely Material, Intellect ual and Spiritual factors, which motivate an individual to go beyond his limits and do something which seems impossible otherwise. Motivation is an unseen force from within which makes a person to impr ove his performance beyond his normal limits. 190 LESSON PLAN: L- 4 CASE STUDIES ON EFFECTS OF LEADERSHIP IN NCC Period - Two Type - Lecture cum Discussion Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

Computers slides, pointer, black board and chalk. Time plan 2. The following time plan will be followed:- (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Early Life. - 20 Min (c) Subhash Chandra Bose and the INA. - 25 Min (d) Leadership Qualities. - 25 Min (e) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Subhash Chandra Bose, popularly known as 'NETAJ I', occupies a honoured place in the history of Indian independence movement. He was a man of great courage, a single minded and dedicated leader who was an icon of patriotism. He wanted to free Indi a from British yoke, not by peaceful agitation or petitioning, but by waging an open war. He did so by escaping from India, organizing an army of Indian nationals and fighting like Mazzini and Garibaldi of Ita ly which is rarely seen in the annals of liberation movement all over the world. 4. Subhash Chandra Bose was one of the most visi onary and fierce leaders of the pre independence era, for he followed a path which no one could even have imagined. An unparallel example of the declaration of Independent Indian government with a cabi net and its own army was seen in form of the Indian National Army. Under his char ismatic leadership he organized a m ilitary attack on the British India and had pushed them till Imphal. AIM 5. To acquaint the cadets with the l eadership qualities of Subhash Chandra Bose. PREVIEW 6. The lesson will be covered in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Early Life. (b) Part II - Subhash Chandra Bose and the INA. (c) Part III - Leadership Qualities. PART I - EARLY LIFE 7. Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 18 97 in Cuttack as the ninth child among fourteen of Shri Janakinath Bose, an advocate and Smt Prab havati Devi, a pious and God fearing lady. A brilliant student, he topped the matriculation examination of Calc utta province and passed his BA in philosophy from the Presidency College in Calcutta. Remembered fo r his fiery speeches which mobilized masses, this leader was a great orator and had started a debating club in his college saying that India in her forthcoming struggle would need great debaters and parliamentarians. He tried to promote quick thinking and self reliance among his colleagues. 201 8. He was strongly influenced by Swami Vivekanand a's teachings and was known for his patriotic zeal as a student. His parents' wishes kept him away from the freedom struggle and send him for higher studies for the Indian Civil Services in England. Although he fini shed those examinations on t op of his class (fourth), he could not complete his apprenticeship and returned to India, being deeply disturbed by the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. He came under the influence of Maha tma Gandhi and joined the Indian National Congress. Gandhiji directed him to work with Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, the Bengali leader whom Bose acknowledge as his 'Guru'. 9. Bose was outspoken in his anti - British stance and was jailed 11 times between 1920 and 1941 for periods varying between six months to three years. He was the leader of the youth wing of the Congress party, in the forefront of the trade union movement in India and organized 'Service league', another wing of congress. He was admired for his great skills in organization development. 10. Bose advocated complete freedom for India at the earliest, whereas the congress committee wanted it in phases, through a Dominion status. Other younger leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru supported Bose and finally at the historic Lahore Congress co nvention, the Congress had to adopt 'Poorna Swaraj' (complete freedom)as its motto. Bhagat Singh's martyrdom and the inability of the Congress leaders to save his life infuriated Bose and he started a movement opposing the Irvin-Gandhi peace pact. He was imprisoned and expelled from India. But defying the ban he came back to India and was imprisoned again. 11. He was elected president of the Indian National Congress twice ie 1937 and 1939, the second time defeating the nominee of Gandhiji. He brought a resolution to give the British six months to hand India over to the Indians, failing which there would be a revolt. There was much opposition to his rigid stance and he resigned from the post of the president and formed a progressive group known as the 'Forward Block' in 1939. Subhash Chandra Bose was against the British invo lving India in the Second World War. He started a mass movement against utilizing Indian resources and men for the Great War. To him, it made no sense to further bleed poor Indians for the sake of colonial powers. There was tremendous response to his call and the British promptly imprisoned him. He took to hunger strike and after 11 days of fasting, his deteriorating health made the British free him. However he was placed under house arrest. The British were afraid of violent reaction s in India, should anything happen to Subhash Chandra Bose. PART II - NETAJI AND INA 12. Bose suddenly disappeared in the beginning of 1941 and it was not until many days that authorities realized that Bose was not inside the house they were guarding. He traveled by foot, car and train and resurfaced in Kabul (now in Afghanistan), only to di sappear once again. Finally he reached Germany where with the help of the German army, he raised an Indian Legion and started broadcasting anti British speeches. From a secret radio station known as t he 'Azad Hind Radio, he urged the people to rise and revolt against the British. He coined the term 'Jai Hind 'as greeting which is very popular these days. His legion called him 'Netaji' or the revered leader. Bose's sensational escape and his broadcasts from Berlin stirred the people of India into action. In Nov 1941, his broadcast from German radio sent shock waves among the British and electrified the Indian masses w ho realized that their leader was working on a master plan to free their motherland. It also gave fresh conf idence to the revolutionaries in India who were challenging the British in many ways. Netaji met the war leaders Hitler and Mussolini, besides their commanders from whom he sought help for liberating India. 13. The Axis powers assured Bose help to fight the British. Japan by that time had grown into another strong world power occupying key colonies of Dutch, French and British in Asia. Bose had struck alliance with Germany and Japan. He rightly fe lt that his presence in the East would help his countrymen in freedom struggle and hence decided to shift his base to Japan. 14. In the beginning of 1943, a most hazardous jour ney was undertaken by him under water, covering thousands of miles, crossing en territories. He was in the Atlantic, the Middle East, Madagascar and the Indian Ocean. Battles were being fought over land, in the air and there were mines in the sea. At one stage he traveled 400 miles in a rubber dingy to reach a Ja panese submarine, which took him to Tokyo. He was warmly received in Japan and was declared the head of the Indian Army, which consisted of 40,000 soldiers from Singapore and other eastern regions. Bo se called it the Indian National Army (INA) and a government by the name \"AZAD HIND GOVERNMENT\" was declared on 21 Oct 1943. INA freed Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British and was renamed 'Swaraj' and 'Shaheed' islands. 15. Bose wanted to free India from the eastern front. He had taken care that Japanese interference was not present from any angle. Army leadership, admin istration and communication were managed by Indians only. The INA was structured into three Brigades na mely - 'Subhash', 'Azad', and 'Gandhi'. INA marched through Burma and occupied Coxtown on the Indian bor der. They were determined to drive the British out 202 of India. However the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagas aki changed the history of mankind. Japan had to surrender. Bose was in Singapore at that time and decided to go to Tokyo to plan the next move. Unfortunately there has been no trace of him from that point. He was just 48 and his death or disappearance continues to be a mystery. PART III - LEADERSHIP QUALITIES 16. The effect of a leader can be measured by t he amount of influence he is able to exert on the activities of a group in an effort to move towards a pre-determined goal. The fact that Subhash Chandra Bose could raise a voluntary army in itself without an y material resources speaks volumes of his effective leadership. Certain qualities which made him a leader unique in himself and endearing to the masses are enumerated below:- Alertness 17. Subhash Chandra Bose was mentally alert and al ways exploited the limited opportunities that came his way. One such event was the formation of the 'A zad Hind Fauj'. Netaji observed that some Indian POW's are being brought to radio department to listen to the BBC and other stations which sent out their programs in Hindustani and were translating the same for Germans. It occurred to him, that these people could be motivated to form a national militia, which he accomplished through persuasion of the German authorities and by motivating the POW's. Courage 18. Netaji had ample physical and moral courage. He disp layed physical courage a number of times, but the most significant incident was undertaking the most per ilous journey ever undertaken by man; a submarine voyage through thousands of miles of mine infested wate rs all the way from Germany to Japan crossing the Atlantic. He was transferred from one submarine to anot her which in itself was hazardous. Moral courage was displayed time and again when Subhash Chandra Bo se stood by his decision, be it his anti British stance for which he was jailed 11 times betwe en 1920 and 1941 or opposing Congress leaders who advocated a milder approach of revolting against British rule. Initiative 19. Subhash Chandra Bose was a natural leader. He took the lead and initiative whether it was college activities or politics. He took initiative and started a debating club in his college with a thought that 'India in her forthcoming struggle would need great debaters and parliamentarians'. Knowledge 20. He was a brilliant student, having topped the matricul ation examination of Calcutta Province. He also cleared the Indian civil services and moved to Englan d for further studies .He also had immense knowledge of freedom struggles in other parts of the world from which he drew lessons as far as the Indian struggle was concerned. Esprit-de-Corps 21. Subhash Chandra Bose laid a lot of importance on team spirit and camaraderie. He always made it a point to be with his troops as much time as possible .He made sure he shared their agonies and sorrow and not just happiness. In one instance he ordered his personal physician to go forward to Imphal to treat the INA soldiers even when he was not keeping good health. Humility 22. A simple man with high ideals, he, despite having a huge mass following never behaved or felt as a special person. He could mingle with the common man and a royalty alike. He was accessible to one and all. CONCLUSION 23. The Indian people were so much enamored of Bose 's oratory skills and leadership qualities, that he became a legend. Many people still do not believe that he died in the plane crash. Bose also raised an army of women called the Rani of Jhansi regiment, a Balak sena. For him there was no difference between a man and a woman, the spirit was what mattered. While Bose's approach to Indian freedom continues to generate heated debate in our society, there is no denying of his burning patriotism, his tireless efforts to free India from inside and outside and his reckless advent ures in trying to reach his goals. His exploits later became a legend due to many stories carried by the disbanded INA soldiers who came from every nook and corner of our great country. 203 LESSON PLAN: L-8 LEADERSHIP CASE STUDIES- II MOHANDAS KARA MCHAND GANDHI Period - Two Type - Lecture Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

The following time plan will be followed:- (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Early Life. - 20 Min (c) Gandhi and the Freedom movement - 20 Min (d) Leadership Qualities. - 30 Min (e) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma or \"Great Soul\" was a hero, as well as a political and spiritual leader of India. Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, in the present state of Gujarat. Gandhi was brought up in India near Rajkot, where he did most of his studies. In 1888, Gandhi went to London, leaving his wife and son behind, to pursue his degree in law. Later in 1893, he went to South Africa to work and found that there was lot of prejudice towards Indians. That was when he began protesting and eventually became an inspiring hero for millions. 4. Gandhi fought for India's independence by using non-violent means of resi stance. He thought there was injustice being done to the Indians by the British. The three main qualities that define Gandhi as a hero are his strong leadership, simplicity and bravery. G andhi first experienced racial discrimination, and prejudice directed at Indians and the injustice imposed on them. This encouraged him to work for the Indian people in South Africa. His idea of non-violence and peaceful agitation came to be known as Satyagraha which forced the British to leave India. AIM 5. To acquaint the cadets with t he leadership qualities of Mahatma Gandhi PREVIEW 6. The lesson will be covered in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Early Life. (b) Part II - Gandhi and the Freedom movement (c) Part II - Leadership Qualities. PART I - EARLY LIFE 7. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was the Diwan (Prime Minister) of Porbander st ate, a small princely state in the Kathiawar Agency of British India. 8. On 4 September 1888, less than a month sh y of his 19th birthday, Gandhi traveled to London, England, to study law at University College and to trai n as a barrister. His time in London, the Imperial capital, was influenced by a vow he had made to his mo ther in the presence of the Jain monk, upon leaving India, to observe the Hindu beliefs of ke eping away from meat, alcohol, and immorality. 204 9. His attempts at establishing a law practice in Mumbai failed. Later, after failing to secure a part-time job as a high school teacher, he ended up returning to Ra jkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, a business he was forced to close when he fac ed problems of a British officer. In April 1893, he accepted a year-long contract from Dada Abdulla & Co., an Indian firm, to a post in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, then part of the British Empire. 10. In South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination di rected at Indians. He was thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to mo ve from the first class to a third class coach while holding a valid first class ticket. Traveling farther on by stagecoach he was beaten by a driver for refu sing to travel on the foot board to make room for a European passenger. These events were a turning poi nt in his life, awakening him to social injustice and influencing his subsequent social activism. PART II: GANDHI AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT 11. In 1915, Gandhi returned from South Africa to live in India. He spoke at the conventions of the Indian National Congress, but was primarily introduc ed to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a respected leader of the Congress Party at the time. 12. In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, Gandhi was invited by the Viceroy to a War Conference in Delhi. Perhaps to show his suppor t for the Empire and help his case for India's independence, Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort. 13. In 1918, in Champaran, a distri ct in state of Bihar, tens of t housands of landless and poor farmers were forced to grow indigo and other cash crops inst ead of the food crops neces sary for their survival. Gandhi proposed Satyagraha - non-violence, mass civil disobedien ce. While it was strictly non-violent, Gandhi was proposing real action, a real revolt that the oppressed people of India were dying to undertake. His sathyagraha came to a halt when he was arrested by police on the charge of creating unrest and was ordered to leave the province. 14. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, havi ng served only 2 years. Without Gandhi's uniting personality, the Indian National Congress began to splinter during his years in prison, splitting into two. Furthermore, cooperati on among Hindus and Muslims, which had been strong at the height of the non-violence ca mpaign, was breaking down. 15. After long deliberations, Gandhi declared that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom, while that freedom was d enied to India itself. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, drafting a resolution calling for the British to Quit India . This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revo lt aimed at securing the British exit from India. 16. When the moment of freedom came, on 15 Augu st 1947, Gandhi was nowhere to be seen in the capital, though Nehru and the entire Constituent Assemb ly were to salute him as the architect of Indian independence, and as the 'Father of the Nation' . 17. Gandhi, quite characteristically, refused additional security, and no one could defy his wish to be allowed to move around unhindered. In the early evening hours of 30 January 1948, Gandhi met with India's Deputy Prime Minister and hi s close associate in the freedom struggle, Vallabhai Patel, and then proceeded for his prayers. Gandhi commenced his walk towards the garden where the prayer meeting was held. As he was about to mount the steps of the podi um, Gandhi folded his hands and greeted his audience with a 'namaskar'; at that moment, a young man came up to him; Nathuram Godse bent down in the gesture of an obeisance, took a revolver out of his pocket, and shot Gandhi three times in his chest. PART III - LEADERSHIP QUALITIES Faith in Self 18. Mahatma Gandhi wasn't a great orator, didn't have a very attractive physique, lived a life of simplicity and avoided limelight as much as he could, but still he is regarded as one of the greatest persons to have ever walked on earth. The reason is that he always believed in himself. He believed that he has a great responsibility to free his country and he had complete faith in himself. He knew he'd to play a significant role in the freedom of India and so he did. His faith in himself triggered the faith of millions of Indians in him. 205 Resistance and Persistence 19. It was very tough to lead a huge country such as India that too with non-violence mantra and against the violent and cruel British army. Gandhi wa s beaten a lot of times, a lot of times he was left alone, bleeding and lying on the ground and sometimes it seemed that he won't see the sun, next day but each day and each time he faced the opposition, he resisted, he persisted and he got through all the opposition. Forgiveness 20. Mahatma Gandhi was thrown into jail, beaten on the roads; many people conspired about his death and tried to assassinate him. But he forgave them all. He always forgave the people that might have hurt him in any way. Learning from Mistakes 21. Mahatma Gandhi wasn't perfect from the beginning. When he was child, he lied, he stole, and he fought and was too much after material things. But he was honest to admit his mistakes and take recourse correction by elders. He made mistakes throughout his life but he never made the same mistake twice. He learned from his failures and used it as a stepping stone to achieve success. Strength of Character 22. Mahatma Gandhi was a man of great character. He kept himself away from the materialistic desires, always favored the truth and honesty, he condemned violence, he was married but still he was celibate and was himself a pure vegetarian. He was a ce lebrity and was covered on the front-page of all the important newspapers in the world at that time. But still he lived the life of simplicity and discipline. Truthfulness 23. Many may not be aware that before becomi ng a freedom fighter, M.K. Gandhi was actually a lawyer. It is common belief that the profession of law requires much cunni ng and lying but still Gandhi never resorted to lying. He promoted truth throughout his life. He always called truth as his most powerful weapon. CONCLUSION 24. Gandhi without a doubt could inspire and move the masses in India, he could show the common man that even he can make a difference and bring the Br itish Empire to its knees. It was all possible since his leadership was based on self-reliance and non-co operation, something every commoner could adopt and feel that they were a part of freedom struggl e, synergizing the country men. One of the most outstanding qualities of Gandhi which makes him a great transformational leader of modern history was his long term vision, self confidence an d strong principles of righteousness. 206 LESSON PLAN: L-9 LEADERSHIP CASE STUDIES - III P.V SINDHU Period - Two Type - Lecture Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

Since the dawn of civilization, human society, natural environment and disasters have been closely interlinked. Natural disasters and the increasing envi ronment degradation world-wide are serious threats to development. Natural disasters threaten all three di mensions of development to include economic, social and environmental. In the past twenty years, earthquakes, volcanic erupt ions, landslides, floods, tropical storms, droughts and other natural disa sters have killed over three million people, inflicted injury, disease, homelessness and misery on one billion others, and caused billions of dollars of material damage. Ninety percent of the natural disasters and Ninety five percent of the total disaster-rela ted deaths world-wide, occur in the developing countries. 4. Definition of Disaster . The term disaster is commonly used to denote any odd event 'natural or manmade' which brings about a lot of misery to a regi on and it becomes difficult to cope with the situation through local resources. As per W.H.O. \"A Disaster can be defined as any occurrence that causes damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, deterioration of health and health services on a scale, sufficient to warrant an extraordinary response from out side the affected community or area\".

Landslides usually consist of falling rocks and sliding earth in addition to failure in the Earth's surface. 10. Earthquakes . Earthquakes are one of the many po werful natural disasters caused when there is a shift, collision, or sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust. Sometimes ca lled tremors and temblors, earthquakes usually occur on the boundaries of, or near, the lines where the Earth's tectonic plates collide and slide past each other. Volcano Eruption Landslide Earthquake Tsunami Flood Cyclone Drought Hurricane 11. Tsunamis . Tsunami is a Japanese word meaning harbor wave. Tsunamis usually take place in the ocean, but can also occur in large lakes. Caused by an underwater earthquake, volcano, landslide, or other type of explosion, tsunamis are giant waves that can destroy entire cities. Tsunamis can range anywhere from a few inches to several yards high. 12. Hurricanes . Sometimes called Tropical Cyclones, Typhoo ns, or Willy-Willies. Hurricanes can rip up trees, destroy crops, and flatten buildings. Torrential rain causes flooding and coastal regions may be swamped by huge waves whipped up by winds that blow as fast as 300 km/h (185 mph). 13. Floods . It can arise from abnormally heavy precipitation, dam failures, rapid snow melting, and river blockages or even by cloud burst water. 14. Droughts . If, over about two weeks, there is less than 0.2 mm of precipitation, there is said to be a drought. Without reservoirs, there is not enough water for people and crops. Some places have extreme drought which lasts for many years. CONCLUSION 15. Natural disasters and the increasing environm ent degradation world-wide are serious threats to development. Natural disasters threaten all three di mensions of development to include economic, social and environmental. Natural calamities have killed millions of people, inflicted injury, disease, homelessness and misery on one billion others. It is therefore important for all of us to be fully aware of the various types of Natural Disasters and take measures to minimize losses of all types. 217 LESSON PLAN: DM-2 ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND THEIR MAINTENANCE Period - One Type - Lecture Term - II (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

NCC can play a significant role in the managemen t of the after effects of natural calamities and disasters. With its organizational capability, strength and quality of it s cadres, involvement of NCC in disaster relief will provide able assistance to the nat ion as well as an avenue to the youth in showing its commitment to the society, play a significant role in forming correct attitudes, feelings of empathy in respect of fellow human beings and also result in pe rsonal growth and improved self image of the cadets. The NCC will in turn benefit immensely with its e nhanced image. Cadets being young and exuberant can be selectively employed through correct selection of areas of intervention. Proper guidance and strict supervision of their activities will ensure succes s of cadets. 4. Some disaster situations may, however, deman d functioning of cadets on their own. It would, however, be preferable to determine their areas of ac tivity and responsibility in any disaster situation beforehand and limit the same to an indirect support role, while the direct in tervention is left to the experts in the field. Ordinarily participation should be restricted to 2nd/3rd year SD/SW cadets only and selection of boys and girls should depend on area and distance from home town. 225 AIM 5. To acquaint the cadets about various Do's and Don'ts for NCC cadets performing disaster management duties. PREVIEW 6. The lecture will be conduct ed in following parts:- (a) Part I - Precautionary measures to be followed by NCC cadets. . (b) Part II - Do's and Don'ts for NCC cadets. PART-I: PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES TO BE FOLLOWED BY NCC CADETS 7. NCC cadets have to perform mu ltifaceted duties during disaster under the guideline of District Disaster Management Authorities. JD/JW cadets ar e young and may not be considered suitable for such operations. SW cadets may be used for softer jobs like providing medical assistance or manning exchanges during strikes of nurses or telephone operators. Only SD cadets may be found suitable for helping in natural calamities like earthquakes, land-slides and floods. 8. Prior to sending the cadets on such tasks, suitable bonds would be required to be obtained from parents of cadets. Cadets are not adequately trained fo r specialized tasks related to Disaster Management. Suitable training must be given to them during institut ional training. Adequate allowances would require to be allocated for the cadets taking part in these activi ties. Joint schemes with the State Disaster Relief machinery would be required to be made in whic h NCC cadets may be incorporated. Adequate signal equipment and other disaster relief equipment would be required to be authorised to NCC to carry out necessary training. NC C cadets would have to carry out rehearsa ls along with the Army, Police, Fire Fighting forces and others in the state. PART-II: DO'S AND DON'TS FOR NCC CADETS 9. Do's and Don'ts . Few Do's and Don'ts instructions to be followed by NCC cadets performing disaster related tasks are given below:- Ser No Do's Don'ts (a) NCC cadets should take all the preventive measures during disaster management Ensure that no cadet will be permitted without the consent bond document from the parents. (b) Assist in Traffic Management under supervision Without adequate signal equipment traffic control should not be operated. (c) First Aid can be given to the rescued people. They should avoid treatment of serious injuries. (d) Help in setting up and administration of Relief Camps. Without suitable training specialized tasks should not be handled by NCC cadets. (e) Distribute the relief material to the affected population for their temporary sustenance. Don't operate away from your group. (f) Manning exchanges during strikes of telephone operators. Cadets should not act as experts as they don't have required technical knowledge. (g) Collect the water containers, food and ordinary and special medicines. Cadets should not indulge in mishandling of water, food and medicines as these are important amenities during disaster. (h) Submit suitable bonds to be obtained from their parents. Avoid risky work during the disaster management. (i) SW cadets may be used for softer jobs like providing medical assistance or manning exchanges. Ensure that SD cadets are not involved directly in the rescue operations. (j) Be prepared for immediate response Cadets should not make unnecessary delays in their 226 response (k) Cadets can mark safe places and make evacuation route chart of the arena. Cadets should not impede rescue operations. (l) Collect data of the injured & casualties Given task should not be neglected. (m) Counteract gossip and rumors to restore the morale of the people Cadets should stay away from gossiping and rumors. (n) Conduct of cultural and recreational activities for victims to boost their morale at later /Land rehabilitation stages. Don't operate without full preparation. (o) Help removal of debris. Cadets should not be involved in removal of toxic material. CONCLUSION 10. A sound disaster prevention and response plan refl ects on the effectiveness of the NCC cadets during the disaster. Suitable training must be given to t hem during institutional training. NCC cadets can effectively assist the state which could take the form of traffic management under supervision, conduct of cultural and recreational activities for victims to bo ost their morale at later or rehabilitation stages, collection, loading and dispatch of medical aid material, food and other articles of relief, help in setting up and administration of relief camps etc. Cadets mu st be well versed with various Do's and Don'ts associated with disaster related tasks. 227 LESSON PLAN: DM-5 FIRE SERVICES AND FIRE FIGHTING Period - Two Type - Lecture Term - II (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Charts, Po inter, Black Board & Chalk. Time plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Causes and Prevention of Fire - 35 Min (c) Fire Fighting - 35 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Fire is a major cause for destruction of prop erty / lives these days. Due to increase in the standard of living, electrical goods, air conditioners and cooking gas are found in most of the houses. Also, due to the influx of multinational companies, most offices, shopping malls and hospitals have air conditioners. With the influx of these electrical ga dgets and cooking gas, occurrences of fire incidents have increased manifold, especially during winters a nd summers. It is therefore essential that everyone should be aware of how to prevent fire hazard s or to provide assistance in firefighting. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the Fire Services and Fire Fighting. PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conducted in following parts:- (a) Part I - Causes and Prevention of fire. (b) Part II - Fire Fighting. PART I: CAUSES AND PREVENTION OF FIRE 6. Fire is the outcome of either heating or over heating of a combustible substance to the required temperature or igniting an inflammable material. The following three elements are essential for creation of fire and its continuation:- (a) Oxygen. (b) Sufficient heat to raise the temperature of fuel to its burning point or ignition temperature. (c) Combustible or burnable material (Solid, Liquid or Gas). 7. It should, therefore, be remembered that three th ings or conditions that necessary to start a fire, fuel (Combustible Material), oxygen (Air) and sufficient Heat to raise t he temperature of the fuel to its burning point are not present at the same place and ti me to prevent out break of any type of fire. Modes of Spread 228 8. The fire spreads by the transmission of heat in one or any combination of the following four ways:- (a) Conduction . Transfer of heat by the intermediary material. Many materials which will not burn easily partic ularly metals are good conductors for tr ansmitting heat. These materials when overheated or heated by the fire, may ignite other combustible material with which these may be in contact e.g. short circuiting of electrical wires due to overloading. (b) Convection . Transfer of heat through gases or smoke. Gases tend to rise until ceiling or roof is reached after which they sp read sideways in a mushroom manner and ignite combustible materials located at higher levels than the original fire e.g. fire spreading onto top floor. The best method to check this is to remove or cool the combustible materials. (c) Radiation . Radiation means transfer of heat from the source of fire, without heating the midway media e.g. air. The effect of radi ation can be countered by forming a water curtain 'between the fire and the object to be protect ed or the object may be removed or cooled. (d) Direct Burning . This phenomenon is self-explanatory. Direct burning is often due to a combination of the above two or three fa ctors viz, conduction, convection and radiation. Prevention of Fire 9. The following measures must be taken to prevent occurrence of fire incidents:- (a) Domestic Fires . (i) Kitchen Fires . These fires can be prevented by following measures:- (aa) Don't keep any inflammable material like petrol, kerosene or clothing near the fire or the gas. (ab) Always check the gas cylinder, gas pipe for leakage. Keep the kitchen well ventilated to prevent leaking gas accumula tion. Switch off the regulator when the gas is not in use. (ac) Before lighting the gas, ensure there is no gas leakage. (ad) Keep children away from gas or fire or stoves. (ae) Before leaving the kitchen, ensure that the gas and kerosene stoves are switched off and there are no burning embers in the 'Chula'. 229 (ii) Other Fires . (aa) Ensure that no electrical circuit is overloaded'. (ab) Ensure that good quality electrical items are used. (ac) Ensure that all electrical gadgets ar e switched off when not in use, e.g. TV, AC, room heater or iron. (ad) Ensure that smokers do not leave any burning cigarettes or stubs in ashtrays near inflammable material (ae) Don't ignite any fire cracker inside the house. (b) Fire in Public Places . (i) Ensure that smokers do not leave any burning cigarettes or stubs in public dustbins or near inflammable material in closed AC offices, shopping malls or cinema halls. (ii) Don't ignite any fire cracker near petrol pumps, in crowded markets, near inflammable material or inside malls. PART-II: FIRE FIGHTING Fire Fighting 10. Fire can be extinguished if any one or more of the three main constituents are removed from the scene of fire. The fire can thus be extinguished by:- (a) Starvation . Starvation means removal of fuel or combustible material and it can be achieved by either segregation of fire and un-burnt fuel by removing either of them e.g. removing un-burnt combustible materials from a room on fire with the help of hook or otherwise or division of a large fire into several smaller ones to prevent the radiated heat from setting alight combustible material at some distance. (b) Cooling . Cooling implies the removal of heat to lower the temperature of burning material to a point below its ignition point. This is usua lly achieved by water. W hen water is poured over a burning material, it absorbs heat, becomes hot and flows away or is converted into steam. The burning substance loses heat to the water and its temperature comes down to below its ignition temperature and so the fire is extinguished. (c) Smothering . Smothering means Choking 'or restricting the supply of Oxygen (Air) to the burning material. This is also called - blanke ting' and is achieved by sealing all the burning material from Oxygen (Air) by covering it with sand/dry earth/ foam or by creating an atmosphere over the fire of heavier than air inert gas. Fire Fighting Parties 11. To carry out the above methods, the fire services and fire parties are organized at the level of every city, town and important establishments. 12. House Fire Parties . It consists of four persons who ca rry stirrup pumps and water buckets. They act as fire watchers and work under the orders of the wardens. They carry one stirrup pump, two buckets, one torch and one hand axe. One steel helmet and one whistle per member are envisaged as personal equipment. 13. Auxiliary Fire Services . This consists of eight persons with Trailer Pump which can throw water at the fire from a distance. The members of this Service are drawn from the Home Guards. 230 Fire Fighting Equipment 14. Fire Fighting Equipment can be divided into the following four categories:- (a) Fire Extinguishers. (b) Stirrup Pumps. (c) Buckets. (d) Fire Beaters and Hooks. 15. Fire Extinguishers . For the convenience of study, these could be grouped as under:- (a) Soda Acid Extinguishers . These fire extinguishers are used for extinguishing fires involving ordinary combustible material, where the c ooling effect is achieved by water or solution containing large percentage of water. Such exti nguishers are conical /c ylindrical in shape. (b) Foam Type or Dry Chemical Powder Extinguishers . These fire extinguishers contain dry chemicals or solution and are exclusively me ant for extinguishing fires involving inflammable liquids such as oils, fats, or grease, where blanke ting the fire to isolate it from Oxygen (Air) is required. (c) CTC Carbon dioxide and Dry Chemical Extinguishers . These fire extinguishers contain chemicals, either liquid, gas or dry, and are mainly used to fight fires involving Live 'electrical equipment' etc. where, the use of an electrically non-conductive extinguishing agent is of most importance. (d) The main advantages of these extinguishers are:- (i) They are easy to operate. (ii) They need only one man to operate and carriage to another place. (iii) They are very useful in the initial stages of fire. (e) The disadvantages of these extinguishers are:- (i) The use is limited as the duration of the working of the extinguishers is approximately one to two minutes. (ii) The cost of thes e extinguishers is high. (iii) These extinguishers require co nstant care and careful maintenance. 231 16. Stirrup Pumps . The stirrup pump is an excellent piece of first aid firefighting equipment designed for use on small fire. It is very useful in localizing and controlling fires with limited water supplies. Water spray from this equipment may be used on small fires for cooling the combustible material or the surrounding of scene of fire. It is generally operated by a team of four members but in an emergency a team of two members can also operate it effectively. The consumption of water is about 3.8 to 5.7 litres per minute. The spray produced by this pump can reach 15 to 20 feet away from the nozzle with water consumption 2.8 litres per minute. 17. Bucket . Buckets are ideal for storing water and sand for fighting small fires. They could be easily carried by one person, from one place to another. 18. Fire Beaters / Hooks . Beaters made of wire net in a rectangular shape and hooks made of iron fitted on bamboo poles are ideal for separating the burning and unbent combustible material, and extinguishing by beating the small fires. CONCLUSION 19. It is extremely essential for all to be aware of the causes of fires and how to prevent fires or carryout firefighting in homes and public places. 232 Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Charts, Po inter, Black Board & Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Civil Defence Organizations - 15 Min (c) Civil Defence Services - 15 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Civil Defence was first established in India on 24th October 1941. Two significant events took place after independence which gave a major fillip to Civil Defence in India. The first was the Chinese aggression in November, 1962 and the other was th e Indo-Pakistan war in September 1965, when, for the first time after Independence, the nation wa s subjected to enemy air attacks. This led to considerable rethinking about the policy and scope of Civil Defence and as a result the Civil Defence policy, as it exists today, was started. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the Civ il Defence Organizations and their duties. PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conducted in following parts:- (a) Part I - Civil Defence Organization. (b) Part II - Civil Defence Services and their Duties. PART I: CIVIL DEFENCE ORGANISATIONS General 6. The Civil Defence Act of India was enacted by Parliament in May 1968. Today, Civil Defence' includes any measures, not amounting to actual combat, for affording protection to any person, property, place or thing in India or any part of the territory thereof, against any enemy attack, whether from air, land, sea or other places, or for depriving any such attack of the whole or part of its effect. LESSON PLAN : DM-6 CIVIL DEFENCE ORGANISATION AND THEIR DUTIES Period - One Type - Lecture Term - I (JD/JW) 233 7. Civil Defence is a much misunderstood subject because; it is often confused with the air raid precautions taken during the war. There are many ot her measures necessary to deal with effects of direct and indirect raids and such measures cann ot be separated from the Civil Defence measures. Civil Defence measures mainly consist of the following:- (a) Protective and Preventive Measures . Measures which may be taken before an air raid, such as dispersal of population and industries, camouflage, preparation of shelter, warning and training etc. (b) Control Measures . Measures taken immediately after the raid, such as reconnaissance , reporting of damage and unexploded bombs, rescue of casualties, control of services, clearance of debris and extinguishing of fires. (c) Restorative Measures . The measures which become necessary after an air raid include feeding, providing shelter and clothi ng, salvage of property, disposal of dead, disposal of unexploded bombs, control of in fection and contamination, repair of damages caused to utility services etc. Civil Defence Organisation at work 8. Civil Defence is primarily organized on voluntar y basis except for a small nucleus of paid staff and establishment which is augmented during emer gencies. The present target of Civil Defence volunteers is 12.49 lakhs, out of which 6.0 la khs have already been raised and 4.8 lakhs have been trained. These volunteers are administered and train ed by 68 Deputy Controllers, 17 Medical Officers and 503 Civil Defence Instructors, which are full time paid posts. 9. National Level . At the national level, the Home Mi nistry is responsible for the Civil Defence. It has under its direct control, the Di rectorate of Civil Defence, headed by a Director General - usually a senior police officer, who is responsible to advise th e Home Ministry on all matters relating to Civil Defence. The Civil Defence organization basically comprises of the Home Guards and the Fire- Fighting Units. Most of the central ministries have a civil Defence cell which gets activated during emergency and is responsible for rendering specialist advice pertaining to their respective ministries to the Home Ministry. In addition, The Ministries of Defence and Railways are responsible for civil Defence on properties owned or managed by them. 10. State Level Organization . Each State and Union Territory government has, under the overall control of its Inspector General of Po lice, a Director General of Home Guards and Civil Defence. As in the case of the central government, he is a senior police officer and is responsible for controlling fire departments as well. 234 11. District Level Organization . In a district, the District Magistrate is the highest authority on Civil Defence. He is designated as the Controll er of Civil Defence. He is responsible for implementation of all Civil Defence measures by the district department al heads such as Civil Surgeon, Superintendent of Police, PWD Engineer, P ublicity Officers etc. They are appointed by him as in-charge of various Civil Defence Services. He also constitutes an Advisory Committee out of the people possessing qualities of leadership and discipline that can arouse and sustain public interest in the Civil Defence Services. PART-II: CIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES AND THEIR DUTIES 12. The Civil Defence Corps has the following 12 services in which volunteers are trained:- (a) Headquarters Service . This service works under control of Civil Defence. (b) Warden's Service . It is a link between the public and the authorities. This service is responsible for organizing self-help parties, fire parties and to check light restrictions, report damages and guide homeless to the Rest Centers. (c) Fire Fighting Service . They detect small fires and put out the same. (d) Casualty Services . The functions of this service are:- (i) Rendering first aid on the spot. (ii) Providing transport to casualties for short distances. (iii) To send various causa lities for further treatment. (e) Communication Services . This service is responsible for:- (i) Receipt and dissemination of air raid warning. (ii) Provision of co-ordination and co ntrol facilities. (iii) Provision of communication between warden posts, control centers through messengers or telephone etc. ( 13. with its v (f) Res trapped und (g) Wel missing an d vulnerable a (h) Dep send vario u required fro m (j) Salvag custody. k) Cor and dispos a (l) Sup procuring ne distribution o (m) Rep Defence or g arrangeme n town.

Computer slides, Charts, Po inter, Black Board & Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Administration at District level - 10 Min (c) Administration below District Level - 20 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. We all are aware that the Indian constitution guarantees and provisions Union and State laws as well as policies and programmes for economic and social development are relevant to the daily lives of the people only to the ex tent they are implemented honestly and efficiently. Constitution stipulates that the Governments preserve publ ic order and ensure welfare of its citizens. 'Administration ' encompasses any activities towards impl ementation and execution of above tasks. 4. Administration is an art of getting things done through and with the people in various organizational departments of the Governments. Administration involves guidance, leadership and control of the efforts of various departments towards common goals. AIM 5. To acquaint the cadets about the adminis trative set up in India at District / Taluka / Village levels. PREVIEW 6. The lecture will be conducted in three parts as under:- (a) Part I - Administrative set up at District level. (b) Part II - Administrative set up below District level. PART I : ADMINISTRATIVE SET UP AT DISTRICT LEVEL 7. The government at the centre and the state le vel cannot implement its policies directly from the head quarters. Therefore, the state is divided into territorial division s and districts. The actual work of the government is carried out at the district leve l. People tend to judge the performance of the government by the way the programmes are actually administered in the district. The people come into direct contact with the administration at the di strict level more than the state or central level. 237 8. District administration is on e of the most important parts of the Indian administrative system and has been one of the most powerful institutions. During the colonial regime, it was rigorously built up to bring the totality of government closer to the people. It was hierarchical sub-system of the state administration performing the specific tasks assigned to it. District Collector 9. The head of civil administration in a district is a District Collector who is also a district magistrate. She/he is a regional officer but she/he represents the government in the district in practically all spheres of its activities. She/he is as sisted by a number of other bureaucrats in various departments. All the officers assist him/her in di fferent branches of administration such as land records, collection of revenues, policy implementati on etc. Collector is also the ex-officio district election officer. He/she is also responsible fo r planning and development of the district plans and assists district planning committees in the budgetary processes. The office of the collector is called the collectorate. 10. The other major functions of District Collector include:- (a) Maintenance of law and order. (b Inspection of Jails. (c) Supervise cadastral survey and land records. (d) Revenue administration and collection of land revenue. (e) Enforces civil Defence measures, and is responsible for the protection of vital installations. (f) Coordinates work of Different Departments/Offices (g) Acts as returning Officer for elections. (h) Heads the District disa ster management Authority. Other Officials 11. A District is further divided into tahsils for the purposes of realization and collection of land revenue and administration. Tahsils are the units of Sub divisions, and Sub Divisional Magistrate performs similar functions as that of district collector at the tahsil level. He is assisted by a number of land revenue officials like Tahsildar, Naib-Tahsil dar, Kanoongo and lastly the Lekhpal. Lekhpal is the last in the revenue chain and is a village level functionary. PART-II : ADMINISTRATION BELOW DISTRICT LEVEL Sub Divisions 12. For administrative purposes the district is divided into Sub divisions, Tehsils, Parganas or Circles or Ferkas and the Village is at the lowest level. The sub division is headed by SDO - SDM/ Assistant Collector. He performs revenue as well as law and order functions in his sub division. He is a link between the District Collector and the Tehsildar in revenue matters. As future citizens of India, we need to be aware of the system and responsibilities of each official in the administrative set up so that we can contribute in our own way for the development of our soci ety. Station Police Officer is in charge of law and order matters. Tehsil is the basic unit for purposes of general administration, treasury, land revenue, land records, etc. A Tehsil comprises of about 100 villages. Taluka / Tehsils 13. Talukas, blocks or mandals (sub-districts but can also refer to division), headed by a Tehsildar or Talukdar, comprise several villages or village clusters. The governmental bodies at the Tehsil level are called the panchayat samiti. 238 Blocks 14. The block is often the next level of administrative division after the Tehsil. Villages 15. Villages are often the lowest level of subdivi sions in India. The governmental bodies at the village level are called Gram Panchayat, of which there were 2645880 in 2009. Each Gram Panchayat covers a large village or a cluster of smaller villages with a combined population exceeding 1500 (Gram Group). Municipalities 16 Municipalities of India are governed by Muni cipal Corporations (Mahanagar Paalika) for large urban areas, Municipal Council (Nagar Paalika) for smaller urban areas, and Town Councils (Nagar Panchayats) for suburban areas. Municipalities can be as large as a district or smaller than a Tehsil. CONCLUSION 17. It is very important in a large and democrati c country like India, all welfare schemes and other administrative benefits reach every citizen. For this to happen, it is important that an effective administration set up is available at every level from Central Go vernment to Gram Panchayat. Of course, honest and corrupt-free implementation of projects will decide the success of the sy stem. As the future citizens of India, we need to be aware of the system and responsibilities of each official in the admi nistrative set up so that we can contribute in our own way fo r the development of our society. 239 SUMMARY \u00be The term disaster is commonly used to denote any odd event natural or manmade which brings about a lot of misery to a region and it beco mes difficult to cope with the situation through local resources. \u00be Classification of Disasters :- \u00be Natural Disasters . Wind related, water related and earth related. \u00be Man-made Disasters .

Computer slides, Projector, Charts, Pointer, Black Board & Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Basics of Social Service - 15 Min (c) Weaker sections and their needs - 15 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. The term 'Social Service' is defined broadly as, the provisions made by governmental or voluntary efforts to meet income maintenance, medical care, housing, education and recreational needs and provisions, for the care and protec tion of recognised special groups. The modern institutional service took shape with the impact of the industrial revolution upon family and community life, and creating dependence upon the wage system as a means of livelihood. 4. Social service characterises a formalised way of helping people, to help themselves. It is based on the reorganization of variations in individual capability and variations in the social structure. The objective is to help the individual to utilise his capability for his own welfare and for that community. AIM 5. To acquaint the cadets about the Basics of Social Service and its Need. PREVIEW 6. The lecture will be conducted in following parts:- (a) Part I - Basics of Social Service. (b) Part II - Weaker sections and their needs PART- I : BASICS OF SOCIAL SERVICE 7. Methods . There are generally three accepted methods identified for conduct of social service which are as under:- 245 (a) Social Case Work. T h i s a i m s t o h e l p t h e individual make maximum use of the established community, through understanding the individual in his total situation. (b) Social Group Work . I t s e e k s t o h e l p t h e individuals utilize their fullest capacity for their own welfare and for the welfare of the group as a whole, through understanding of the behavior of individuals in a group setting. (c) Community Organization . It attempts to help groups of individuals or groups of agencies to work together so that their combined efforts will be useful for the social welfare of the whole community. 8. Types of Social Service Activities . There can be many social servic e activities. Some of the social service activities which can be undertaken are as under:- (a) Education. (b) Family Welfare, Medical Care, Family Planning and Nutrition. (c) Provision of Water and Cooking Fuel , Roads, Electricity and Sanitation. (d) Old Age Support Systems. (e) Employment. (f) Social Assistance, Social Security and Care & Protection. (g) Housing and Rehabilitation. (h) Recreation, Sports and Social activities. PART- II : WEAKER SECTIONS OF SOCIETY AND THEIR NEEDS 9. General . India is still divided into many endogamous groups, or castes and sub-castes, as a result of centuries of practicing a form of social hierarchy calle d the caste system. The traditional caste system, leads to severe oppression and segregation of the lower castes and other weaker sections and limits their access to various freedoms eg:- education and employment. After independence the constitution of India included safeguards for suppressed and other backward classes. The Indian constitution prohibits any discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth. But, while provid ing equality of opportunity for all citizens, the constitution also contains special clauses to ensure reservation, 'for the advancement of any socially and for the educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes'. 246 10. Classes of Society . (a) Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes . Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are communities that are accorded special status by the Constitution of India. They are socially and economically backward and were subjected to extensive social disadvantage and discrimination. The Scheduled Caste people are also known as Dalits and the Scheduled Tribes as Adivasis. (b) Other Backward Classes (OBCs) . These classes are a group of sub castes which are socially and educationally backward while still hav ing a higher status than scheduled castes or scheduled tribes. 11. Needs of the Weaker Sections. (a) Education. Education is the basic need of the weaker sections. The right approach would be to provide all weaker sections, proper pr imary education, to prevent them from dropping out of school and making them 'nat ural competitors' and to give scholarships at higher level. Some measures which can contribute in this are:- (i) At the village level, opening of schools which impart basic education c oupled with the vocational skill that can be taught with the naturally available resources e.g. basket weaving, painting printing, tailoring, embroidery, pottery, music, dance, etc will help in achieving self-sufficiency. (ii) Schools should also educate the villagers on mora l values, hygiene, first aid, family planning, budgeting, savings etc. (b) Villagers must be educated on the n eed for educating the girl child as she is the one responsible in bringing up the future generations. (c) Social evils such as the dowry system, ch ild marriages and superstitions, should be taken up for discussion and their drawbacks be pointed out, so that they become events of history. (d) Provision of land to landless and helping them in working out a life by providing softer loans for cultivations etc can take care of employment probl ems to some extent. Taking up of infrastructure projects will help in creati ng large number of jobs. (e) Reservation in Educational Institutions and Government Jobs. Reservation is a term used to describe policies where by a portion of jobs, posi tions or academic seats are set aside or reserved for a given group. Government has taken initiatives on a large scale by providing reservations in different fields such as government jobs, educational institution and other such government aided and semi-govt institutions, to help the SCs, STs and OBCs. Although originally supposed to last for 10 years, the reservation system has continued till date and now applies to higher education and legislative offices also. Currently 22.5% of the seats in higher education institutes under the Central Government are reserved for SC and ST, and 27% for OBCs. 12. Contribution of NCC Cadets . NCC Cadets are from every nook and corner of India. We must therefore utilise this huge potential of eager, helpful, energetic, educated and talented cadets, to achieve our aim of imbibing values and skills amongst the weaker sections of our society which will make them self-sufficient and confident. CONCLUSION 13. There is no doubt that the interests of the weak er sections need to be protected and their legimiate needs fulfilled so that we can have a just fair society where the under privileged are not discriminated against and no section lags behind the other. 247 LESSON PLAN: SA 2 CIVIC RESPONSIBI LITIES: SWACHH BHARAT ABHIYAN, SAUCHH ABHIYAN Period - One Type - Lecture Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

(a) Introduction - 05 Min (b) Civic Sense - 10 Min (c) Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - 20 Min (d) Conclusion - 05 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Civic Sense is that positive sense in an i ndividual which makes him a civilized citizen of a country. It means developing the positive understanding, perception, attitudes towards society or community. Each one of us enjoy many rights as a citi zen of the country, howev er with these rights understanding and performing our responsibilities is extremely important, which includes abiding by the law and maintaining proper behavior in public places. Swachh Bharat and Sauchh Abhiyan are two community cleaning programs launched by Government of India to make India more clean and hygienic. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about civic responsib ilities, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and Sauchh Abhiyan. PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conduct ed in two parts as under:- (a) Part I - Civic Responsibilities (b) Part II - Swachh Bharat Abhiyan PART I - CIVIC RESPONSIBILITIES 6. Civic sense means social ethics, the positive pe rception, and understanding attitude towards society or community. Civic sense is not just keeping t he roads clean and avoiding the violation of basic civil rights, it's about respecting one another, abiding by the law and maintaining proper decorum in public places. 7. Nowadays, we are so busy that we do not have time to spare for civic responsibilities. We absolutely lack basic civic sense and some of us are not even bothered. We see people littering, smoking in public places, cutting off plants and many other violations every day. Ther e are so many products that we use mindlessly every day, without a thought of how they might be affecting the environment around us. The 248 time has come for us to think carefully before we use a product and look for healthy alternatives. We as a nation need to improve our civic sense considerab ly. This needs to be taught at an early age. Characteristics of Responsible Citizen 8. Obeying laws and respecting authority is one of the main responsibilities of a good citizen. Don't break laws and also prevent others from doing so. Be aware about the issues affecting the society and provide solutions to them, vote intelligently, pay taxe s fully and timely. Keep your surroundings and locality clean by use of dustbins, avoid littering and respect public property. It is necessary to be honest to country and fellow citizens. When the civic sense among citizens increase, our surroundings especially public places and environment will be a better liveable place. PART- II : SWACHH BHARAT ABHIYAN 9. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Movement) is a campaign launched by the Government of India to clean the streets, roads and other infrastructu re It is India's largest ever cleanliness drive with 3 million government employees, school and college st udents from all parts of India, participating. 10. Aims and Objectives . The Swachh Bharat mission aims to involve each and every Indian from all walks of life in the mission of cleanliness. It is a mass movement that seeks to create a Clean India. 11. Implementation . By inviting common people to participate in the mission, a se nse of responsi bility has been evoked among the people. With citizens now becoming active participants in cleanliness activities across the nation, the dream of a 'Clean India' by M ahatma Gandhi has started taking shape. 12. Outcome and Benefits Expected . People from all sections of the society have come forward and joined this mass movement of cleanliness. From government officials to jawans, 249 Bollywood actors to the sportsperson s, industrialists to spiritual leaders, all have lined up for the noble cause. Organising frequent cleanliness drives, se minars and campaigns for spreading awareness about hygiene through plays and music are also being widely carried out across the nation. 13. Sauchh Abhiyan . Sauchh mission is aimed to construct individual sanitary latrines for household purpose. Sauchh Abhiyan is a project within Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which deals with only toilets and bathrooms in the country. 14. Benefits of Sauchh Abhiyan . It is beneficial for the people living below poverty line. It assists in converti ng dry latrines into low-cost sanitary latrines. It also provides facility of hand pumping, safe and secure bathing facilities, setting up of sanitary stores, construction of drains for disposal of solid and liquid wastes etc. CONCLUSION 15. Civic Sense is not just about keeping the roads clean and avoiding t he violation of basic civil rights, it's about respecting one another, abiding by the law and maintaining discipline in public places. A Clean India would be the best tribute India could pay to Mahatma Gandhi. 250 LESSON PLAN : SA 3 CONTRIBUTION OF YOUTH TOWARDS SOCIAL WELFARE Period - One Type - Lecture Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

Youth constitute the mo st creative section of any society. Their role and contributions are vital to all societies and more so in a country like India having social, cultural and other demographic disparities. Youth constitute about 34 % of the total population of India and their role and contribution towards social welfare and nation building is significant. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the contri bution of youth towards social welfare. CONTRIBUTION OF YOUTH TOWARDS SOCIAL WELFARE 5. The contribution of youth towards social we lfare have been discussed in the succeeding paras:- (a) Leadership . Young and vibrant youth are the l eaders of tomorrow and youth need to involve themselves in activities which will develop creditable leadership. (b) Community Service . Youth need to work in social welfare activities and community services. Community Service should be an integral part of curriculum so that they can fruitfully understand and contribute in community service. (c) National and Cultural Integration .

Literacy is a key factor for development of any nation. Enhancement of literacy is one of the primary duties of the Governments at Centre as well as States. All other issues like economic development, employment availability, industrial development, poverty etc. can be linked to the basic issue of literacy. In India, another basic problem is poverty. Since independence, successive gover nments have initiated many programmes and schemes for the removal of poverty. We must do everything possible to eradicate poverty from our society and help governments achieve this. 4. Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao is one important Social Se ctor Initiative introduced by government to address the problems of gender imbalance and discrimination against girl child in Indian society. AIM 5. To acquaint the cadets about the Literacy En hancement (improvement), Poverty Alleviation (reduction) and Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao Program. PREVIEW 6. The lecture will be conduc ted in three parts as under:- (a) Part I - Literacy Enhancement in India. (b) Part II - Poverty Alleviation in India (c) Part III - Be ti Bachao Beti Padhao Program 253 PART I : LITERACY E NHANCEMENT IN INDIA 7. Definition . Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak, listen, and communicate effectively. As per 2011 census, 26 % of Indian population is illiterate. 8. The Literacy rate in India has improved a lot over the last couple of y ears especially after the implementation of mid-day meals. Reasons for Low Literacy Rate in India 9. Some of the reasons for low literacy rates in India have been inadequate and poor infrastructure in education, sector, awareness, caste system, gender bias, poverty and lack of political will etc. The States and the regions which have gone ahead in these fields, the literacy rate has improved, as high as 100 % in states like Kerala, Mizoram etc. Literacy Enhancement 10. Government of India has taken several measures to improve the literacy rate in India. State Governments are making efforts to improve literacy rate in districts and villages where people are very poor. Some of the steps or programs to im prove the literacy rate include the following:- (a) National Lite racy Mission . It was launched in 1988 and aims to educate 80 million adults in the age group of 15 - 35 years, over an eight-year period. (b) Sarva Siksha Abhiyan . Began in 2000-01, aims at making free and compulsory education to children between the ages of 6 to 14 years (as a fundamental right). (c) Saakshar Bharat . Began in 2009, it aims to create a literate society through a variety of teaching, learning programmes for non-literate and neo-literate of 15 years and above. It focuses more on women. (d) Right to Education ( RTE) Act 2010. I t provides for free and compulsory education for children between 6 and 14 years as a fundamental right. (e) Non- Governmental Efforts . The bulk of Indian illiterates live in the country's rural areas, where social and economic barriers play an importa nt role in keeping the lowest strata of society illiterate. Go vernment programmes alone, however well intentioned, may not be able to dismantle barriers built over centuries. Major so cial reformation efforts are sometimes required to bring about a change in the rural scenario. Several non- governmental organizations such as ITC, Rotary club, Lions Club have worked to improve the literacy rate in India. PART II : POVERTY ALLEVIATION 11. Poverty in India is widespread, with the nation estimated to have a third of the world's poor. According to United Nations Development Programme , an estimated 37.2% of Indians live below the country's national poverty line. 254 Causes for Poverty in India 12. Following are some of the causes for poverty in India:- (a) Lack of Market Economy . After independence, India adopted a centrally planned and closed economy. It has started to open its markets since the economic reforms in 1991. (b) High Population Growth Rate . Another cause for poverty in India is the high population growth rate. (c) Neglecting Agricultural Sector . A griculture growth rate has dropped drastically compared to services and industry. Poverty Removal Programmes 13. In order to reduce poverty, the following programmes were launched by the government:- (a) Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojna . It was started on 01 April 1999. The main aim of this programme was development of rural areas. Its secondary objective was to give out sustained wage employment. This was only given to BPL families. (b) National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS) . It is a non- contributory old age pension scheme that covers Indians who are 60 years and above and live below the poverty line. (c) National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS) . In the event of death of a bread-winner in a household, the bereaved family will receive lumpsum as sistance of Rs 10000/- The Scheme is for BPL families only. (d) National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS) . This Scheme provides a sum of Rs 500 to a pregnant mother for the first two live births. T he women have to be older than 19 years of age. It is given normally /8-12 weeks before the birt h and in case of the death of child the women can still avail it. (e) Annapurna . It aims at providing 10 Kg of food gr ains in a month as food security to meet the requirement of those senior citi zens who, though eligible, have remained uncovered under the National Old Age Pension Scheme. (f) Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) . It aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every household, whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. (g) Rural housing- Indira Awaas Yojana . It is a social welfare flagship programme, created by the Indian Government, to provide housing for everyone. IT aims to creat e 20 Lacs housing units by providing Loans at Subsidized rates 255 PART III : BETI BACHAO BETI gover nmental social scheme to address the gender imbalance and discrimination against girl child in the Indian society. Objectives 15. It is to increase awareness among common people to save the lives of girl child by completely stopping the female foeticide. Peopl e are encouraged to celebrate the birth of their girl child and educate them with full respon sibility as they do for their boy child. Implementation of the scheme 16. Under Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, government has taken various steps towards protecting the girl child and enabling her education. The District Task Force and Block Task Force have been formed with an aim of developing and relating to Child Sex Ratio. To reach out the community at a large, awareness programs are being conducted for wider publicity of the Scheme. A number of rallies have been organized with major participation from school s, employees of government departments, etc. CONCLUSION 17. Literacy enhancement and removal of poverty are two important aspects to be tackled on an urgent basis in order to ensure that every section of our country progresses evenly and at a faster pace . Evils of illiteracy and poverty can eat away the soul of India unless the entire country along with the governments tackles them on mission mode. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao program has noble intention which needs to be translated on ground. NCC cadets can play an im portant role in these aspects, particularly in literacy. 256 LESSON PLAN : SA 5 RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES Period - One Type - Lecture Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

Social Security refers to all governmental or others programmes aimed at providing basic needs to citizens who are retired, unemployed, or unemploy able due to disability/old age. It is funded through contributions from both the employees and th e employers or by the government itself. The ILO in 2014 estimated that only 27% of the world's populati on has access to comprehensive social security. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets with various Social Security Schemes in India. PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conduct ed in two parts as under:- (a) Part I - What is Social Security? (b) Part II - Jan Dhan Yojana (b) Part III - New Social Security Schemes of government PART I : WHAT IS SOCIAL SECURITY? Social Security 6. Any of the measures established by legislation to maintain individual or family income or to prov ide income when some or all sources of income are not available.In India, the modern social security measures were planned and implemented after independence. They were too meagre and limited to the organized sector workers only, which constituted about 8 per cent of the to tal workforce, despite a majority of the workforce (about 93%) comes in the unorganized sector (self- employed or casual workers). 260 7. Importantly, the need to ensure so cial security for all, especially those in the unorganized sector, is an overarching concern recognized in the Five-Year Pl ans. The Constitution of I ndia provides strength and spirit to the social security for organized and unorgani zed workers through its Directive Principles of the State Policy. 8. Thus, while a large proportion of the organized se ctor workers have been benefiting from legally mandated and budget-provided social security benefits si nce independence, but most of the workers in the unorganized sector have been left out (only less than 10% of the total unorganized were benefited). 9. The below poverty line (BPL) criterion is a minimalist and inappropriate approach to extend social security to the unorganized workers. About 55 per cent of the population though not comes in the category of the poor in India but is vulnerable. Not only this, mo st of the unorganized workers suffer from the lack of awareness about social security and social welfare measures. 10. Narrowly speaking, social welfare refers to a set of institutional or personal services provided either by the state or voluntary organization s to prevent the incidence or to re form or rehabilitate the victims of disabilities, or disorganization or del inquencies or destitution and so on. 11. Types of Social Security . Social security are of three types:- (a) Social Insurance . It is where people receive benefits of services in recognition of contributions to an insurance program. These serv ices typically include provision for retirement pensions, disability insurance, survivor b enefits and unemployment insurance. (b) Services . The ones provided by government or designated agencies responsible for social security provision. In different countries , that may include medical care, financial support during unemployment, sickness, or retirement, health and safety at work, aspects of social work and even industrial relations. (c) Basic Security . I t i s i rrespective of participation in specific insurance program where eligibility may otherwise be an issue. For instance, assist ance given to newly arrived refugees for basic necessities such as food, clothing, housing, education, money, and medical care . PART II : JAN is national mission for financial inclusion to ensure access to financial services, namely Banking/Saving & Deposit Accounts, Remittance, Credit, Insurance and Pension with direct benefit schemes. 13.

The ones that are illegal to produce, possess, buy or sell, consume and store. There are no prices or quality control over such drugs say heroin. This means that a user can never be sure that the drug they are taking is suitable and these kinds of drugs are banned. PART II : DRUG ABUSE AND TRAFFICKING 9. What is Drug Abuse . Consuming the substance which is neither approved nor supervised by medical professionals. The use of steroids for performance enhancement in sports is also called drug abuse. Continuous and prolonged abuse of drugs may make a person an addict. 10. It was found that all the addicts either take hashish, cannabis or heroin. 72% of addicts are in the age group of 20-24 years.

If a person is not strong enough then they may go for pleasure seeking with drugs. Some people have mental tensions and therefore use this to relieve their pressure. If the av ailability of these drugs is easy then that may lead to more cases of addiction. Drug Trafficking in India 12. India, due to its geographical location has become a transi t route base for illicit heroin, hashish and morphine from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Nepal and Burma. To meet the expenses for drug intake, many users involve themselves in crime and thefts. The drug syndicates often use poor people, especially youth to carry their illegal products from one place to another, at a huge price, which makes the youth fall for this easy money. The youth today, do not understand th e dangers of this illegal activity. The Law 13.

For fast, safe and trustworthy payments. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the Gove rnments' New Development Initiatives. PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conduc ted in five parts as under:- (a) Part I - Aadhar. 277 (b) Part II - Digital India. (c) Part III - BHIM App. . PART I : AADHAR 6. Aadhar is a Unique Identification Number issu ed by UIDAI to individuals for the purpose of establishing unique identification of every single pers on. Aadhar is actually a 12-digit number and not a card. The Unique Identification Authority of I ndia (UIDAI) is the regulatory body for this. 7. Aadhar is meant for individuals of any age (including children) for the purpose of establishing identities. Since Aadhar is for only individuals, it is di fferent for all the members of a family. For deciding uniqueness of every individual, the demographic details (residence address information) of the person and his/her biometric information (photograph, iris-scan, finger prints) is collected which is stored in a centralized database. As. NCC cadets, one should not only possess AADHAR card not also educate those who do not have to proure it. 8. Application process for Aadhar Card . (a) How to apply for AADHAR card online? (i) Not all AADHAR card centers have onl ine appointment regi stration facility. (ii) To check a center nearby has onlin e appointment facility, click on: Apply for AADHAAR Card Appointment Online. (iii) Once applicant has ta ken the online appointment, co llect the required documents and go to the center with the documents at the assigned date and time. (b) How to apply for AADHAR card at the center? (i) If an AADHAR card center near one's location DOES NOT have online appointment registration facility, one can wa lk into any nearby AADHAR card center, without prior appointment. (ii) To contact nearby AADHAAR card cent er click on: Locate Nearby AADHAAR Card Centers . (c) What documents are required to apply for AADHAR card? (i) Generally 1 identity and 1 address proof document is required to apply for AADHAR card. To know about the documents required to apply for AADHAR card click on: AADHAAR Card Documents Required . (ii) If someone in a family does not have valid documents , he/she can still enroll if his/her name exists in family entitlement docum ent. In that case the Head of the Family in entitlement document needs to be enrolled first with valid Identity and Address proof document. The head of the household can then introduce other members in the family for enrollment. (iii) If there are no documents available at all , resident may take the help of Introducers available at the enrollment cent re. For further details please contact the concerned Registrar office. 278 9. Features of AADHAR (a) Uniqueness . This is achieved through the pr ocess of demographic and biometric de- duplication. The de-duplication process compares the resident's demographic and biometric information, collected during the process of enrol ment, with the records in the UIDAI database to verify if the resident is already in the database or not. An individual needs to enrol for aadhaar only once and after de-duplication only one aadhaar shall be generated. In case, the resident enrols more than once, the subsequent enrolments will be rejected. (b) Portability . Aadhaar gives nationwide portability as it can be authenticated anywhere on- line. This is critical as millions of Indians mi grate from one state to another or from rural area to urban centres etc. (c) Random Number . Aadhaar number is a random number devoid of any intelligence. Person willing to enrol has to prov ide minimal demographic along with biometric info rmation during the enrolment process. The aadhaar enrolment process does not captur e details like caste, religion, income, health, geography, etc. (d) Scalable Technology Architecture . The UID architecture is open and scalable. Resident's data is stored centrally and authent ication can be done online from anywhere in the country. Aadhaar authentication service is bu ilt to handle 100 million authentications a day. (e) Open Source Technologies . Open source architecture precludes dependence on specific computer hardware, specific storage, specific os , specific database vendor, or any specific vendor technologies to scale. Such applications are built using open source or open technologies and structured to address scalability in a vendor neutral manner and allow co-existence of heterogeneous hardware within same application. Why Aadhar Card is Becoming Important? 10. With the passage of time, importance of Aadhar card has greatly increased. In future, Aadhar card will be mandatory to avail benefits of various governm ent schemes and services. Few important uses of Aadhar card in our basic living are as under:- (a) LPG Subsidy through Aadhar . Government has started the PAHAL Scheme under which the subsidy amount of LPG cylinder is directly transferred into the Aadhar number linked bank account of the consumer. Absence of Aadhar card can deprive the consumer from availing subsidy benefits on LPG cylinders. (b) Aadhar card must for Passport . Government has also ordered that Aadhar card is necessary for issuance of new passport. You can be denied of passport if you do not have your Aadhar card with you. (c) Aadhar is Digital ID Proof . Aadhar card will be identity proof of every individual in future. Since the details of Aadhar card holder are ke pt at secure online serv ers, the bio-metrically verified identity of an individual can be us ed to confirm the identity of its holder. (d) Use Aadhar for new SIM Card . Aadhar card is necessary for purchasing new SIM cards. With this you cannot buy a new SI M card without having Aadhar card. (e) Aadhar Vital for Government Employees . There is a proposal to bring Aadhar card into use to connect it with the a ttendance book of government employees. 11. Advantages/Benefits Of Aadhar Card . Indian Government is planning to use Aadhar not only for the identity but also for the various other important purposes. It give an identity is a citizen, facilitate easy transaction as well as makes every citizen re sponsible for his actions and also participate in development of the nation. Some of the benefits are:- (a) In several places and all government departments various documentary proof is required, but, the Aadhar will reduce the burden of many identity proofs. 279 (b) To open a 'bank account' or to operate a current account, now it's mandatory to submit your Aadhar Number, to your bank officials. So, RBI can easily find out all the bank accounts of a person. (c) Aadhar Number linked to a bank account w ill get LPG Subsidy directly to their bank account. (d) Under the Prime Minister's 'Jhan Dhan Yojana,' Aadhar is used as the main document as evidence, to open a 'bank account.' (e) For various monetary transaction providi ng UIN detail, would be necessary, which reduce the 'black money' transfer. (f) Various types of duplication of data and fake identities created by frauds for a long time, in India, for their individual benefits, can be stopped with the help of UIN. PART II : DIGITAL INDIA 12. Digital India is a major step by Government towards development. Can you imagine a country where Government procedures are done on a click of a bu tton? Yes, the ultimate aim of digital India is its facilitate all transactions through digital means rather than by manual method. Fo r e.g. the application are sent on email and certified and stored digitally. It saves ti me and effort of the citizen. Digital India was launched by Government of India on 01 July 2015 with the objective of connecting rural areas with high- speed Internet networks and improving digital literacy in the country. The vision of Digital India programme is inclusive growth in areas of electronic services, pr oducts, manufacturing and job opportunities etc. and it is centered on three key areas - Di gital Infrastructu re as a Utility to Every Citizen, Governance and Services on Demand and Digital Empowe rment of Citizens. Digital Literacy mission will cover six crore rural households. It is planned to connect 550 farmer mark ets in the country through the use of technology. 13. Out of 10% English speaking Indians, only 2% reside in rural areas. Rest depends on their vernacular language for all their lives. As of now, ema il addresses can only be created in English language. To connect rural India with the Digital India, the Government of India is encouraging email services providers like Gmail, MS Office and Rediff etc to prov ide email address in regional languages. The email provider companies has shown positive signs and an India based company, Data Xgen Technologies Pvt Ltd, has launched world's first free linguistic ema il address under the name 'DATAMAIL' which allows to create email ids in 8 Indian languages, English and 3 foreign languages - Arabic, Russian and Chinese. In due course of time email services in 22 languages will be offered by Data XGen Technologies. The Nine Pillars 14. Government of India hopes to achieve growth on multiple fronts with the Digital India Programme. Specifically, the government aims to target nine 'Pillars of the Digital India' that they have been identified as:- (a) Broadband Highway. (b) Universal access to Internet. (c) Public Internet Access Programme. (d) e-Governance - Reforming Government through Technology. (e) e-Kranti - Electronic delivery of services. (f) Information for All. (g) Electronics Manufacturing. (h) IT for Jobs. (j) Early Harvest Programmes. 280 15. Through Digital India Programme the Indian Government aims to create jobs for 18 lakh people and bring investment of around Rs. 4.5 lakh crore in the country. The government will look to benefit both the consumers and the service pr oviders by developing a two-way platform. The programme will be supervised and managed by the Digital India Advisory group which will be lead by India's Ministry of Communications and IT. PART III : BHIM APP 16. The indigenously developed payment app ' BHIM ' (Bharat Interface for Money ) has been named after the main architect of Indian constitution, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. It was l aunched on 30 December 2016 by National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI). This app will create financial equality in the country, as envisaged by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. 17. BHIM is a biometric payment system app using Aadhar platform, and is based on Unified Payment Interface (UPI) to facilitate e-payments directly through bank. It stresses on the importance of technology and digital transactions. It can be used on all mobile devices, be it a Smartpho ne or a feature phone with or without internet connection. The payments through the new system ( BHIM App) can be made by just a thumb impression after the bank account is linked with Aadhar gateway. Indeed, the technology through BHIM will empower poorest of the poor, small business and the marginalized sections. The app will minimize the role of plastic cards and point of sale machines. The app will eliminat e fee payments for service providers like MasterCard and Visa, which has been a stumbling block in people switching to digital payments. 18. Advantages of BHIM app are:- (a) The app can be used to send and receive money through smart phones. (b) Money can also be sent to non UPI supported banks. (c) Bank balance can also be checked through the app. (d) Currently Hindi and English are supported in the app, with more languages coming soon. 19. The e-wallet app will feature fingerprint verifi cation in future. Thereafter only thumb will be needed to make a payment. Thumb will be your bank then. People especially young should utilize the app and support this to curb black money and to create financial equality in the society. CONCLUSION 20. The new development initiatives undertaken by Govern ment of India will definitely propel India to a higher developmental pedestal if executed properly. T he government, the industries, banks, various other agencies and common man especially youth will have to work in collaboration to make these initiatives a great success which is what the world is expecting from India at present.

It's about respecting one another, abiding by the law and maintaining discipline in public places. Lack of civic sense retards the progress of the society. At home, in our neighbourhood, in the colony, on the road, in the office, in a theatre, in a restaurant and everywhe re we go, we are duty bound to have civic sense. \u00be The Swachh Bharat mission aims to involve ea ch and every Indian from all walks of life in the mission of cleanliness. It is a mass movement that seeks to create a Clean India. \u00be Youth is the strength of the family, village, loca lity and the community. They are also the future of our nation. We must take all necessary steps to mobiliz e this most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of our society in the mission of nation building and social welfare. \u00be Literacy enhancement and removal of poverty are two important aspects to be tackled on an urgent basis in order to ensure that every section of our country progresses evenly and at a faster pace . \u00be The objective of Indira Awas Yojana is primarily to help construction of new houses as well as conversion of unserviceable \"kutcha\" hou ses into pucca / semi-pucca houses. \u00be We need to develop rural areas in order to bridge the urban - rural divide, to have equitable distribution of resources and development activities, to create more job opportunities and to empower the rural population. \u00be The Government of India has provided several social security schemes for the benefits of the citizens namely Jandhan Yojana, At al have to make good use of these schemes to attain the benefits. \u00be Social evils are mostly due to poor educati on, misplaced beliefs, unemployment and inequitable distribution of wealth. Social evils are a disease on t he society and have disastrous long term effects. We need to take concerted action to eradicate these ev ils forms society. Although many laws/legislations presently exist to prevent the social evils, but t he wholehearted participation of the people will only force their implementation. Hence we must all educate oursel ves, as also our family and neighbours to take all necessary steps to eradicate all types of society evils form society. \u00be Corruption in any form is bad and not acceptable. If we want to eradicate corruption, we must all take a pledge not to form part of the chain of corrupti on either as a 'giver' or as a 'taker'. Also we must ensure that, any person who make a demand for bribes or gratification must be promptly reported to the authorities for remedial action. \u00be Drug trafficking and consumption has become a global menace. To eradicate this governments and NGOs should emphasise on education, healthcare, treatment and rehabilitation and combat illicit production, trafficking and consumption of drug s for the effective c ontrol of drug abuse. \u00be The role of alcohol in traffic accidents is very hi gh. After drinking, the judg ment power of the driver gets impaired - a threat to road safety. Due to its effect s, a drunken driver tends to take more risks, become more aggressive and take a longer reaction time we must ensure that neither do we drive after drinking alcohol nor do we allow others to do this. \u00be The protection of Children from Sexual Offences Ac t, 2012, is an important milestone, and children are to be educated about the provisions available in the act. \u00be The responsibility to control all traffic is with t he Traffic Police department. For the safety 'Drunken and driving' should be prohibited. The Government has introduced Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2016 with better provisions for making roads safe and save lakhs of innocent lives. 285 \u00be Government of India has launched a number of new developmental Initiatives which can usher transformative changes the society. They are:- \u00be Aadhar . For unique identity of citizens and its connectivity digitally. \u00be Digital India . For digitalizing / paperless transactions. \u00be BHIM App . For fast, safe and trustworthy payments. \u00be Make in India . To encourage manufacturing in India. \u00be Start up India . For encouraging new businessmen. 286 Comprehension Questions Q1.

Computer slides, Charts, Po inter, Black Board and Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 03 Min (b) Skeletal and Muscular System - 10 Min (c) Organ Systems - 20 Min (d) Conclusion - 02 Min INTRODUCTION 3. The human body is the greatest of all complex ma chineries. In order to carryout first aid, a first aider should have basic idea of stru cture and function of every part of the human body. Many lives can be saved if proper and timely first aid can be rendered. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about the St ructure and Functioning of the human body PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Skeletal and Muscular System. (b) Part II - Organ Systems. PART I: SKELETAL AND MUSCULAR SYSTEM Skeletal System 6. The human body has 206 bones of various shapes and sizes. The bones give shape and firmness to the body, as also it protects the vital organs like brain, heart, lungs and spinal cord . Bones can either be loosely arranged or densely arranged. The loosely arranged bone is called \"spongy bone\" and densely arranged bone is called \"compact bone\". Some bones are hollow from inside and filled with bone marrow. 291 7. Classification of Bones. Bones can be classified according to their shape as under:- (a) Long Bones . These bones are long and tubular a nd are confirmed to upper and lower limbs. (b) Short Bones . This bones are short and tubular and are found in the ankle/.wrists (c) Flat Bones . These bones are flat like plates.e.g. Bones of cranium Skull shoulder or hips. (d) Irregular Bones . Irregular or mixed shapeeg.Vertebral column. (e) Sesamoid Bones . They develop in the tendons of t he muscles around the joints e.g., Patella Long, Flat, Short And Irregular Bones Long, Flat, Short and Irregular Bones 8. Muscular System . The muscles form about half of the total weight of the body and are responsible for body movement. The muscles form the fl esh of the body that is under the control of nervous system. 9. Classification . The muscles of the body are classified into the following types:- (a) Voluntary/Skeletal Muscles . These muscles are attached to the surface of bones. These muscles form about 47% of the body weight. Most of the skeletal muscles pan from one bone to another across a joint and by contracting; they act upon the joints and produce movements. ( b) Involuntary Muscles . These muscles are controlled by the automatic nervous system. (c) Cardiac Muscles . These muscles are striated stru cturally, unstrained functionally. They form the part of heart wall. 292 PART II: ORGAN SYSTEMS 10. Circulatory System . The circulatory system consists of t he Heart, Blood Vessels and blood. Each time the heart contracts; blood is pumped along the bl ood vessels. By blood circulation, oxygen, nutrients and other substances are brought to the tissues and the waste products and carbon dioxide formed by the tissues are constantly removed. (a) Heart . The Heart is the four chambered pu mping organ. It is situated in thorax between the lungs and on to the left side of the body. The si ze of heart is to a closed fist and the average weight of heart in a male is about 300 grams, and in a female about 250 grams. (b) Blood. The blood is also known as the transport system of the body. It consists of plasma and formed of cells such as RBC, WBC and platelets. (c) Blood Vessels. Blood vessels are tube like structures which carry blood all over the body for circulation. These are of three types: (i) Arteries . These are the blood vessels which carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body. (ii) Capillaries . These are tiny blood vessels which connect the small arteries & veins. The exchange of oxygen and nutrition wi th carbon di oxide by the tissue takes place in the capillaries. (iii) Veins . These blood vessels carry blood to the heart. The main veins are called superior and inferior vena cava. 11. Respiratory System . Respiration is a process by which oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is given out. The main organs of respiratory system are Nose, Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchi, and the Lungs. 12. Digestive System. Digestion is a mechanical and chemical process by which, complex food substances are converted into simple substances so that they can be easily absorbed by blood and utilized by the various tissues of the body according to their requirements. The main organs of digestive system are mouth, salivary glands, pharynx, esophagus, stom ach, pancreas, liver, small intestine and the large intestine. 293 13. Excretory System. Excretion is a process by which wast e products are removed out of the body. Among the organs that contribute towards the e limination of waste products are the skin, lungs, kidneys and the gastro-intestinal tract. 14. Nervous System . Internal balance of the human body is maintained with in normal limits by the nervous system and the endocrine system. The neur ons are the basic units of nervous system. The nervous system may be divided into three main parts:- (a) The Central Nervous System. This consists of brain and spinal cord. (b) The Peripheral Nervous System. This forms the connections between the central nervous system and the various organs and muscles. (c) The Autonomic Nervous System. It is an offshoot of the central nervous system and controls the involuntary functions of the various internal organs. CONCLUSION 15. Basic knowledge of our body systems allows us to understand the field of health and hygiene with ease. This knowledge provides us the basic framew ork on which subsequent knowledge and skills dealing with medical science can be gained in a progressive manner. 294 LESSON PLAN: H-2 HYGIENE AND SANITATION (PERSONAL AND FOOD HYGIENE ) Period - 02 Type - Lecture Term - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Charts, Pointer, Black board and Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 03 min (b) Personal Hygiene - 35 Min (c) Food Hygiene - 40 Min (d) Conclusion - 02 Min INTRODUCTION 3. Personal and Food Hygiene are necessary to preserve and improve the health of the individual and of the community as a whole. Its study is aimed at ma king the cadets aware of the many preventable health hazards and to enable them to look after themselves and their community most efficiently. It seeks to develop in them the concepts of healthy living. Person al hygiene involves all aspects of the health of an individual. Responsibility for the maintenance of perso nal health therefore lies with the individual. Every person must remain in perfect physical, mental an d social health, only then can he serve the community and the country well. AIM 4. To teach the cadets about Personal and Food Hygiene. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Personal Hygiene (b) Part II - Food Hygiene PART I: PERSONAL HYGIENE 6. Maintenance of personal hygiene is very important in preventing disease. It deals with the practices that help in the maintenance and promotion of a pers on's health. Personal hygiene habits such as washing hands and brushing teeth will keep bacteria, viruse s and illness at bay. There are mental and physical benefits. Practicing good body hygiene helps you feel good about yourself. 7. Main components of personal hygiene are:- (a) Sleep is the periodical rest of both body and mind and it is extremely essential for a healthy body. The duration of sleep one requires varies wi th individual age. The average requirement of sleep is about 7 to 8 hours a day. 295 b) Bathing keeping the skin clean and in healthy condition is essential for good health. Wash your body regularly. Your body is constantly shedding skin. That sk in needs to come off. Otherwise, It will cake up and cause illnesses. (c) Brush your teeth twice a day. Brushing mini mizes the accumulation of bacteria in mouth which can cause tooth decay and gum diseases. Brushing Prevents Tooth Decay (d) Keeping finger and toe nails trimmed and in good shape will prevent problems such as hang nails and infected nail beds. Feet that are cle an and dry are less likely to contract Athlete's foot. Prevent Infection Trimmed Nails PART- II: FOOD HYGIENE 8. Food hygiene is the condition and measures necessary to ensure the safety of food from production to consumption. Food can become c ontaminated at any point during slaughtering or harvesting, processing , storage, distribution, transporta tion and preparation. Lack of adequate food hygiene can lead to food borne diseases and death of consumer. 9. The five keys to safer food are listed below:- (a) Keep clean. (b) Separate raw and cooked items. (c) Cook thoroughly. (d) Keep food at safe temperatures. (e) Use safe water and raw materials. 10. Over the past years, the Five Keys to Safer Food have become an international reference source and are recognized as one of the best WHO global risk communication message. Important Components of Food Hygiene 11. Food is a potential source of infection and is liable to contamination by micro organisms at any point during its journey from the producer to the cons umer. Prevention of contamination of food has to be observed from production to handling, distribution and serving. The following are the important components of food hygiene. 296 (a) Milk Hygiene . Milk is an efficient vehicle for many disease organisms Contamination of milk may be through infected animal, human handler or environmental factors. Following aspects should be ensured to obtain clean and safe milk:- (i) The animal and its surroundings should be healthy and clean. The animal should be properly washed before milking. (ii) Milk handler should be free from any communicable disease. (iii) Milk vessels should be cleaned, sanitized and kept covered. (iv) Water supply must be safe. (v) Pasteurization . It is the heating of milk to such temperature and for such periods of time, as are required to destroy any pathogens wi thout destruction of nutritive value. It does not alter taste. (Temperature 130 C and time 1 to 2 seconds.) Hands, Contact Surfaces and Milking Equipment must be Kept Clean at all Times . (b) Meat Hygiene . The word meat includes various tissues of animal origin. The diseases which may be transmitted through meat are 'Tapeworm Infestation' and 'Bacterial infections' like anthrax, tuberculosis or food poiso ning. The animals intended for slaughter, must be subjected to proper ante mortem and post mo rtem inspection. Good meat should neither be pale pink nor deep purple nor should it be slimy. Good meat should be elastic to touch and should have agreeable colour. (c) Fish Hygiene . Fish for human consumption should be fresh. In fresh fish, the gills are bright red and the eyes are clear and prominent. Consumpt ion of contaminated fish may give rise to fish poisoning. (d) Egg Hygiene . Though the majority of freshly laid eggs are sterile inside, the egg shell may become contaminated by fecal matter from the hen. The egg must be properly washed before cooking. (e) Fruits and Vegetables Hygiene . Fruits and vegetables are an important source for the spread of pathogenic orga nisms, protozoan and helminthes. Fruits and vegetables consumed raw must be washed well before eating. Fruits and Vegetables should be Rinsed before Eating 297 (f) Hygiene of Eating Places. (i) Eating places should not be located near filthy places, open drains, animal, sheds, manure/soakage pits and other such places. (ii) Floors should be easy to clean, and should be preferably tiled. (iii) Room for storage of food should be well v entilated, insect and rat proof and should have adequate lighting. (iv) Perishable and non perishable items should be kept separately. (v) Furniture should be strong and easy to clean. (vi) Refuse should be collected in covered bins and removed regularly. (vii) Water supply should be independent, adequate and safe. (viii) Proper place for cleaning of utensils should be provided. (g) Hygiene of Food Handlers. (i) Complete medical examination of food handlers must be done at the time of employment. (ii) Regular health checkups should be done. (iii) Food handlers should be regularly edu cated on health and hygiene aspects. (iv) They should be constantly reminded about hand washing, trimming of nails, covering of hair, wearing of overalls and covering mouth while coughing and sneezing during cooking. Cleanliness and Hygiene in Restaurants CONCLUSION 12. Personal and Food hygiene are two sides of a co in, which must be ensured together for best results. These are simple steps which, if taken re gularly and correctly can be beneficial to both individuals and community as investing of time and effo rt in them can lead to saving of lives. 298 LESSON PLAN : H-3 PHYSICAL HEALTH Period - One Type - Lecture Year - I (JD/JW) Traning Aids 1. Computer slides, Pointer, Black Board and Chalk. Time Plan INTRODUCTION 3. Earlier doctors defined health simply as an absence of disease or illness. However the World Health Organization defined the term health as a complete stat e of physical, mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. AIM 4. To teach the cadets about t he importance of Physical Health. PHYSICAL HEALTH 6. Physical health is the absence of disease and infirmity and it is assessed by taking health state measurements of the body. P oor physical health can lead to an increased risk of developing mental health problems. Similarly, poor mental health can have negative impact on physical health, leading to an increased risk. 7. Elements of Good Health. Good health is an essential condit ion for a purposeful existence. The main elements of good health are:- (a) Absence of disease. (b) Ability to work har d with efficiency and enthusiasm. (c) Ability to endure stress and strain. (d) Cheerfulness. (e) Courage. (f) Freedom from anxiety. (g) Self control and self confidence. (h) Sense of well being. (j) Wholesome mental attitude. 8. Five Components of Health Related Fit by W H O . (a) Cardio-respiratory Endurance. Cardio-respiratory endurance is the ability of the body's circulatory and respiratory systems to suppl y fuel during sustained physical activity. (b) Muscular Strength . Muscular strength is the ability of t he muscle to exert force during an activity. (c) Muscular endurance . Muscular endurance is the abilit y of the muscle to withstand 2.

Health is very important aspect for all living beings. Humans have a tendency to get into bad life styles due to facilities available to them which result s in their poor health. The subject of health must be understood by all of us to remain in good health. 300 LESSON PLAN: H-4 INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES AND THEIR PREVENTION Period - Two Type - Lecture and Demonstration Term - II (JD/JW) Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Pointer, Black Board and Chalk. Time Plan 2. (a) Introduction - 03Min (b) Classification of Diseases - 35Min (c) Preventive Measures - 40Min (d) Conclusion - 02Min INTRODUCTION 3. The diseases which spread easily by vari ous modes are called contagious diseases. These diseases are the bacterial or viral origin. Many of the deadly diseases can be prevented from spreading to healthy persons if proper precautions are taken by checking infection and contagion of several diseases and by killing carriers of several other diseases. AIM 4. To teach the cadets about the different types of Infectious and Contagious Diseases and their Prevention. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conducted in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Classification of Diseases. (b) Part II - Preventive Measures. PART-I: CLASSIFICATION OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES 6. Contagious diseases (communicable di seases) can be classified as follows:- (a) Excremental Diseases . These are those diseases which are communicated through human excreta (urine and f aeces). The excreta can contami nate food, water or hands of cooks and thus pass on the infection. Typhus fever, dysentery, diarrhea, jaundice and intestinal worms are some of the important diseases belonging to this group. 301 (b) Droplet Infection . These are those diseases which are communicated or transferred through germs which are sprayed out from the nose, throat or lungs in the air, in small droplets of saliva during coughing, sneezing or even while talking. Common cold, influenza, diphtheria, meningitis, (inflammation of the brain) and tuberculosis are the common diseases in this group. (c) Contact Diseases . These are those diseases which are communicated or transferred when the germs pass from a sick person to a healthy person by actu al body contact. Venereal diseases i.e. syphilis, gonorrhea and skin infection are some common examples. (d) Insect Borne Diseases . These are those diseases which are communicated or transferred when the germs move from a sick person to a healthy person through blood sucking insects known as 'carrier s'. These insects first bite a sick person and then bite a healthy person, transferring the germs of the di seases in the blood of the healthy person. These germs then multiply in the blood of the healthy person during the period of incubation, and at the end of which he starts showing sympto ms of the disease carried by the insect. Some of the carrier insects and their disease are:- (i) Mosquito - Malaria, Dengue and Filaria. (ii) Sand fly - Sand fly fever, Kala Azar, Oriental Sore. (iii) Lice - Typhus, Relapsing Fever. (iv) Flies - Diaorreah, Dysentery, Cholera, Typhoid. (v) Fleas - Plague, Typhus. (vi) Ticks - Relapsing Fever, Typhus. 302 (e) Water Borne Diseases. Certain diseases spread due to infection carried through water. These are cholera, dy sentery, diaorreah, jaundice etc. These spread as water gets contaminated through vomits or faces passing into it. Epidemics are likely to spread if immediate steps are not taken to disinfect water and to prop erly dispose off the excreta through efficient conservancy arrangements. All sources of the diseases ought to be eliminated. (f) Animal Borne Diseases. The germs are transmitted through the agency of animals by drinking milk or through the agency of inse cts. Rabies, plague, anthrax and tuberculosis are some of the common diseases. PART-II : PREVENTIVE MEASURES 7. Specific measures to prevent diseases are as under:- (a) Prevention of Excremental & Water Born Disease. (i) Control of water route is easy by disinf ecting water or providing safe water in place. (ii) Control of the milk route is easy by su bjecting the milk to boiling or pasteurization. (iii) Food born infection may be controlled by standards of food hygiene, exclusion of sick persons from food handlings. (iv) Safe disposal of excreta will bl ock the transmission of disease by the faecal matter. (b) Prevention of Droplet Infection. This can be achieved by use of mask, proper spacing of bed, screening, dust control, avoiding of over-crowding, proper ventilation, avoiding of spiting in public places, proper sunlight and proper disinfection of air. (c) Prevention of Contact Disease. This can be achieved by:- (i) Complete segregation of patient. (ii) No direct personal contact between patient and the relatives/staff. (iii) Early diagnosis will help in preventing the spread in the patient. (iv) Proper disposal of all the excreta a nd disinfection of all articles of the patient. (d) Prevention of Insect Born Disease. (i) Filling, leveling and drainage of breeding places and water m anagement will help in eliminating larvae. Adequate collection, re moval and disposal of sewage and waste water are important in preventing culex. (ii) Use kerosene oil, fuel oil, or special oil to prevent larvae. (iii) Use of residual sprays like malathion. (iv) Use of mosquito nets, screening of doors and windows, mosquito repellant and sun down sleeves down. (v) Control the presence of rodents and fleas in and around the home. (vi) Avoid contact with any species of wild rodents, especially sick or dead rodents. (vii) Not to handle sick or dead animals or animal waste. 303 8. The following preventive measures are necessary to ward off these diseases:- (a) Segregation of the Patient. Important points are as under:- (i) Preferably shift patient to an isolated room. (ii) Ensure room confirms to hygiene and sanitation standards i.e, adequate ventilation, sunlight and cleanliness. (iv) Nominate one healthy person to undertake nursing and care of the patient. (iv) Nominated person to take preventive measures like use of mask, gown, and gloves and avoid direct contact and hand washing before and after every visit. (iv) Clothing and utensils used by patient to be cleaned / washed separately. (vi) Safe disposal of patients excreta - Ur ine, Stool, Sputum, Refuse e.g, discarded dressings, garbage etc by burning. (b) Destroy Agents (Germs) Causing Infection in the Surrounding Area or Premises. Immediately on detection of a communicable dis ease, the source of agents /germs causing infection should be destroyed by following actions :- (i) Removal / destruction of garbage. (ii) Cleaning the drains & keeping them covered. (iii) Remove/ dry out waste water. (iv) Spray malathion mixed in water (ratio:malathion - 1 ml, water 1000 ml) in and around the premises. (Caution - malathion is hi ghly poisonous. Direct breathing / touching should be avoided). Wash hands after use. (v) Keep premises free of ro dents (rats), stray dogs. (vi) Use mosquito nets, long sleev es, screening of doors and windows. (c) Disinfection . All articles in contact with the patient should be disinfected by following means:- (i) Natural. Sunlight and air can be used to disinfect articles like blanket, mattresses, pillows and also the rooms. The micro organisms thrive in darkness and need moisture for their survival, on being exposed to sunlight and air they die. (ii) Physical. Physical agents like heat, cold radiation etc. can also be used for disinfection and sterilization. (aa) Heat . Heat can be used in two ways for sterilizing. Moist Heat in the form of 'boiling' kills germs very rapidly. In addition, 'autoclaving or Steam under Pressure' is the most effective method used to disinfect all hospital equipment which can be boiled like linen, bandage, dressing material, gloves and instruments. Dry heat like flaming or use of hot ai r oven. Sterilizat ion by steam under pressure (autoclaving) is the commonest method for sterilization which is being used in the Army. 304 (ab) Cold . Freezing or freeze-drying can inac tivate bacteria. Some of them can however survive even at 0\u00b0 C. (ac) Radiation. It includes ionizing radiations like X rays, gamma beta and ultraviolet radiation. These are expens ive methods and are not suitable for small- scale procedures. (ad) Other Methods . Disinfection and sterilization can also be done by using other methods like of infrared rays, filtration etc. (iii) Chemical Agents. Chemical agents like phenol, savlon, potassium permanganate, hydrogen per oxide etc are commonly used for disinfection and sterilization. The strength of agent depends upon used concentration being used. (iv) Control of Food & Drink. Salient points to be observed while feeding the patient:- (aa) Clean water preferably boiled must be served to the patient. Water container must be kept covered. (ab) Balanced diet, well cooked, hygienically prepared food using less oil and condiments, should be served hot. Stale, cold and food exposed to flies & insects should not be served. (ac) Food items sourced from rest aurants /dhabas must not be served. (iv) Inoculation and Vaccinations . Inoculations and vaccinations are provided free of cost under various government programmes. These are administered at Primary Health Centers/Hospitals. If not available the same should be administered/ taken from market. Important inoculations and vaccination are as under:- Name of Vaccine Disease Prevented Injection Rabipur Rabies Injection TAB Typhoid Injection Hepatitis 'B' Hepatitis 'B' Injection T T Tetanus Oral Polio Polio CONCLUSION 9. Communicable diseases as the name suggests ar e most easy to prevent if timely measures are taken as recommended above. As these diseases are communicated through some carrier or agent, their spread on occurrence is difficult to control. It is advisable to always follow the prevention measures to save precious human and animal lives, national resources and effort. 305 LESSON PLAN: H-5 BASIC FIRST AID & TREATMENT OF WOUNDS Period - Four Type - Lecture and Demonstration Year - I (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

PART IV : ASPHYXIA 21. The tissue and organs of the body are suppli ed with oxygen through respiration, essential for the functioning of body. Respiration consists of inspirati on, expiration and a pause. During inspiration air is drawn inside causing the lungs to expand. During expi ration the lungs contract and air is pushed out. The respiratory system consists of the air passage known as respiratory tract and lungs. The actions of muscles concerned with respiration are controlled and regula ted by the respiratory centre of the brain. Asphyxia 22. Causes. Anything which interferes with respirati on producing irregularities in breathing, produces a condition known as Asphyxia. The main causes of Asphyxia are:- (a) Drowning - due to water entering the air passage. (b) Hanging and Strangulation - due to obstruction to entry of air. (c) Suffocation. (i) Due to obstruct ion to entry of air through the air passage. (ii) Foreign body obstruction in air passage. (iii) Inhalation of poisonous gases e.g. carbon monoxide. (d) Over dosage of drugs such as sleeping pills, morphine, pethedine. (e) Electric Shock. (f) Diseases e.g. tetanus, epilepsy, rabies. 23. Signs and Symptoms of Asphyxia . (a) Dizziness and weakness. (b) Shortness of breath rate or breathing increase. (c) Rapid pulse. (d) Partial loss of consciousness. (e) Swelling of the veins of the neck. (f) Face, lips, nails, fingers and toes turn blue. 309 24. General Rules for Treatment of Asphyxia . (a) Remove the cause if possible or the casualty from the cause. (b) Ensure that there is a free passage for air. (c) Lay the individual on his back. Press the head back-wards supporting the neck on your palm. Lift the tongue clear of the airway. Give mouth to mouth breathing. 25. First Aid for Special Cases - Drowning . (a) Wet clothes should be loosened. (b) Mouth, throat and nostril should be cleaned of mucus and any foreign body. (c) Patient should be made to lie down over his belly, face down, head turned to one side, arms stretched beyond the head, tongue pulled out. (d) Artificial respiration should be given till he starts breathing. (e) Cover the patient with a blanket. 26. First Aid in Case of Strangulation or Hanging . (a) Cut the constriction. (b) Clear the air passage. (c) Start artificial respiration. (d) Give inhalations if possible. (e) Make the patient warm and comfortable. 27. First Aid in Case of Choking. Bend the casualty's head and shoulders forward, to dislodge the obstructions. In case of small child hold him upside down and thump his back hard between the shoulder blades or encourage vomiting by passing two fingers to the back of the throat. 28. First Aid in Case of Suffocation by Poisonous Gas . Protect yourself and remove the casualty from the gas as early as possible. 29. First Aid in Case of Electric Shocks . (a) Switch off or break the current, if possible. (b) Remove the casualty from contact with the current, if possible. Stand on some insulating material such as rubber soled shoes or boots or piles of news papers. (c) Give artificial respiration. (d) Treat for shock and burns. PART V: INSENSIBILIT Y OR UNCONSCIOUSNESS 30. Insensibility or unconsciousness is caused due to inte rruption of the action of the brain, through some interference with the functions of the central nervous system. 31. Stages of Unconsciousness. (a) 1st Stage Delirium - When the restlessness of body and mind are present. 310 (b) 2nd Stage Patient responds to loud commands, gives maximum response to minimum stimulus. (c) 3rd Stage Semi- Coma- Patient responds to painful stimuli onl y (minimum response to maximum stimulus). (d) 4th Stage When the patient makes no response to any Stimulus. 32. Causes of Unconsciousness or Coma . (a) Head injury and brain Hemorrhage. (b) Hypoglycemia. (c) Heart failure. (d) Physical agents such as heat strokes, electric shocks. (e) Epilepsy. 33. General Rules of First Aid in Casualties of Unconsciousness . (a) Make the patient lie down with hea d turned to one side. Pull out his tongue. (b) Loosen the clothing, ensure fresh air. (c) If breathing has stopped or is irregular, start artificial respiration. (d) Keep the air passage clear. (f) Nothing should be given by mout h. Remove false teeth, if any. PART VI : ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION. 34. If there is any irregularity in breathing or a cardiac ar rest, artificial respiration is given. If it is given correctly and in time, the patient's life can be saved. There are three methods for providing artificial respiration, but we will tell you only about the most common one. 35. Mouth to Mouth Respiration . This is the most common and simple method and is given immediately. If given timely, it can save many lives. This can be given by following way:- (a) Casualty should be in supine position. (b) Clean the mouth and throat to maintain clear air passage. (c) Extend the neck to st raighten the air passage. (d) Cover the patient's mouth with clean gauze and blow directly and slowly into it. (10 - 12 times per minutes). PART VII : FIRST AID FOR DI FFERENT TYPE OF FRACTURES First Aid 36. In Case of Simple Fracture. The first aid to be rendered is:- (a) Reassure the patient and make him comfortable. (b) Apply splints with any common article like st ick or ply board or card board to immobilize the fracture. (c) Relieve him of discomfort and pain and keep the patient warm. 37.

Proper treatment and care of wounds is extremely important for a healthy life, especially in children because, if some wounds are not treated properly, they may cause serious diseases like gangrene or tetanus. AIM 4. To teach the cadets about the Treatment and Care of Wounds. PREVIEW 5. The class will be conduct ed in the following parts:- (a) Part I - Classification of Wounds. (b) Part II - First Aid for Wounds. (c) Part III - Dressing of Wounds. PART I : CLASSIFICATION OF WOUNDS 6. Definition . Wounds can be defined as a break in continuity of the skin or muscles membrane. It is caused by violence. 7. Classification . Wounds can be classified as under:- (a) Inside Wound. It is wound caused by a sharp instrument like knife, razor and so on. Its edges are clean. (b) Lacerated Wound . It is caused by blunt instrument. The edges are torn or uneven. 314 (c) Punctured Wound. It is a deep narrow wound caused by a pointed instrument like knife, bayonet. The wound is small on the surface but may be very deep causing injuries to internal organs. (d) Contusion. A contusion is an injury or a bruise in which some of the tissues or a part is irregularly torn or ruptured but, the skin may not be broken. It is caused by a blow or blunt instrument. PART II : FIRST AID FOR WOUNDS 8. The method for giving first aid for different types of wounds are:- (i) Place the patient in a comfortable position. (j) Stop the bleeding, if any. (k) Remove any foreign body, if it is easily visible and can be easily removed. (l) Prevent the entry of germs by applying steriliz ed dressing like first field or shell dressing. (m) Give rest to the injured part by sling. (n) Immobilize the part, if wound is large or complicated by fracture. (o) Treat the patient for shock. (p) Send the patient to nearest hospital. PART III : DRESSING OF WOUNDS 9. A wound is to be cleaned with antiseptic loti on and covered with cotton or gauze piece with medication, before applying the bandage. 10. Aim. The aim of dressing a wound is as under:- (f) To protect the wound from infection. (g) To reduce swelling and early healing. (h) To support the effected part.

In order to carryout first aid, a first aider should have basic idea of structur e and function of every part of the human body. Many lives can be saved if prope r and timely first aid is rendered. \u00be Basic knowledge of our body system allows us to understand the field of health and hygiene with ease. This knowledge provides us the basic framework on which subsequent knowledge and skills dealing with medical science can be gained in a progressive manner. \u00be Classification of Bones:- \u00be Long Bones, Short Bones, Flat Bones. \u00be Irregular Bones, Sesamoid Bones. \u00be Hygiene and Sanitation are two sides of a coin, which must be ensured together for best results. There are simple steps which, if ta ken regularly and correctly can be beneficial to both individuals and community. Investing of time and effort in them can lead to saving of lives. \u00be Components of personal Hygiene:- \u00be Proper sleep. \u00be Regular Bathing. \u00be Moderate eating and drinking. \u00be Care and cleanliness of skin, hair and teeth. \u00be Regular Exercise. \u00be Physical and Mental Health . \u00be Physical health is the absence of dise ase and infirmity and it is assessed by taking health state measurement of the body. \u00be Mental health refers to the successful performance of mental function resulting in productive activities. \u00be Communicable diseases are easy to prevent if, timely measures are taken. As these diseases are communicated through some carrier or agent, their spread on occurrence is difficult to control. Always follo w the preventive measures to save precious human and animal lives. \u00be Excremental, droplet, contact, insect borne, water borne and animal borne diseases are various types of communicable diseases. \u00be Food borne infection may be controlled by standards of food hygiene. \u00be Exclusion of sick person from food handlings. \u00be Chemical agents like phenol, savlon, potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide etc are commonly used for disinfec tion and sterilization. \u00be Important inoculations & vaccinatio ns are provided free of cost under various.Government programmes. \u00be All the contagious diseases c an be prevented by adapting certain 320 preventive measures such as keeping the atmosphere, water bodies, and home surroundings clean by using various cleaning and safe disp osal processes and periodical inoculation and vaccination right from infancy. \u00be First aid is a very simple and effective method which, a trained NCC Cadet, can save precious lives under various life threatening situations. The crucial aspects are promptness and correctness in administrating firs t aid. A NCC cadet who reaches the victim must first quickly investigate the cause and type of in jury before attempting to administer first aid. \u00be First Aid in Snake Bite. \u00be Make the victim lie down comfortably. \u00be Give convincing reassurance against fear of death. \u00be Apply a light constricting tourniquet with hand kerchief. \u00be Wash with soap and water. \u00be Use water freely. \u00be Evacuate the patient quickly to the nearest dispensary or hospital. \u00be If breathing fails, start artificial respiration. \u00be Wounds are common features among human who are outdoor oriented. If cared properly during early stage the wound heal qui ckly.NCC cadets by virtue of their routine are prone to injuries and hence must pass this basic knowledge to help fellow cadets or friends in school or at home. \u00be Classification of Wounds. \u00be Inside wound. \u00be Puncture means to join/to unite/to attach. \u00be Yoga should be performed as exercise or alternative medicine for many ailments. \u00be Meditation and simple breathing exercise (without breath-holding) are safe and can help children to manage stress, impulsiveness, and emotional situations. \u00be There are innumerable asanas which are useful for curing ailments and maintain go good health. 321 Comprehension Questions Q.1 Answer the following in about 15 words: (a) Write about the function of bones.

The following guidelines and procedures are required to be followed for the safe conduct of the cycling or cycli ng expedition / tours:- (a) Qualified Supervision . All unit, district, council, and national event activities must be supervised by a mature adult who understands and knowingly accepts responsibility for the safety of children in his or her care, who is experienced with the skills and equipment involved in the activity, and who is commi tted to compliance with safety guidelines. (b) Physical Fitness . Biking is strenuous activity; all participants must present evidence of fitness. (c) Helmets and Clothing . All cyclists must wear a properly sized and fitted helmet. Layer your clothing for warmth on cool days so you can avoid chilling or overheating. Cover up for sun protection on clear days. (d) Buddy System . When the program activity is a bicycle expedition or trek, the buddy system must be used. When a program element emphasizes individual performance skills, one buddy observes while the other takes his turn . In competitive activity where the buddy concept cannot be applied practically, all acti vity must be directly observed by the adult supervisor. (Youth members should be taught that biking with a buddy is the best.) (e) Position in Traffic . Ride with the traffic flow, as far to the left as is safe. Obey all traffic laws, signs, signals, and st reet markings. Watch for changes in road conditions. Keep your head and ears open and do not wear headphones while riding. (f) Turns and Intersections . Look left, right, back, and ahead before turning. Stop and search all directions when enteri ng a street from a driveway, parking area, sidewalk, or alley. Signal all turns using universal hand signals. Walk your bike through or across busy intersections. (g) Equipment . Ride only a bike that fits you. Sele ct a bike that permits youto put both feet on the ground while st anding over the top tube. The handgrips should be no higher than your shoulders or lower than your seat. (i) Bicycle Accessories . Every bike needs a horn or bell and reflectors (front, back, landsides). Items should be carried only in baskets, in saddlebags, or on a rear carrier rack. If you must ride in traffic, a helmet-mounted mirror is recommended. For long trips, a bike-mounted container for drinking water is recommended. (ii) Maintenance . Keep your bike clean and well maintained, especially the brakes and drive chain. (h) Racing . Open street racing is dangerous. Race only with supervision on marked courses that have been set up to exclude other vehi cle or pedestrian traffic, to eliminate fall hazards and minimize collision risks. Cl early define \"start\" and \"finish\" points. (j) Discipline . All participants should know, understand, and follow the rules and procedures for safe biking, and all partic ipants should conscientiously and carefully follow all directions from the adult supervisor. pavement required). PART III : ROCK CLIMBING 11. Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing comp etitions have objectives of completing the route in the quickest possible time or the farthe st along an increasingly difficult route. 330 SAFETY TIPS 12. Use the following 10 tips to keep safe when you're out rock climbing:- (a) Always Check Harnesses . After you've geared up, al ways check that both the climber's and belayers' harness buckles are doubled back. (b) Always Check Knots . Before you start climbing, always double check that leader's tie-in knot right and finished with a backup knot. Also check that the rope is threaded through both the harness waist loop and the leg loops. (c) Always Wear a Helmet . A climbing helmet is essential if you want to live long and prosper. Always wear one when climbing or belaying. Helmet s protect your head from falling rocks and from the impact of falling. (d) Always Check the Rope and Belay Device . Before you lead a route, always double check that the rope is proper ly threaded through the belay device. Also, always make sure the rope and belay device are attached with a locking carabineer to the belayers' harness. (e) Always Use a Long Rope . Make sure your climbing rope is long enough to reach the anchors and lower back down on a sport route or to reach a belay ledge on multi-pitch routes. (f) Always Bring Enough Gear . Before you climb a route, always eyeball it from the ground and determine what you need to bring. (g) Always Climb With the Rope Over Your Leg . When you're leading, always make sure the rope is over your leg rather than between them or behind one. If you fall with the rope in this position, you will flip upsi de down and hit your head. Wear a helmet for protection. (h) Always Properly Clip the Rope . Make sure you always clip your rope through carabineers on quick draws correctly. (i) Always Use Safe Anchors . At the top of a pitch or route, always use at least two anchors. Three is better. Redundancy keeps you al ive. On a sport route, always use locking carabineers if you're lowering down to top-rope off the anchors. CONCLUSION 13. Trekking is a very enjoyable and satisfying adventurous activity in which proper health and fitness is an absolute must for every trekker. Cy cling is a very efficient and effective mode of transportation, optimal for short to moderate di stances. Rock Climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often test s a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. It can be a dangerous sport and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and usage of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes. 331 SUMMARY \u00be Adventure activities have been incorporated in NCC training with the aim of inculcating and strengthening leadership tr aits amongst the cadets. \u00be Trekking is very enjoyable and satisfying adv enture activity in which proper health and fitness is an absolute mu st for every trekkers Safety Tips for Trekkers . \u00be Before heading for your trekking trip study w hether forecast of that area.

A naturalresource is any useful product which is produced by nature and is essent ial for our aily life. Natural resources can be classified in different ways as per their nature or availability or type. A few examples of natural resources are air, water, wood, oil, solar energy, windenergy, fossil fuels, minerals and coal. Refined oil is not a natural resource since humans create it. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about Natural resources, their conservation and management. PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conducted in following parts:- (a) Part I - Basic Informatio n of Natural Resources and Types of Resources. (b) Part II - Conservation and Management of Natural Resources. PART I : BASIC INFORMATION OF NAT URAL RESOURCES AND TYPES OFRESOURCES 6. Natural resources can be classified by various methods, which includes:- (a) Source of origin. (b) Stage of development and by their renewability. 336 Classification 7. Natural resources are basically classified as either renewable or non-renewable:- (a) Renewable Resources. Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human time scale such as solar, hydropower, biomass, geot hermal and wind energy. Renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas: electricity regeneration, air and water heating, motor fuels, and rural energy servic es. Thus renewable resources are resources which can be used repeatedly because it is refilled naturally. (b) Non-Renewable Resources. These are re-sources which are formed extremely slowly and those which do not naturally form in the environment. Most common non-renewable resources are Minerals and Fossil Fuels. Thus non-renewable resources are the resources that cannot be re-made, re-grown or re-generated. 337 Classification of Natural Resources on the Basis of Origin 8. Resources can be further classified on the basis of origin as under: (a) Biotic . Biotic resources are obtained from the biosphere (living and organic material), such as forests & animals and the materials that can be obtained from them. Fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum are also included in this category because they are formed from decayed organic matter. (b) Abiotic . Abiotic resources are those that come from non-living, non-organic material. Examples of abiotic res ources include land, fresh water, air and heavy metals including ores such as gold, iron, copper, silver, etc. Classification of Natural Resources on th e Basis of Their Stage of Development 9. On the basis of their stage of development, natural resources can be divided in the following types: (a) Potential Resources . Potential resources are those that exist in a region and maybe used in the future. For example, petrol eum may exist in many parts of India, having sedimentary rocks but until the time it is actually drilled out and put into use, it remains a potential resource. (b) Actual Resources . Actual resources are those that have been surveyed, theirquantity and quality determined and ar e being used in present times. The development of an actual resource, such as wood processing depends upon the technology available and the cost involved. (c) Reserve Resources . The part of an actual resource which can be developedprofitably in the future is called a reserve resource. (d) Stock Resources . Stock resources are those that have been surveyed butcannot be used by organisms due to lack of technology. For example, hydrogen. PART-II: CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Need for Management and Conservation of Natural Resources 10. Most of natural resources on earth, especi ally the non renewable resources, have a finite limit. Extreme use of these may deprive the futu re generations for their use. It is therefore extremely essential that we not only conserve natural resources but also plan their proper management so that the longevity of these resour ces increases. Some of the major effects of unrestricted use of natural resources are as under: (a) Ozon atmospher e (CFCs), us aerosol sp Since the radiation, u 290 and 3 2 depletion o f (b) Effe ozone dep l reaches t o animals, pl a (i) ph y CO (ii) (iii) the (iv) (v) (c) Soil and rock a r processes transporte d erosion is deforestati o dramaticall y soil erosio n gradual tr a decreases degradatio n collapse d u (d) Aci d precipitatio n possesses by emissio n and nitrog e in the atm o acid rain c a such as b r causing tot ane Depletio n e decreases ed in refrig e rays, are r a ozone laye r ultraviolet B 20nm, passi n f the ozone l ect of Ozon e letion harmf u o earth wh i ants, aquati c Effect ytoplankton, O2 in atmosp h Effect o n Effects o e Earth's su r Effect s more p other i increa s Erosion.

Global warming is a phenomenon associated with the increase of earths' temperature. One of the major ca uses of global warming has been excessive production of Greenhouse gases. A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared r ange. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth'satmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. Green house gases have a great affect on the earth's temperature. Methods of Management and Conservation of Natural Resources 11. Following methods contribute toward s efficient conservation of resources:- (a) Recycling . This is a method by which some of the resources can be conserved byrecycling them or reusing them by adopting certain methods as under:- (i) Recycling of paper will reduce the burden on trees. (ii) Recycling of water including sewage will reduce theburden on sub soil / fresh water for irrigation. (iii) Recycling of metal or plastic waste will conserve metal resources. (b) Water Harvesting . This method can be used for storing rainwater which can be used later. In villages, storing of rain water in ponds will increase the level of sub soil water. (c) Aforestation . This leads toplanting more seeds or trees to make a forest on land which has not been a forest recently, or which has never been a forest and avoid cutting of trees. Benefits of Aforestation:- (i) It restores ecological balance of all eco systems. (ii) It maintains biological diversity. (iii) It acts as catchment for the soil and water conservation.

(g) Developing environmental consciousness amongst common people through posters, hoardings and environmental awareness campaigns. CONCLUSION 13. Natural resources are Mother Nature's gift to mankind. These need to be used with attention. Large scale industrialization, urb anization and massive increase in population are leading to depletion of these meager resources. Natural resources are to be conserved and managed judiciously. 342 LESSON PLAN: E 2 WATER CONSERVATION AND RAINWATER HARVESTING Training Aids 1. Computer slides, Projector, Char ts, Pointer.

Water is a very important and precious resource for life. Water Conservation covers policies, strategies and activities to manage fresh water as a sustainable resource, to protect the water environment and to meet current and future human demands. Population growth, household size and effect the quantity of water that is consumed. Factors such as climate change will increase pressures on natural water resources, especially in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation. Water is fast becoming insu fficient due to increase in population, industries and agricultural activities and due to poor rainfall. AIM 4. To acquaint the cadets about Water Conservation and Rain Water Harvesting. PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conducted in following parts:- (a) Part I - Water Conservation. (b) Part II - Rain Water Harvesting. Period - One Type - Lecture Term - I (JD / JW) 343 PART - I : WATER CONSERVATION Need for Water Conservation 6. No other natural resource has had such an overwhelming response on the history of mankind as much as Water. As human population increases, the desire for a better standard of living will increase the demands of fresh water resources. 7. Much of the world's fr esh water is consumed by the agricultural, industrial and domes tic sectors. The failure in useful managing this resource to meet the increasing water demands of these sectors has resu lted in a situation of crisis in many parts of the world. In many parts of India, freshwater crisis already exists. 8. With only 1% of water available for human consumption, we must treat our water supply with more respect. Water conservation should not be considered an option any longer but is an inescapable necessity. Current circumstances require our full attention, if we hope to thrive as a civilization. Much of the world is currently suffering due to a lack of clean water. Therefore, it is extremely important to seek out, find and start using all the innovative water conservation solutions and methods that are available today. 9. Ways to Conserve Water Indoors. The best place to start Water Conservation is one's own house. Certain measures wh ich can be adopted at home are:- (a) Ensure that there are no leaks in your house, in the pipelines, taps and toilets. (b) Use water efficient flushes and if possible, toilets with dual flushing systems. (c) Close taps while brushing your t eeth, shaving or soaping your face. (d) Use water from washing of clothes for cleaning floors. (e) Use appropriate amount of detergent for washing clothes. (f) Close the shower tap while soaping your body. (g) While washing the dishes by hand, don't let the water run while rinsing. Fill one sink with wash wa ter and the other with rinse water. (h) Monitor your water bill for unusually high use. Your bill and water meter are tools that can help you discover leaks. (i) Water your lawn and garden in the morning or evening when temperature is cooler to minimize evaporation Other Practices for Water Conservations Water Conservation Practi ces for Water Utilities . Common practices used by water supply utilities include metering, leak detection, repairing water lines, well capping, retrofitting programs, pricing, waste-water reuse and developing public education programs and drought management plans. Judicious Use Of Water For Irrigation 344 10. Agricultural Water Conservation Practices . Practices such as drip irrigation can save large quantities of water. Careful and judicious use of water for irrigation can lead to irrigating much more land. 11. Industrial and Commercial Water Conservation Practices. Industries could save copious amounts of water by installing water recycling systems. Cooling Water Recirculation and Wash Water Recycling are the most widely used water recycling practices. 12. Other Methods to initiate Water Conservation would include, public awareness programmes, nukkad natak and community dramas and water audits. Rainwater harvesting is one of the most successful te chniques being used in India. PART - II : RAIN WATER HARVESTING 13. Rainwater harvesting means capturing the runoff of the rainwater in our own house, village, town or city. It basically means accumulati on and storage of rainwater for reuse, before it reaches the aquifer. Utilization includes water for garden, livestock, irrigat ion, etc. In many places, the water collected is just redirected to a deep pit with percolation. The harvested water can be used for drinking water also, if the stora ge is a tank that can be accessed and cleaned when needed. Need for Rainwater Harvesting 14. India is in a state of water crisis, both in rural and urban areas. Floods and droughts go hand in hand in our country, which causes water shortage. Rainwater is a pure form of water if stored properly and can greatly reduce the pressures on treated water supply. Rainwater harvesting is therefore extremely es sential for the following reasons:- (a) It helps to recharge sub soil and groundwater thus increasing the level of the water. (b) It helps to create large quantity of pollu tion free clean water that can be stored in huge tanks or ponds for use later on. In cities, it reduces the dependency on treated water supply to a great extant. (c) It ensures ready supply of water on the land surface thereby reducing dependence on the groundwater. Types of Rainwater Harvesting Systems 15. There are a number of ways to harvest rainwater, ranging from very simple to the complex industrial systems. Generally, rainwater is either harvested from the ground or from a roof.

Some of the reasons why rainwater harvesting can be adopted in cities are to provide supplemental water for the city's requirement s, to increase soil moisture levels for urban greenery to increase the ground water table through artificial recharge, to mitigate urban flooding and to improve the quality of groundwater . In urban areas of the developed world, at a household level, harvested rainwater can be used for flushing toilets, washing laundry, showering or bathing. It may however require some treatment before it can be used for drinking. CONCLUSION 18. Water is the only resource for which there is no alternative. Earth sustains life primarily because there is water available on the earth. I nefficient management of this important natural resource has caused a situation of crisis in many parts of the world including India, therefore it is very important that we conserve this unique natural gift to mankind. 347 LESSON PLAN: E 3 WASTE MANAGEMENT Period - One Type - Lecture Term - II (JD/JW) Training Aids 1.

PREVIEW 5. The lecture will be conducted in following parts:- (a) Part I - Type of Waste. (b) Part II - Disposal and Management of Waste . PART - I : TYPE OF WASTE 6. Waste material can be of following types:- (a) Solid Waste . This can be further classified into different types depending on theirsource as under: :- (i) Household waste is generally classified as municipal. (ii) Industrial waste as hazardous waste. (iii) Biomedical waste or hospital waste as diseas e causing waste. 348 (iv) Electronic wastes such as TV's, refrigerators and computers. (b) Liquid Waste. This can be classified into following types:- (i) Chemicals released by industries. (ii) Waste water released by households through the sewer lines. (c) Radioactive Waste . These arethose wastes that containradioactive material.Radioactive wastes are usually by-products of nuclear pow er generation and other applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. Radioa ctive waste is hazardous to most forms of life and the environment and is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment. (d) Municipal Solid Waste. Municipal solid wastes consist of household waste,and waste fr om the streets. This garbage is generated mainly from the residential and commercial complexes. This waste comprises of:- (i) Organic waste such as vegetable and fruit peels, leftover foodstuff, etc. (ii) Paper. (iii) Cotton and Woolen clothes. (iv) Wood. (v) Plastic Bags. (vi) Tin, aluminum and other metal items such as cans. (vii) Glass Bottles. (e) Hospital or Bio-Medical Waste . Hospital waste is generated during the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals or in research activities in these fields or in the production orbiological testing. It may include Soiled Waste, Disposables, Anatomical Waste, Discarded Medicines and Chemical Wastes. (f) E-Waste . Electronic waste or E-waste as it is popularly called is a collectiveterminology for the entire stream of electronic wast es such as Used TV's, Refrigerators, Telephones, Ai r Conditioners, Computers, Mobile Phones etc. (g) Hazardous Waste . Sources of hazardous waste mainly include industries liketextile, tannery, petrochemicals, pharmaceutic als, pesticides, paint and dye, petroleum, fertilizers, asbestos, caustic soda, inorganic chemicals and general engineering industries. Hazardous wastes contain heavy metals, cyanides, pesticides, complex aromatic compounds (such as PCBs), and other chemicals which are toxic, reactive, corrosive or have a serious damaging effect on the environment. 349 PART II: DISPOSAL AND MANAGEMENT OF WASTE Actions by Individuals 7. Some steps which all individuals can take while contributing to the waste management may include:- (a) Separation of household waste into bio-degradable and non- bio-degradable. (b) Reduce use of plastic bags and replace with paper or jute/cloth bags. (c) Recyclable waste such as paper, glass, cloth etc could be segregated and disposed off accordingly. (d) Keep the surroundings of your house and around the house clean. Do not dump waste just outside the house on the road. (e) Colonies could start vermin-composting and natural composting. (f) What is waste for you is wealth for somebody else. There has been a tradition in India of finding an innovative use for everythi ng -tyres, battery cases, plastic bins and what not. Think of reuse of the thi ng you would like to discard. Actions by Civic Bodies 8. The major functions of civic body may include the following:- (a) Prohibiting littering of street. (b) Organizing house to house waste collection. (c) Conducting awareness programs to spread information to public. (d) Providing sufficient community storage facilities. (e) Use of colour code bins and promotion of waste separation. (f) Transportation of wastes in covered vehicles. (g) Processing of wastes by adopting suitable combination of composting, an aerobic digestion, pelletization etc. (h) Upgradation of the existing dum p sites and disposal of inert wastes sanitary landfills. CONCLUSION 9. Water is the only resource for which there is no alternative. Earth sustains life primarily because there is water available on the earth. I nefficient management of this important natural resource has caused a situation of crisis in many parts of the world including India; therefore it is very important that we conserve this unique natural gift to mankind. 350 SUMMARY \u00be A natural resource is any useful product wh ich is produced by nature and is essential for our daily life. \u00be Natural resources are basically classified as either renewable or non-renewable. \u00be Renewable resources: Solar energy, Air, Wind, Water, Tides, Soil, Plants etc. \u00be Non-renewable resources: Fossil fuels, Oil, Coal, Natural gas, Minerals, Iron, Copper, Phosphates, Aluminum etc. \u00be Resources can be further classified on the basis of origin as Biotic and Abiotic. \u00be Biotic resources: Plants, Animals, Fungi, Bacteria etc. \u00be Abiotic resources: Sunlight, Air, Water, Soil, Temperature etc. \u00be On the basis of their stage of developm ent, natural resources can be divided as: Potential, Actual, Rese rve and Stock resources. \u00be Major effects of unrestricted use of natural resources are : Ozone depletion, Soil erosion, Acid rain, Global Warming etc. \u00be Methods towards efficient conservation of natur al resources are: Recy cling, Aforestation, Water harvesting, Waste management, Greater Use of Renewable Sources, Avoid Wastage, Use of energy efficient vehicles or equipment etc. \u00be Types of Rainwater Harvesting Systems: Ground Catchment Systems, Roof Catchment Systems, Subsurface Dyke etc. \u00be Advantages of Rainwater Harvesting: Reduce runoff of water, preserve ground water, reduce environmental losses, lessen dr ought period and plan for sustainability. \u00be Waste Management refers to the collection, transport, processing or disposal, managing and monitoring of waste materials. \u00be Types of Waste: Solid waste, Liquid wast e, Municipal waste, E-waste, Bio-medical waste, Radioactive waste, Hazardous Waste etc. 351 Comprehension Questions Q1.
