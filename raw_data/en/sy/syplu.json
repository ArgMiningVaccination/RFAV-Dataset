Conventional drugs often have side effects, and pathogens are becoming resistant to these types of drugs. In such circumstances, the study of traditional medicinal plants is an effective and logical strategy for finding new herbal medicines. One such herb is Plantago major, a perennial plant in the Plantaginaceae family that is found throughout the world. The Plantago major plant has been used as a medicine for the treatment of various diseases. Studies have shown that plant extracts of Plantago major exhibit antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory effects, and have wound-healing properties. This review collects and presents the results of various studies of Plantago major plant extracts with antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing properties, which demonstrate a wide range of therapeutic possibilities of Plantago major plant extracts and have a huge potential for use as a medicinal raw material.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-01", "cleaned_text": "Plantago major is one of these herbs whose value has been praised since time immemorial [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Plantago major (Plantago major ssp. Major L.) is a perennial plant belonging to the Plantagina'ceae family ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-01092-f001)) [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Plantago major was once distributed mainly in Europe and North and Central Asia, and is now widely distributed throughout the world [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-16-01092), [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-16-01092), [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Plantago major has been used to treat a variety of diseases, including infectious diseases [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-01092), [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. It is reported that Plantago major has of drug-resistant pathogens in recent decades has prompted scientists to evaluate the effects of medicinal plants on pathogens [ [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. The study of plants traditionally used as medicines should still be seen as a useful and logical research strategy in the search for new antimicrobials and other anti-infectives [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Conventional chemicals have numerous side effects compared to their herbal counterparts [ [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-01092), [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Plant extracts are an attractive alternative as they are a rich source of biodegradable secondary metabolites such as phenols, flavonoids and saponins, alkaloids, etc., which have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, wound-healing and antiviral properties and reduce the likelihood of disease [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-01092), [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-16-01092), [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-16-01092), [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. The main purpose of this review is to introduce the wide therapeutic potential of Plantago major extracts and the possibility of their use as herbal medicines. 2. Methods 3. Phytoconstitutions [Figure 3](#pharmaceuticals-16-01092-f003)). The seeds, leaves, flowers, and roots of the plant, as well as practically every other part of it, contain these compounds approach was used in the study by Abbasi et al. (2022) to assess the antibacterial activity of Plantago major extracts against Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as their capacity to affect the expression of the Tox-A gene. The results showed that the raw extracts had good antibacterial activity when compared to other fractionated plant extracts. Plantago major has an average zone of inhibition of up to 16 mm against P. aeruginosa at 1000 mg/mL. In comparison to the aqueous extract, which displayed an inhibition zone, petroleum ether, and chloroform had a minor inhibitory effect. The Tox-A gene expression value was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced at most plant concentrations [ [52](#B52-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [53](#B53-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. However, in vivo tests of antimicrobial activity and the minimum effective dose of hexane, methanol, ethanol, and an aqueous extract of Plantago major leaves by Akku and Hizi\u00e7ekliyurt (2021) revealed that all extraction techniques of Plantago major leaves have activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida tropicalis, and Candida albicans at 4 mg/mL. Extracts of Plantago major in methanol and ethanol were more effective than those in hexane and water. The lowest activity (8 mg/mL) against the bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas vulgaris was found in the Plantago major hexane and aqueous extract. The antibacterial properties of Plantago major ethanol and methanol extracts were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aerouginosa at 2 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL, respectively [ [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Additionally, an ethanolic extract of Plantago major leaves is effective in inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 at dosages of 250 mg/mL, and 1000 mg/mL [ [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Furthermore, methanolic extracts of Plantago major leaves showed higher antibacterial activity than aqueous and alcoholic extracts in studies conducted by Soliman et al. (2022). A methanolic extract of Plantago major leaves from canal banks displayed the highest efficacy against P. aeruginosa, followed by an extract from orchards against Staphylococcus aureus [ [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Plantago major leaf extracts can inhibit microorganisms because they contain flavonoid components, phenols, tannins, and terpenoids, which all function together synergistically. Through the peptidoglycan of bacteria, chemicals can enter the cell and influence the cytoplasmic membrane. Due to the leakage of cytosolic fluid, structural changes in the membrane occur, including fluidity alterations and changes in the outer layer of the cell wall. This is the first step in the inhibitory process for phenolic, flavonoid, and isoflavonoid compounds. This leak induced morphological alterations in the bacterial cells, including death [ [57](#B57-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. However, an alcohol extract of Plantago major seeds gathered in Semnan Province (Iran) was found to have antibacterial activity in a study by Mirkalantari and Fateh (2018) [ [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. The lowest concentration of Plantago major's alcoholic extract, which inhibits Staphylococcus aureus growth, was 100 mg/mL with an inhibition diameter of 13 mm. However, the acetone extract of Plantago major seeds had a stronger antibacterial effect than its alcoholic extract, and it showed an antibacterial effect on Streptococcus mutans at a concentration of 1 mg/mL with an average diameter of the growth inhibition zone of 6 \u00b1 0.2 mm. This was demonstrated by the antibacterial properties of Plantago major seed extracts in vitro against S. mutans at eight different concentrations of acetone and ethanol. This extract had an MBC and MIC of 1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively. At a dosage of 0.5 mg/mL and an average inhibition zone diameter of 8.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm, the alcoholic extract of Plantago major seeds inhibited the growth of S. mutans. This extract had an MBC and MIC of 8 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL, respectively. At greater doses of both extracts, growth in the diameter of the zone of inhibition was seen. The chlorhexidine (CHC) growth inhibition zone had an average diameter of 24 mm [ [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. The antimicrobial effect of an aqueous-alcoholic extract of Plantago major (a native strain of Khorasan, Iran) on Streptococcus mutans also showed good antimicrobial activity and an average growth inhibition zone diameter of 15 \u00b1 1 mm. At a dosage of 1.56 mg/mL, a large seed extract containing zinc oxide nanoparticles exhibited antibacterial action. The average inhibitory zone diameter for the same extract at the same concentration but without zinc oxide nanoparticles was 7.67\u00b1 0.57 mm ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-01092-t001)) [ [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. In another study of the crude extract and aqueous phase of the seeds of the plant Plantago major growing in the territory of Turkey, it was found that the crude extract and the aqueous phase of Plantago major have a weak antimicrobial effect on S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, S. pyogenes, and E. coli, compared with the highest bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect on individual populations of bacteria of the ethyl acetate fraction. During the study, the total content of phenols and flavonoids was found in the composition, which may be the cause of activity [ [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Plantago major demonstrated a MIC for S. aureus and E. coli of 6.25 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL, respectively, in a broth microdilution test [ [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Plantago major seeds include phenolic compounds, tannins, and flavonoids that provide seed extracts with a strong antibacterial effect. These compounds have the antibacterial qualities of inhibiting the synthesis of DNA and RNA since the B ring of flavonoids makes hydrogen bonds with the bases of nucleic acids to prevent the formation of new nucleic acids. The findings of decreased fluidity of cell membranes in the presence of flavonoids support the idea that flavonoids have an inhibitory effect on how the cytoplasmic membrane operates. Another way that flavonoids work to inhibit bacterial growth is by blocking energy metabolism. By disrupting energy metabolism, lipidchalcones may affect how much energy is required for metabolite uptake or the synthesis of macromolecules. Another secondary active metabolite, phenol, prevents bacterial development because of its toxicity. The amount of hydroxyl groups attached to the phenol group controls how harmful phenols are to microorganisms since higher hydroxylation results in increased toxicity. Microbe toxicity may be brought on by non-specific interactions of phenols with proteins or by the inhibition of enzymes brought on by the reaction of oxidized compounds with sulfhydryl groups. Tannin is a class of polyphenolic chemicals that binds to various organic materials like proteins and amino acids via covalent, hydrogen, and hydrophobic interactions. Thus, tannin's ability to inactivate microbial adhesins and transport proteins or enzymes accounts for its antibacterial properties [ [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. However, investigations by Metiner et al. (2012) showed that all the bacteria utilized in the study\u2014aside from E. coli and B. cereus\u2014are resistant to the ethanol extract of Plantago major's roots [ [66](#B66-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. At the same time, two strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in vitro were inhibited by ethanol extracts of the root of Plantago major at doses of 75% and 100%. In contrast to 70\u00b0 alcohol, where bacterial inhibition was not seen, inhibition 14.9 mm chlorhexidine +0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride was used [ [67](#B67-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Additionally, evaluation of the antibacterial activity of Plantago major's root methanol extracts at various concentrations (1000, 500, 250, and 125 mg/mL) on six different bacterial strains, including Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus sp., revealed a zone of inhibition within 25 \u00b1 1.3 and 10 \u00b1 0.6 mm ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-01092-t001)) [ [68](#B68-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. The biological activity and therapeutic advantages of Plantago major roots are influenced by the characteristics of the chemically active constituents. Polysaccharides and polyphenols may have biological effects, according to some research. However, it is not apparent how precisely bacteria are suppressed, or which bio-active compound is most crucial. [69](#B69-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Also, agar disk diffusion research on hydroalcoholic Plantago major extracts revealed antibacterial activity against Aid\u00ae (chlorhexidine 0.012%) (22.0 mM), hydroalcoholic extracts at (25 g/mL and 50 g/mL) displayed greater antibacterial activity. The hydroalcoholic extract of Plantago major at a concentration of 25 g/mL had the maximum activity. Etanolic and hydroalcogolic Plantago major contain and glycosides like aucubin and catalpol among their active ingredients. The active component aucubigenin, which is generated from aucubin, is crucial because, during catabolism, it creates a dialdehyde that acts as a bactericide by denaturing the proteins of oral bacteria and plaque colonizers. It also has various flavonoids, of which acteoside and plantamajoside have antibacterial properties [ [70](#B70-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using Plantago major plant extracts also shows promising antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli bacteria at a dosage of 20 \u00b5g/mL [ [72](#B72-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. A very crucial antibacterial mechanism is oxidative stress. Ag NPs can generate superoxide radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and hydroxyl ions, all of which can quickly destroy microorganisms. The disruption of the cell membrane, penetration of the cell membrane, and binding to DNA and protein result in ROS. Ag NPs' antibacterial activity is most likely caused by their surface charge, which attracts negatively charged bacteria [ [73](#B73-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [74](#B74-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. 5. Antiviral and Antifungal Effects [75](#B75-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. In another study, Chiang et al. (2003) also tested the antiviral activity of Plantago major hot water extracts in vitro against herpes viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2), adenoviruses (ADV-3, ADV-8, and ADV-11). The results showed that the hot water extract of Plantago major had a significant inhibitory activity also against viral infection (HSV-2 and ADV-11), which confirms the previous results and the high antiviral activity of Plantago major. The low antiviral activity of the aqueous extract of Plantago major can be explained by the low concentration of phenolic compounds present in the extract. The results on the time effect between 0 and 12 h after infection with the virus showed that caffeic acid tends to inhibit the replication of the virus. This suggests that the mode of action is not due to inhibition of viral absorption, but due to viral replication after infection. Phenolic compounds exhibit the best antiviral and antiadenoviral activity of the five chemical classes studied. Contrary to substances with one hydroxyl group at the R1 position, such as ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid, substances with two hydroxyl groups at the R1 and R2 positions of the cinnamic acid fragment, such as caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, displayed a wider spectrum of antiviral activity. Thus, the spectrum of antiviral activity of phenolic compounds containing a cinnamic acid fragment is associated with the number of hydroxyl groups in positions R1 and R2. The property of direct antiviral action, strengthening of cellular immunity, and secretion of interferon can explain the reason for the antiviral activity of the Plantago major [ [76](#B76-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [77](#B77-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. High-concentration alcoholic extracts of plantain 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/mL. have antifungal properties. In the presence of 30 mg/mL, the diameter of the growth halo increased to 12.4 mm. As for the MIC, MIC50, and MIC90 indicators, they are 38, 14, and 29 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Taking into account the number of living cells, the smallest number of living cells was formed when taking 10 mg/mL. The average value of this indicator was obtained for Planatago major 4.2 CFU/mL [ [78](#B78-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. The alcoholic extract of Plantago major is also involved in the fight against fungal infections within a group of fungal strains. Maximum growth inhibition (32.2%) was obtained against P. cinnamomi at 2000 \u00b5g/mL followed by C. gloeosporioides (25.7%) on Day 6 and C. godetiae and C. nymphaeae (21.1%) on Day 9 [ [79](#B79-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. 6. Anti-Inflammatory Activities [80](#B80-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. In addition, water and ethanol-based extracts of Plantago major leaves have an anti-inflammatory effect on oral epithelial cells in vitro. Concentration 0.1 mg/mL (with total phenols content of 1.67, 0.22, and 0.94 mg and content of 1.24, 0.19, and 0.71 mg GAE plantamaoside per ml for ethanolic, aqueous, and combination of both extracts, respectively) exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory activity against oral epithelial cells (OEC H400). The anti-inflammatory response was reduced or absent at both the lower and higher concentrations tested. The fact that the total phenol content and plantamajoside content of the ethanol-based extract at 0.01 mg/mL (0.12 mg plantamajoside and total phenol content of 0.17 mg GAE per mL) is comparable to the plantamajoside and total phenol content of the extracts water-based at 0.1 mg/mL, but there is a significant difference between the anti-inflammatory response of both extracts in vitro, indicating that not only total phenols and plantamajoside but also other water-soluble components (possibly polysaccharides) are responsible for the ultimate wound-healing and anti-inflammatory effects of Plantago major. However, both the ethanol-based and mixed forms of the water- and ethanol-based extracts demonstrated anti-inflammatory action at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL [ [81](#B81-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [82](#B82-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Along with this, Plantago major leaf extracts attenuate inflammatory activity in the inflammatory response following acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity. The anti-inflammatory activity of ethanol, aqueous, comparison to the treated groups, the APAP group had considerably higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, and TNF-). Before leukocyte migration into tissues, IL-1 and TNF- that are generated by active macrophages stimulate leukocyte adhesion to endothelial surfaces. TNF- and IL-1 frequently express synergistic action to initiate cell death. The plasma levels of TNF- and IL-1 indicate how severe the inflammation is. The partial avoidance of APAP toxicity demonstrated by the suppression of TNF- and IL-1 includes a decrease in the amount of liver enzyme in circulation. The TNF- and IL-1 levels were lower in the Plantago major treated groups. The methanol extract treated group saw a more pronounced impact, which was consistent with Plantago major's in vitro anti-inflammatory properties. It indicated that the anti-inflammatory property of the Plantago major was able to prevent the inflammatory reaction following APAP toxicity. It showed that the anti-inflammatory ability of Plantago major might stop the inflammatory response brought on by APAP poisoning. The liver contains 11-HSD type 1, which is responsible for converting inactive glucocorticoids into their active form. The nuclear transcription factors AP-1 and NF-B, which promote the production of all pro-inflammatory cytokines, are suppressed by the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. The Plantago major's methanol and ethanol extract treated groups revealed increased activity and expression of the 11-HSD type 1 enzyme. As a result, local tissue production of active glucocorticoids may attenuate the inflammatory response [ [83](#B83-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [84](#B84-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Plantago major have an anti-inflammatory effect at doses of 20 and 25 mg/kg. It was established that the decrease in inflammation was 90.01% when using indomethacin as a control marker, and Plantago major 3.10% when using 5 mg/kg, 41.56% when using 10 mg/kg, 45.87% when using 20 mg/kg and 49.76% when using 25 mg/kg. The mean effective dose (ED50) of Plantago major was 7.507 mg/kg [ [86](#B86-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. In addition, pretreatment with an aqueous extract (1 g/kg, po) of Plantago major reduced acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, but did not alter the tail-flick response to thermal nociceptive stimuli. In rats, an aqueous extract (1 g/kg, po) reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema and pleurisy but did not eliminate dextran-induced paw edema. The effect of the aqueous extract on carrageenan inflammatory responses was more intense than on-ear edema induced by Croton oil in mice. In addition, daily administration of an aqueous extract (1 g/kg/day for 8 days, orally) inhibited the exudative process induced by the administration of Croton oil into the rat air sacs. Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Plantago major contain a large amount of biologically active compounds such as terpenoids and fatty acids, as well as some of their structural derivatives. Some of the naturally occurring fatty acids and triterpenoids, as well as all the semi-synthetic fatty acids, inhibit COX-2 catalyzed prostaglandin biosynthesis, where are sensitive to COX-2 suppression. As you know, COX-2 is a source of prostanoids that are formed during inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of Plantago major is largely associated with its inhibitory effect on COX-2 [ [87](#B87-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-16-01092-f004)). inhibitory effect for DCM, IHF, and SHF at a dose 560 mg/kg was 47.33%, 55.51%, and 46.61%, respectively. IHF at doses of 280 and 560 mg/kg decreased osteoclast development and COX-2 expression in an animal model of RA when compared to diclofenac ( [Table 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-01092-t002)). This activity is reported to be associated with several compounds, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and oleamide, identified in DCM, IHF, and SHF. Through processes that do not need peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR), palmitoleic acid improves insulin sensitivity and lowers hepatic inflammation in rats. Nuclear factor (NF) B is inhibited when the PPAR is activated, which lowers the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and the generation of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and interleukin (IL)-12. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that oleic and linoleic acids reduce inflammation in rat macrophages by controlling the production of inflammatory thioglycolate-induced peritonitis ( [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-16-01092-f004)). This is consistent with the results of several previous studies that examined the activity of oleic acid in the peritoneal lavage of mice suffering from sepsis. Oleic acid increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and decreased the levels of the TNF- and IL-1. Similarly, oleic acid inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced cell migration in isolated human neutrophils. In an animal model of CFA-induced rheumatoid arthritis, IHF reduced the onset of arthritis and COX-2 expression. This action is associated with the activity of oleic and linoleic acids as inhibitors of COX-2 [ [88](#B88-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. 7. Wound-Healing Effects [89](#B89-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. We also evaluated the clinical efficacy of a hydroalcoholic extract of Plantago major in the healing of diabetic foot ulcers (DNS) and bedsores (NS) by applying a 10% gel with an extract of Plantago major. The use of Plantago major extract gel for topical application to the wound once per day along with dressing and standard wound care for two weeks demonstrated a larger reduction in wound size compared to the control after the first week (64.90 \u00b1 29.75% vs. 33.11 \u00b1 vs. 52.87 \u00b1 32.41%; p < 0.001). Additionally, the proportion of patients in the medication group (n = 32, 64%) who had fully healed their wounds was higher than that of the control group (n = 9, 20.45%; OR: 3.129, 95% CI: 1.685-5.80; p < 0.001). This is due to the polyphenolic compounds and the antioxidant properties of the extract. The polyphenolic compound in the Plantago major extract, called plantamajoside, is anti-inflammatory and is responsible for the extract's healing properties. It has also been noted that proteins isolated from the plantain extract affect the proliferation of fibroblasts, which leads to accelerated wound healing. Nitric oxide (NO) generation is raised by Plantago major extract, and this effect may aid in the healing of wounds. Hispidulin and baicalein, two of Plantago major's primary flavonoids, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antifungal effects. Additionally, they prevent the release of histamine and prostaglandins, preventing their tissue-damaging effects. Additionally, the astringent action of flavonoids may play a key role in speeding up wound healing [ [90](#B90-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [92](#B92-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. In a study on the effect and toxicity of ethanolic extracts of Plantago major on wound healing compared to a commercial product used in Brazil, macroscopic and microscopic analysis showed a good level of wound healing. After trauma to the cervicodorsal region of mice, Plantago major extract and ointment were applied to the cervicodorsal region of mice. The reduction in wound area occurred earlier in mice treated with Plantago major than in the control marker, ointment. On the 15th day, wounds treated with Plantago major had complete wound closure. Microscopic analysis of the wound on the ninth day revealed that animals treated with Plantago major had more effectively formed neoepithelium and skin appendages, whereas, during ointment therapy, reepithelialization and the absence of skin appendages in the lesion were absent. Wound-healing activity is associated with a high content of steroids and tripertenes and not only. Triterpenoids inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of prostaglandins in vitro, while the structural isomer of oleanolic acid is less active. However, the wound-healing potential is the result of a combination of phytocomponents and the real contribution of each of them. Coumarins caused significant changes in the regulation of immune responses. Alkaloids helped to improve the healing of incisions by increasing the tensile strength of scar tissue. In addition, it enhanced wound healing, accelerating the period of epithelialization and contraction of the wound on the 4th and 16th days. In addition, dose-dependently accelerates the recovery of soft tissues in the initial phases of the process due to chemotactic properties in relation to fibroblasts [ [93](#B93-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. [94](#B94-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. In an in vitro scratch assay, Plantago major leaf extracts based on water and ethanol promoted cell proliferation and migration. They also showed anti-inflammatory effects in an in vitro NF-kB assay using oral epithelial cell cultures. Similar to ex vivo testing employing detached pig ears, these extracts promoted wound healing [ [95](#B95-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Along with this, the ethanolic extract of Plantago major leaves and roots has a wound-healing effect on rats with hyperglycemia. The results of the study show that the gel of alcoholic extract of Plantago major leaves and roots at a concentration of 5% and 10% can increase the percentage of wound closure and accelerate wound-healing time (p < 0.05) [ [96](#B96-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Even though there was no significant difference on Day 0 (p = 0.69), there was a significant difference in the average wound surface area on Day 14 (p = 0.014) in another study of the effect of a methanol extract of the leaves of Plantago major on the duration of wound healing in male rats [ [97](#B97-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Antioxidant substances such as plantaginin, baicalein, and hispidulin, which are found in Plantago major, guard cells against being destroyed by inflammatory mediators. The migration of cells and proliferation are crucial to the healing of wounds. After treatment with Plantago major leaf extract, bio-active compounds such as polyphenols and polysaccharides encourage cell proliferation and migration and enhance wound healing. [98](#B98-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. The topical application of 10% Plantago major leaf extract (PMLE) to infected wounds in rabbits confirmed that PMLE plays a role in promoting healing. These results were in parallel with the WCR results, which reflect the mean wound contraction rate at Days 7, 14, and 21 in the PMLE-treated group was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the normal saline-treated group. The results of histopathological examination confirmed an early increase in new blood vessel formation, fibroblast proliferation, marked collagen precipitation, and early epithelialization in the PMLE group compared to the control group [ [99](#B99-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. A mixture of Plantago major and aloe vera on the process of wound healing in rat models according to stereological parameters also showed a good wound-healing effect when applied topically. The group of rats treated with a gel containing 5% Plantago major and 5% blend of aloe vera (PA group) showed a faster rate of wound closure compared to the control group and the gel base group (p < 0.05). The number density of fibroblasts, the volume density of collagen bundles, and the average diameter and volume density of vessels in the PA group were significantly higher than in the control group and the group that received the gel base (p < 0.05). Overall, the topical efficacy of Plantago major in skin wound healing in animal models in terms of wound contraction rate was observed at 10%, 20%, and 50% concentrations compared with A mixture of Plantago major and aloe vera on the process of wound healing in rat models according to stereological parameters also showed a good wound-healing effect when applied topically. The group of rats treated with a gel containing 5% Plantago major and 5% blend of aloe vera (PA group) showed a faster rate of wound closure compared to the control group and the gel base group (p < 0.05). The number density of fibroblasts, the volume density of collagen bundles, and the average diameter and volume density of vessels in the PA group were significantly higher than in the control group and the group that received the gel base (p < 0.05). Overall, the topical efficacy of Plantago major in skin wound healing in animal models, in terms of wound contraction rate, was observed at 10%, 20%, and 50% concentrations compared with control preparation ozemecine [ [100](#B100-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. Topical application of Plantago major extracts accelerates the healing of infected wounds due to the content of phenols and flavonoids, which act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances, enhancing WCR due to early and additional fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis compared with the control. group. This improvement in wound healing is due to two main factors. First, Plantago major extracts contain phenolic compounds with antiseptic and antioxidant properties in addition to flavonoid compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Second, due to the high percentage of the use of Plantago major extracts (5-10%), which, as it turned out, is the reason for the acceleration of the wound-healing process. On the other hand, Plantago major extracts reduce bacterial growth by stimulating fibroblast proliferation. The use of a dressing also contributes to the acceleration of the wound, since the dressing promotes faster epithelialization, and collagen synthesis, promotes angiogenesis, creates hypoxia in the wound bed, and reduces the pH of the wound bed, which leads to a decrease in wound infection [ [101](#B101-pharmaceuticals-16-01092)]. 8.
