This review\u2014with a handy at-a-glance guide\u2014examines 8 modalities, the level of evidence behind them, and the adverse effects you'll need to keep in mind. Consider referring your patients for guided imagery to reduce anxiety or pain. A Recommend a trial of glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg/d for 3 months for patients with osteoarthritis. B Consider acupuncture as a treatment option for patients with chronic pain. B Use probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in pediatric patients, except for those who are immunocompromised or have an indwelling medical device. B Strength of recommendation (SOR) A Good-quality patient-oriented evidence B Inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence C Consensus, usual practice, opinion, disease-oriented evidence, case series CASE Bob F, age 54, seeks care for chronic low back pain. The conservative treatments you have prescribed, including physical therapy, regular exercise, and an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, have provided minimal pain relief. Mr. F is reluctant to take a prescription pain medication and has expressed interest in trying a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy, such as acupuncture or yoga. What should you tell him? Almost 40% of Americans use CAM modalities to treat specific conditions or for overall well-being,1 and these practices are increasingly becoming a part of our approach to health care, as evidenced by the nearly 50 of facilities across the country that boast integrative health care programs, which combine CAM modalities with conventional medicine.2 Emerging evidence suggests several integrative practices may offer health benefits, and primary care physicians must become well-versed in these modalities to effectively communicate potential benefits and harms to patients. In this article, we present evidence from Cochrane reviews and other studies of 8 commonly used CAM therapies, including dietary interventions, a psychotherapeutic modality, and other treatments (TABLE).1,3-30 And while motivational interviewing technically is not a form of CAM, we also review this modality, which has proven useful in the treatment of patients for substance use. (See \"Motivational interviewing for substance abuse.\") Fish oil for hypertriglyceridemia High triglyceride levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a component of metabolic syndrome.8 A 2008 review of 47 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included 16,511 participants found that omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil) supplements significantly reduced triglyceride levels compared to placebo.7 The American Heart Association recommends 2 to 4 g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to lower triglyceride levels.8 Most studies have found that fish oil supplements are associated with few adverse effects; gastrointestinal (GI) complaints are most common. However, these supplements should be discontinued following an acute bleeding event, such as hemorrhagic stroke, due to their anticoagulant properties.9 Some evidence suggests that the risk for prostate cancer is increased in men with high blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids.10 Glucosamine for osteoarthritis The AHA recommends 2 to 4 g/d of EPA plus DHA to lower triglyceride levels.Glucosamine is an amino sugar that is a building block of cartilage proteoglycans. Although it occurs naturally in the body, the glucosamine used in supplements is typically harvested from seashells. Glucosamine stimulates the metabolism of synovial cells and chondrocytes in articular cartilage and may delay joint degeneration.31,32 Glucosamine is widely used in the United States as a dietary supplement, most often as glucosamine sulfate but also as n-acetyl glucosamine and glucosamine hydrochloride, although there is limited evidence of effectiveness for the latter formulations.33 Most studies have examined the effects of oral glucosamine sulfate, 500 mg taken 3 times a day for 30 to 90 days. Once-a-day dosing as high as 1500 mg also has been used. A Cochrane review of 25 studies with 4963 patients concluded that oral glucosamine sulfate may reduce osteoarthritis (OA) pain and improve functionality, without many adverse effects.11 A 2-year double-blind RCT compared the effects of glucosamine hydrochloride 500 mg tid, chondroitin sulfate 400 mg tid, glucosamine plus chondroitin, celecoxib 200 mg/d, or placebo in 662 patients with knee OA.12 While all groups experienced early and sustained symptomatic relief, the odds of achieving a 20% reduction in pain and improved functioning were highest with celecoxib and glucosamine. Oral glucosamine sulfate can cause mild GI effects, but drowsiness, skin reactions, and headache also have been reported. Shellfish allergy also is a concern; however, shellfish allergies occur due to the proteins in the meat, and not from the shell from which glucosamine is derived. Glucosamine may increase glucose levels and the anticoagulant effects of warfarin.13 Probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a common problem.21 Probiotics\u2014microorganisms found in oral supplements, yogurt, and other food\u2014are commonly used to help maintain the balance of intestinal flora.34 A recent Cochrane review of 16 RCTs that included approximately 3400 patients found evidence that probiotics can prevent AAD.22 A 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis of 63 RCTs with more than 11,000 participants concluded that probiotics lowered the relative risk of developing diarrhea compared to control groups.35 The American Academy of Pediatrics supports the use of probiotics, citing results from a meta-analysis that found probiotics reduced the risk of developing diarrhea from 28.5% "}
