Homeopathic medicines are prepared from natural substances that are non-toxic and can be safely given to infants, children, and adults. They do not interfere with prescription medications, but can be given along with them. When prescribing a homeopathic medicine we recognize each person's illness manifests in a unique way. If two patients present with the same illness, they will not necessarily get the same homeopathic remedy. If someone has a cold with a runny nose and watery eyes they would get a different remedy then a cold sufferer a stuffy nose and dry eyes. Our prescription of a homeopathic remedy matches a patients unique symptoms including the mental, physical, and emotional ones. Homeopathy was developed by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) and quickly spread throughout Europe and worldwide. With over 200 years of clinical experience and numerous peer-reviewed basic science and clinical studies confirm homeopathy's ability to be a safe, effective, and powerful medicine. "}
