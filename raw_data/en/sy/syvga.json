Member FINRA/SIPC The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 8 YOGA WITH CATSIn the Company of Cats \u2014 Ann Arbor's first cat caf\u00e9 lets visitors enjoy feline companionship and cat-centered activities The sun is just peeking over the horizon, burning off the last tendrils of early morning fog, as instructor Lisa Norgren begins teaching her yoga class. The studio is dim; a soothing fountain trickles gently in the back of the room. Students stand in front of their mats, talking softly. The room eventually becomes quiet. The cats awaken, stretch and start to roam. Yes, the cats.Because this is no ordinary yoga class. This is Yoga with Cats at Tiny Lions Lounge and Adoption Center, administered through the Humane Society of Huron Valley. \"This center is for anyone and everyone who loves cats,\" explained Wendy Welch, director of marketing for the humane society. \"All the cats here are looking for forever homes, of course, just like at the humane society. But at Tiny Lions, the cats are free-roaming, and everyone - whether you're interested in adopting or not - is encouraged to come in and visit with the cats.\" The nonprofit Tiny Lions center, located at 5245 Jackson Road, Suite A1, in Ann Arbor, is also known as a cat caf\u00e9, a concept that started in Japan and has gradually made its way to the States in a variety of forms. Some cat caf\u00e9s focus on the food aspect and have resident cats who are not available for adoption. Others focus on the felines and have cats looking for homes.At Tiny Lions, the focus is on adoption and human/animal bonding, and the caf\u00e9 is in the form of a Biggby Coffee shop, conveniently located next door. Visitors are welcome to bring their refreshments into the caf\u00e9, pay an hourly fee of $7, and enjoy time with the 10 to 15 felines who wander about freely. Cat toys abound, and visitors are welcome to interact with any and all kitties. The money goes toward the upkeep of the center and the care of the cats. And if a cat and visitor bond particularly well, even better. All the cats at the center are available for adoption, and cards at the back of the large, cheery room detail the name, age, and individual quirks of each feline. \"We get a lot of people who come in here with their laptops, and they try to work, but they end up playing with the cats,\" said volunteer Sierra Nair, laughing. \"People come in for lots of different reasons. We'll have students who are away from home, and they miss their cat. Or we'll have families who come in, and maybe one family member is allergic, so they can't have a cat at home - but other family members love cats.\" The staff at Tiny Lions makes sure there is plenty to do when people arrive. Guests are welcome to simply come in without reservations, visit, and play with the cats - with some limitations. These include only gentle petting, no cat chasing, and no flash photography that may startle shy felines. The posted rules also recommend visitors steer clear of kitty belly rubs, since those often lead to play that involves claws, and safety for everyone is of the utmost priority.By Diane Majeske Students stand in front of their mats, talking softly.

YOGA WITH CATSThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 9 For those looking for more structured, cat-centered activities, there are many available. Visitors can register for events like Cat Tales Storytime or Family Mew-vie Time. Niva Lin of Ann Arbor, whose longtime family cat passed away last year, enjoys taking her three young children to the latter event. She's not quite ready for another cat in the household, but says movie time allows her children to enjoy a little feline interaction. \"They really enjoy it,\" she said. \"It's a lot of fun and a great way for them to be around cats without us having one at home.\" And of course, there's the weekly Yoga with Cats. Yoga enthusiasts both new and experienced are invited to stretch and bend while sharing the floor with a few furry friends - who may at times decide to take over more than their share of the mat. Norgren keeps class casual, taking any and all kitty interruptions in stride. \"When I first started teaching this, I'd get all sorts of questions,\" she said, laughing. \"People were like, 'Yoga with cats? Are you teaching the cats yoga? Are you using the cats to teach yoga? How does it work?'\" For those looking for more structured, cat-centered activities, there are many available. Visitors can register for events like Cat Tales Storytime or Family Mew-vie Time. Norgren didn't mind the questions; she was delighted at the new opportunity. \"I love to teach, and I feel like I'm doing something for the cats, too,\" she said. \"I already have two rescue cats, and that's my maximum right now... so I feel like this is my way of helping.\" Each class is different and equally enjoyable, she said.\"We take our time, we leave cat toys between the mats... We make it fun.\"Debbie Crump, who attends class regularly with husband John, is one of her most enthusiastic students. \"For us, this is a way to promote a local business, to relax, and to have a good time,\" said Debbie. The couple has six cats at home, but they still enjoy coming to the caf\u00e9 to enjoy a little cat camaraderie. \"This is such a great idea - the cats get used to people, and there are so many fun activities.\" In fact, she and her husband had never tried yoga until they started visiting the center. \"We just thought, 'Why not?\" she said. \"And we like it so much. The cats lounge on the mats, they jump around - they're so funny. And the instructors don't get overly serious. They give you time to move around... If you want to stop to take a quick picture, that's OK.\" Because, in the end, it's all about the visitors and the cats bonding. And maybe, just maybe, more cats finding forever homes. It's happening, said Welch. Since the center opened in June, more than 100 cats have been adopted. And when one is adopted, another takes its place. \"The best scenario is when they fall in love with a human... and find a new home.\" For more information, check out www.tinylions.org. YOGA ...

The injured raptor birds, often used in educational programs, sleep in little wooden houses on the hillside. Community gardens and orchards await spring, leaves poised to unfurl and earth to be turned. It is the night of the salamander survey at Black Pond Woods. When I first moved to my north Ann Arbor neighborhood, I went for a walk one afternoon with no destination in mind. I wandered through the grounds of what I didn't know yet was Leslie Science Center. It was late August 1988. Flowers blazed at the margin of a forest. I was drawn into the woods, up and down slopes of the moraine, until I wound up in a valley near what I realized must be a little pond. It was a summer of drought, and what water remained in the vernal pool was covered with duckweed. But it glowed green, and I knew that I had found a focal point, the heart of the woods. I returned often to explore. The woods were shrubby near the center, giving way to mature forest on steep slopes and big oak trees along the rim of a golf course. I sometimes took books or drawing paper there and sat reading, sketching, or daydreaming, jumping up to dodge the occasional stray golf ball. The oaks reminded me of the site in one of my first childhood reading experiences, the Hundred Acre Wood from Winnie-the-Pooh. They anchored heaven to earth, deep-rooted and reassuring, hissing gently through fringes of leaves, dreaming both past and future. On an April evening, friends and I followed the sound of springtime frogs. Soon we were sitting cradled in it by the pond. \"Look, look,\" I said. A little frog was perched on a wet log near us. We could see the rhythmic puffing of its pale-green throat as it added its note to the hypnotic mesh of sound. The calls rose, silver-green, a light that grew and grew, entreating mates and touching the pool of answering stars overhead. In spring, the slopes in the valley near the pond were starred with trillium. Dogwood trees flung up sprays of blossoms that floated on light and shadow. A hawk wheeled above them one afternoon. The atmosphere was medieval, mythic; the bird tracing an invisible snare that bound it all together. From a high ridge, my friends and I could see into a sunlit wetland that cradled another kettle pond, small and potently alluring, with its own ensembles of frogs, their sounds welling up to splash around us. We explored the trails and dreamed with the oak trees. But none of us knew the name of the woods. The following summer I experienced some strange things there.On assignment to create illustrations for the alumni newsletter of the University's School of Natural Resources and Environment, I wandered with a sketchbook up one of the paths. It was a hot July day. Green fires glimmered around the periphery of my vision. I drew small birds that alighted on branches. Suddenly there was a rustling sound from behind a stand of trees. Or I thought so. A sense of something large, an animal shifting about on its feet. I stopped drawing, watched and listened. Nothing. I began to draw again. Once more, that almost-heard movement. An image in my mind: a tall man with the legs of a horse. Two legs, not quite the form of the mythological centaur. I froze, listening, watching. Nothing. At the third instance, settling into drawing, then startled by the sense of sound and motion in that same spot, I decided to leave. A month later, I left a trail for a moment and could not find my way out of the woods. A little panicky, though I knew that I couldn't stray far from human presence here, I began to move fast, with an increasing sense of sentient things throwing projectiles and touching me with electric fingers. When I emerged on the slope above the golf course, my clothes were covered in tiny seeds. I picked them off and sowed them on the ground.These events only deepened my love for this place and the tenacity of its spirit. One spring day, I saw signs posted at every entrance to the forest: \"HELP SAVE BLACK POND WOODS\", with a telephone number. It was the first time I'd seen the pond or the forest named. That evening, I called the number. Jennifer Hill answered: The woods were owned by a man who lived in Florida. He wanted to sell a portion of them for condominium development. A group, Friends of Black Pond, was forming to save them. I stood in front of Borders Bookstore with sheaves of petitions. Usually I'm terrible at that. I want people to understand what they're signing and there isn't time to go into nuances. But this one was simple. I collected many signatures and attended Council meetings. Though I dreamed one night that a frog in the pond told me to \"Speeeek\" , I never quite summoned the nerve to do so in Council. But I met with the group at Leslie Science Center, and collected funds at a biweekly dance party I hosted at the Network on Huron at Third Street. I created in my mind imaginary panthers to guard the woods from development, and set them to work high in the trees of the woods. I sometimes dwelled on them while braver souls took the open mic at Council and Commission meetings. They showed slides of sweet green-lit columns of trees, named rare plants and animals and environmental tests that must legally be conducted, but which are sometimes glossed over in favor of lucrative property rights. We stood up en masse when asked to show support. Jennifer, a shy person, was a heroine, steadfast and thorough, speaking eloquently, always backed up by research conducted with utmost care. After this adventure, she was invited to join the Parks Department and she served there for several years. We learned that the kettle ponds were formed from melted ice broken off retreating glaciers. We learned about the salamanders that breed in these vernal pools in the springtime, needing the safe haven of water that dries up in summer and cannot host fish. A smaller contingent among us asked each other if we would be willing to chain ourselves to trees if the development went ahead. We agreed that we would. We meant it. We won, helped by the Washtenaw Land Conservancy. The distant owner was persuaded that the site was inappropriate for development. There was a ribbon-cutting party with hikes in the forest where a dream-catcher was attached to a tree overlooking the pond. Great joy, new friendships, the beginning of what became a nature-study area. Controlled burning resulting in vivid flowers among the shrubs. Children were taken to the pond to dip nets and learn about creatures. After some years, a pontoon bridge was installed at the pond. Some of us hated it, missing the triangular shape of the green-dark heart of the wood, glad the bridge In the Heart of the Wood on a Rainy Night ~ Reflections on Black Pond Woods By Irena Nagler The oaks reminded me of the site in one of my first childhood reading experiences, the Hundred Acre Wood from Winnie-the-Pooh. They anchored heaven to earth, deep-rooted and reassuring. The [frog] calls rose, silver-green, a light that grew and grew, entreating mates and touching the pool of answering stars overhead. Though I dreamed one night that a frog in the pond told me to \"Speeeek\", I never quite summoned the nerve to do so in Council. We learned about the salamanders that breed in these vernal kettle pools in the springtime, needing the safe haven of water that dries up in summer and cannot host fish.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 11 could easily be removed. But we got used to the fun of looking directly from it into golden-brown water, submerged leaves glowing in filtered light. The frogs, which at first seemed to have been scared away by the vibrations of feet and forbidden bikes crossing the bridge, returned in force. We'd hang about on the bridge with the silver sound of them straining through us and rising into treetops. One winter night, there was another kind of frog on the pond. Cindy Overmyer and I were taking photos in the woods, most of which I hand-altered later to bring out ghostly figures and bear-spirits among the trees. The pond was frozen, and in the center of it we found a snow-sculpture of a frog. Cindy took a photo of me hugging it. Around my neck was a wreath of branches I'd found somewhere and was using now for our little photographic modeling adventure. On a winter day there with my best friend, Anne Beebe, who was especially fond of frogs, she spoke a spontaneous verse to the ones who might be sleeping in the mud. \"Froggies, froggies, fast asleep, tell me froggies, peep peep peep. Getting stranger by the year ... Getting...How shall I end it?\" \"Getting strange, but never fear!\" I said. Anne died in 2003 from complications after chemotherapy for leukemia. My friends Christina Guldi and Marin Perusek and I held a gathering in her honor one evening by the pond. We stood in hollows and under trees and played small musical instruments: a rain stick, a kalimba, a thunder tube, a wooden rainforest frog with a stick drawn over ridges on its back. I read out loud a story Anne had written that involved frogs jumping through blue rings into other dimensions. When I began, there was a loud and distinct glunk sound. It was soon joined by a few others, and then a rising chorus that continued to call louder and louder, until they reached top volume. The frogs called only during the space of Anne's story, though we also read other stories of our own. March 2016. Here I am for the salamander survey on the first rainy night of spring. Normally the frogs would be vocal now, too, but the weather has been erratic, and they're silent. We brush off our boots to avoid bringing in tiny hitchhikers, invasive species from outside the woods. Rain hoods shadow faces. Led by Patrick Terry, an educator from Natural Areas Preservation in the Ann Arbor Parks & Recreation Department, we move in single file down uneven, muddy paths, splashing in puddles. Flashlights glow here and there. Usually I prefer darkness and the use of night-adjusted eyes, but there's so much focus that it's faerie-like, sentient; the lights are nerves. People are assigned areas to survey. They are turning over logs, startling red-backed salamanders into abrupt emergence, slither and gleam. And tiny newts, bearing neurotoxins (touch not the newt but with a glove). Many little dragons. These are here year-round, but people almost never see them. We search layers of leaves near the pond, then move onto the bridge. A light shines on a male salamander, black and gold-spotted, swimming in the water. Patrick scoops him out, and he's passed from hand to hand. I touch him briefly with a gloved finger. Patrick explains how the males, who arrive first, deposit spermatophores and dance near them in the water to show the females where they are. There's a blue-spotted species that is all-female, or unisexual; when they interbreed with males of another species, their offspring might have up to five sets of chromosomes. We see adult newts in the water, silvery and fish-quick. Lights gleam on the rich, dark leaves at the bottom. The hills of trees behind us are fae and bristly in the dark. Rain dimples and glitters on the water. Lizard-shapes, tails flickering, burrow in submerged leaves and reappear. We see beetle larvae that bristle with tiny hairs. The creatures are almost liquid; porous skins with the world passing through them. We see more and more of them. In their motion they are one with the water, the rain, and the forest bubbling and glimmering. It's a salamander party. It's an underworld turned inside out, glowing deep inside.

By Lynda Gronlund New Offerings by Established Businesses and PractitionersThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 12 Photo by Joni Strickfaden At the end of the 2017 growing season, farmers Annie Elder and Paul Bantle will be leaving the Community Farm of Ann Arbor, a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm in Chelsea, Michigan. Elder and Bantle have run the farm for 25 years. Established in 1988, Community Farm is the first CSA in Michigan, and only the eighth to have formed in the country. Elder and Bantle took over operations in 1992. The farm uses biodynamic farming, a holistic, organic, and ethical approach to farming, rooted in the spiritual teachings and practices of philosopher Rudolf Steiner. Biodynamic farming was created in the 1920s by Steiner, who believed in anthroposophy, or \"spiritual science.\" He felt that the future of medicine, pharmacy, and farming was in combining scientific and spiritual pursuits. When Elder and Bantle started on the farm, biodynamic farming was a relatively new concept, which had started on the East Coast. Today, said Bantle, there are \"tens of thousands of biodynamic farms\" in the U.S. As a CSA, the Community Farm of Ann Arbor is member-owned, and decisions are made by a board of directors and the membership. Elder and Bantle grow the food with the help of volunteers and coworkers they hire and supervise. Each week during the growing season, members pick up their farm shares of produce. Bantle said that families, couples, and singles come to the farm and engage with it, touching the earth, seeing the animals, and enjoying the community. Sometimes, he said, there are up to four generations in a family enjoying the crops. Members are encouraged to volunteer and learn at the farm, connecting with the earth and the process of growing their food. Shares are sold on a sliding scale, said Bantle, and every member family receives an equal share and vote no matter what they paid. It was important to Elder to make the fresh food available to as many people as possible. For people not used to seeing their whole produce bill at once, the prices may seem high, but Bantle explained that if they were to buy the same amount of biodynamic produce throughout the year, they would potentially pay much more and not have the connection to the community farm to enjoy. After running the farm since 1992, Bantle and Elder are resigning at the end of the 2017 season to move on to the next phase of their lives. They will move to Marin County in northern California to work with the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation. They have been involved with the Center since the 1990s, making meditation part of their daily routine on the farm. When they move, they will work in the Center's retreat house. When asked if they will continue farming, Bantle said \"the earth and the elements are in our bones now.... We'll definitely stay connected to the earth,\" though their \"daily rhythms will be a bit different.\" They are working on finding their successor, and said that they are excited to pass the mantle on to a new generation who can vitalize the farm in new ways. The work is very physical, said Bantle, and while he and Elder have many more years of productive work left, they feel it is a good time to move on to an endeavor their bodies can more easily sustain. \"We've been really involved in the community intricately for years of love,\" said Elder, and they hope that the farm continues that legacy after they move on. Information about the farm and CSA are available at www.communityfarmofaa. org. Bantle encourages people to stay in touch as the transferring process continues. This ongoing column features upcoming events within Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County and surrounding areas' Body/ Mind/Spirit communities, new (during the past year or two) practitioners and holistic businesses, new books written by local/regional authors, new classes, as well as new offerings by established practitioners and holistic businesses. Personal trainer and exercise instructor Molly Stamos is bringing \"rebounding\" classes to Ann Arbor at The Mix Studios. See article on page 14 Robin Gaines published her first novel, Invincible Summers , in June 2016. The book follows Claudia, a girl growing up in a fictional middle-class suburb of Detroit in the 1960s and 70s as she loses her father at the age of ten and struggles to find her place in the world. The events of the time \u2014 the Vietnam War, Detroit riots, and assassinations \u2014 form a backdrop of chaos and uncertainty as Claudia's family experiences not only the loss of her father, but a serious injury that disfigures her mother and her brother's struggle with drugs and drinking. Invincible Summers explores eleven summers of Claudia's life, between the ages of six and twenty-three. Most of the chapters, said Gaines, started as short stories, some previously published. Claudia is not Gaines, as Gaines noted, but has similarities \u2014 Gaines grew up in the 60s and 70s in Michigan and lost her father at a young age. As she wrote and edited, Gaines said she discovered many \"unintentional threads\" to the stories, which she described as an \"exploration of the nature of loss.\" Claudia and her brother, left largely to their own devices after their father died and their mother returned to work to provide for the family, have to find their own way forward for themselves. Gaines said the themes of the book are universal \u2014 love, loyalty, betrayal, and grief \u2014 but the story will be particularly relatable to women near her own age who grew up around the same time. A professional journalist, Gaines had wanted to write a novel for a long time, but did not feel she had the training or ability to do so. She signed up for a writing workshop in Iowa where she began to learn and teach herself how to write fiction. She said it didn't come naturally to her, that she had to \"dismantle\" others' stories and put them back together to understand how they worked. Encouraged by her teacher at the workshop, she kept at it, eventually \"finding her voice,\" which resulted in Invincible Summers . Gaines said she is almost done with a second novel and hopes to write more. Invincible Summers is available at Crazy Wisdom. Robin Gaines is online at www. robingaines.net. She is available to speak at book clubs and can be reached through her website.

The Community Farm of Ann Arbor is located at 1525 S. Fletcher Road, Chelsea, MI 48118, and mail can be directed to P .O. Box 8353, Ann Arbor, MI 48107-8353. Mridu Pasrija, a Northville-based Crystalline Consciousness Technique energy coach and teacher, has begun offering \"coffee shop sessions.\" Clients contact her with a question or issue needing attention or care. She puts together a special mandala \u2014 a pattern of shapes and forms related to the 'flower of life' pattern \u2014 infused with Crystalline Consciousness vibration, and she intuitively \"releases blocks to shift the problem into the solution.\" She then meets with the client at a coffee shop or over Skype. While enjoying coffee (or tea), they talk, discovering \"deep insights into the situation,\" and discussing the solution. The client takes home a beautiful mandala chart with empowered affirmations to help him or her work through the needed changes. Follow-up sessions are available, as well. Pasrija has also started offering an online meditation series. The program runs for 6 weeks at 30 minutes per session once a week. The time is in the late evening, so it is a good way to wind down from the day and prepare for a restful sleep. Meditators can set an intention for the week, and then participate in a 25-minute guided meditation. Meditations are recorded and participants can re-listen to them at any time. Pasrija said the course is set up to appeal to everyone, including those new to meditation. She said she started meditating at around twelve years old while growing up in Ann Arbor. Her parents are from India and meditation is a part of their religious and spiritual life. She said that meditation can help reduce stress, anxiety, and overwhelm; help with restful sleep; improve mood; and promote general wellness. Dates for the course are available online. More information about Mridu Pasrija and her offerings is available at www.liveliferadiantly.com. She can be reached by email at mpasrija@liveliferadiantly.com or by phone at (248) 470-5610. Dr. Deirdre Conroy, Ph.D., started her coaching practice, Happy Healthy Rested, in 2015. She is a psychologist specializing in sleep disorders, especially insomnia. She completed health coach training through the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, where she learned about a variety of dietary theories and practical lifestyle coaching methods, as well as what the Institute calls \"primary foods\" \u2014 factors in life, like relationships and career satisfaction, that can influence the \"secondary foods\" \u2014 what actually goes into our mouths. As a licensed clinical psychologist and board-certified cognitive behavioral therapist, she brings a strong knowledge base to the practice of coaching (though she does note that coaching is not the same as therapy and does not replace it). Conroy aims to help people make changes to their nutrition, sleep, and life that will increase their happiness, energy levels, and overall health. She explained that these are interrelated: when someone changes their nutrition, it can help them sleep better and feel more rested. This improves mood, and when one is well rested and nourished, he or she is better able to make other positive life changes. As an example, she told me about a client who came to her because she was suffering from low mood, low energy, and low confidence. Through coaching she not only improved her diet and sleep, but also got more involved in her community and gained self-confidence and life satisfaction. Before seeing Conroy, the client was overwhelmed, as many people are, with knowing what changes to make and how. Conroy tailored a program to her specific needs, goals, and preferences and gave her actionable steps to feel and function better. Conroy offers a free initial consultation to those interested in working with her. She offers coaching packages based on what the individual needs, and also provides support between coaching sessions and keeps her clients updated on local seminars and workshops that can help them with their goals, whether offered by her or other professionals. She provides encouragement to people suffering from burnout in their jobs or life, low energy, and/or sleep problems, and those just looking to improve their general health. She emphasizes that she does not offer a \"quick-fix diet,\" but gradual lifestyle changes. Dr. Diedre Conroy's coaching website is www.happyhealthyrested.com. She can be reached by email at dconroy@happyhealthyrested.com or by phone at (734) 223-7148. A team of massage therapists has come together in a new office called Ann Arbor Massage, L.L.C.

She has taught cooking classes for many years and has observed that people love to attend the classes but tend to go home, never use the recipes, and still rarely cook. The reasons she hears most are \"I don't know how to cook from scratch\" and \"I don't have time.\" Baker, like many others, grew up with a working mother in the 60s and 70s, when the trend toward using packaged foods started \u2014 cream of mushroom soup as a base for anything, Hamburger Helper \u2014 which meant the skill of cooking from scratch was no longer being taught at home. Believing that cooking at home from scratch with whole food ingredients is healthier, more economical, and, if buying locally, better for the environment and local economy, Baker wanted to make it easier and less intimidating for people to start making this change. She said the keys to cooking homemade meals daily, while also working full time and keeping up with other obligations, are planning and understanding how cooking works. Planning involves stocking the kitchen with items that can be used for multiple meals and thinking ahead about ingredients that can be prepared ahead of time or made in larger quantities. So, for example, if a few meals call for rice, one can make a bunch of rice at the beginning of the week, eliminating that step for the rest of the meal preparations. Understanding cooking means deconstructing recipes and realizing, for example, that \"all soup recipes are basically the same: saut\u00e9 some vegetables, add herbs and spices, add liquid,\" then add the ingredients that make it a particular soup \u2014 chicken, beans, and so on. Different recipes will look very different on the surface, but when deconstructed, they follow a similar basic outline. Baker said once people begin thinking in this way, it's easier to think about substituting anything they want without having to know exactly how many spoonfuls of an ingredient are needed. This makes improvising easier and also decreases the chance of someone derailing the entire cooking experience because he or she forgot a particular item at the store. Baker acknowledged that starting off making 21 meals every week from scratch might be overwhelming for someone just learning how to cook from scratch. But she helps people break big goals down into everyday steps. As a first step, she said, she might ask someone to pick two related meals, figure out what they have in common, and determine what can be made ahead of time. The person can build from there until he or she is cooking her desired number of meals per week. The same goes for stocking a kitchen. Purchasing the staple ingredients needed to prepare for multiple meals, or \"flipping\" a kitchen, can be done in small steps. Doing it all at once would require a considerable investment. A culinary school graduate, Baker owned a catering business before having children, so she knows how many tricks of the trade can be used by home cooks. She said her new book aims to bring cooking into a more practical realm as compared to the entertainment of cooking shows and celebrity chefs \u2014 \"of course no one is going to cook like that every day,\" she said.

Fl!p Your K!itchen Upcoming Events Brenda Morgan, Ph.D., founder of Grass Lake Sanctuary in Manchester, Michigan, is offering a new two-day spiritual retreat on June 24 and 25, 2017. The retreat is called \"Beyond a Little Spiritual Cream in Your Coffee: Opening Your Heart Amidst Everyday Life.\" It explores \"the awakening process of embodied existence that embraces both divine and human expression. The body-mind is an expression of the living spirit and is not trivial just because it is temporary.\" The retreat includes meals and snacks prepared with organic food, some of which is grown in the Sanctuary's garden. Cabins and bungalows are available for overnight stay, and ample free time allows for enjoyment of the Sanctuary's 145-acre beautiful wooded trails, meadows, ponds, streams, and gardens.

Personal Trainer and exercise instructor Molly Stamos is bringing \"rebounding\" classes to Ann Arbor at The Mix Studios. Starting this past November, her Total Body Jump classes are being offered several times per week. \"Rebounding\" means jumping on individual-sized trampolines, which allows for high-intensity exercise without high impact on the joints. The commercial-grade trampolines have bungees instead of springs, so they are quieter than conventional models, and the level of springiness is adjustable. They can support jumpers up to 300 pounds. For beginners, specialized handles can be attached to help with balance. Rebounding offers some unique benefits. Stamos said that unlike running or other high- impact activities, the impact of the bounce is spread throughout the body, causing all the muscles in the body to fire simultaneously, even tiny muscles like those around the eyes. She explained that the bouncing movement can help detoxify the lymph system as it helps lymph to move through the body, and that this can even help reduce cellulite. Rebounding can be done by athletes rehabbing injuries, older people worried about their joints, and new exercisers, but it can also be a great workout for highly fit people. Stamos is in her early fifties. She said she had been looking for a high-intensity but low-impact workout for herself as she gets older and needs to take better care of her joints. Recalling the fun and great workout she got from playing with her kids on a trampoline, she bought a small one just to \"run\" on indoors. She loved it and began experimenting with different movements, from dance to strength training. She discovered that rebounding classes are popular in New York City and had a chance to attend several while traveling there. Hooked, she decided to invest in the equipment and bring the classes to Ann Arbor. Stamos' colleague Sarah Kreiner had recently moved her personal training studio, The Mix, to a larger location on State Street, and was able to provide the space for the classes. Stamos is starting with the general Total Body Jump class, but has plans for more options in the future, including a dance-jump class complete with nightclub-style lights and music. Total Body Jump is offered on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings. The first class is free to try. Online registration is required at www.the-mix-studios.com. The Mix Studios is located at 2007 South State Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. Molly Stamos can be reached by phone at (803) 719-2732 or by email at fittogo-molly@hotmail.com.

La-Von Salon on Jackson Road in Ann Arbor. She learned Reiki from an Indian Master in Iran and is focused on healing the chakras, which she said can help alleviate many physical conditions. While Reiki can be used for stress reduction and relaxation, she is most focused on improving physical health. Each person is different, she explained, and bodies react differently to treatment, so the amount of time needed to heal a given condition can vary. She has had success, she said, in helping people with migraines, addictions, cataracts, weight loss, sexual problems, pain, asthma, acne, allergies, and even cancer. Some Reiki practitioners use light touch on some areas of the body, said Vakilian, but she keeps her hands an inch or two above the body when manipulating the energy.

Dr. Andrew Gessert, D.C., opened Pivotal Chiropractic in Ann Arbor in mid-2016. He provides \"Specific Correction\" chiropractic, which he described as a unique area of chiropractic focused on correcting underlying structural problems rather than just treating the symptoms of pain, inflammation, and decreased range of motion, which is often a temporary solution. Gessert explained that when new patients come to Pivotal, they undergo a very detailed exam process. He examines the person externally through a 3-D structural assessment, and internally with digital x-rays. He also does a neurofunctional assessment and thermographic imaging of the neck. Once he understands the structural issues the patient is dealing with, he uses his hands to do corrections. There is no rapid rotational movement, he said. Gessert takes a \"top-down\" approach, beginning with the neck, which affects the entire spine. Sometimes problems that manifest lower in the spine are a compensation for problems in the neck, he said. The patient is set up to facilitate adjustment on specialized benches, kneeling or lying down. He uses firm, not rough, movements to perform corrections, then has the patient sit in a \"zero-gravity chair\" for about 20 minutes to allow the body to relax and the correction to stabilize. He then checks the patient again before they leave, and does more corrections if needed (though this is uncommon). For people interested in learning about chiropractic and about Specific Correction in particular, Gessert offers a complimentary presentation on the first and third Thursdays of each month called the \"Head to Toe Spinal Show.\" This is geared toward people who just want a little more information before scheduling a consultation. Gessert also offers a free 30-minute consultation to discuss the patient's issues, needs, and goals, and to determine whether Pivotal is a good fit for him or her. He said he doesn't do \"hard sales,\" and there is no commitment if someone comes in for a consultation. If the patient and Gessert decide to go forward, he will schedule an exam, which takes 45 to 60 minutes. He will then hold a conference with the patient to discuss the recommended treatment plan, including frequency of corrections and any at-home measures. The goal, he said, is to get the patient to the point where he or she doesn't need correction anymore. So, a patient might come in for corrections twice a week for a period of time, then go to a \"protection plan\" or maintenance phase, where he or she would come in one to two times per month to be evaluated and receive corrections if needed. Gessert said that chiropractic can help with all aspects of health, including allergies, the immune system, movement, sleep, aches and pains from activity, and more. He has been able to help people clear up problems they have had for long periods of time, such as one patient who had been suffering from severe headaches requiring daily medication for decades. Pivotal Chiropractic is located at 905 W. Eisenhower Circle, #106, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. The website is www.pivotalchiropractic.com. Dr. Andrew Gessert can be reached at (734) 221-0362 or pivotalchiropractic@gmail.com. Waterford-based Reiki practitioner and empath Kristen Schmitt launched www.spiritanchor.com in October 2016. Spirit Anchor is a national website for metaphysical practitioners and those seeking metaphysical and spiritual services. In addition to promoting their businesses, practitioners can communicate through a member forum, where they can provide or seek advice and offer support to one another. In the retail section, visitors can search for practitioners in their geographic area, read articles about the various types of services, and shop for items, like angel and tarot cards, crystals, prayer bowls, salt lamps, and more. There is also a resource section listing metaphysical events. Schmitt described Spirit Anchor as \"a safe place for people to find quality information on all avenues of metaphysics and spirituality.\" She felt \"divinely guided\" to create the website last year. She had been living in California, exploring her own metaphysical and spiritual path, when she had the idea, bounced it off some web developers she had worked with, and decided to return home to Michigan to pursue it. It was important to her that the website be \"inviting and professional,\" she said, in order to reach the most people and \"not give people the heebeegeebees.\" Her goal is for the site to become the \"number one online resource for all things metaphysical.\" The site offers free and enhanced listing memberships for practitioners and is free to search and explore. Services include card readers and psychics, Reiki and other healing modalities, retreats, acupuncture, and naturopathic medicine, as well as training in these areas. Spirit Anchor is located at www.spiritanchor.com. Kristen Schmitt can be reached at info@spiritanchor.com or at (248) 494-4044. Ann Arbor native Courtney Blake started Mothers Own, a placenta encapsulation service, in July of 2012, three months after her daughter, Alice, was born. On the advice of her sister, Blake decided to consume her placenta after her daughter's birth. Because her mother had suffered with severe postpartum depression and her sister Continued from page 17The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 18 Please note that the \"What's New\" column is an editorial (not paid-for advertising) feature of the Crazy Wisdom Journal, and the editors may or may not include what you submit.

Though she was skeptical, she had the hospital save her placenta, and her father shipped it in a cooler overnight to an encapsulation service in California. There it was preserved using a traditional Chinese method and returned to her in pill form in a few days. Blake said before the pills arrived, she was crying for hours each night. Once she began consuming them, this stopped, and she felt she had more energy and was better able to enjoy new motherhood. In her research, she found that placenta consumption can \"help prevent excessive bleeding and iron-loss, help the uterus shrink to its normal size, increase energy, help with insomnia, and increase milk production.\" Practiced since ancient times by some cultures, and also by many animals, placenta consumption is not a new or unnatural concept. Blake explained that placenta contains hormones, stem cells, and nutrients that are tailored to the woman's own postpartum needs. After her experience, Blake was so convinced of the benefits that she decided to learn how to encapsulate placentas for others and bring this service to the Ann Arbor area. She offers the service using either raw or traditional Chinese-inspired methods. She also offers organic placenta smoothies immediately after birth. Mothers can choose which services they want after talking with Blake. She can also help women navigate \"placenta plans,\" which ensure hospitals avoid using chemicals on the placenta and place it on ice right away.

Reiki Master Andrea Kennedy moved to Saline from Buffalo, New York, in 2015. She has been practicing Reiki for over 20 years and started her business, Mainstream Reiki, in the summer of 2016. She practices out of Borer Family Chiropractic in Saline and is committed to bringing Reiki to as many people as possible, which is why she named the business \"Mainstream.\" Many people often view Reiki as a strange and unscientific practice, she said, and therefore they aren't willing to try it. Science-oriented, Kennedy holds a B.S. in physics, so she aims to draw peoples' attention to the scientific research surrounding Reiki. It is being used in some hospitals, and studies have demonstrated faster healing after surgeries, less need for pain medication, and no harmful side effects. Kennedy also said that she is focused on healthcare and practicing Reiki in a healthcare setting to reach more people. Many practitioners use crystals and give off a \"new age vibe,\" she said, and while those things can be very positive, she feels it turns some people away. Reiki, said Kennedy, requires no belief and does not involve religion. A concept in Eastern medicine, Chi or Ki, or life force energy, is used in a variety of practices, such as in acupressure and acupuncture. Reiki, she explained, is an amalgamation of the Japanese words for \"higher power\" (rei) and \"life force energy\" (ki). Reiki helps this energy to flow through pathways in the body that can easily become blocked or impeded by physical or emotional stress. The practitioner can use light touch or no touch to manipulate the Ki. One of Reiki's benefits, said Kennedy, is that it is \"intensely relaxing.\" It can be used to help many different physical and emotional problems as well as general stress. Kennedy is also a Reiki instructor and will be offering level I and II certification classes on January 28 and 29, 2017, 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. More information and registration is available online. Mainstream Reiki's website is www.mainstreamreiki.com. Andrea Kennedy can be reached by email at andrea@mainstreamreiki.com or by phone at (734) 664-2255. Maggie Perrone relocated to Ann Arbor from the Los Angeles area in May of 2016, bringing her spiritual business, Genuine Journeys, with her. Perrone is a nurse with over 25 years of experience, and in 2008, earned a master of arts degree in pastoral ministry. Her full-time work is in oncology, administering chemotherapy and giving psycho-social counseling to cancer patients. Genuine Journeys, which she started in 2008, is about helping others \"create sacred space.\" She offers a wide variety of experiences, from one-hour talks to full weekend retreats, giving people tools to cope with everyday stresses. Additionally, Perrone is a Veriditas-certified Advanced Labyrinth Facilitator, and she uses the labyrinth in a variety of ways in her work. According to the Veriditas website, \"The labyrinth is a walking meditation, a path of prayer.... It has only one path that leads from the outer edge in a circuitous way to the center. There are no tricks to it and no dead ends. Unlike a maze where you lose your way, the labyrinth is a spiritual tool that can help you find your way.\" Perrone explained that the tools of the labyrinth can be used by people of any faith or no faith, and that it is \"about coming to terms with yourself.\" She also emphasized that through this work she can help people \"bring the spiritual into a really practical and plain place.\" Within the labyrinth, she said, there is one path into the center and one out, by retracing one's steps. She said that it is a metaphor for life. People can walk the labyrinth (locally there is one at St. Joseph Hospital and one at the Matthei Botanical Gardens) or use finger labyrinths. They can \"bring a question, thought or intention, or nothing,\" she said. The labyrinth can be used for \"grief, meditation, contemplative prayer, to answer a question, and more.\" Perrone has used this unique type of walking meditation to help people deal with chronic illness and pain, post-traumatic stress, caregiver fatigue, issues with being a woman in a sometimes misogynistic culture, and difficulties in discovering one's own unique gifts and calling. Perrone is working to bring her offerings to individuals and groups in the Ann Arbor area, her new home. Her work with the labyrinth can be adapted to many different needs, and she said the tools she teaches make it clear how to take them home and begin a personal practice. Genuine Journeys is online at www.genuinejourneys.com and www.facebook. com/genuinejourneys.

I'll ask people, 'Do you laugh a lot?' or 'How often do you wake up in the middle of the night?' [I] can get a picture and a good idea of where they're coming from.\"Discussing Spiritual Counseling with Lauren Tatarsky Having lived in the Ann Arbor area for six years now, I've occasionally seen listings for spiritual counseling. What exactly is spiritual counseling? I've often wondered, imagining a minister or rabbi, images from my childhood. It turns out ordained individuals are referred to as \"pastoral counselors,\" and a \"spiritual counselor\" can be a person of any or no religious background. I recently sat down with Ann Arbor-based spiritual counselor Lauren Tatarsky of Inspired Life Counseling to learn about spiritual counseling and discuss her practice. Per her website, Tatarsky's \"training includes therapeutic theories and techniques found in Transpersonal and Spiritual Psychology, specifically Psychosynthesis, Focusing, and Somatic Experiencing.\" Tatarsky enjoys all forms of the spiritual experience. \"I have a long history [of study] in Eastern meditation and Eastern religion. I also studied a lot of tarot and the paranormal, and my thesis was on after-death communication,\" she said. She welcomes people to share experiences that others may find unbelievable, such as visitations from loved ones who have died. Tatarsky herself has had experiences one might call paranormal or supernatural, some while working in hospice care. Once while sitting by a patient's bedside, she had the persistent image in her head of a little boy. \"I felt his presence,\" she explained, \"and his image came to my mind. And it was really strong and clear!\" She mentioned the boy to the patient's daughter, and the patient's daughter explained that her mother had had a brother who passed when he was five who fit that description. Tatarsky feels what really set her on her spiritual path was the strong feelings of her father's presence throughout her life. (He passed when she was nine years old.) \"I would be having a moment where I was really sad, and I could just feel him and know he was there,\" she said. She attended \"a really special school,\" the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, now re-named Sofia University, in Palo Alto, California. \"I got my master's in Spiritual Guidance.... We had courses on transpersonal psychology, but then we also had courses on things that were really about spiritual development ... what it means to grow spiritually.\" In her capacity as spiritual counselor, Tatarsky helps people learn to \"experience the fullness of life\" and be more engaged with their own lives and spiritual growth. This can involve \"what they want out of their life, their meaning, and their purpose. So it could be in the form of a job, or in the form of a partner, to the extent of exploring the occult.\" Whatever one needs or is seeking, she is honored to walk with them.In addition to working one-on-one, Tatarsky leads transformational workshops, ceremonies, and rituals. She has also been a Hatha Yoga teacher since 2010. If meeting in person is difficult or uncomfortable, she offers sessions via Skype or FaceTime. She also hates to turn people away over an inability to pay, so offers a sliding scale option for those in need. Learn more about Lauren at inspiredlifecounselinga2.com.

The Healing Properties of Essential Oils with Allegra Miller When I first spoke with Allegra Miller, I was struck by her knowledge, confidence, and desire to help others heal. I asked if she would describe herself as a wellness coach. She answered, \"Plant Wisdom Educator and Wellness Advocate is a more fitting description. I focus on educating and empowering others to utilize natural solutions in a context that encourages them to become stewards of their own wellbeing.\" Now a full-time wellness advocate/ leader for dTERRA, creators and distributors of certified pure therapeutic grade oils, Miller was once \"a driven pre-med student at [the University of Michigan]\" when \"a series of eye-opening healing opportunities pushed me to see the power of natural solutions in elevating all levels of wellbeing. I had grown up using high caliber essential oils and, later, worked with some of the world's finest oils during naturopathic training and work.\" As for right now, \"I am particularly passionate about contributing to workplace wellness programs and partnering with other practitioners to implement these natural solutions into their practices.\" One of the reasons Miller promotes dTERRA over other brands of essential oils is that they \"have a good relationship with the FDA\" and strive to \"stay FDA compliant.\" They also utilize what they call Co-Impact Sourcing, which is, according to their website, \"an initiative that seeks to develop long-term, mutually beneficial supplier partnerships while creating sustainable jobs and providing reliable income in underdeveloped areas.\" As Miller pointed out, many of the sources for essential oils are grown in developing countries, an opportunity for exploitation to the unscrupulous. When it comes to using essential oils for healing, Miller explained that we take in oils in three ways: aromatically (smelling), internally (ingesting), and topically (putting it on our skin). How it's used depends on the oil, which a person like Miller would help guide in. A person seeing Miller for the first time would \"start with an oil experience,\" meaning they would be introduced to some sample oils and their general uses. \"Lavender is good for burns,\" she offered as an example, and to \"communicate from one's heart.\" Next, they would \"talk about primary wellness concerns,\" such as chronic pain, allergies, or sleeplessness, just to name a few. Suggested therapies \"can consist of essential oils and supplements\" or pro-biotics and proper nutrition. Miller \"focus[es] Tatarksy welcomes people to share experiences that others may find unbelievable, such as visitations from loved ones who have died. Smell is the quickest way to affect mood. Miller was once \"a driven pre-med student at [the University of Michigan]\" when \"a series of eye-opening healing opportunities pushed me to see the power of natural solutions in elevating all levels of wellbeing.\"CRYSTA GOES VISITINGThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 21 3a lot on balancing the three brains: head, heart, and gut,\" which are \"very important for balancing the whole person.\" She also stresses \"work[ing] with the medical system\" in a way \"that doesn't give away one's autonomy.\" She wishes \"to educate and empower people to become their own wellness advocates.\" Some people, like myself, find taking medication difficult due to harsh side effects, and essential oils could be a fitting alternative treatment under the right supervision. And as real estate agents long ago discovered with cookies, \"smell is the quickest way to affect mood.\" Talking with Miller, I found the potential uses of essential oils to be boundless and compelling!

A Brief Introduction to Lomi Lomi with Stefani Colbourne Is deep tissue massage too painful? Is Swedish massage just not doing the trick? Have you tried lomi lomi? Lomi lomi (or just lomi to some) is the term for traditional Hawaiian massage, and it looks different from the other massage styles most people are accustomed to. It actually reminded me of tai chi with its fluid, dance-like movements when local lomi practitioner Stefani Colbourne showed me a video at her cozy studio in Saline, Michigan, Crescent Moon Healing Arts. In fact, learning lomi starts with a dance. As Colbourne explained, \"When one first learns lomi, they learn the dance first. It's called the Flying Meditation, and that's the prerequisite for you to learn the massage.\" It centers the practitioner in the moment and in the space. They reflect on \"what's going to be shared, what's going to come up, how am I able to serve [the client], how am I able to guide them?\" With its long, flowing strokes, lomi covers the entire body, front and back, foot to crown, including the face and up into the hairline. This is why most traditional practitioners prefer clients to be unclothed and do not use a massage sheet, though, Colbourne emphasizes, it is all about the comfort level of the client. (One man she worked on wouldn't even take his glasses off!) \"There's a lot of tummy work,\" she said, an area of the body many people aren't used to having touched. Colbourne told me that a mantra of lomi is love the being on the table \u2014 \"no matter who they are or where they came from,\" she said. Lomi is about loving and nurturing. (One of the alternate names for lomi lomi is \"Loving Hands\" massage.) This is in keeping with the concept of aloha, which translates to compassion, peace, love, and so on. Given its nurturing and cleansing nature, I asked Colbourne if she has had people cry. \"Oh yeah,\" she answered. \"Some people don't even realize they're doing it.\" She doesn't mind. Lomi removes blockages in the body's flow of energy, which can be emotional! If they want to talk about it, she said she is there for them, and if they don't, she won't say anything either, affirming again that she is there to facilitate healing. For most of its history, practicing lomi was kept private between certain Hawaiian families (styles vary by island and families), and it's only relatively recently that outsiders have been allowed to learn. It could incorporate hot stones and plant medicine into the healing, as well as drumming and prayer. Not being Hawaiian herself, Colbourne is very aware that what she practices is from a different culture. She tries to honor and \"maintain the integrity\" of the tradition by being true to how she was taught. She acknowledges that there are people out there claiming to practice lomi who have not properly been trained. \"Watching a YouTube video doesn't cut it,\" she said wryly. If you would like to experience lomi lomi, contact Stefani at (734) 846-9949 or crescent.moon.lomi@gmail.com. \"When one first learns lomi, they learn the dance first. It's called the Flying Meditation, and that's the prerequisite for you to learn the massage.\"OSTEOPA THIC MA NIPULATIVE MEDICI NE Where the Science of Medicine Meets the Art of TouchOsteopathy: True Holistic Medicine By restoring structural health, the whole being begins to heal. 5889 Whitmore Lake Road, Suite 4, Brighton ONLY 15 MINUTES NORTH OF ANN ARBOR * Read more about Dr Rose's work in Issue 64 of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal - http://bit.ly/susanrose Treats pain and imbalances anywhere in body with gentle manual medicine techniques.

Once the field manager for Seeds of Change (now a national seed company), Pecoraro had been doing seed work his whole life. \"[While] growing produce for farmers' markets and CSA's (Community Supported Agriculture), restaurants and groceries, he was also selling seeds he had saved himself. He was doing direct pack sales, like what I'm doing [now], and also he was a contract grower, so bigger companies like Seeds of Change would buy from him.\" \"The engineer side of me likes the challenge of agriculture, and seeds, in particular,\" Kampe explained. \"Every crop is its own puzzle, but you work at it, and it can drive you crazy because it can take years to really figure it out.\" If you make a mistake, you can't fix it immediately; you have to wait for another year before you can try again. \"But it's really rewarding when you get it right.\" After four years in Colorado, Kampe and his wife moved back home to Michigan, where he hoped to become a grower and seed saver. The seed saving aspect is unique because not many people do it in this area. It's a time consuming effort for the small farmer who doesn't have the large combine to do the work of harvesting, separating, chafing, and winnowing seeds for sale and later planting. A small farmer, like Kampe, can't afford the cost of such machinery, but Kampe feels \"it's something important that [he] can share.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 28 This is part of a series of articles we've been doing on local business owners and their relatively newer businesses. As the economy in Michigan has struggled over many years, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here. What follows are personal profiles of two businesses that are thriving despite the odds. By Mary Runser Photos by Susan Ayer Eric Kampe, owner of Ann Arbor Seed Company, grew up in Shelby Township, a suburb of Detroit, without a background in farming. \"There was some farming in my grandparents' generation, but that's true of nearly everyone,\" he said. Before venturing into the life of a farmer, or perhaps gardener would be a more appropriate description, Kampe was an engineer with a computer engineering degree from the University of Michigan. \"The engineering work I did was good and it was mentally engaging.... But I had this idea that I could do something with a better environmental impact; something that allowed me to work with my hands.\" While living in Boulder, Colorado, Kampe began volunteering at organic farms and got swept up, falling in love with growing, farming, and gardening. Taking a leap of faith, he left engineering and began working full time at Abbondanza Organic Seeds and Produce, an organic farm outside of Boulder owned by Richard Pecoraro, who became Kampe's mentor. Ann Arbor Seed Company \u2014 Sowing Seeds of Goodness Ann Arbor Seed Company Eric KampeP .O. Box 3382 Ann Arbor, MI 48106eric@a2seeds.com; www.a2seeds.com\"The engineer side of me likes the challenge of agriculture, and seeds, in particular,\" Kampe explained. \"Every crop is its own puzzle, but you work at it, and it can drive you crazy because it can take years to really figure it out.\" Eric Kampe & Meredith Kahn at the HomeGrown Festival \"People aren't as attached to or as interactive with agriculture and food as we once were,\" Kampe explained. It's more convenient and less time consuming to go to the nearest grocery store and purchase the items we once went to the garden to pick. But that convenience has distanced us from the freshness and flavor of food the way it's meant to be experienced, allowing hybrid (non-GMO) and genetically modified fruits and vegetables to saturate the market. There are many varieties of heirlooms, each with a certain flavor, color, or other appeal, and are not meant to be grown in mass quantities, so we've lost a number of them over the years, some that have been around since the end of World War I. Kampe grows several varieties and species of heirloom produce. \"I can't save them all,\" said Kampe, \"but I can keep some of them going for a while, and that is a good feeling.\" Ann Arbor Seed Company is currently finishing its fourth growing season. Kampe said, \"I've made lots of mistakes and killed many plants... but I think I'm figuring out a lot about agriculture and growing as I go along.\" He knew that he couldn't succeed in building a successful business and make a profit in any quick manner. \"I'm only able to do this because my wife has a good job as a librarian at the University of Michigan, and she's supportive of this mission. It takes time to establish a seed farm because you can't grow your entire crop every season. It takes several seasons to work the bugs out.\" Ann Arbor Seed Company focuses on the local farmer and providing them with a full offering of produce, including tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, carrots, and rutabagas, through their online seed catalog. Though their main focus is growing for seeds, Kampe and his co-worker Stacy have had a fair amount of success selling their produce at Argus Farm Stop, Green Things Farm, the Farm at St. Joe's, and various local restaurants, such as the Grange and Juicy Kitchen. They also take their produce and seed racks to the Kerrytown Farmers' Market, and their seeds are available for sale in various retail locations throughout the Ann Arbor and Detroit area. \"We have a great online seed catalog as well,\" Kampe said. If you are interested in growing your own food and getting back in touch with the fresh, delicious taste of homegrown produce, try ordering some of Ann Arbor Seed Company's heirloom tomatoes and lettuce seeds or some Jimmy Nardello peppers online, or pick them up at a local retailer, and discover what you've been missing. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 29 Feature continued on page 30 Think you are to o busy to eat w ell?

But that convenience has distanced us from the freshness and flavor of food the way it's meant to be experienced, allowing hybrid (non-GMO) and genetically modified fruits and vegetables to saturate the market. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 30 Feature continued from page 29 \"My grandfather was a beekeeper, and one day, while he was separating some honey from the beeswax, he handed a little pile of wood, some nails, and a hammer to my brother and me and told us to build something and stay out of the way,\" Matthew Millar of Vintage Village and Renovatio Woodworks recalled. He's been working with wood ever since. Millar lived in Northville, Michigan, until he was nine years old. He spent his junior high school years in Birmingham; Brighton for high school; and after that he joined the Navy. In the beginning, Millar taught sailing classes on Midway Island, and later was aboard a ship out of Alameda in the San Francisco Bay Area for three years. \"I eventually made my way back toward the Ann Arbor area because I thought that out of all the cities I saw, Ann Arbor was just as cosmopolitan a city as any. So, I ended up settling here in Chelsea.\" While Millar has an associate's degree from Washtenaw Community College and a bachelor's degree in Technology Education from Eastern Michigan University, most of his formal wood-working training has come through hands-on experience with other woodworkers and contractors. \"Most of what I've learned has come from taking furniture apart to see how things were built from the late 1800s all the way through the 1950s and 1960s. And so a lot of the woodworking techniques I employ for the furniture I build are old world style techniques,\" he explained. By old world style, he means simple, strong construction versus \"fanciful construction with sophisticated joinery.\" Mid-century Modern is his favorite style, with flared legs and funky Space Age shaped components. Millar credits much of his technical education and improvement in wood working to Bruce Simon of Simon Construction Company out of Bend, Oregon. \"He helped me to start thinking more precisely about my cuts and joints, and about keeping within the tolerances.\" When you're working on such projects, the details matter. \"I worked with an old Swedish Carpenter in Grand Rapids and learned from him that the simplest way is the best way. I was very impressed, not only with the way he did carpentry, but with the way he did life and treated people.\" One day, while working in the woodshop in the bottom of a barn, Millar looked around and noticed how beautiful the rustic wood was, the way the light hit it, the different tones it took depending on the stage of finish it was in. He reclaimed a beautiful wide piece of wood from the burn pile and turned it into a wine rack that went to a restaurant in Indiana. \"Sometimes it's an area on a board where a horse chewed on it, and that becomes a part of the character of the wood,\" he said. He aims to deliver that story in all his furniture. All the wear and tear and nail holes are a representation of the history and the life of the wood. For Millar, it's all about embracing and sharing that complexity with people who appreciate this natural element. \"I just love wood. I almost hated opening up the doors of the shop this morning because the whole place had the wonderful aroma of some cedar I'd cut last week.... It was like aromatherapy to anyone who came through the shop.\" Vintage Village and Renovatio Woodworks \u2014 Local Artisan Breathes New Life into Old Wood Vintage Village and Renovatio Woodworks 12290 E Old US Hwy 12, Chelsea, Michigan 48118 (734) 475-0985; renovatiowoodwork.weebly.com Matthew Millar of Vintage Village & Renovatio Woodworks\"Most of what I've learned has come from taking furniture apart to see how things were built from the late 1800s all the way through the 1950s and 1960s. And so a lot of the woodworking techniques I employ for the furniture I build are old world style techniques.\" - Matthew Millar, owner and woodworkerIn the past few years, several young apprentices have sought Millar's help and worked under his guidance. \"I always try to convey to them about feeling, understanding the wood, and the process of working with it to bring it to a point where the finished product will tell a story and convey a personality and feel,\" Millar explained. We were privileged on the day we spoke to be joined by an unexpected and thoroughly delightful guest. His name was Bruno Koper, a Frenchman by birth, a retired professor and artist by trade, and a bicyclist by choice. Koper found Vintage Village by chance as he was riding his bike down Michigan Avenue. He'd flown from Paris, France, to Ontario, Canada, to visit with a friend, and was now in the process of riding from Ontario to Chicago to visit another friend. After learning that Koper taught art history, and particularly classes in poster art, Millar showed him a framed poster he had in the store. Koper was excited when he recognized the name of the artist. \"And welcome to Vintage Village,\" Millar said after Koper left us. \"This is part of the normal experience here.\" In the nine months that Millar has been in both the wood shop and the retail space, sales have nearly tripled since its first soft open above the Barbeque 52 in downtown Chelsea. \"With this new visible location, we're slowly and steadily becoming known to people. Steady, slow growth is what I prefer,\" Millar said. Take a drive out to Vintage Village and Renovatio Woodworks and make a new friend in Millar, peruse Vintage Village, with its offerings of fine art, handmade soaps, photography, beeswax candles, handbags, funky lamps from repurposed vintage metal, select antiques like a Victrola phonograph and trendel sewing machine, and its freshly roasted whole bean Roos Roast coffee and Mindo Chocolates. Before long you'll find you've become part of the family. Millar also likes to keep things fresh, so if you're an artist from Michigan, he would love to talk to you about sharing your Michigan art and artisanal goods with the world via Vintage Village. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 31 ART, TAROT &CANDLES KOKOPELLl1S KORNER ll( SPIRITUAL SHOP Vibrational S ound by Y avia (Sound Massage) Jessi Carrier Reflexologist TUMBLED STONES AND CRYSTALS SMUDGE STICKS AND INCENSE SPECIALTY ORGANIC TEAS ESSENTIAL OILS ORGANIC HERBS DRUMS AND CHIMES AND MUCH MORE! 0 111 E Grand River, Howell, Ml 48843 586.630.9323 One day, while working in the woodshop in the bottom of a barn, Millar looked around and noticed how beautiful the rustic wood was, the way the light hit it, the different tones it took depending on the stage of finish it was in.

This issue, we are profiling another business offering space, tools, and teaching, but in a very different medium. Pink Castle Fabrics has a small retail space on the West Side of Ann Arbor, and may seem modest to outsiders. But with a global reach through their online community, retreats, and Instagram feed, Pink Castle Fabrics invigorates and innovates in a uniquely modern format. Pink Castle Fabrics sits in a plain building behind the main post office on Stadium, adorned with a small sign. Primarily an online retailer of modern patterned quilting fabric, their physical space is modest yet appealing. Entering, my eyes drink in the vibrancy on the shelves, each an explosion of color and softness. Silky deep magenta fabric with gold circles, gossamer thin lawn fabric popping with pink and yellow crocuses, textured vibrant orange canvas with a tracery of the periodic table in yellow. The inventory is small and selective, and I note that the quality and variation exceed what I have seen elsewhere. This clearly isn't your grandmother's quilting style. Brenda Ratliff, co-owner of Pink Castle Fabrics, agrees. It's definitely grown, especially with the modern stuff. There's a modern quilt guild out there now. We have one in Ann Arbor that I founded four and a half years ago, before we started our shop. Quilt guilds have been around for a long time, but the more modern national guild has grown over the last five years to international status, and they have a juried show. Ratliff, a woman in her early 30's with a sleek cap of light brown hair, greets me in the retail area and guides me into the back room. There I meet her husband, Jason Elliott, who manages the finances for Pink Castle Fabrics, and their son, David, who is busy coloring at his desk. We seat ourselves near David, while other employees move back and forth on their way to errands between the front retail area and the office areas behind.Pink Castle Fabrics began as an online store four years ago, two years after Ratliff began quilting. She had been working with a business incubator in Detroit called Bizdom, when she explained: David was born with a heart condition, so I wasn't able to move forward with it. I tried to get a corporate job, but it's hard to get back into work when you've been away, even for a few months. I learned to quilt from tutorials online. My mom and my grandma both sew, but they sew garments, neither one of them quilt. So I knew how to use a sewing machine...I knew just enough to be dangerous! [she laughs] Elliott went to art school, focusing on 3-D animation, and did graphic design jobs and 3-D modeling for Daimler before moving over to Pink Castle Fabrics. Ratliff's degree is in sociology, but she also went to school for marketing. [The] only reason our business is so big is because of the marketing we do. I'm an early adopter on social media. In 1995-96, in high school, chat rooms were just beginning, and I would skip class to chat. Lots of quilters [are] on Instagram. We've got 19,000 followers on Instagram. After opening online in February of 2011, Pink Castle Fabrics held their first sewing retreat in December that year. The retreats have grown to 200 people, are held twice a year, and sell out months in advance. They opened their first physical space in 2013 near the airport, but have since moved to Federal Street off Stadium Blvd. Given their origins, I asked them what differences they noticed between an online community and a physical one. \"It's very different,\" Ratliff began, \"like two separate businesses, with online being very visual, using Instagram, Facebook. With social media you get instant feedback. Manufacturers and designers inform the community as a whole of different fabric and lines, so online buyers know what they are looking for months ahead of time.\" Comparatively, with the in-store customer, \"They Entering, my eyes drink in the vibrancy on the shelves, each an explosion of color and softness. This clearly isn't your grandmother's quilting style. Brenda Ratliff, Co-Owner Pink Castle Fabrics Pink Castle Fabrics began as an online store four years ago, two years after Ratliff began quilting. Pink Castle Fabrics has 19,000 followers on Instagram.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 33 have a purpose or project in mind when they come in; it's a different type of buying. They are tactile buyers, they need to see what it looks like. On the computer screen color shows different. We are getting the hang of both.\" Physically, \"We do better with our retreats, which are a great way to learn, but they aren't as often.\" Explaining the sewing retreats, Elliott offered: We call it Glamp Stitchalot. It's just like actual summer camp. I was there at the end of the retreat, helping them tear down and taking stuff back to the shop, and a couple of the campers were like, 'Is it done, do we have to leave now?' They're sad to see everyone go and they are sharing addresses, they all wanted to keep in touch. We've got people coming to the retreat from all around the world. \"We had one lady, Sonia, she told me two years ago: 'My family doesn't get it, they don't understand how fun this is for me. I try to talk to them about fabric, about quilting, and they don't want to hear it. It's the first time I've found my people,'\" said Ratliff. \"It's cool to hear that, to see them making friends with each other and keeping in touch.\" When I remark on the exponential growth that social media and online communities have had on crafting, Elliott replied, \"It's a hobby you can do with your friends outside your house, even though you are staying home. Brenda and Dave can be in her sewing room, he's watching TV, and you,\" he gestured to Ratliff, \"at the same time, are sewing and talking to your friends, who are sewing at their house with their kids.\" Ratliff joins in: Or let's say you are working, this time of life, early 30's part of your careers, sometimes you have to work a lot. I have a friend, she is an attorney, she doesn't get a lot of time off, but when she does, she browses social media. It's worldwide. First thing I do when I get up is see what people have been doing overnight, in Australia and England, it's really cool to be able to see it. The U.S. is the biggest quilting country, but in Australia and England they do brighter colors. In Asia they do a lot of different substrates, they add in a lot more linen and lawn, they do small zaka projects, things for the home, a little basket. It's fun to see the different projects, the way it differs, and it doesn't really differ. Ratliff continued: In fact, lots of people like to do quilt-a-longs (a round robin quilt where everyone does a piece). Online, a quilt-a-long [happens such that] 'I'm going to make this pattern this day. If you want to join, with this hashtag, quilt-a-long.' It started three years ago with Scrappy quilt-a-long: use your scraps, use what you have, right after Christmas, [and] like 3,000 people were making that quilt that weekend. It got so big they wrote an article about it in American Quilt Retailer and other magazines. Really crazy. You can immediately start it. You can click on the hashtag and see what everyone else is doing. You can give them encouragement, you can ask a question and get an answer, especially if you've got the hashtag right there. It was really cool that that kind of thing started. Now people will do 'Saturday night sew along' and use the hashtag. When I ask about the collaboration she witnesses within the community of her store and its retreats, her face lit up. We've got people coming to the retreat from all around the world.

With the quilt guild retreats, we meet once a month and there's a lot of sharing. If I'm stitching and my seams don't match, someone may say, 'Oh, let me show you a trick I do,' and there's a lot of that going on even when there's no formal instruction. I know in some crafts some people don't share what they learn, but this is not that type of community. With quilters, people are all about free content on their blog. If you have a question, they are very open about 'here's how I do this' because that helps everybody. I'm not going to steal your technique, it's just a technique. Community is a tangible asset of quilting, but other, intangible benefits, also accrue. Elliott reflected, \"I think some of it is so many people these days have jobs where they don't actually produce something. They have jobs where they work at a computer, or they answer phones. They don't make anything and this is something they can make.\" I noted that it also gives the fulfillment of completion, which causes Ratliff to sit up in agreement. Pink Castle Fabrics Continued from page 33Right, my email box will never be empty. I think that's a lot of it. I think the people who quilt now, some of them are women who went to college and have a degree and are used to doing something and now they are staying home. That's what happened to me. 'I have no idea what to do and I've gotta do something or I'm going to go crazy.' You have all of these intelligent people with time to do it and then, like you said [gesturing to her husband] there are other people who have these jobs they are never going to get to the end of and now they've got all these beautiful finished projects. I think people are missing out on trying out those types of things in school. We don't have the home economics requirement anymore. You aren't required to make your own clothes; don't know how to make napkins, or something that is really, really easy. Elliott added, \"Or what do you do when a button falls off?\" In the book Shop Class as Soulcraft (Penguin, 2010) philosopher and motorcycle mechanic Matthew Crawford muses on how his work in his motorcycle shop feeds and supports a different consciousness: how being able to do \u2014 to pack a ball bearing with grease properly and make a wheel function \u2014 creates a sense of agency and accomplishment in the wider world. Physical action then supports the nonphysical world of values: struggle, skill, problem solving, and completion. He argues that we need the trades \u2014 wood shop, home economics \u2014 more now than ever. Work is no longer one job until you retire; many of us will hold many different jobs over a lifetime and those jobs demand a different skill set. Flexibility and adaptability are skills in themselves, helping us to accommodate the changes in our workplaces, and, Crawford argues, can only be learned through doing with the body. When I mention Crawford's theory to Ratliff and Elliott, they both pause. \"I don't think people think about that when they are going into it, but yeah, I'm definitely more confident after I've finished projects,\" said Ratliff. \"I used to knit, and frogging your knitting is a sad thing; definitely easier to un-sew something than un-knit. With making a garment, it has to fit, but with quilting, sometimes you can just leave it in, that's a mistake but it's a design element now.\" Making also creates a different relationship to your objects. Ratliff explained: When I remark on the exponential growth that social media and online communities have had on crafting, Elliott replied, \"It's a hobby you can do with your friends outside your house, even though you are staying home.\" \"With quilters, people are all about free content on their blog. If you have a question, they are very open about 'here's how I do this' because that helps everybody. I'm not going to steal your technique, it's just a technique.\" -Brenda Ratliff, Co-Owner Pink Castle Fabrics \"I think some of it is so many people these days have jobs where they don't actually produce something. They have jobs where they work at a computer.... and this is something they can make.\" -Jason Elliott, Co-Owner of Pink Castle Fabrics The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 35 My attitude definitely changed since I learned how to quilt and learned garment sewing. I'm definitely pickier about where I buy my clothes. I'm pickier about what I purchase, I want it to be a piece that will last a long time. It may be my age, but that's kind of a trend I see with a lot of people I know in the sewing community: less but nicer. [You] grow up, want a nicer couch. I think it's an important thing people should learn, is how long things take to make. Now there's like a big movement: who made my clothes? Like fashion exposed; the conditions of people working to make clothes for Walmart. I don't think people realize, until they start looking into it, just how long it takes to make clothing and quilts and these kinds of things, even to knit a sweater. I think in Ann Arbor we see this more than in some cities, where people are over-shopped. Elliott added, \"It's easy to throw away when you don't know where it came from.\" He also points out that it's hard to value something when you don't know anything about it. \"People ask if you sell your quilts,\" he said, gesturing to Ratliff on the sofa. \"It took a hundred hours, so I'll sell it for $2,000, and people are like, 'You are crazy, I'll give you $50 for it.' The raw materials cost more than that! But if something is mass produced, you don't know that.\" Ratliff added: There are people that do appreciate quilting as an art form. And there are art quilters out there, they are a different skill set all together. The modern quilts are meant to be used. It doesn't mean they aren't pretty. That's a definite trend, people are like, 'I'm not making this to put on my wall, on my couch, but I want someone to be warm.' I probably have about 20 quilts in my living room. Elliott related a story from their recent trip to Quilt Market, the major national event for quilting retailers, which emphasizes Crawford's theory. \"We were walking with Sara, and she had made her dress and people are asking her, 'Oh, I like that dress, where did you get the fabric?' And we go outside the market and people are like, 'I like that dress, where did you buy it?' It's the same information, but a different question altogether.\" Ratliff finished the story, \"As soon as they found out she made it, they were like,\" throwing her hands up in the air, \"Forget it! Like, 'There's no way I could make a dress that beautiful.' She's 33! It's not like she's been sewing forever.\" While quilting cotton is stiffer than garment fabric, the skills with sewing machines are versatile, allowing for cross-pollination and experimentation. \"We did a dressmaking retreat in May 2015, which is a little out of my wheelhouse,\" commented Ratliff. [Mostly] they all knew how to use a sewing machine. It was quilters who were trying garment sewing for once. A couple of the girls had never made a dress before, so we made a dress, a really big confidence booster. We focused on fit. It was kinda fun, we got to measure each other, find out what your actual measurements are and modify the pattern. We had a girl who was six feet tall \u2014 she had to lengthen it. Who participates and comprises their community? \"[The] age range, with retreats, I thought it would be my age [early 30's], but it's people who are older, they have the time, the means to go. It's harder for me to get away, I have a five year old,\" Ratliff said. Added Elliott, \"It's not that the younger crowd doesn't sew though, it's that they don't have the time to go. It's a lot of new moms.\" Both express regret about the lack of gender diversity in the community. \"If you are a male quilter, you are kind of instantly famous,\" related Ratliff, \"because there aren't that many of them. In our society we look down at men who quilt, because they think it's women's work. I think there are a lot of men who would be interested; it's geometry, it's math, there's men out there who like that sort of thing but who won't do it because its a women's thing.\" Elliott added, \"Woodworking is not a popular hobby for women, and I think it's more accepted for a female woodworker than a male quilter.\" Ratliff would love to see more men at the machine: \"[It's] kind of sad, I wish there would be more men quilters. I think it would be really nice to have more men's take on it.\" She hands me her phone with a photograph of a white backed quilt with colorful triangles creating a circle, echoing the spectrum of visual light, and said: One guy, his wife is an author and quilts in the U.K. He made this design, elaborate triangles in a curve on a computer, because that's his day job. And his wife taught him the skills to do it with cloth. He's taking math and making. These guys make really cool stuff. There needs to be more variety. Propelling all of this \u2014 quilts, making, and creating \u2014 is joy. \"Those ladies,\" said Ratliff, referring to the retreat goers, are there to have fun, that's the thing. It's a happy occasion for all those people. It's a happy [craft], you think of quilts and you think of weddings, babies, birthday. Quilters do a lot for charity \u2014 do charity quilts for Mott Hospital and the VA. \"It's a very social hobby,\" added Elliott. Ratliff continued: \"When I say I quilt, people are like, 'Oh, that's nice, let's talk about the football game.' When they see what I actually do,\" her eyes open wide and she mimics surprise, \"they are like, 'Oh, you don't just have a store on Etsy.' No, it's a legitimate business with employees and taxes.\" Elliott interrupts, adding, \"I get that a lot, too, being a man who works in a quilt store. You always think of quilting as a grandma's hobby, not as a younger modern thing; the perception of what it has been in the past versus what it is nowadays. Then when my friends see the fabric, they are like, 'That's not so bad.'\" And the future? Elliott replied: \"More exporting. Countries that can't get the fabrics that we have here and they see it through English speaking channels. Online, they are filling the need they have, but it's hard to help them finish the project if you don't have the tools.\" Ratliff, who debuted her first fabric line in 2015, said: I'd like to expand to more than one physical place. More importing and add sewing machines into our shop. The Pink Castle empire. One reason our online shop is so successful is people who don't have a quality quilt shop, shop online. Quilting is a whole world. I'd like for people to at least have the knowledge of quilting, to gain appreciation, to see it come more mainstream.

I love the way it sounds, but have found that not every term is explained. Though I often do look for context and ask questions, there is one in particular I am reticent about asking ... what is a Drishti point? James P ., Ann ArborDear James \u2014 To begin, congratulations! Trying out a new studio, or even a new instructor at your usual studio, can be a bit overwhelming as an effective yoga practice is largely built upon trust and understanding between instructor and student. For a trusting relationship to develop, the student should feel comfortable approaching the instructor with questions. But this usually takes some time. Or, you may find that your instructor chooses to explain a different term or principle in each class (there are so many!) \"Drishti\" in Sanskrit translates to \"gaze\" or \"view.\" It is a technique used both in asana (postures) and medita-tion practices to focus the eyes. In Virabhadrasana II (Warrior Two), for example, we focus our gaze on the front fingertips. By holding the gaze on this fixed point, we are able to allow the mind to focus and the breath and the body to work together to really get the most out of this posture. We also use Drishti points for en-gagement in balance postures. By fixing the gaze, we allow our focus to develop more fully and the body to open up into a space for stability. Drishti also relates to Pratyahara, another aspect of yoga philosophy, which means withdrawal of the senses. One of the precursors to meditation is being able to switch off the senses in order to shift your focus Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, you'll find a variety of useful tips from local yoga instructor Katie Hoener. Namaste, Katie... inward. To help engage in meditation, we can practice Drishti-play, where we actually move our focus with the eyes closed! A common way to start is by bringing your awareness and focus to the tip of the nose, and then moving up to the space between the eyebrows. Only play with these when you are ready \u2014 it is helpful to first use Drishti while in an asana practice and gain confidence and comfort in that environment before incorporating it into your meditation practice. Dear Katie \u2014 I spent the warm months out and about hiking and enjoying nature. I am hoping to spend these winter months using yoga to connect internally in that same way, and I'd also like to maintain my strength. Any tips? Libby T., ChelseaDear Libby \u2014 Yoga is a great way to capture the serenity of nature inside the home or studio! As the practice of yoga teaches us, all the peace and serenity that we need lies within us; we simply need to take the time to connect with that space. So, whether you choose to practice at home or in a class setting, yoga is a great way to maintain strength and connect with your internal peace. Standing postures are wonderful for maintaining leg strength over the winter months. A good posture for overall leg strength is Utkatasana (Chair Pose). Some prefer the balls of the feet touching in their Utkatasana, and others prefer feet hip-distance apart. Feel free to try both to see which is a better fit for your body. With your foundation set, bend the knees, with the tailbone reaching back, as though you were moving backward to sit in a chair. Watch that the knees do not extend forward of the toes, in order to keep the ligaments of the knees safe. The arms can float up to shoulder height, shoulder blades reaching down the back, or the arms can continue to reach up in the direction of the sky. Maintain connection with the abdomen and allow the breath to be full. Stay here for a few breaths, perhaps sinking down a bit further with an exhale. When ready, use an inhale to float out of the posture and then exhale into an Uttanasana (Forward Fold Pose) to give the body space to relax. For leg strength, Chair Pose is a great place to start, and combined with other standing postures, you should have no problem keeping your legs fit over the winter months. Dear Katie \u2014I've read about a few cooling/calming breath practices and, on occasion, have used them off the mat when feeling anxious. Is there a breath technique that I can use during the afternoons for my afternoon slump? A little pick-me up? Kara L., Ann ArborDear Kara\u2014 Of course! There is a pranayama technique for everything! Should you choose to dive into the ancient yogic texts, there are breath techniques to ward off spirits, to aid in digestions, to clear the brain, to stoke desire \u2014 you name it, it exists. Of course, not too many of these have made it to our modern practice, and some practices have evolved to fit our current lifestyles (though they may still be practiced by some). One beautiful heating breath I love when I need a little afternoon boost is Bhastrika Pranayama (Bellows Breath). Although you'll need a little space, and people may ask what you are doing, it is a quick way to increase blood flow and invigorate the breath through the body. Bhastrika can be practiced standing or sitting. Make light fists with the hands and bring them up to shoulder height. Keep the arms engaged yet light. On the inhale, raise the hands toward the sky, arms straightening, while keeping the shoulder blades grounded. The inhale stays at our regular inhale pace. The exhale will be quick through the nose, bending the elbows and returning the arms back in and close to the body, with hands near the shoulders again. Inhale nice and long, arms float overhead. Exhale quickly with sound, arms pull back to side. Repeat three to five times. Take a few breaths and see how you feel. If you feel like another round of three to five breaths, go ahead. This practice can be built over time to several rounds of 10. In the beginning we don't want to overdo it, as the addition of oxygen can leave us feeling lightheaded. Enjoy this natural boost! Standing postures are wonderful for maintaining leg strength over the winter months. A good posture for overall leg strength is Utkatasana (Chair Pose).

Despite a general consensus that sexual health is an important marker of our vitality and wellbeing, it can be ignored in outpatient medical settings. When sexual health is improved, reduction in pain symptoms, better sleep, and even enhanced immunity can be seen. Sexual health is an important aspect of wellbeing and, because it is often the most ignored, deserves special recognition.Perhaps optimal sexual health can best be defined as \"A level of intimacy with one's own body and that of a partner's that is satisfying to both and enhances overall vitality in the four health domains (biological, psychological, social, and spiritual).\" Recognition and acknowledgement of a problem is still an important first step. It allows for emotional release, which in itself is therapeutic.Sexual Health - The Sixth Vital Sign? Temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rate \u2014 these are the four classic medical vital signs. When one or more are out of range, we look for possible underlying pathologies like infections, cancers, and heart or lung conditions. The four classic vital signs are objective measurements. However, in 1996, the American Pain Society introduced the concept of using subjective pain as a \"fifth vital sign\" to emphasize the importance of assessing and addressing this aspect of a patient's experience. This awareness was particularly important to bring to an inpatient setting, such as a hospital, where it wouldn't necessarily come up. The designation of pain as a fifth vital sign prompted more discussion in inpatient settings between health providers and patients about this important, but ignored, concern. In the outpatient integrative medical clinic setting, if both parties have enough time and a good working relationship, most aspects of a patient's experience get assessed and addressed in some way: pain, mood, weight gain, substance use, and almost any other physical symptom or disease process. Yet despite a general consensus that sexual health is an important marker of our vitality and wellbeing, it can be ignored in outpatient medical settings, just as pain assessment was overlooked in inpatient settings. While providers may be comfortable talking with patients about some of the most intimate details of their bodies, the topic of sexual health is not often broached. Health providers' reticence in asking about sexual health is understandable; many patients do not want to talk openly about their sex lives and may even feel offended when their provider brings it up. Also, there is often no need to broach the subject. Skilled integrative medical practitioners can bring many of their clientele back to health using their usual array of techniques. However, when an answer to a particularly difficult case is hard to find, it is worth seeing if there are factors like sexual health that are being left unaddressed. The bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model of health has gained traction even in so-called conventional medical settings. This framework states that biological, psychological, social, and spiritual factors all play a role in any given disease process. What follows from this framework is the understanding that effective care addresses all of these components. The bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model explains why we see better control of a person's diabetes when they reconnect with old friends, or why we might see low back pain significantly improve after a person has started a spiritual practice that resonates, or ended one that did not resonate. It can explain why we could see a cancer remission after someone has ended a difficult relationship. Conversely, it can explain why a rash might develop after someone starts a stressful new job or why a non-smoking adult might develop asthma after a loved one has passed away from lung cancer, due to unresolved grief. Sexual health crosses the boundaries between biological, psychological, social, and spiritual domains, making its assessment an important tool in gauging overall health. For example, erectile dysfunction may be the first symptom to develop with the onset of diabetes or vascular disease. Or for some individuals, chronic abdominal pain may manifest years after being sexually assaulted. When sexual health is improved, reduction in pain symptoms, better sleep, and even enhanced immunity can be seen.Sexual health is an important aspect of wellbeing and, because it is often the most ignored, deserves special recognition. For these reasons, perhaps sexual health should be thought of as a sixth vital sign. Would such a designation help clinicians remember to have more robust dialogue about this sensitive topic with patients?Identification of sexual health issues is complicated by several challenges. One is the task of simply defining optimal sexual health. Achieving an ideal weight or a reasonable level of depressive symptoms are difficult processes, but have identifiable goals. Optimal sexual health varies widely among individuals and within one individual's life course. Even a permanent absence of all sexual activity can be a healthy choice. Given such variability, perhaps optimal sexual health can best be defined as \"A level of intimacy with one's own body and that of a partner's that is satisfying to both and enhances overall vitality in the four health domains (biological, psychological, social, and spiritual).\" Often, individuals may not feel there is a problem with their psychological, social, spiritual, or sexual health. In this case, the issue is \"ego-syntonic.\" An ego-syntonic problem is one that goes unacknowledged. For example, alcoholism can be ego-syntonic; despite negative consequences, a person may feel the situation is acceptable. Conversely, an ego-dystonic issue is one that a patient readily acknowledges as causing obvious distress. When there is an ego-syntonic (unacknowledged) issue in one health domain, it may present as an ego-dystonic (acknowledged) problem in another domain. In the case of a person who has a rash develop after starting a stressful new job, they may find the work very enjoyable and have difficulty seeing the connection between the rash and the job. Or the non-smoking adult who develops asthma after a loved one has passed away from lung cancer may not have symptoms until five years later and cannot recognize the unresolved feelings underlying their illness. Sexual health issues can be particularly ego-syntonic. Regardless of their approach, even medical providers with excellent rapport-building skills will not be able to elicit information about problems of which the patient is unaware. Ego-syntonic dysfunction in any health domain is difficult for a practitioner to deal with. Treating sexual health as a vital sign \u2014 bringing it up as part of a routine assessment and re-assessing it when improvement of a biological disease process has been stalled \u2014 normalizes discussion of the topic and helps a person feel more comfortable mentioning the problem when they have identified it, even months or years later.While definition and recognition of the problem is one hurdle, addressing the problem also has its challenges. Suboptimal sexual function can sometimes be addressed by strictly biological means, such as medications for erectile dysfunction or hormone replacement therapy in the appropriate age group. However, sexual concerns often signal problems within a romantic relationship. Most medical providers do not have extensive training in counseling techniques and worry that asking about issues they are unprepared to treat may leave people feeling stranded. In addition, it is important for providers to understand that asking about any problem with which a patient is struggling can often make the person feel worse in the short-term, which is a normal human reaction when initially acknowledging a difficult situation. Recognition and acknowledgement of a problem is still an important first step. It allows for emotional release, which in itself is therapeutic. Also, it gives an individual the opportunity to reassess their situation and come up with ways of healing themselves that are often surprisingly creative. For all these reasons, I feel that sexual health deserves greater and more serious consideration in medical practice \u2014 as a vital sign, if you will. Open and honest dialogue about our bodies, minds, hearts, and souls will be crucial t o the future of medical practice, where the primary challenge will not only be adding years to our lives, but adding joy and vitality to those years.

In 1995, when Rene and her husband, Matt Greff, opened the brewpub on Washington Street, craft beer was anything but mainstream. A few brands were paving the way, including Samuel Adams in Boston, Sierra Nevada and Anchor Brewing in California, and Bell's Brewery in Michigan, but American beer sales and consciousness were dominated by light, insipid lagers produced by mega-breweries like Anheuser Busch, Coors, and Miller. The American palate was trained to expect beers with thin body and little flavor. Jumping into the nascent craft brewing industry was an act of courage and faith that the nation's tastebuds would come around. \"When we opened, we were the seventh brewery in Michigan,\" Rene told me. She estimated that there are now over 250, but she confessed that she can't keep track of them all. The Michigan Brewers Guild lists 207 member breweries on its website. As someone who has followed the industry for over 20 years, I remember noticing when we hit 50, then 70, and then 100, and then one day realizing that breweries were opening too quickly for me to keep up. As I write, there are at least eight in Ann Arbor, with another under construction on the west side. Ypsilanti has two, as do Saline and Chelsea, and Dexter has one. The American beer industry has never had so many breweries producing such a wide variety of brews, and Michigan is a leading craft beer state. The Michigan Brewers Guild estimates that Michiganders are never more than an hour from a brewery and that the total economic impact of the industry is well over half a billion dollars. Yet despite their statewide and even national impact, brewpubs and brewery tasting rooms and restaurants are decidedly local places, places where communities gather to celebrate, relax, debate, and play. Rene Greff said that she and Matt just wanted to \"open a little place where people could get a beer and some food and we could talk with them across the bar.\" As large and varied a business as Arbor Brewing has become (in 2013, ABC opened a brewpub in Bangalore, India), the Ann Arbor brewpub and Ypsilanti microbrewery are still places where casual chats across the bar happen all the time. The idea of a \"little place\" for people to gather, a community place, is the thread that connects the breweries across the Ann Arbor area. Ann Arbor's newest brewery, Glasshouse Brewing, opened this summer. Head of Operations Cole Bednarski noted that people work hard day in and day out, and a brewery is a \"conversation space\" where they have an opportunity to just enjoy themselves. Similarly, Jerry and Heidi Tubbs opened Stony Lake Brewing in Saline in November, 2015, to give the town the sort of social gathering spot it had previously lacked. They've decided not to have TVs despite some pressure to do so. Jerry said, \"For every person who bugged us to add television, there were two that whispered in our ears 'don't ever get televisions.'\" Without televisions blaring, there's room for conversation, and Jerry pointed out that on Friday and Saturday nights, Stony Lake is packed with people talking and playing board games. Jerry credits Arbor Brewing's microbrewery in Ypsilanti for inspiration, noting that he and his wife could sit there either inside or in the beer garden and just enjoy conversation and meet new people. \"It brings people together,\" he said. Also in Saline, the owners of Salt Springs Brewery carefully converted a historic former church into a brewery-restaurant. Original stained glass filters sunlight into the large dining room, where the ceiling features a huge painting of a deific hand pointing to a cluster of hops. Like Stony Lake, Salt Springs has sought to give Saline something the town didn't have. \"Our instincts told us that in this building, in this setting, in this town, with the right menu and making really good beer, people would embrace it and it would be something for Saline to be proud of,\" said co-owner Ron Schofield. He added that lots of nearby towns have breweries, and before Salt Springs and Stony Lake opened, Saline \"had a demographic that wasn't being served.\" Opening on the southeastern edge of brewery-rich Ann Arbor, Jason and Tori Tomalia looked to create and occupy a unique niche when they opened Pointless Brewery and Theatre. The couple shares a theater background, and they believed that theater and craft beer make a good combination. Pointless has an in-house improv company, the League of Pointless Improvisers, which Jason directs, and even offers Saturday morning children's theater programs run by Tori since the tasting room isn't open in the morning. The couple shares a passion for providing performance space for the community. Jason noted that some people come mainly for the shows, others for the craft beer, and there's a lot of cross-pollination as craft beer aficionados fall in love with the theater offerings and theater fans discover craft beer. The combination is made manifest in an improv show called Test Batch; local improvisers get some stage time, and the audience also submits suggestions for new beer flavors and styles. Jason told me that he is especially proud to have created a community space for collaboration, laughter, and play. Other local breweries fill niches that are more particular to beer. Wolverine State Brewing Company on Ann Arbor's westside specializes in lager brewing as opposed to ales. Brewed at cooler temperatures and requiring a long period of cold storage, called \"lagering,\" lagers are known for clean, crisp finishes. Wolverine set out to show that lagers aren't limited to the light, yellow versions from the mega-breweries, and the taproom features a wide array of beers, from stout-like dark beers to a top example of India pale lager that has spurred other breweries to create similar offerings. Wolverine also offers a food menu, including pulled pork smoked in-house.Dexter's Jolly Pumpkin, which has a restaurant in Ann Arbor, occupies a completely different category, specializing in the beers native to Franco-Belgian farm regions. The idea of a \"little place\" for people to gather, a community place, is the thread that connects the breweries across the Ann Arbor area. Ypsilanti Ann ArborSaline PHOTO BY TYLER BRUBAKERThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 43 Barrel aged and carefully blended batch by batch, these farm ales can be sour, funky, and fruity, with complex wine- and cider-like flavor profiles. A forerunner of the barrel aging craze that has swept craft brewing, Jolly Pumpkin has achieved international renown with its beers. Rounding out the brewpub scene in Ann Arbor are Grizzly Peak and the Blue Tractor, both on Washington Street. \"The Grizz\" offers a broad food menu and a wide array of well-crafted beers. The Blue Tractor features barbecue fare and a beer selection that has blossomed over the years. Finally, Biercamp on South State Street combines a market and lunch counter featuring house-smoked and cured meats with a small brewery, with beers available for on-premise consumption or to-go. As more and more breweries have opened, competition has increased. Rene Greff described a huge amount of industry growth in the 1990s, followed by a contraction in the early 2000s. At the time, she thought she had seen the \"industry's growth spurt, and from there on out, it was just going to be sort of steady, maybe a little bit of growth.\" But the industry was by no means done. \"I don't think anybody saw the second wave coming. In the late 2000s, we went into another huge expansion that has been much bigger, much more explosive, than the first expansion.\" Nevertheless, she said, \"We may be seeing [a contraction] happening again.\" Asked why, she replied, \"This movement, more than many other market growth movements, is about authenticity, and customers can spot it in a second. So if you open a place and you don't have a passion for beer and you just see it as a profit center, people are going to sniff you out as a fraud.\" She thinks that's happening now as venture capitalists buy up breweries merely because they see them as opportunities for big profits. In addition, with the proliferation of craft breweries and the fact that craft beer is much more mainstream than it once was, consumers have become more discerning. It's no longer good enough to be the local place serving mediocre beer. Now breweries need to make consistently good beer to survive. Those that don't, or that market themselves as \"craft\" yet make beer with additives more common to the mega-breweries, risk not only closing but also damaging the industry as a whole. As Rene put it, \"We've worked really hard to build consumer confidence in craft beer so that a consumer can go into a store and grab a six-pack of a beer they've never had and have the confidence that it's going to be good.\" The danger of turning off consumers and scaring away newcomers is a significant challenge faced by the industry. I asked Rene how much room is left for further growth in craft brewing in Michigan. She said, \"I think we're going to continue to see tons of growth in local brewpubs, nanobreweries, and local microbreweries. We're going to see contraction \u2014 and are already starting to see it \u2014 in bigger breweries, especially the breweries that need national distribution. We're starting to see a tremendous amount of consolidation in the industry, with big breweries buying smaller breweries and trying to expand their footprint.\" Overall, she predicts continued volume growth but fewer players in the larger market, but small, local breweries making great beer should continue to multiply and thrive. After I moved to Ann Arbor in the fall of 1994 as a craft beer-loving graduate student, I was thrilled to learn that two new brewpubs were opening on Washington Street. I remember watching their construction impatiently. In July, 1995, Arbor Brewing Company opened, followed about a month later by Grizzly Peak just down the street. I never would have predicted that within the next two decades, Michigan would become a major player in craft brewing, and Ann Arbor and its surroundings would have over a dozen breweries. Each shares the desire to provide a space for the community to gather, relax, and celebrate, even as each fills a slightly different niche. As Cole Bednarski of Glasshouse Brewing told me, \"Keep your eyes open, because this place is always going to be changing.\" She was describing the desire to produce experimental beers at Glasshouse, but she also could have been describing our dynamic craft beer scene.WHERE TO TRY A PINT...

I found my host, farmer Kris Hanna, wrenching a piece of equipment when I pulled into the driveway by her charming yet modest farmhouse. I noticed she had little by way of \"garden or landscaping,\" which she later explained is not her area of expertise. Her son did a fine job of perennial plantings in the area surrounding her homes' entrance as a Mother's Day gift. The iconic Midwest red barn with silo stands proud among several smaller barns and paddocks, dappled by a background of rolling green fields. These fields lead way into wooded trails where lazy cows spend sunny days in the shade. As we meandered down a hill that snakes between the smaller structures and a chicken grazing yard I could see free-range hogs mudding themselves. Hanna pointed out a patch of kale, radish, and other verdant delectables she lovingly planted for the fowl. I was struck by a calming sense of place from a gentler time of years gone by. There were no cars on the secluded dirt road, and all I could hear was the wind in the trees, the muted sounds of the animals, and soft music echoing from a barn. I came to her farm for an interview because I wanted to know firsthand her philosophies in raising grass-fed animals for meat and what life is really like for a small scale sustainable livestock farmer. I wondered if she spent winters hibernating, reading livestock catalogs, recuperating from fall's harvest, and planning for the year ahead. I was also curious if she had help or collaboration in managing the rigors of farm life. I soon realized just how busy she is on a daily basis all seasons long. Just in the one day I visited in August, Hanna witnessed a calf being born before she engaged in the morning chores, moved animals ...what life is really like for a small scale sustainable livestock farmer. By Angela Madaras | Photography by Fresh Coast Photography The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 46 around pastures, checked the fences, engaged in office work, errands, and picked up vegetable scraps from Hand Sown Farm near Manchester. Here in the late afternoon we talked as we fed the organic vegetable \"scraps\" out of eight large plastic bins to exceptionally healthy-calm hogs; a \"swine salad bar\" of sorts. This is one of many ways in which she collaborates with other neighbors and farmers like Hand Sown Farm, and The Gardner Farm where she pastures some of her cows. The extra effort that goes into community collaboration is quite time consuming. I could see that it is a true passion for her, well worth it in the long run. Not only do the animals benefit, the entire community reaps rewards in the end. In this way, one landowner can lease acres to grow hay or pasture cows, while yet another vegetable farmer reduces the amount of compostable matter on their scrap pile in order to feed her happy hogs. It is also about building sustainable relationships and healthy farming practices that benefit future generations. I, for one, because I have grandchildren who will inherit the earth, appreciate the added value and positives this endeavor produces. Hanna clarified that her philosophy ensures that all the animals she cares for are free-range, pastured, never subjected to a feed lot or fed corn, are GMO-free, with no growth hormones or animal by-products. They also do not use steroids or feed antibiotics. Old Pine sells their meat frozen, on their website exclusively; pork by the half and whole, beef by the eighth, quarter, half and whole, chicken only in variety packs with beef and pork, and lamb by the half and whole when available. Her products sell pretty fast because of happy regular customers who pre-order in advance of processing to ensure all meat harvested is sold. Because of this conservation-minded and compassionate approach there is no waste or glut. This seems a much more responsible and respectful way to engage in farming practices. In addition, the livestock are humanely treated throughout the animal's life. I witnessed her benevolent behavior with my own eyes and through her eloquent words: Everyone's definition of \"humane\" is a bit different. In my case, I believe animals should be on pasture and in open space whenever possible. I've also learned over the years that working around the animals in an even-tempered manner is really helpful. I think it makes for a better, calmer life for them and a better product for us. I've seen pigs rotated on pastures that roll over for a belly scratch. I \"talk\" to my cows and sometimes scratch their backs! When I'm working in the barn I play music. It makes the animals much easier to work with. Stress hormones and meat are not a good combination. Stress on every level is not good for the animals nor the flavor, consistency, and color of meat as noted here by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations: \"The energy required for muscle activity in the live animal is obtained from sugars (glycogen) in the muscle. In the healthy and well-rested animal, the glycogen content of the muscle is high. After the animal has been slaughtered, the glycogen in the muscle is converted into lactic acid, and the muscle and carcass becomes firm (rigor mortis). This lactic acid is necessary to produce meat, which is tasteful and tender, of good keeping quality and good color. If the animal is stressed before and during slaughter, the glycogen is used up, and the lactic acid level that develops in the meat after slaughter is reduced. This will have serious adverse effects on meat quality.\" The end result of her efforts, respect for the animals, stewardship of the land, and endless labor is that customers enjoy very tasty-healthy fare! And there is little to no \"down time\" for a nonstop livestock farmer as Kris Hanna explains in the following interview, for which I am very grateful. So Kris, do you spend time studying or researching farming and related fields? In other words, how much time do you allocate to education, new research, and agriculture news as part of your \"farm work\"? I do spend time studying. The timing varies. I participate in MSU grass-fed beef programs and pasture walks around the state whenever they are available and the timing works (maybe four or five a year). I'm a member of the Mid Michigan Cattle Association and another Grazing Group. I also subscribe to a magazine called Graze. Through MSU extension, I receive information via email regularly and a daily email Ag News Report. I was also lucky enough to attend a national grazing conference last fall put on by the Grass-fed Exchange. How much time do you spend on marketing, promotion, sales, emails, office, and so on? One to two hours a day on average. I can work in this area as much as four to five hours in a day. It is a big part of my job. A few years ago I remember you and one of your sons attending, as local delegates, Slow Food International Terra Madre bi-annual event in Turin, Italy. [To give a bit of background, this event assembles thousands of \"slow food\" producers who observe fair and sustainable food practices from around the world. Together, farmers, fishermen, chefs, educators, millers, beekeepers, vintners, bread bakers, and cheese purveyors are selected to participate based on their commitment and practice of upholding Slow Food principles in creating a \"good, clean and fair\" food system. In 2010, Kris and her son, Casey Hirth, were joined by Brandon Johns of Grange Kitchen and Bar, John Savanna of Mill Pond Bread, and Deirdra Stockmann, and Kim Bayer, both leaders of Slow Food Huron Valley, to represent the Ann Arbor area. Slow Food Huron Valley is a nonprofit that works to strengthen our region's food system, build community food security, and preserve our culinary heritage. They aim to inspire a transformation in food policy, production practices and market forces so that they ensure equity, sustainability and pleasure in the food we eat.] Were your sons' active in farming and food as youth? Both sons were involved in 4-H and showed steers, hogs, dairy cows, goats, and chickens. The last time they showed was around 2009. Casey (Hirth) was sent to Turin as a young farmer delegate by Slow Food Huron Valley. I was also one of the farmer delegates from our area who attended. Josh (Hirth) cuts and transports the hay from our field in Saline, where my parents have owned acres of land on which they grow hay. They both appreciate quality food and one of them works in the cooking industry. Do you see the value in youth participating in organizations such as 4-H, and how did that shape your children? Were your parents active in this way? Do you have any words of wisdom to share in a world where kids may not have a sense of responsibility or understand hard work ethics? 4-H helped develop an immeasurable sense of responsibility and work ethic in both kids. That work ethic is still evident today in both of them. The first year they showed Not only do the animals benefit, the entire community reaps rewards in the end. This seems a much more responsible and respectful way to engage in farming practices. These fields lead way into wooded trails where lazy cows spend sunny days in the shade. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 47 animals in the club I had friends and family commenting on the change in them. My dad loved farming and I believe there is a \"genetic\" love of farming that was passed on to me that can't be denied! Neither parent was involved in 4-H as a child but my parents helped my kids with their 4-H projects and provided the barn and property for them to be raised. Is farming a way of life for you or a passion? It's both. It has to be. It is not a great way to make a living as expenses meet income. I'm doing what I love and I am very grateful to be able to do it. It takes a lot of determination to keep going (hours are long, work is sometimes tough) and that's because I have a deep passion for the animals I raise and take care of. You mentioned that you are not a gardener. Many people make assumptions that every farmer can grow crops, tend gardens, and care for animals. What are your favorite and least favorite tasks? I could possibly divide most farmers I meet into three groups. Like other professions there are \"areas of expertise\": vegetable farmers, crop farmers, or livestock farmers. One of my favorite things to do is work with the cattle. I love to \"call\" and move them. When they are done eating a section of grass and need to go to a new area I call them. Heads pick up, moo's start, and here they come \u2014 headed to the new grass I'm standing in and calling them towards! My least favorite task is anything when it's 90 degrees or above or below zero! I work out in the weather every day. One task might be running and draining hoses when it's below zero because a hydrant has frozen. Can you offer more insight into your relationship with other area farmers? For example, the day I visited your farm you and I fed your pigs with vegetable scraps that were given to you by a local vegetable farm. Can you provide more on this subject? How important are relationships and community to you and your business? I may not be in business without the farmers I network with. Hand Sown Farm and I have a great working relationship. We've shared farm workers, composted manure, and vegetable scraps! I've rented pasture from several other farmers and couldn't have grass-fed without it. One of them has 30 legume-rich paddocks/pastures and, in my opinion, is essential to producing a good grass-fed beef product. I also purchase hay from another farmer to supplement what we produce. How does being a full-time \"Four Season Farmer\" affect your social life, vacations, down-time, and other activities outside of the farm? I'm fortunate enough to have a farm helper this year that is very reliable and helpful. Thanks to Richard R. From Manchester for helping me on the farm and allowing me much needed time away. I could not do it without his help. I also appreciate my sister, Kendra McClure, for helping in the busy seasons. There are times of the year that I absolutely can't leave, like in the spring when baby calves and lambs are being born, ( and fall when it is harvest time). I do work seven days a week, but with some planning I can take some time off. I know from personal experience a farmer must also know construction, welding, mechanics, and a plethora of other skills. What skills have owning your own farm taught you that seem unrelated to farm chores? I've definitely developed skills in all of those areas (maybe not so much welding). I also have learned to operate equipment, such as a skid steer, and different types of hay making equipment. Last year I bought a \"sawzall\" to cut some metal bars off a hay feeder! I don't know if this is a \"skill,\" but one of the biggest things farming has taught me is confidence. Who is your favorite writer of farm related subjects? Probably Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms, Northern Virginia. I also really appreciate the unpublished work of Gabe Brown in the area of polycultures. He is out of the Dakotas. Who and what inspired you to start your own farm?My dad, who passed away last year, inspired the farmer in me. Farming was his passion. That being said, my mom has always been passionate about healthy food. Between the two of them, and my love for animals, I believe becoming a grass-based farmer was a natural choice! 4-H helped develop an immeasurable sense of responsibility and work ethic in both kids. It is not a great way to make a living as expenses meet income. I'm doing what I love and I am very grateful to be able to do it.

Continued on page 48I grew up in Ann Arbor and attended Ann Arbor Public Schools, but my family/ grandparents owned a farm in northwest Ohio (where I was born and then moved to Ann Arbor at about the age of four). We went there regularly while I was growing up; my dad loved the field/crop work and being outdoors working on the tractor. Visiting the farm was by far the most memorable and favorite part of my childhood. Eventually, my grandparents passed away, and the farm was visited much less often. It was sold in the late 90's and my parents purchased about fifty acres near Saline. A place we've raised both livestock and hay. When in high school I considered becoming both a livestock veterinarian as well as going into agriculture. I was discouraged from going into agriculture for \"financial\" reasons. I went to Eastern Michigan University and received a B.S. and University of Detroit where I received a M.S. (Neither degree is in Agriculture). I worked full-time in an unrelated field for about nineteen years. When I was nineteen I moved out of Ann Arbor into the country and knew I would never live in the city again. Do your customers notice a difference in your meat products compared to store bought and to other local farms? Is your meat better for humans than CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operations) grown livestock? Why do you feel yours is better? Absolutely...I hear that often! There is no comparison to grocery store meat \u2014 it's not raised the same or processed the same. It's really a totally different product. Ground beef in this country comes from multiple cows and multiple countries, combined into one package. Our meat comes from one cow only, processed one animal at a time. Our beef is 100 percent grass-fed and raised. There are so many definitions of \"grass-fed.\" Many give grain at some point in the cow's life. Some grass-fed markets are now raising cows in feedlots on all hay as well. True grass-fed beef is high in omegas. You won't find any beef higher in omegas than ours as all we're feeding is rich grass and great legumes! What breeds do you prefer to rear? I know you have some recognized by the American Livestock Breed Conservancy, as part of an effort to reintroduce endangered breeds into the marketplace and protect the genetic diversity of these animals. We value genetic diversity and raise a variety of animal breeds recognized by the American Livestock Breed Conservancy and the Slow Food Ark of Taste that are adapted to our region. Some these include the Highlander Cattle, Berkshire and China-Poland Hogs, and Ketahdin Sheep. Explain what and how you feed your livestock in basic, simple terms anyone can understand. Beef: All grass and hay. Pork: Outside and fed a combination of G.M.O.-free grain. They were just turned into a turnip patch to eat and root. Chickens: Raised outside, free range, fed G.M.O.-free grain, grass, and scrap veggies. Lambs: Grass/hay only. Do you work solely on the farm or do you depend on work outside of the farm to earn a living? I have been farming at Old Pine for ten years while working part-time at a family engineering firm doing custodial work to help bring in extra income. I am 58 and hope to continue farming for as long as I am physically able and income meets expenses! This is a common challenge small organic farms face. I would like to share the Salon essay \"What nobody told me about small farming: I can't make a living\" by Jaclyn Moyer, which I think is the best I have ever read on trying to earn a living off a self-started farm.

There, he and his family of five generations of farmers, including a sister, Terra, have bucked the traditional agribusiness conventional wisdom by farming in a way that's sensible, sustainable, and focused on producing healthy, nutritious food in ways that don't despoil the land. Terra Brockman tells the story of her family and their life on the farm in the form of a year-long memoir (with recipes) that takes readers through each season of life on the farm. Studded with vignettes, digressions, photographs, family stories, and illustrations of the farm's vivid plant life, the book is a one-of-a-kind treasure that will appeal to readers of Michael Pollan, E. B. White, Gretel Ehrlich, and Sandra farmer is sixty years old. When young people can't get in, old people can't get out. Approaching a watershed moment, our culture desperately needs a generational transfer of millions of farm acres facing abandonment, development, or amalgamation into ever-larger holdings. Based on his decades of experience with interns and multigenerational partnerships at Polyface Farm, farmer and author Joel Salatin digs deep into the problems and solutions surrounding this land- and knowledge-transfer crisis. This book empowers aspiring young farmers, midlife farmers, and non-farming landlords to build regenerative, profitable agricultural enterprises. The Soil Will Save Us: How Scientists, Farmers, and Foodies Are Healing the Soil to Save the Planet By Krisin Ohlson Rodale Books Our Price: $21.59 Thousands of years of poor farming and ranching practices and, especially, modern industrial agriculture have led to the loss of up to 80 percent of carbon from the world's soils. That carbon is now floating in the atmosphere, and even if we stopped using fossil fuels today, it would continue warming the planet. In The Soil Will Save Us, journalist and bestselling author Kristin Ohlson makes an elegantly argued, passionate case for \"our great green hope, \" a way in which we can not only heal the land but also turn atmospheric carbon into beneficial soil carbon and potentially reverse global warming. Ohlson introduces the visionaries scientists, farmers, ranchers, and landscapers who are figuring out in the lab and on the ground how to build healthy soil, which solves myriad problems: drought, erosion, air and water pollution, and food quality, as well as climate change. Her discoveries and vivid storytelling will revolutionize the way we think about our food, our landscapes, our plants, and our relationship to Earth.

Barn icon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.comThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 49 Raising Backyard Chickens: What to Consider Before Collecting Those Wonderful EggsThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 50 A chicken ordinance was passed in Ann Arbor in 2008, allowing residents to keep up to four hens in their backyards for the first time. Happily, residents of Ann Arbor began building coops and transforming their backyards into a haven for their chickens. The popularity of backyard chickens has continued to grow. As of December 2016, 22 permits for backyard chickens had been issued, already rising above the 14 that were issued in 2015. Early in 2015, the number of chickens allowed went from four to six, delighting those who already had them and instilling curiosity in many who have never had chickens. But it's not as easy as picking up fresh eggs every morning. There's work involved before and after reaping that benefit, such as planning before the chickens arrive and figuring out what to do with them once they've stopped laying. If there's one thing that everyone who has chickens can agree on, it's that it's worth the small amount of work for the quality of the eggs, the amount of which can vary anywhere from a couple dozen a week to only a handful, depending on the ages of the chickens, time of year, and, of course, how many chickens you have. What to know before you start: You will become emotionally attached to your chickens \u2014 if you let yourself. \"In the city, when you get chickens, generally they become your pets,\" said Judy Stone of Ann Arbor, who has been keeping chickens for seven years. According to Stone, the eggs are without a doubt the best part of keeping chickens, but when they stop laying after a few years, they start costing more than it's worth to some. At that point, it becomes difficult for many to picture their dear chickens in a soup pot. Stone spoke from first-hand experience. Her first chickens became her pets, and a few of them are still with her seven years later. The next step is to think about the amount of work and money that it takes to get started. Eileen Dickinson, another Ann Arbor resident, has had chickens for years, and spends about $27 a month on the upkeep of her six chickens. This covers food and maintenance of the coop. Judy Stone pays about the same price, coming in at around $30 per six chickens each month. Surprisingly, the amount of work that it takes to keep chickens is not extensive, and is easily managed. To collect eggs, feed the chickens, and clean the coop takes only a few minutes each day, plus a few hours a year to thoroughly clean your coop. \"I don't consider it a lot of a work,\" said Dickinson. \"I feel like it's just part of my life.\" Dickinson also suggests going into the process with an understanding of what it's like having chickens. \"I think it's really helpful when talking to neighbors to have an understanding. Some talking points might include that they aren't noisy, they aren't smelly, and they don't attract rats.\" Dickinson said that her neighbors enjoy it, and having some advance information to navigate getting neighbor permission is important. Getting your neighbors' signed permission is part of acquiring the permit that you need to By Chelsea Hohn As of December 2016, 22 permits for backyard chickens had been issued, already rising above the 14 that were issued in 2015. \"...it's not as easy as picking up fresh eggs every morning... [but] it's worth the small amount of work for the quality of eggs.\" Buff Orpington The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 51 keep chickens. (In order to apply for the permit go to a2gov.org and search \"backyard chicken permit.\" The steps are relatively simple.) Where to get started: The Coop Once you have your permit and a clear decision to start raising chickens, the first step is to build a home for them. Chicken coops can vary from an elaborate chicken manor to a simple four walls, but there are certain requirements for each. There's an entire industry built around coops that you can buy online, and stores like Home Depot have pre-made chicken coops, but there are several thoughts that should go into building your own. The first is space. Stone recommends two square feet per chicken, and if you start with fewer than six, possibly allowing room for growth. It's also important to remember that chickens aren't the only ones that will be in the coop. Allow room for yourself to get in and collect eggs and clean the coop. \"It needs to be easily cleanable,\" said Stone. \"If it's burdensome to clean it then you won't.\" Dickinson also pointed out that it needs to provide a roosting area for the chickens or a nest box. There also should be a spot for food so that it doesn't get wet, the usual culprit behind the stereotype that keeping chickens is a smelly business. When food and flooring gets wet it can ferment. Some suggestions for flooring include pine shavings or straw. Another important aspect is making sure that the coop is predator-proof. The most common predators in Ann Arbor are hawks, stray dogs, raccoons, possums, and even coyotes or foxes. It's important to make sure that if the chickens are in the coop, they are safe from predators that might come from above or from the ground. Having something in the ground around the coop prevents animals from digging into the chickens' space, as well. Keep in mind also that the chickens will be spending a fair amount of time inside of the coop, during the winter months especially. It's important to make sure that it stays fairly warm inside and that their water doesn't freeze. Breeds and raising: There are over 50 different types of chickens. Certain breeds are better for egg production, some are better with being handled, some are more winter-hearty, the list goes on. Think about what's important to you, how you will be treating and handling them, and do some research on which breeds seem to fit your purpose of having chickens. Buff Orpingtons are popular, and Dickinson and Stone both have experience with this breed. Dickinson says they are like the golden retriever of chickens, because of their pleasant demeanor. Stone also has Australorps and Araucanas, which lay different colored eggs and are wonderfully nicknamed \"Easter eggers.\" There is also the option of raising them from chicks, which has many rewards and a few risks. Attempts are made to sex chicks at birth, but unless the breed indicates the sex by the color of the feathers, chances are you're going to get a rooster, and then you're going to have to figure out what to do with it. Many farms will take roosters, and it will most likely end up in a soup pot. If you're lucky, you can trade for a hen. Raising day old chicks, despite the rooster risk, is a good idea, according to Dickinson. \"I would definitely recommend starting with day old chicks. They're really cute. It's good to handle them, and then they get used to being handled,\" she said. Integrating them into the coop should be a gradual process though, slowly introducing them to less heat and more space.Once you decide which chickens to get, deciding how many is the next step. Chickens are social creatures, and the most common suggestion is to start with four. Stone and Dickinson both said that more chickens doesn't necessarily make for a significant amount of more work, only more feces to clean up and providing slightly more food. Once you've dived in: Plan for the future. Chickens will produce eggs for about two to three years with egg production lessening over time. Once your chickens stop producing, it's important to know what you're going to do with them. It's also important to have a plan in place in case a chicken gets sick. This is where the pet/livestock line gets drawn, again. A visit to the vet can mean keeping chickens is an expensive game, and having a plan before something happens is a good idea. Keeping the coop clean is an important part not only for your chickens' health, but for your neighbors' and your own happiness. Cleaning the coop keeps it from smelling and keeps your chickens happy in a clean environment. Food is another part of upkeep, and making the decision to feed your chickens organic feed affects whether or not you're getting truly organic eggs. You can also supplement chicken scratch with scraps of compost from your kitchen, which can mean buying less food and provide other nutrients for your chickens. Keep in mind that laying hens need extra calcium, and this can be found from crushed oyster shells or limestone grit that the chickens can pick at. Why it's worth it: It can seem daunting. The coop, the feed, raising from chicks, the cleaning, and the planning. But it's worth it. \"It's part of the cycle of my garden,\" said Dickinson. \"They're an integral part of my garden.\" For her, keeping chickens isn't a lot of work, and not only does she enjoy keeping chickens for the eggs, they're entertaining to watch, her neighborhood kids enjoy them, and it's satisfying. She enjoys knowing where her food comes from, and it's hard to beat when that place is your own backyard. Stone enjoys them for similar reasons. \"It adds to my life to have them around,\" she said. \"Listening to the sounds they make, or seeing how happy they get from compost. I get a lot of pleasure out of that.\" It also is an integral part of her urban farm. By keeping chickens, she is able to work with the whole life cycle. \"It's really important to me that I work to keep the soil healthy because it keeps the food I grow healthy and regenerates our climate,\" she explains. \"I consider it a complete cycle.\" But above all, the thing that everyone who keeps chickens raves about the most is how absolutely wonderful the quality of the eggs are. And for most, that's enough. ### 21-da y Sugar De tox Starts Februar y 6th, 201 7 KARRIE REA, BS, MA, NTP , CGP Barred Rocks and Buff OrpingtonsSurprisingly, the amount of work that it takes to keep chickens is not extensive, and is easily managed.

While I desire to eat organic, whole, and clean foods, I tend to seek out restaurants where I can either have breakfast, lunch, or \"happy hour\" for around ten dollars. Because of this dilemma, I eat out less and prepare more meals from food we have raised and grown ourselves. But when I do want to dine out, I now understand my grandparent's penchant for the \"Early Bird Special.\" The greater Ann Arbor region is home to a plethora of choices from which to pluck a savory meal thanks in large part to the University of Michigan and Eastern Michigan University's hungry student population. Chelsea, on the other hand, possesses a large retiree population mixed with young families, and thusly caters to those demographics. Downtown Ann Arbor is home to more \"high-end\" eateries intermingled with college joints. Ypsilanti boasts affordable, ethnic, and funky eateries, and bars. I challenged myself to find and write about some of the spots in our area where I can eat well while sticking to a tight budget. To up the ante, I further decided to sample from a few higher end restaurants to see if I could stay on task monetarily while splurging a bit in the gastronomic department. In this first installment of my thrifty explorations, I want to share with you my go-to spots for uncompromising American fare. THE COMMON GRILL , Chelsea's anchor restaurant, which opened in 1990 by owner and executive chef Craig Common, is one of my much loved winter spots for lunch. The large windows fill the space with natural light. They primarily serve up beautiful seafood flown in regularly, salads, fresh baked yeast rolls, pasta, and inspired American cuisine. My favorite budget lunch at The Common Grill is a bowl of savory tomato-based chowder with huge chunks of shrimp, scallops, and fish. It comes with two yeast rolls and butter; all for only five dollars. It was filling and comforting on the cold Michigan winter day when I last dined here. When I go alone I sit at their open bar and watch the kitchen pump out food. I do love the buzz of a well-greased kitchen. They also sell their uncooked pasta (including gluten-free options), house-made sauces, and hot rolls for folks who want to prepare a chef-inspired meal in the comfort of their own kitchen. MORGAN AND YORK is heaven for a Midwesterner like me. With their wide selection of cured meats, olives, cheese, and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, my cravings can always be satiated. However, on one particular cold and rainy day I arrived wanting a whole sandwich and hot nurturing soup. Sadly, I was a wee bit early, or they a little late getting the soup ready for the lunch crowd. No worries for me, as I asked if I could make up my own sandwich and the answer was \"yes, of course.\"(I later found out this is actually an item on their menu). I pursued this by purchasing a hunk of baguette, sliced and toasted, with a one inch slice of braunshweiger (a type of liverwurst), a smear of Dijon mustard, and a thin slice of red onion. It was just like my grandmother used to make. With this, I ordered a cup of hot herbal tea to wash it down. I spent ten dollars, with a dash added to the tip jar. Morgan and York is a gourmet specialty food and wine shop with ample amounts of seating to dine in. They even have old-fashioned candies by the pound. Additionally, they serve breakfast and lunch during limited hours with expected standard items such as bagels, pastries, soups, salads, and their signature sandwiches, called bocatas, which are traditional Spanish-style sandwiches on locally baked, crusty organic bread with all sorts of creative fillings. It may be high-end gourmet, but you can dine here on any budget and be well-fed.MONAHAN'S SEAFOOD MARKET is a local treasure and fairly famous in the food biz. Anthony Bourdain visited in 2010, promoting the release of his book, Medium Raw: a bloody valentine to the world of food and the people who cook. This is where I buy seafood because I trust their sources and it is completely fresh. You order at their counter and tell them where you'll be sitting. It usually takes ten to fifteen minutes for lunch to be made per order. You can order any fish out of the counter at market price to be prepared as desired with a choice of their signature sauces, rice, and vegetable of the day. Or they also offer sandwiches, daily specials, a raw bar, and chowder. On this one particular day, my lunch was their daily special: Salmon Sandwich with slaw on the side. It was very tasty and filling with just enough pizzazz in the patty. Lining the table area is an extremely wide variety of condiments from which to choose. I could have added sides or soup but the amount was perfect. Had I more space, I likely would have gone with either their hand-cut fries or the saut\u00e9ed lemon-garlic spinach. A final thought in a setting like Monahan's - always tip the counter help; they bring your food and serve you water, plus they are some of nicest people you will meet. THE LUNCH ROOM RESTAURANT AND BAR is pleasantly located in a ground level corner space within Kerrytown Shops, in downtown Ann Arbor. They have a second smaller location near U-M North Campus, featuring a bakery and caf\u00e9, but the downtown locale is convenient to parking and lovely on a warm day. The seating extends to the garden atrium where one can sit in the shade of trees with little road noise. I have ordered several items from their all-vegan menu, but the one I feel most drawn to in the moment is the Powerup Bowl for an even ten dollars. It is full of fresh vegetables like kale, carrots, red peppers, avocado, rice, walnuts, and tofu. It is served with a sweet and savory maple Dijon sauce and they have other condiments such as Clancy's Fancy Hot Sauce and Sriracha. The Lunch Room's non-dairy and non meat menu items are made fresh with local ingredients that, when possible, are also organic. You can leave knowing you ate a very clean, healthy, protein-filled meal at budget. And if you still have space left, it's worth noting they also bake all sorts of goodies, including gluten-free options.

THE LAST WORD BAR is kind of a speakeasy, essentially located in the basement of LIVE Nightclub but with its own entrance. There are no signs on the darkly lit side door off W. Huron Street, just west of First Street. They open at 5 p.m. sharp. The ambiance is seductive and reminds me of an old hunting lodge. Lighting is low and they have plenty of seating in booths, at tables, or around the bar. My table of four sat in a good-sized booth with a lot of privacy, and romantic candles dotting the table. The space smelled intoxicating too \u2014 in an earthy kind of way, with high notes of cypress and juniper. I later learned they infuse their cocktails with smoke and other essences or aromas of the natural world. I was invited by a couple of family friends with my father as my date. Our friend paid the tab like a sly fox, but I stayed on my budget mission none-the-less. Well, I am slightly telling the truth....I did go over because I had a happy hour cocktail. The small plate menu on offer consisted of snacks and small prepared dishes. The combinations were provocative, slightly trendy, and mostly locally sourced. My pick was their Game Pot Pie, made of local rabbit, veggies, and cream sauce, all in a housemade tart with microgreens for exactly ten sheckles. It was yummy and comforting on a day with wind chills below zero. My dad opted for pork tacos, which were very sweet and three per order, so he added one extra so we could each sample. Another friend had Goat Poutine, which came in a large bowl with Sparrow Market goat, gravy, and cheese curds. Our other friend had a snack of Shishito Peppers blistered in truffle salt, sporting a gentle fragrance. All dishes were reasonably priced and brimming with flavor. In this way, they do have the last word. It is impossible to list all my favorite Americana eateries where I can \"bargain dine\" in our area, but this is a sampling of some of my picks. Truly, you can dine almost anywhere for five bucks by simply ordering a cup of soup. In the next issue, I will take you to a selection of more globally inspired eateries. Until then, enjoy! Life is too short to compromise flavor and pleasure. Please note: before visiting these establishments, always check their hours on their website or by phone, as they may change seasonally.

Mikette Bistro and Bar located on Ann Arbor's north side brings a little of this beloved culinary region to southeast Michigan. Mikette's atmosphere is relaxed yet far from quiet as the air is filled with the ani - mated conversations of contented patrons. Though the menu's presentation reflects the simplicity of a children's menu, Mikette is not really a family restaurant (though there is a small children's menu with three items). It is a gathering place for friends to enjoy food, drink, and \u2014 well, maybe not song exactly. The food menu is divided into six sections: oyster and raw bar, cheese, les plats (small plates), soup and salad, les classiques (main dishes), and a three-item kid's menu. You can choose to treat each section as a course or make a meal of oysters, crab, or shrimp cocktails; cheese served with French bread, almonds, and pickled peaches (as it was when I dined); and the wide selection of small plates such as Mo - roccan spiced meatballs, eggplant tagine, ratatouille, and frites (french fries). When I see an assortment of cheeses on a menu, I am certain to order some. My companions and I chose for our spread the Valencay (classic French from goat's milk), Fromage d' Affinois (similar to Brie, but creamier), and Country Wind Farmstead goat cheese. We were all skeptical of the pickled peaches, but they paired so well with the creamy cheeses and french bread that I really liked them. They're sweet, like bread and butter pickles.The Moroccan spiced meatballs were savory and had a courser texture than El Harissa's (CWJ issue 59). They were also not \"spicy\" in the sense of \"hot,\" but packed with spices and herbs. Southern France is known for its herbs and has historically traded with its Mediter - ranean neighbors like Morocco. Speaking of herbs, my steak frites (steak with french fries) was surprisingly herby. Obviously, steak is pre-pared countless ways. It is fitting that Mikette finishes theirs with Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel butter, though I've never had it this way before. It adds quite a punch of flavor! I want to touch on the beverage selection. Yes, the wine, beer, and cocktail lists are very fine, exactly what I'd expect from a French restaurant in Ann Arbor. (I hear good things about their Vie en Rose, and my husband was impressed with their inclusion of the Sidecar.) But for non-drinkers, Mikette also offers some delicious alternatives, such as the Honey and Sage Spritzer \u2014 delightful! \u2014 and citron press\u00e9. They also serve Orangina, which I haven't had in ages. If you're looking for a new place to pass a pleasant evening with friends in a relaxing atmosphere where the wait staff really takes care of you, consider Mik - ette. Et bon app\u00e9tit! Located at 1759 Plymouth Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, Mikette Bar and Bistro is closed on Mondays and open Tuesday through Saturday from 4:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. and Sun - day from 4:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Find them online at mikettea2.com. Located in downtown Saline, Salt Springs Brewery is beautiful. The 116-year-old building was once a church, and obvious care has been taken to preserve the polished blonde wood and vibrantly colored stained glass windows. What was once the place for the choir is now the kitchen, and a dining room has replaced the pews, a bar to one side. Yet a restaurant is not out of place in these surroundings. The tables and chairs are simple and unobtrusive; the seats at the bar, cushioned and with backs, are light brown and comfortable. The beer is made in-house and ingredients for both the food and the beer are sourced locally as much as possible. According to their website, (re-garding the beer): \"Located in farm country, fresh, local ingredients are used when-ever possible. In return, spent grains are sent back to farmers for feed and compost.\" Southern French cuisine is varied and rich with fruits of the land and sea, wine, and herbs.

LOCAL FOODGreatTastes in Column by Crysta Coburn Photography by Rachel Everheart The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 55 CHIVE KITCHENI'm not big on beer, but I do love fresh, local ingredients. \"There isn't even a deep freezer on site!\" proudly proclaimed our amiable server. I also love menu items like poutine, a dish synonymous with Canada. It's a simple construction of french fries topped with cheese curds and brown gravy, and it is catching on rapidly in the States. With just the right amount of salt, the poutine at Salt Springs Brewery is the best I have had since my trip to Quebec. Though I could have made a meal out of the poutine, I shared it with my husband and ordered the Creamy Shrimp Pasta for my dinner, composed of Key West shrimp (so plump!), broccoli, red peppers, garlic, shallots, butter, Parmesan cheese, and a white wine cream sauce. It was a true delight. The pasta was cooked al dente . (Com - ing from an Italian background, I am a stickler for pasta.) I paired it with an Arnold Palmer, another perfect blend, not too sweet or sour. I tried the smallest bite of my husband's Smoked Pulled Pork sandwich (I don't eat pork), and I was surprised by the pronounced smoky flavor. It made me even more curious about the Smoked Chicken Salad sandwich, which had originally caught my eye before I settled on the pasta. I will just have to go back and try it on another visit. Atmosphere and food are wonderful things to have in a restaurant, and I do appreci- ate them immensely. But people can make a difference. I really liked our server! She was friendly, attentive, and ready to answer any question. She clearly had pride in her job and the brewery, and that enthusiasm was inspiring. I had a great time, and I'd like to go back soon! In warmer weather, we can try the biergarten and firepit. Salt Springs Brewery is located at 117 South Ann Arbor St., Saline, MI 48176. Closed on Mondays, they are open Tuesday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Their web - site is saltspringsbrewery.com. When I stepped through the door of Chive Kitchen, an all vegan restaurant in downtown Farmington, Michigan, I smelled food. I don't mean it smelled like a restaurant. A freshness permeated the air unlike I've ever experienced outside of a farmers' market. Per their website, Chive Kitchen \"focus[es] on fresh and local products.\" And my nose confirmed it. The atmosphere is super casual with a youthful vibe. Vintage style light bulbs sin - gularly hang from the ceiling on black wires, and art dots the walls. When I spotted the painting above the front door of a woman writing on parchment with a quill, I decided this place was for me. Unlike other vegan restaurants I've visited, this one has a bar. It is a little known fact that many alcohols are not vegan-friendly due to animal products used in the filtration. Modern crafters have gotten better about this, and many no longer use that technique, so Chive Kitchen's bar is fully stocked and vegan-friendly. They also offer some tasty nonalcoholic drinks, such as the refreshing Cherry Bitty (like a cherry limeade). Many of the dishes are, or can be made gluten-free, though the grill and fryer are not. My favorite of the appetizers happens to be gluten-free: the fried chickpeas with smoked paprika salt. They pop in your mouth! I want to have these at home! Far superior to popcorn for movie night or beer snacks. I almost ordered the mushroom pasta with its smoky cream sauce (our server's favor - ite, she later confessed), but instead, I was persuaded by the bourbon-maple brown butter in the sweet potato rigatoni. Though cooked a little beyond al dente, this was still an enjoyable dish. I loved the sage-sweet potato cream sauce! I can't imagine any - one who didn't already know it was vegan would have guessed that it was. Chive Kitchen's menu is not sparse by any means, and I think it will surprise a lot of non-vegans. Take, for example, the oatmeal cream pie on the dessert menu with its \"buttery oatmeal cookie\" and \"vanilla bean buttercream\" filling. Or the orange cream cupcake with orange-infused buttercream. They have unique items, too, such as the kombucha float made with coconut ice cream (which is creamier than dairy ice cream, for the record). I would have tried one if I hadn't been so full! A meat-eating friend recently declared to me that vegan lentil tacos are the best tacos he has ever eaten \"hands down.\" Chive Kitchen's tacos are made with tofu, but their chili is composed of lentils, mustard cumin aioli, and red onions, which sounds scrumptious to me. I wouldn't have thought to use lentils as a meat substitute in a recipe. My culinary horizon has been expanded. Thanks, Chive Kitchen! Chive Kitchen is located at 33043 Grand River Ave. in Farmington. Closed on Sunday and Monday, they are open Tuesday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Find them online at chivekitchen.com.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 56 For Want of a Nail: How the U-M's Innovative Faculty Scholar Program Could Fade Away, or Continue to Thrive By Kirsten MowreyPhotography by Susan Ayer In 2013, Professor Ana Baylin found herself in a professional crisis. After training as an M.D. in Spain, getting her Ph.D. in Nutrition and Epidemiology, and working at the U-M School of Public Health, she found herself wanting to do... something else. A colleague encouraged her to enroll in the Faculty Scholar Program (FSP), a year-long educational group. The faculty in the program study recent research on integrative medicine, such as meditation, yoga, and chiropractic, as applied to cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic pain, and mental health. By exposing professionals to the benefits of other disciplines outside their own, and building bridges based on science between medicine (disease treatment) and health (vitality and well-being), faculty find themselves creating new methods and solutions to patient problems. The program has been innovative and successful, and a key element in the slow but steady growth in the acceptance of integrative medicine at the University of Michigan. Baylin, for example, met Max Shtein, an engineering professor. Shtein was working on designing UV lamps to affect appetite and obesity. As Baylin looked at the implications of Shtein's lamps, she found herself getting excited. From a public health perspective, the lamps offered an intervention to change local metabolism, affect appetite, and decrease risk of obesity, particularly for healthy people who worked night shifts, irregular hours, and in a cubicle. During the year-long program, Baylin and Shtein began collaborating on an experiment involving the lamps, with Shtein providing the technical side and Baylin providing the public health aspect. They have applied for grants to do experiments, collect data, and research if this could be an effective intervention for obesity. Baylin said \"[This was] the best thing. I was in the middle of a professional crisis. [Then] I met Max, and now I'm in a project I love. It opened me to a different way of thinking.\" This class not only resolved Baylin's professional difficulties, it led her to new innovations that may address a current public health challenge, as well as offer new technologies for health. All that from the work of two scholars in one year. And the FSP has been running for 15 years. What other amazing doors have been opened, interventions and innovations created? What else is possible? And it's also possible that this very worthwhile program might slowly disappear, underfunded, dismissed, and lost in the University's Medical School. The Faculty Scholar Program is the creation of Rita Benn, Ph.D., and Dr. Sara Warber M.D., with others collaborating. Benn is a curly haired, bright eyed woman, who cocks her head to the side as she listens to your questions. Her home office is stuffed After 15 years, 150 scholars, numerous programs designed and implemented and countless classes, Rita Benn has persuaded and inspired many of her colleagues of the value of integrative health for all, especially for those who teach. Rita BennBy exposing professionals to the benefits of other disciplines outside their own, and building bridges based on science between medicine (disease treatment) and health (vitality and well-being), faculty find themselves creating new methods and solutions to patient problems. \"We felt that, no matter how much teaching we - myself, Sara Warber, Suzie Zick, and others - could do in the [traditional medical] curriculum, we wouldn't be able to reach all the schools in order for them to understand what needed to occur in integrative medicine. Bringing faculty on board who could have that understanding, they could then teach their departments or their students in their schools.\"Integrative Medicine at the U-MThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 57 with books, and stacks of paper and journals sit on her desk with a computer and recessed keyboard. It was late summer when we talked, and she, as program director and teacher, was preparing for a new year of scholars and projects. Originally from Montreal, Benn arrived in Ann Arbor in 1975 to do a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology and Education with clinical child and school specialization. Upon receiving her doctorate, she traveled to India and worked at Boysville in Clinton before starting her family in 1982. When her first son was over a year old, Benn began work at the Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute for child and family development at Wayne State. She worked with attachment in infants and mental health, developed policies for assessing children at risk for developmental delay and disability, and wrote grants with the state for social services. Her Ph.D. had prepared her well for bringing together the many disciplines necessary to help one- to five-year-old Michiganders to thrive: social work, education, and public health joined in campus collaborations. In 1997, after years of commuting to Detroit from Ann Arbor, her husband commuting to Jackson, and her three children in elementary school, Benn decided that someone needed to be local, and she left Wayne State. She had heard about a new grant to research Complementary and Alternative Medicine therapies (now called integrative medicine) in cardiovascular disease, given to Dr. Sara Warber, Suzie Zick, and Alana Gillespie at the U-M Medical School. She was invited by her friend Coco Newton (who was featured in the cover story of issue #60 of the Crazy Wisdom Journal, available on its online archive) to a lecture Newton was giving at Parke-Davis, which Dr. Warber also attended and where they were introduced. After meeting Benn, Warber said, \"We've got to figure out a way to get you part of us.\" Benn wrote her job description for Warber and was hired in 1999 to do education-related research for the grant. In 2001, Benn and Warber wrote a second grant to the National Institutes of Health. Its goal: to bring integrative medicine to the medical school and its allied schools of health. Alternative health use had been increasing among the public since the 70's but ballooned in the late 1990s. Many patients were using massage, herbs, chiropractic, yoga, and meditation along with conventional medicine, yet there was little research available about them. Also, many conventional medical practitioners had little to no experience with these modalities, how they would affect treatment, or if they were contraindicated. The grant funded two programs, student development and faculty development. Said Benn, \"We felt that, no matter how much teaching we - myself, Sara, Suzie Zick, and others - could do in the [traditional medical] curriculum, we wouldn't be able to reach all the schools in order for them to understand what needed to occur in integrative medicine. Bringing faculty on board who could have that understanding, they could then teach their departments or their students in their schools.\" This was the beginning of the Faculty Scholar Program. Grant restrictions originally required faculty to create a project that was educational in nature. Benn explained, \"That could be a course - in the School of Public Health that's 32 credit hours, or in the medical school that's five or six hours - or could be targeted to residents, a few lectures, but it had to be educated related.\" Once the funding from NIH was discontinued, that restriction lifted and faculty pursued what they wished. It also allowed Benn to open the program up to faculty doing research and clinical service. As an example, she said, \"For some faculty members it changed the trajectory of their research careers. Our most famous scholar was Barbara Fredrickson, who is the queen of positive psychology and President of the International Positive Psychology Association. Barb developed a research project on lovingkindness, published it, and is now researching lovingkindness versus mindfulness meditation and the effects on anxiety and depression. She's finding that one may be more beneficial than the other and looking at how our physiological functioning is affected by one over the other. Before [the FSP] she wasn't doing that kind of work.\" Faculty scholars meet one Friday a month. \"We always have an evidence based presentation, they have readings they have to do, there are discussion questions on those readings,\" Benn elaborated. \"Then we have a practitioner who comes in, who teaches us, and we may have a patient of that practitioner who shares their experience of that practice and what it afforded them. The scholars present an update of their project, and then there is some free floating discussion. It's a packed day, and the discussions tend to be focused more on the transformation of health care.\" There are usually anywhere from 10 to 15 scholars a year coming from all over the University. Rita Benn points to that as one of the accomplishments of the program. \"Faculty have an opportunity across campuses and disciplines to learn from each other. Ours is very broad: art, music, business, engineering.\" There is a new national board certification in integrative medicine that is recognized by conventional medical boards. This could create a stream of students and professionals seeking certification. While the Faculty Scholars Program currently does not qualify, it easily could. The decision to do that would be up to Benn's successor.

Benn invites a presenter to talk about a given topic, and collects research articles and data about integrative medicine on that particular topic for the day's schedule. There are usually anywhere from 10 to 15 scholars a year coming from all over the University. Benn points to that as one of the accomplishments of the program. \"Faculty have an opportunity across campuses and disciplines to learn from each other. Ours is very broad: art, music, business, engineering.\" Some years they've also had faculty from other institutions, such as Eastern Michigan University and St. Joe's Hospital. As far as projects go, they vary. A pharmacy faculty member mimicked the medical school program and had her pharmacology students visit alternative practitioners in the community to develop familiarity with non-pharmacological options for care. A math professor distracted his students from their math anxiety by having them solve real world issues, such as calculating the glycemic index for foods they ate. Then there is Sean Ahlquist, a Professor at the Taubman School of Architecture and Urban Planning. His research is on tactile and interactive environments. He also has a daughter with autism. His project united both of those areas, constructing a positive view of mental health. He created a video of his daughter titled Every Day We Look to Define Mental Health on Ara's Terms. From that video, and with the support of Benn and his peers in the program, he developed a workshop for parents to construct a mindful view of the mental well-being of their autistic child. The workshops ran in the fall of 2015 for the first time. Discussions, class time, and the year-long structure create what many scholars call the best part of the class: community. Michael Rice, M.D., Inpatient Medical Director of Gastroenterology, came to the program because \"50% of inflammatory bowel patients use integrative medicine. I wanted to better understand for myself, for patients, and to incorporate [it] in [my] practice.\" Rice, who went through the FSP with Ahlquist, says he was surprised by the camaraderie of the group. \"It was a group of phenomenal people. [I] looked forward to spending time with them. [They were a] sounding board and inspired me.\" Baylin concurred, \"I was looking forward to that day.\" Hank Greenspan, a psychologist and playwright in the Residential College said, \"It was a chance to talk across disciplines, to create a common language. People tend to talk in a certain language and style of work; professionally, [it was] an intercultural exchange.\" Quyen Epstein-Ngo, of the Institute of Research on Women and Gender, said she went through a \"withdrawal\" at the end. Benn points to a growing recognition among the medical profession of the importance of wellness \"not only for their patients, but for themselves.\" The program is a professional renewal of faculty, a \"nurturing of faculty,\" a quality that often falls by the wayside in the high pressured, achievement oriented University community. Many are so burnt out, according to Benn, or bored, or contemplating leaving academia. The monthly format \"allows for deep work. I would say there is a therapeutic element; unexpected for them but [not] for myself. It is what will occur when you are a small group over time, talking about your own personal professional beliefs and views; you are also having these experiences (class visits and demonstrations).\" By allowing faculty to become students, they are given the permission all students have: to be curious, to inquire, to evaluate and reevaluate, to err, to test theories, and see how well they work, not just from a base of theory, but with experiential knowledge as well. The program creates an open, supportive space to learn, design, and play with new ideas, innovations, and cross fertilizations, then apply them into projects. Baylin is one of the many faculty who has had her professional life reinvigorated. Jane Dutton is another. A distinguished Professor of Business Administration and Psychology, Dutton credits the program with giving her the courage and facts to pursue what she wanted to professionally 15 years ago. Dutton's interest was in rethinking management in the business world, how workplaces affect people's health and how workplace design affects human flourishing. The research she was exposed to \"fired her up to explore\" what eventually became the University's Center for Positive Organizations, a part of the Business School. She calls the program one of \"the most transformative educational experiences I ever had, the most pivotal important intervention in [my] career.\" Baylin credits Benn with making it work so well. \"Everything is consistent with the program, not just the talk - the food, the setting. I love the work Rita does and the people involved.\" Dutton added, \"Part of the magic [is the] safe and welcoming learning space. Able to handle conflict, able to handle vulnerability. We felt known as a person, could take risks, and authentically show up as you were.\" There is another, subtler aspect to supporting and nurturing faculty. When many of us reference \"the University\" or \"the Medical School,\" we may mean the physical location, but often we mean the institution and the culture, both of which are represented by the people in that culture. Our interactions with those people affect our understanding and perception of the institution itself. Think for a moment: what are your interactions and experiences like when you are overwhelmed or stressed out? How does that differ when you feel supported, engaged, and inspired? Nurturing faculty to bring out their best selves changes the face of the institution that patients, students, and the community interact with regularly. With elated reviews, professional transformations, inter-professional connections, and innovative research, replication and expansion of the Faculty Scholar Program would seem obvious. However, that is not the case. While the start-up costs and first five years were covered by the NIH grant, and the next three by the Esperance Family Foundation, during the past seven years they have had to search for money. Faculty who attend pay tuition, which usually comes from their department. Some faculty have paid themselves. Funding within the University is a topic of its own, but in general, faculty are encouraged to find grants to support their projects. In the medical school, research receives funds but not education, at least not directly. To receive money once a grant has been given, it is channeled through the department to faculty. The FSP is education focused and cross disciplinary, so while it has found a home in Family Medicine, it belongs to the entire medical school. It is an ongoing program, which most foundations have no interest in, instead wanting the institution to take up the costs. Added to this is Benn's position as adjunct faculty, a change she made seven years ago to teach at Dr. Andrew Weil's Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine. After a year of flying between the program in Ann Arbor and Tucson, she decided to remain in Ann Arbor as an adjunct. Adjunct faculty have a different role in the university hierarchy than permanent faculty. They participate less administratively, and therefore, as Benn says \"the University has less obligation to them.\" They are also limited in access to funding opportunities. These factors combined with those listed above have hampered the project financially, and there is a precedent for failure. The University of Washington had a similar program that ran for three years, with staff trained by Benn, but then Rita Benn and the Faculty Scholar Program Continued from page 57 Discussions, class time, and the year-long structure create what many scholars call the best part of the class: community. Jane Dutton, U-M Professor of Business Administration and Psychology calls the program one of \"the transformative educational experiences I ever had, the most pivotal important intervention in [my] career.\"With elated reviews, professional transformations, inter-professional connections, and innovative research, replication and expansion of the Faculty Scholar Program would seem obvious. However, that is not the case.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 59 \"the staff left and the funding left, so there wasn't a champion to keep it going.\" Costs for the program are a short list: Benn's salary from the Department of Family Medicine, copies to give to the faculty scholars, food for their meals, renting the classroom, payment to the visiting practitioners (although many give their time unpaid). Benn herself does all of the research collection, email coordination, recruitment, arranges the food, the location, the practitioner visits, as well as the teaching. A small of amount of money is paid to the Department of Family Medicine to keep track of the financials - has tuition been paid, the food vendors, the practitioners? When asked what the program needed to be sustainable, Benn said that an extra $10,000 aside from tuitions would cover it. Similar programs nationally cost $5,000 to $15,000, according to her, whereas the University charges faculty and their departments $2,250 to take the program. If they were to raise the cost to between $3,000 and $3,500, Benn believes it would be sustainable locally, although she added, \"donors are welcome.\" Northwestern University implemented the program last year and is continuing it this year with assistance from two of Benn's graduates. Benn is currently training an individual at Beaumont Hospital in metropolitan Detroit to run a similar program there, and recent changes in the world of medicine could assist the program. There is a new national board certification in integrative medicine that is recognized by conventional medical boards. This could create a stream of students and professionals seeking certification. While the FSP currently does not qualify, it easily could. The decision to do that would be up to Benn's successor. When I originally spoke to Benn in 2015, there was no successor in sight and the FSP's demise appeared certain. Benn had searched for a successor and had just had a potential candidate bow out due to too many commitments and the funding difficulty remained. When I contacted her again in the middle of 2016, she emailed that she was in discussions with her department, Family Medicine. In October 2016, Dr. Sara Warber retired. Her leaving proved a catalyst to decision- making and made apparent that if the program was not to disappear, it would need leaders. Suzie Zick, Naturopathic Doctor and M.P .H., and Jill Schneiderhan, M.D., stepped forward. Zick is a researcher, Schneiderhan a clinician and a graduate of the program. Current plans are for the two to co-direct for the next five years and bring it more firmly under the umbrella of Integrative Family Medicine. Benn says there has been \"a recognition of the core value of integrative medicine to family medicine for patients. We have shown the value in the last 15 years and made our case.\" The question is, will that case be strong enough to garner funding? Will it become fully funded as it moves deeper within Family Medicine? Will it become absorbed in the total curriculum, giving faculty the support for developing new programs and initiatives that could benefit students and patients? Or will it disappear in five years, a legacy unfulfilled? For Benn, she says this may be her last year or there may be one or two more. She is very involved with Michigan Collaborative for Mindfulness in Education (MC4ME), a group working on bringing mindfulness into elementary education (See the interview with Mary Spence in issue #62, available on CWJ's archive online), and should hear soon about another grant, this time with Suzie Zick, to train professionals in integrative oncology. She would like to get the program into more universities and hospitals and leave a legacy of integrative health. And then there is Alice, her granddaughter, who recently moved to Ann Arbor while her mother does There is a new national board certification in integrative medicine that is recognized by conventional medical boards. This could create a stream of students and professionals seeking certification. While the Faculty Scholars Program currently does not qualify, it easily could. The decision to do that would be up to Benn's successor. a fellowship at the medical school and her father finishes his Ph.D. Having Alice local \"thrills me!\" says Benn, especially since her other children live in California and New York. The final class offered to the faculty scholars is optional. Its title is \"Leadership and Systems Change.\" Benn stated, \"I think what can also transform the system is when the leadership of that system has their own personal experience. We have the data and the data supports [a] benefit of quality of life for these modalities. We think that policy change occurs because of data but it doesn't, it occurs because of personal experience and persuasion.\" After 15 years, 150 scholars, numerous programs designed and implemented and countless classes, Rita Benn has persuaded and inspired many of her colleagues of the value of integrative health for all, especially for those who teach. For it to flourish and grow, nourished and funded, and continue to benefit faculty, patients, and students in the future is up to her successors and the University.

That was around the same time that Dr. Tarik Bel-Bahar arrived in Ann Arbor. We were approached by Bel-Bahar in mid-2015, who suggested that CCS's mission and activities might be ripe for a story in the CW Journal. We agreed. So what follows is an interview with Dr. Bel-Bahar, about the Center and its work. For long-time Crazy Wisdom Journal readers, this is a \"must-read\" about exciting work on the frontiers of consciousness research being done right here in Ann Arbor, right at the University, in the Medical School, no less. Tarik Bel-Bahar is a Research Investigator at the CCS. He does data collection, analysis, and reporting on studies using psychometrics (questions and tests) and neurometrics (high-density EEG). His interests are focused on brain dynamics, consciousness, emotion, and other topics including psychopathology, personality, social cognition, mobile biosignals, ritual cognition and experience, and religio-contemplative metaphysics. Bel-Bahar is highly intelligent, gentlemanly and quick-witted. He has an exceptional grasp of the many and varied threads of the fields of consciousness science and consciousness studies. He is as at home talking about altered states of consciousness induced by meditation, shamanism, Roman Catholic chants, psychoactive substances or Sufi dances, as he is talking about examining brain dynamics with research-grade high-density-array EEG. Best of all, he's possessed of a twinkle in his eye and a wizard-like appreciation for the mysteries yet to be solved in the field of consciousness exploration. Bel-Bahar, 43, was born in Poland and spent his early childhood there. He spent some of his growing up years in Algiers, and then in New York City. He went to the University of Alaska in Anchorage as an undergraduate, and later received his Ph.D. in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Oregon. Currently single, he lives in Ann Arbor Hills. Bill Zirinsky: Thank you for agreeing to this interview, Tarik. The Center for Consciousness Science (CCS), part of the Department of Anesthesiology at the U-M Medical School, is doing some exciting research, and I think our readers will be interested in the Center, its research, and what's ahead. Please tell our readers some basic information about the Center. How long has it been around? How did it come to be? Who are the movers and shakers behind its inception? Tarik Bel-Bahar: The CCS is only two years old and was born after a decade of growing efforts at the U-M Medical School by Dr. George Mashour and colleagues to explore brain and behavior changes associated with anesthesia, and especially the induction of unconsciousness and the emergence of consciousness. The Center's leaders also include Tony Hudetz and Uncheol Lee, two deans in the world of anesthesia and consciousness research.Developing a better understanding of the mechanisms and measurement of consciousness (i.e., awareness, subjectivity, and conscious experience) is fundamental for the mind and brain sciences, and may have profound psychological, clinical, philosophical, and theological implications. Building on recent advances in consciousness research by the Department of Anesthesiology (U-M Medical School) and on the strong need for research centers dedicated to rigorous multidisciplinary studies of consciousness, the Center for Consciousness was founded. The CCS is focused on innovative and long-term research that will advance interdisciplinary models of consciousness. Researchers at the CCS are doing basic and translational research funded by NIH grants, using advanced brain connectivity and modeling techniques, providing training and research opportunities, and engaging with the emerging international community of consciousness researchers. In the first year and half of the CCS, we have grown to include over 50 core and associated faculty from the fields of neuroscience, physiology, anesthesiology, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, psychology, philosophy, engineering, physics, mathematics, computer science, and music across seven institutions. A research center is usually setup by dedicated scientists when there is: 1) a strong core set of researchers with overlapping interests, 2) young or growing research agenda with international merit, and 3) good research infrastructure. The development of a center serves as a galvanizing force that can make the research more impactful. We are part of a growing movement in the cognitive, medical, and engineering sciences to better understand the fundamentals and complexities of mind, brain, and behavior. As one of a few centers worldwide, the CCS is at the forefront of research into anesthesia, sleep, and altered states, but also reflects to some degree the broad multi-disciplinary nature of modern consciousness research. CCS faculty and associated faculty come from a range of disciplines including medicine, philosophy, As one of a few centers worldwide, the Center for Consciousness Science is at the forefront of research into anesthesia, sleep, and altered states, but also reflects to some degree the broad multi-disciplinary nature of modern consciousness research. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 61 psychology, physics, and engineering. This past year in April, we co-sponsored the premiere Science of Consciousness conference in Tucson and presented a range of experimental, behavioral, and brain-imaging work there. Readers are invited to peruse the Tucson conference website, the CCS website, and to look out for CCS-sponsored events open to the community. Bill Zirinsky: Can you tell us about the background of Dr. George Mashour? And how does he define the purpose of the Center? Tarik Bel-Bahar: George A. Mashour, M.D., Ph.D., is an anesthesiologist and neuroscientist who founded and directs CCS. Dr. Mashour's primary scholarly interest is in consciousness and anesthesia. In his clinical research he studies intraoperative awareness and has conducted several major randomized controlled trials on brain monitoring. In his laboratory he investigates the mechanisms of unconsciousness during general anesthesia and sleep. Finally, his computational research group explores network science approaches to consciousness and unconsciousness. Mashour's research is funded by the NIH and the James S. McDonnell Foundation. Bill Zirinsky: Can you give us a sense of the size of the Center? How many scientists and researchers are working at the Center, how much money is being budgeted for the Center, either out of the U-M budget and/or from grant money and other funding sources? Were there also a few major donors to the Center, and who are they? Tarik Bel-Bahar: The Center consists of about ten core faculty, about ten other collaborators at U-M, and about fifty associated faculty from around the country. We have an external advisory board of world leaders in consciousness research. Our current budget comes mainly from current and new federal grants focused on research into anesthesia, along with support from U-M. We actively seek out new opportunities to build out our research portfolio into other research areas. We have received some private funding for a one-year project examining kundalini yoga. Considerable seed funding is required to jumpstart long-term research programs into traditionally underfunded research areas such as altered states of consciousness associated with religious, mystical, psychedelic, or contemplative practices. BZ: In explaining to me why the growth of the Center is an interesting story, you noted it is a story of anesthesia \"rediscovering\" consciousness just as the \"consciousness science movement is heating up.\" Please elaborate. Tarik Bel-Bahar: For nearly a century and a half, anesthesiologists have been working with turning general consciousness on and off in operating rooms for millions of people around the world. But to date we still do not understand this on/off process in terms of neuropsychology. What is this consciousness that we lose when we go to sleep and that returns when we wake up? Some researchers, including Dr. Mashour, have increasingly focused on directly examining cognition and brain dynamics before, during, and after anesthesia. This kind of research reflects a growing synergy between the medical, brain, and cognitive sciences. It builds on the extensive knowledge about anesthesia at a neurochemical level and in terms of fine titration and control of various substances used for anesthesia. It also builds on developments in cognitive neuroscience, millisecond-resolution functional brain imaging, and advanced computational methods that draw from advanced math and physics, including graph theory and dynamical systems. In another sense, this line of research brings about interesting findings that consciousness and cognition researchers can benefit from, and anesthesia research in turn benefits from the wide range of techniques and theories for examining consciousness and cognition. Other influences have included research programs focused on the cognitive unconscious (some pioneered by CCS collaborators here at U-M) and disorders of consciousness involved with brain damage and coma. BZ: You noted that there are three pillars of the Center's work. Please delineate those three pillars? Tarik Bel-Bahar: There are three \"pillars\" or general research themes. They are: 1) Human experiments focused on brain dynamics and monitoring of consciousness, 2) Experimental neuroscience with small animals, focused on brain and biochemical dynamics, and 3) Altered States of Consciousness (including those related to anesthesia, contemplation, mysticism, etc.). The Center is also associated with multi-center studies of anesthesia effects and post-surgery recovery. BZ: You provided an article for me by Anil Seth, the co-director of the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science at the University of Sussex, on \"Consciousness: Eight questions science must answer.\" Which of those eight questions is the CCS engaged in exploring and understanding more deeply? Tarik Bel-Bahar: We are primarily looking into questions one and two regarding anesthesia, what are the critical brain regions and mechanisms for consciousness? Researchers at CCS look at how different parts of the brain work together in modulating local and global network dynamics during anesthesia and other forms of altered states of consciousness. We are also looking at which brain regions are Consciousness: Eight Questions Science Must Answer What are the critical brain regions for consciousness? What are the mechanisms of general anesthesia? What is the self? What determines experiences of volition and 'will'? What is the function of consciousness? What are experiences for? How rich is consciousness? Are other animals conscious? Are vegetative patients conscious?This groundbreaking work has well established the main effects of light doses of ketamine on quickly reducing depression. Discover how dynamic patterns of neural activity are transformed into cognition, emotion, perception, and action in health and disease. This is the ultimate current goal of the brain and mind sciences, and is strongly related to explaining how human consciousness happens. Continued on page 62The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 62 Dr. Krystal's talk was the 2nd Annual CCS Lecture and focused on developments over the last decade or two (among others) in the use of ketamine as a therapy for clinical and/or chronic depression. This groundbreaking work has well established the main effects of light doses of ketamine on quickly reducing depression. The work now continues to examine these effects over time, at different dosages, and over treatments of varying length. Although much research remains to be done, this progress at a premiere academic institution bodes well for more research in psychiatry on the effects of substances that have psychedelic and dissociative properties. So, unlike some anti-depression medicines, ketamine has a psychoactive component? And how might that be useful in the treatment of depression? Yes, ketamine is known for its psychedelic properties including, particularly, dissociation and disembodiment. The total effect on depression is what has been mainly studied thus far, and the specifics are not clear, though there is a growing set of data and theories that attempt to explain what's going on. The empirical story about how psychoactive components might be useful in various forms of psychiatric therapy is still in development, and the real systematic and long-term work has not yet really begun. One theory that makes some sense is that ketamine helps to disrupt coordinated brain activity, which along with producing a psychedelic component, also somewhat \"resets\" or \"de-stabilizes\" the system. It's probable that it's useful for chronic depression for these reasons of \"resetting,\" and other psychedelic substances may have positive mental health effects (e.g., LSD or psilocybin for insight therapy). The effects of various dosage levels, long-term psychological effects, and the variety of effects across different psychedelics have yet to be studied comprehensively. The current age of brain science has been going on for about 25 years, is that correct? Overall, brains, like minds, are seen from afar, like stars, through the telescopes of scientific methods, and different kinds of telescopes are needed to really \"see\" the action in full. Further, there are of course multiple arcs in science and society, some short, some taking years, some taking decades or longer. The current version of modern cognitive neuroscience really jumped off in the late 80's with the advent of human brain MRI and functional-MRI (fMRI) for psychological research, which followed up on the heyday of cognitive science in the 70's and 80's. But the field has grown quickly and moved past older points of view focused on particular brain regions as loci of mental faculties (aka blob-ology). Over the past few decades there have been several waves of changes, including moves to combine various brain imaging technologies, stronger synergy between cognitive and brain sciences, advances in brain imaging technologies and analysis methods, and, recently, growing national and international funding for big-data/brain science projects. So, in a sense, a new age of brain science has already begun, and the fields of brain imaging and cognitive neuroscience are likely to make big strides as over this century, increasingly in synergy with genetics, molecular-imaging, medicine, and engineering. One thing for sure is that new technologies and more computational capacity will continue to transform the brain and cognitive sciences. It's also important to note that various kinds of experimental neuroscience have been going on for over 60 years, including work with brain pathologies, cellular and systems neuroscience, and with electroencephalogram (EEG) approaches to capturing brain dynamics. Overall we should expect many new and interesting developments in the analysis of brain dynamics in the coming decades. You explained to me that \"the way each of us is brain-wired is the connectome.\" Can you define for our readers what the human Connectome Project is about? How long has connectome research been going on? And what are a couple examples of the kinds of cutting edge research in brain-science being done as part of the Human Connectome Project (HCP)? Work into the brain connectome is only a few decades old and represents important current questions in neuroscience. For example, there are tens of thousands of miles of wiring in the brain, and single neurons have thousands of connections. The idea of \"connections\" and \"connectivity\" have gained more importance as researchers have started assessing the influence of major fiber tracts in the brain on cognition and behavior, and as researchers continue to hunt in more complex ways for the \"brain code,\" which is likely based on the functional-dynamic interactions across brain regions and networks. The rise of connectomics and connectivity is also a reflection of society-wide trend of increased interest into networks and complex systems over the last 20 or 30 years. The HCP is an example of a large brain science initiative that is really pushing the boundaries forward and creating a whole new playing field for researchers. There are several similar initiatives focused on special populations such as autism or pain, or focused on particular kinds of brain imaging methods. The HCP is a federally funded project that includes various forms of data about brain connections, structure, and connectivity in a large number of participants. It also provides tools for viewing and analyses. It is reflective of current mood focused on big standardized databases, active and coordinated most during specific kinds of altered states. By understanding how these brain effects and associated altered states are modulated in different conditions, we also contribute to the growing knowledge about the mechanisms of anesthesia, especially in terms of fluctuations in high-order cortical function linked to awareness and integrated cognition. BZ: I saw that John Krystal, Chair of Psychiatry at Yale, was in town a few months ago talking about ketamine therapy for depression. You mentioned to me that there is a 50-year history of ketamine research, and ketamine can be an anesthetic, an analgesic, an anti-depressive, and a psychedelic. Tell us more about ketamine, and, in a nutshell, what Dr. Krystal talked about. Tarik Bel-Bahar: Ketamine is an important compound in anesthesia, on which early tests in humans were run in the early 1960's by Dr. Edward Domino, a scientist from the U-M Department of Anesthesiology. Since then there has been continuing work on the mechanisms and effects of ketamine, including ongoing studies by CCS researchers that focus on examining brain dynamics and altered states during different ketamine doses. Overall, ketamine is a great example of a substance that can help us understand more about mind, brain, and behavior. It has known effects that can be replicated and studied in controlled medical contexts. The Crazy Wisdom Journal Interview with Dr. Tarik Bel-Bahar Continued from page 61 What is this consciousness that we lose when we go to sleep and that returns when we wake up? For example, there are tens of thousands of miles of wiring in the brain, and single neurons have thousands of connections. This is an example of a spectrogram at different frequencies, and different conditions from the shamanism study. One can see increased alpha (10hz) during eyes closed periods including the drumming music and classical periods This image (below) from a ketamine study depicts oscillatory brain dynamics from a healthy young adult participant. The image shows EEG frequencies' power over time, with a general decrease in alpha (the red amplitudes at about 10 Hz) during the time of the sub-anesthetic period relative to the baseline period at the start. The white vertical line represents the end of the eyes-closed baseline period and the start of the eyes-closed sub-anesthetic period. In this study we also examined altered states of consciousness experienced by participants during the ketamine dose.partly due to developments in engineering and computing, but also partly to push for standardized and coordinated efforts that can make big impacts. With continued effort, this kind of big-push funding will lead to amazing new brain-based technologies and industries over this century. In a sense, our brains' idiosyncratic patterns of connectivity make us who we are, both unique and similar to other individuals who presumably have slightly different connectivity patterns. We can also see this emphasis on \"individuality\" in the growing emphasis on \"personalized or precision medicine.\" You sent me a link about the U.S. Brain Initiative. You explained to me that the European Union has been ahead of us in devoting research dollars to brain science, and I learned, from reading about the U.S. Brain Initiative, that President Obama got behind brain science in mid-2014 by making a commitment to fund $4.5 billion dollars over 12 years to seven high-priority research areas. And that, later in 2014, $46 million was given in grants to over 100 investigators in 15 states and other countries. What are the seven high-priority research areas? And what are some of the research projects now taking place at University of Michigan, or soon to take place, as a result of this? Yes, America has gotten on board in terms of coordinated funding into brain and mind, a program, which in the long run may be more impactful than the heyday of the U.S. space program with all its benefits to humanity. We are also likely to see synergy across U.S., E.U., and other brain-research initiatives, both public and private. The final seventh goal of the U.S. initiative is the most telling: Discover how dynamic patterns of neural activity are transformed into cognition, emotion, perception, and action in health and disease. This is the ultimate current goal of the brain and mind sciences, and is strongly related to explaining how human consciousness happens. It may take us several centuries to really get there, but big consolidative leaps in progress are on the way. The first six research goals are about the heavy lifting and fundamental work needed to really reach that seventh goal. These goals involve a lot of fascinating work, including mapping the brain circuits of mice and monkeys, building computer simulations of the brain in action, and building out new ways to compute and visualize data. In brief, the first six goals are as follows 1) full parts list including specific types of cells across the brain, 2) maps ranging from synapses to the whole brain, 3) large-scale monitoring of neuronal populations, 4) brain-behavior causality, 5) fundamental principles for biological basis of mental processes, and 6) innovative technologies and research networks for understanding the brain and treating associated disorders. One of the center's recent publications is from Dr. Cindy Chestek's U-M lab, a Brain Initiative awardee, where recent work has shown for the first time that ketamine anesthesia disrupts connectivity between sensory and motor neurons. Can you connect the dots for our Crazy Wisdom readers who will be interested in the work CCS is doing and how it relates to the contemplative sciences, meditation, yoga, psychedelics, shamanism, and so on. Please lead us through this thicket so we can understand how it happened that the Department of Anesthesia became a logical, albeit beguiling, place for cutting edge brain and consciousness research to be taking place, and how CCS is integrating practices not customarily studied at the Medical School? In brief, anesthesia, drugs, and altered states have long been intertwined topics. Relatedly, altered states also go together with yoga, meditation, prayer, religion, and psychedelics. The CCS connection with altered states is based on several reasons. Altered states often happen during or after anesthesia. Tracking specific altered states is important for anesthesia and consciousness research. At CCS, some of our studies focus on the anesthetic and cognitive effects of drugs such as ketamine and nitrous oxide, which are known for inducing altered states of mind. Traditionally, altered states have been generated endogenously via a range of structured practices associated with religion and mysticism. During the early days of the psychedelic movement, pioneering psychonauts such as John Lilly self-administered ketamine and other drugs as part of their explorations. Looking further into these approaches, some of which also entail the use of specific drugs or rituals, may help us better understand altered states across a range of contexts, and build up a brain-based theory about the neural and cognitive mechanisms during altered states. A science of consciousness, as we envision it, builds on models and methods from psychological, biological, and social sciences and is perfectly poised to make breakthrough contributions in our scientific understanding of experiences in practitioners from the world's religious and contemplative traditions. As part of the CCS commitment to studying a wide range of normal and altered states of consciousness, our current and planned studies focus on expert long-term In brief, anesthesia, drugs, and altered states have long been intertwined topics.... Looking further into these approaches, some of which also entail the use of specific drugs or rituals, may help us better understand altered states across a range of contexts, and build up a brain-based theory about the neural and cognitive mechanisms during altered states.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 63 Who is on the Cover In the Middle: George A.

Continued on page 64The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 64 practitioners involved with certain forms of shamanism, yoga, and Buddhism. In the long-term, we are also interested in altered states during prayer, religious ritual, and mystical states. For example, what are the brain and consciousness dynamics involved during experiences of God, divinity, sacredness, total/absolute reality, non-duality, unity of being, self-cessation, transcendence, ineffability, or various forms of \"awakening\"? Research is heavily under-developed in comparative religious studies as well as the neuroscience of religion and contemplation, with most of the basic descriptive and exploratory research work yet to be done. New data-driven models and taxonomies are needed now. To build an understanding of complex phenomena such as spiritual experiences requires high-resolution scientific models that track various neuropsychological processes (e.g., awareness, cognition, perception, emotion, memory, motivation) and states of consciousness (e.g., the experience of God, bliss, non-duality). The new work being planned by the CCS can serve as a basis for future explanatory and predictive studies on the mechanisms of specific religious-spiritual practices and their effects. Such systematic projects will lead to important implications for our understanding of 1) the neuropsychological processes and consciousness states associated with religious experiences, in general and in specific traditions, 2) the impact of religious practices on practitioners' experiences in terms of agency and free will, beliefs and expectations, emotion and pain regulation, self-knowledge, self-control, well-being, and character strengths, and 3) enriching inter-religious, inter-cultural, and science-religion dialogues. Please tell us about your study of shamanic healing and the brain? Our study is mainly focused on brain dynamics and altered states of consciousness in shamanic healing experts while they do shamanic healing at a distance directed at a specific adult human target. Shamanic traditions are found across human cultures, and include proto-religious and visionary elements that serve as a foundation for modern ritual, prayer, and contemplative practices. Shamanic practitioners are thought to enter altered states of consciousness (ASC) including trance, interacting with non-physical entities, and traveling to different levels of shamanic reality. Currently there are few empirical studies that have examined shamanic practices and associated psychological states in controlled laboratory conditions. In this study we assessed ASC and emotion states in experienced shamanic healing practitioners relative to an age/gender-matched control group with no interest in shamanism. All participants experienced two music conditions with simultaneous EEG recording: shamanic drumming and classical. The shamanic-practitioners performed shamanic healing during the drumming music condition whereas controls only listened to the drumming music. We are examining changes in self-reported altered states and brain dynamics across the different conditions and groups. Here is an example of findings regarding self-reported altered-states: In the drumming versus the classical music conditions, the shamanic-practitioners group, relative to controls, reported significant increases for the following ASC dimensions: bliss, changed meaning of percepts, complex imagery, disembodiment, experiences of unity, insightfulness, spiritual experiences. Further, for shamanic-practitioners, retrospective-timeline reports of states across the shamanic healing period showed a gradual increase and decrease in: lack of environmental awareness, communicating with the healing target, intensity and being in a different physical or spiritual place. Shamanic-practitioners also reported an initial brief increase at the start of the drumming music condition, and a subsequent gradual decline for visual imagery, effort, traveling, flying, and communication with helping forces. How do participants enter altered states of consciousness in the shamanic and meditation studies? Do you get oral histories of their interpretations of these processes? All participants are asked to perform a prototypical well-known series of steps. In some cases we ask participants what the steps are that they take. Expert participants in our recent shamanic healing study used their personal technique for beginning their shamanic healing ritual, which involved some combination of drumming, rattling, focusing on a sacred object, and the like. They also listened to drumming music during this period. And, yes, we get \"written and/or oral descriptions of their experiences\" after a particular experimental period is over. We also use more quantitative psychometric measures of ASCs, like emotion, and associated psychological states like the ASC dimensions I just mentioned. In some of our meditation-related studies, participants perform a specific technique from their contemplative tradition, with as clear of a start and end as possible. In all our studies we ask specific questions about the expected experiences within that tradition, as well as more general questions about a range of known ASCs (disembodiment, unitive experience, complex imagery, and so on). Some of the tradition-specific questions are often done on a timeline to better capture temporal aspects of the experiences (such as, in shamanism, flying, presence of spiritual beings, or travelling-between-worlds). Can you cite some questionnaire feedback from people reporting on their ASC? What does the reporting read like compared to people answering the same question in the control group? We mainly analyze the questionnaire data, and found that the shamanic healers reported a lot more ASCs related to spiritual experience relative to the controls, as well as experiencing generally more positive emotion during the 25 minutes of listening to drumming music. In terms of brain dynamics, the differences between the shamans and the controls are more subtle and we are currently working on the results. Currently, the differences in terms of the brain dynamics seem to not be very different between the shamanic healers and controls. We expect to publish the results early next year . What does the brainwave activity look like for people during an ASC? We use baseline periods of eyes-closed resting to compare to other periods where we believe ASCs to be occurring. Our main work, in terms of the neuropsychology of ASCs, is associating self-reported ASCs with specific aspects of brain dynamics (including brainwaves). However, it should be noted there are many dimensions to ASCs. You have an upcoming study on meditation and the brain. Tell us about that. Who will be your subjects, and what are you hoping to accomplish? We plan to work soon with long-term 15+ year Zen Buddhist practitioners in one upcoming project. Of all kinds of meditation, Zen probably has the strongest roots and development in the Western world, and we plan to work primarily with ordained monks and abbots from across the nation, as well as long-term lay practitioners. We will look for unique activity of altered-states and EEG brain dynamics associated with several kinds of meditation and chanting, relative to baseline control periods, control cognitive tasks, and a control group of matched participants. The control groups will consist of meditation-na\u00efve people that are age, gender, and education matched to The Crazy Wisdom Journal Interview with Dr. Tarik Bel-Bahar Continued from page 63 In recent decades, structural brain connectivity (such as the white matter fiber tracts depicted in the image) and functional brain connectivity (the co-activation of regions) have been studied ever more intensely. This image shows \"connectome\" data for white matter fibers, color coded by their direction, left-right (red), front-back (green), and ascending-descending (blue). For example, what are the brain and consciousness dynamics involved during experiences of God, divinity, sacredness, total/absolute reality, non-duality, unity of being, self-cessation, transcendence, ineffability, bliss, or various forms of awakening?Shamanic practitioners are thought to enter altered states of consciousness (ASC) including trance, interacting with non-physical entities, and traveling to different levels of shamanic reality.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 65 Our Ann Arbor Holistic Guide at annarborholistic.com the Zen practitioners. Some tasks to be performed are unique to Zen, and some of the tasks are designed to be comparable to meditation practices in other traditions, such as specific forms of chanting or compassion prayers. We also hope to compare outcomes of this study with those from similar studies we have developed looking into shamanism and yoga. This kind of research also allows the development of a database of information about psychological variables in Zen practitioners relative to controls, including ASC levels in daily life and practice, health factors, quality of life, pain, depression, anxiety, and character strengths such as optimism and patience. And, later on, you are intending to also study kundalini yoga from an \"Effects of Aging\" angle? The Kundalini Yoga movement in the West is fascinating in many ways, and offers an opportunity to study yoga-based practices that are relatively formulaic and well-rehearsed. Our Kundalini Yoga study is designed similarly to the Zen study, except that it is focused on practitioners over 50 years of age, and includes Kundalini Yoga practitioners as the \"expert\" group. The focus will be on understanding altered states and brain dynamics that are unique to a small subset of the varied Kundalini Yoga practices originally taught by Yogi Bhajan. For example, this would include some advanced kriyas, pranayama, and meditation practices. As with the Zen study, the focus on these studies is to develop small yet impactful well-designed research focused on isolating the \"active\" ingredients, if any, in well-selected expert groups. These kinds of studies will make a big difference in advancing research into meditation and contemplation techniques, especially by mapping out similarities and differences between groups and practices, and overcoming many of the problems with past research into meditation techniques. And in these research projects which you just described, you are using EEG testing, not MRIs, is that correct? And why? The CCS includes researchers that use a range of technologies including EEG, MRI, and other methods. The focus in the projects I am involved with is examining brain dynamics with research-grade high-density-array EEG. Modern EEG is really a thing of wonder that is set to outclass current fMRI for functional brain imaging. EEG is five percent of the cost and size of fMRI, provides exquisite millisecond temporal resolution, as well as \"pictures\" of brain activity and connectivity that are quite similar to those from fMRI. Further, EEG has a strong base of over 60 years of active research, relative to the youth of newer approaches. You said to me that there is a move in brain science to get out of the lab and move into more realistic, day-to-day situations. You told me that there are now mobile, wearable and \"dry\" EEG systems. Tell us about them, and their uses for brain science research, and also, will there come a time that there will be wearable MRI \"hats,\" and if so, when?In the future we will wear (in our clothes) or implant (in our bodies) tools for continuous brain and body assessment. It will most likely be something like EEG, or some new technology that integrates developments in nanotechnology and computation speed. Currently, there are new EEG systems that allow movement which is usually restricted in traditional cognitive and EEG studies. These new systems increase the realism of the studies, as we are usually moving about when we think and act. Some of these systems also require very little time or training to apply, and have dry electrodes which require none of the traditional sticky gel. There are a few consumer-grade systems on the market that can be bought and used by anyone, but they are still low-quality. There are also a handful of companies that build mobile EEG systems such as Cognionics.com in San Diego. Overall these mobile systems are important because they can be used for studying everyday life perception, cognition, and interaction. They will also provide a window into the embodied mind, as our mind-brains are continuously and permanently intertwined with the rest of the body and the world. This area of research is really a frontier territory, and we're still a bit away from a time when everyone puts on their brain monitor all day long to track themselves or to send data to their doctors (but we're almost there!). In the near future, wearable and unobtrusive brain and bio-signal monitors will be used for augmenting performance and cognition across domains and the lifespan. Continued on page 66 George A. Mashour, M.D., Ph.D., is the director of the Center for Consciousness ScienceThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 66 How do you screen for people with 15 or 20 years of expertise as meditators or yoga practitioners or shamanic healers? \"High-quality and representative\" participants is one of the major issues in meditation and religious science. This is a general issue for researchers working in communities without large homogenous groups of contemplative practitioners. First there are some historical (which schools and methods are most developed in the West?) and regional (major coastal cities that are hotbeds of alternative spirituality) factors. Further, self-ascribed \"great meditators\" will likely not be that great, and true \"great meditators\" are most likely to be hard to find. For some of our studies, verifiability and authenticity of training depends to some degree on the \"official\" affiliation of a potential participant with a specific tradition. We're not expecting to find the top one percent, but rather in the upper twenty percent of the population, in terms of documentable expertise in particular practices. Other issues abound, such as the heterogeneity and individualism of contemplative practices in the West, Westernized and de-contextualized forms of yoga and Buddhism, and the degree to which researchers choose to draw only from formal contemplative communities. The success of finding experts also depends on the specific group and type of practice in question. Finally, there is no one well-known method for pulling expert contemplatives from the population. We vet our protocols and target \"expert\" groups with consultation from tradition-specific experts, and plan a collaborative alliance with other related centers of research to maximize our efforts and share the opportunity to work with high-quality long-term practitioners. Some steps that can be taken to maximize the quality of participants in empirical studies of meditation, contemplation, and religious experience include: 1) Advertising through direct contacts to practice communities, contemplative hotspots, and major cities around the country, and word-of-mouth with leaders in specific practitioner community 2) Focusing on people that are usually over 40 or 50 with practice experience mainly in only one or two major traditions 3) Focusing as much as possible on formally trained and ordained contemplative practitioners, although advanced lay/self-taught practitioners are an interesting sub-group of participants 4) Interviews about background, training, and practice history, including general descriptions of practice actions and content. Getting details about \"other practices\" besides the one of interest in the study5) Confirmation by the participant of training under an expert in a known established school or methods for two or more years 6) Confirmation by the participant of ongoing practice of a specific form of practice for at least the last five years with a certain number of hours per week and month 7) Confirmation by the participant of ongoing practice of specific form(s) of practice(s) for at least the full number of years that are set as the threshold for the study 8) Brief interview with three references (other practitioners) to confirm practice history of the participant Screening questions to make sure that the person can do the tasks (for example, sitting relatively still, doing a specific practice) and does not have various characteristics (for example, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, major physical or psychiatric illness) Please tell us about the \"extensive self-report measures of altered states of consciousness\" that are being used across the CCS studies? You sent me a link to an article on \"psychometric evaluations of altered states of consciousness.\" Can you explain that to our readers, in laymen's language, because I think it's pretty darn interesting now that I have a layman's inkling of what you're doing in building standard measures for understanding altered states? We ask people questions about their experiences during various experimental periods, such as after a shamanic healing session, a light dose of ketamine, a round of pranayama, or a non-dual meditation. The questions vary in number and topic, but essentially touch on emotional states and a range of empirically well-established altered states including disembodiment, unity, bliss, oceanic boundlessness, changed meaning, visual imagery, audio-visual synesthesia, and insightfulness. These questionnaires build on over a half-century of work in measuring altered, religious, mystical, and drug-induced states. Our work will allow comparison of altered states across groups and conditions, and also allow comparison of our findings to those of other researchers assessing altered states in a similar way. In the near future, a range of new questionnaires are being developed focused on experiences that are specific to particular practices (for example, bliss about what?, or describing the specific features of one's experiences of unity). In our meditation studies, questionnaires are also supplemented with brief post-task interviews and open-ended questions that allow participants to provide a personal narrative about their experiences. Future studies will have no-self-report \"behavior\" or \"performance\"-based assessments of changes during or after a specific experience, which will be detecting or reacting to some kind of visual or auditory stimulus. In the article on psychometric measures, it appeared to me that current-day consciousness researchers would like to understand and evaluate the experiences of \"oceanic boundlessness\" and \"visionary restructuralization\" that one might go through in ingesting psilocybin, MDMA, ketamine or other substances. In other words, the time has finally come that academia is again able to study the properties of, and the effects of, and the value of, hallucinogens and other psychoactive substances, after decades in which academia had to turn away from such research and exploration. Can you briefly survey for us where else this kind of consciousness research is going in this country? How unique is the work going on at CCS? There are so few consciousness science centers that most of the work done at each center is unique. There are several other consciousness science centers, for example in Arizona, Finland, and England. These include several other groups that work in the areas of anesthesia and/or consciousness. Consciousness science centers also have a focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, simulation of brain and mental dynamics, as well as robotics and artificial intelligence. A lot of work related to these topics is also done under the auspices of more traditional psychology and neuroscience centers, or centers associated with Integrative/Complementary healthcare, Contemplative Studies, Or \"Integrative Studies.\"The Crazy Wisdom Journal Interview with Dr. Tarik Bel-Bahar Continued from page 65 EEG Techniques - EEG Generation Model Structural models of the brain are combined with EEG data to estimate the \"dynamic sources\" inside the head. This methodology allows assessment of functional associations across brain networks during various forms of cognition. ...the focus on these studies [Kundalini Y oga and Zen Buddhist] is to develop small yet impactful well- designed research focused on isolating the \"active\" ingredients, if any, in well-selected expert groups. In the near future, wearable and unobtrusive brain and bio-signal monitors will be used for augmenting performance and cognition across domains and the lifespan. We ask people questions about their experiences during various experimental periods, such as after a shamanic healing session, a light dose of ketamine, a round of pranayama, or a non-dual meditation.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 67 Research into altered states and psychedelics is certainly on an uptick in the last five years or so. For research into altered states and psychoactive substances, it's worth taking a look into research at Johns Hopkins and at Imperial College London. We're still far from a full opening of the floodgates of research into psychedelics, but the recent research is well-controlled, done in healthy humans, and promising. In the long run, old and new psychoactive substances will likely serve as excellent empirical telescopes to better understand the mind and consciousness both at the level of mental-health effects and the level of examining the \"nature and architecture\" of consciousness. You would like to build a \"self-report platform\" online. Tell our readers what that would be, and how and why? This is a pet project of mine, an easy to use web-based data-gathering platform for assessment of mind-body practices for use by scientists and practitioners. It would essentially contain high-quality questionnaires and cognitive tasks regarding health, emotion, and a range of psychological factors including altered states of consciousness. There would be short version and long versions, which people could take just once or twice, or many times in order to get a data report. The idea is that millions of practitioners (and teachers) at yoga, meditation, and other mind-body centers can \"share\" data to get a clearer empirical picture of what's happening as a result of mind-body practices. These kinds of questions require international samples in the thousands and more to be valid and robust in their implications and usefulness. Such a system would allow individual centers or teachers to track before/after scores for classes and retreats, and, over time with many respondents, would potentially lead to a kind of consumer reports on known schools and styles (for example, which class, teachers, or style is good for anxious types? What are the increases in positive emotion after classes using a particular style or at a particular center?). In brief, the tool would benefit the students, the teachers, and the community with more refined information about what's going on with mind-body practitioners in the U.S. and around the world. In a sense it would be a mind-body assessment toolkit in line with a range of NIH toolboxes for assessment of mental health and pain using well-established questionnaires and tasks. What led to your interest in altered states of consciousness? Please trace the evolution of that interest, and bring it to your current activities at CCS. We all have altered states awareness, consciousness, and experience, of one kind or another, and that is fundamentally interesting. I initially had a natural interest regarding internal experience as a born introvert, only child, and a bookworm. Understanding the life of the mind, and the varieties of mental life, both loom large as core motivating factors for many research-focused psychologists and neuroscientists. In my early 20s I was a yoga enthusiast and interested in becoming a mind-body therapist or counselor. However I could see that the \"data was weak\" for treatments/theories in New Age and complementary health techniques, they smacked too much of the philosophical or spiritual, and thus chose to go into psychology, where I could continue my interests in the self, mind, and people, as well as possibly make a contribution to empirical knowledge on those topics. I went through a phase with serious interests in mysticism before coming to psychological science as a career, as it seemed there was no \"career\" in mysticism besides being a \"spiritual/philosophical\" counselor (now the situation has changed, with the continued growth of Yoga, Mindfulness, and CAM Health approaches in the last two decades). Have you been personally involved in the practice of meditation in addition to yoga? What have been your own consciousness-altering practices? What's worked well for you, and what has not-so-much worked for you? Yes, I've had a few experiences in my life with a few specific traditions, with a focus primarily on hatha yoga and ritual-devotional yoga. As I assume many others Crazy Wisdom readers do, I practice a DIY amalgam based on my own brew of experiences, teachers, loves, and sorrows. However, I generally recommend adherence to tradition rather than purely DIY approaches, so to make use of all the technologies available to adherents when they \"adhere in the prescribed manner\" to a specific tradition's methods and overall praxis. My consciousness-altering practices have included daily thinking and feeling, hatha yoga, deity yoga, as well as, in general, \"focusing\" and \"opening up\" meditation techniques. A few experiences with psychedelics have given brief but deep insights (back in late adolescence) and helped with my healing from some life losses. Overall, I've had the chance to experience good and very simple/easy experiences in a range of religious and contemplative traditions, including ones that involve others in ritual Mapping the Structural Core of Human Cerebral CortexIn the long run, old and new psychoactive substances will likely serve as excellent empirical telescopes to better understand the mind and consciousness both at the level of mental-health effects and the level of examining the \"nature and architecture\" of consciousness.

Pat and Dave KrajovicThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 68 spaces/movements/chants/mesmerizations (such as Roman Catholic Mass, Krishna/ Vaishnaivaite celebrations, Buddhist ceremonies, Muslim prayers, Sufi circles, Zen sitting, Sikh ceremonies). However, most of my personal practices (in the past and now) are personal, quiet or musical \"alone time,\" in nature or in a quiet room. Sufi poems and Krishna scriptures such as the Gita were especially useful in pointing out the immanence of a transcendental reality and \"personality.\" Music has played a pivotal role, for achieving some minor trances and ecstasies. The most important work has been that which one tries to get done day in, day out, chopping wood, carrying water. Or in my case, chopping self and spilling water, all mostly by accident! I encourage readers to embrace their extremely rich global heritage in terms of contemplative practices, communities, and experiences. We don't have to know it all or explore it all, but it is our cross-cultural treasure chest. And we can also certainly build new traditions, both collective and personal. However, I think it's our duty to know our global contemplative heritage, as a path to better understanding the diversity of possible \"interior spaces and lives\" that \"others\" might experience. In the same sense, understanding a culture's literary canon (Shakespeare, the Mahabarata) can provide new eyes into the lived realities of minds and hearts from \"other\" places, as well as our own \"internal\" and \"subjective\" realities. Overall, for good long-term personal progress, I believe it's best to be connected with a particular tradition with a specific set of practices, and a community of \"practitioners\" is important for a healthy spiritual life. However No Guru, No Method, No Teacher can certainly work well for some percentage of the population, regardless of the spiritual culture they may have been born into. It's fascinating to hear how dynamic and diverse your background is. And what a keen sense of humor you bring to bear on this subject. We are all chopping ourselves and spilling water, indeed! Every day. Blindsided by life, every day. Returning to the Center for Consciousness Science, anesthesia research has gone on for a very long time. Can you succinctly describe for us how the anesthesia research going on at CCS is qualitatively different from much of the previous research, or from much of the current research in anesthesiology that is unrelated to \"consciousness studies\"? Brain and cognitive research into the many forms and effects of anesthesia is only a few decades old and will likely take many more decades to achieve to deliver on the promise of providing some major theory about consciousness. Each center for consciousness, as the field is so young, reflects the core interests of the leaders of those centers. The research at the CCS is unique in part because it focuses on the specifics of brain activity before, during, and after anesthesia in healthy humans, and because of our focus on examining brain network dynamics using advanced computational methods (e.g., systems-level and dynamical-systems analyses). The CCS network of collaborators do both similar and different studies in the realm of neuroscientifically-oriented anesthesia research. Can you illuminate our readers on what blobology is, how it is analogous, in a sense, to phrenology of the 19th century?Blobology is not a scientific term and just refers to the tendency to dumb down refined scientific findings into something like the following statement: \"this lit-up blob in the fMRI picture represents 'fear' or 'language.'\" This kind of localism is false, as brain activity is usually ongoing throughout various brain networks, and no brain process occurs independently as some kind of isolated blob of activity. The isolated blob is usually just a peak at the signal, and does not reflect the full complex picture. There are also other problems that have to do with mis-reading current scientific findings about brain activity, which altogether are not always that clear or decisive. Overall we are still far from really understanding the nature of brain function and direct links to cognition. The field of research is currently often called Brain Mapping or Brain Imaging, and in many ways we are still far from Brain Explaining. Phrenology was similar to blobology as it focused on trying to link the morphology of the skull to specific mental traits. Even though Walt Whitman may have decided to be a poet because he visited phrenologists in lower Manhattan, phrenology was pseudo-science, and we should always remain wary of trends in over-simplified popular models of brain-behavior explanations. Can you tell us about two or three other interesting research projects going on at CCS? One involves neuromolecular dynamics during and after anesthesia. Another is impact of anesthesia on delirium and recovery in adults. Another is tracking awareness and brain dynamics during and after operations. As well as computational modelling of brain networks during transitions between consciousness and unconsciousness. And can you tell us a bit about Dr. Chestek's NIH grant through the Brain Initiative having to do with mapping \"the circuitry of the brain and how individual neurons communicate with one another\"? Yes, this is fascinating work and I encourage readers to learn about her work from their lab website, chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu. In brief, Dr. Chestek is one of the only U-M investigators to receive direct Brain Initiative funding for her work on arrays of electrodes that can sit directly on the brain surface in order to more directly measure the dynamics of neuronal ensembles. It is this kind of work, in alignment with needs outlined by the Brain Initiative, which will push our understanding of brain function and communication further. I see that Dr. Mashour gave a talk last year, in Ann Arbor, on the \"psychedelic brain.\" What was he covering in that talk? The talk was about the history of psychedelic culture, research, and propaganda, with a focus on LSD. Dr. Mashour emphasized some of the recent work from Dr. Robin-Carhart Harris and colleagues in the U.K. on brain dynamics during psilocybin, and some of the work on ketamine being done at University of Michigan. What is happening in the area of contemplative studies around the country? Succinctly, how are contemplative studies programs at places like Brown University and University of Virginia interfacing with the purer science approach being taken at CCS? And what else do you regard as exciting and worth noting in what is happening in the new contemplative studies programs that have sprouted forth? This is an interesting topic that is still in development. Essentially, faculty, departments, and funders get together and form centers around their core interests. It's also likely we have a lot more researchers now in academia than 30 years ago who've had strong experiences with transpersonal psychology, altered states, meditation, contemplation, yoga, and/or other religious or mystical practices. There is also a strong interdisciplinary trend in contemplative studies and science. Most of these centers are associated with at least several empirical data-driven researchers that use modern psychological and neuroscience methods, as well as scholars of religion, mindfulness education, death and dying, history, literature, and other topics. My view is that within a few years we'll see more formal agendas from these centers rather that what currently looks like a patchwork quilt of common interests. The most important thing about these centers is that they serve as a meeting place for interested minds and dialoguing. These are nutritive contexts for the next generation of empirical research into contemplative techniques. At the University of Virginia site for its contemplative studies program, much is made of the concept of \"disciplined interiority.\" What does it mean, what is its application in the real world, and is your own research concerned, also, with disciplined interiority? Are you seeking to isolate the ingredient/s present for an experienced meditator or shaman or yogic master? At the CCS, we want to track the dimensions, contours, and changes of subjective (phenomenological) experience, an important goal for consciousness science. In the case of our studies with contemplative practitioners, we are looking to \"get data\" The Crazy Wisdom Journal Interview with Dr. Tarik Bel-Bahar Continued from page 67 Dr. Uncheol Lee is the Associate Director of CCS The idea [with the ASC self-report platform] is that millions of practitioners (and teachers) at yoga, meditation, and other mind-body centers can \"share\" data to get a clearer empirical picture of what's happening as a result of mind-body practices.Y es, I've had a few experiences in my life with a few specific traditions, with a focus primarily on hatha yoga and ritual- devotional yoga. As I assume many others Crazy Wisdom readers do, I practice a DIY amalgam based on my own brew of experiences, teachers, loves, and sorrows.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 69 about instances where people are \"presumed\" to be in specific well-practiced states of so-called \"disciplined interiority.\" This concept is considered by some to refer to what happens during meditation and contemplation in general. I don't really agree with such views, but concepts can be helpful organizing forces in new fields. It's associated with an inward focus, and relates to the internal, subjective, and phenomenological aspects of experience, and draws to some degree from depth psychology. This kind of disciplined interiority is presumably something that occurs with contemplative practitioners who spend a long-time practicing it, or in general with people who try to really get strong and grounded feel for their internal experiences. It is also presumably the primary focus of centers of education and research with a contemplative focus, to advance disciplined interiority. However, I'm not sure that there is yet a testable theoretical empirical model of disciplined interiority that we can refer to here. As a simple example, let's consider a brief mindfulness program for war veterans that have P .T.S.D. A brief training course in a clinical version of mindfulness should lead to some greater awareness and control of one's \"interiority,\" and thus perhaps increased emotion regulation. Another example could be a research protocol where individuals are asked to pay close attention to their emotional states over short periods of time in the lab, thus fleshing out the dimensions and temporal dynamics of their own affective phenomenology. Presumably this is part of what happens in contemplative training, where one comes to know the ups and downs of one's inner life quite well. You said to me that within the field of consciousness studies, meditation researchers are not the integrative medicine researchers who are not the contemplative studies researchers who are not the mindfulness researchers, and so on. Tell us about the continuum within consciousness studies (between pure research and research with realistic applications). There is no perfect continuum, but it would be safe to say that it consists of several dimensions, including medical treatment focus, experimental psychology focus, pro-meditation focus, and psychometric focus. And there is certainly overlap in those researchers that you mentioned. However, in general, there are also unclear definitions about mindfulness and meditation that abound in the scientific literature, and low quality in a lot of previous studies, problems that are only just beginning to change. Thus the context is not solid, and the field is still somewhat nascent and fragmented. In terms of the consciousness studies field, it's a very diverse field, ranging from experimental neuroscience with animals and humans, to theories about mysticism and the nature of mind, to distance healing, and to robotics, AI, machine-learning, virtual-reality, and futurism. The realism (and empiricism) also depends on one's stance, training, and values. Scientists would tend to focus on theories and data, therapists tend to focus on treatments and outcomes, and engineers tend to focus on building new tools. Although it's a complex mix, one can easily look to more well-established fields to see that the trend is towards integrating pure research with translational applications. In the case of contemplative science, it's such a young field that pure first-questions research is probably the best approach to take. However, due to the way federal research funding works, most researchers have to modify their approaches so as to somehow make them useful or novel (for example, focusing on treating depression, eating disorders, or addictions; or working with athletes, military personnel, or seniors). You and others from CCS attended a major conference in Tucson, called \"Toward a Science of Consciousness,\" in Spring 2016, is that correct? Can you share two or three highlights of the conference? The CCS co-funded and helped organize this important annual conference. It was an exciting conference that is inclusive to many different kinds of thinkers and groups, including non-scientists from the public, with presentations ranging from across philosophical, psychological, spiritual, and technological approaches. The primary speakers included Dr. Mashour and Dr. Hudetz from the CCS, who both talked about major types of empirical approaches to consciousness. Several of the other speakers included world leaders representing major approaches to consciousness science, including Stan Dehaene speaking on his theory of the Global Neuronal Workspace of Consciousness, Anil Seth speaking about how prediction plays a major role in consciousness, and Robin Carhart-Harris speaking about his research into psychedelics. There were also a range of non-science activities including meditation groups, live music, and great \"consciousness\" parties. I was especially moved regarding the sense of community and togetherness I felt there compared to more mainstream psychological and neuroscience conferences. I understand that a Neuroscience Graduate Program course on consciousness was taught here at U-M recently, and another one is in the works? What department at the University is the course associated with, or is at the Medical School, or where? And what are the prerequisites for taking that course? Yes, Dr. Mashour was the first to develop a course in the Neuroscience Graduate Program that focused on consciousness. This past fall we had another iteration of this seminar that consisted of reviews of major new research work and theories in consciousness. There are few prerequisites besides being matriculated, and several attendees are interested non-students from the campus or community. I understand that CCS recently hosted a one-day symposium on \"Altered States of Consciousness.\" Please tell us about who the keynote speakers was, and what were the other highlights? The Center for Consciousness Science hosted a one-day symposium on \"Altered States of Consciousness\" this past August in the U-M Rackham Amphitheatre. The symposium was open to the public and is the first in a series. Invited speakers discussed diverse altered states of consciousness, including the psychedelic experience, ketamine anesthesia, emergence from unconsciousness, and near death experiences. Keynote speaker Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, Imperial College London, discussed his outstanding work on the basic action and effects of psychedelics. Additional speakers included George Mashour, Jimo Borjigin (University of Michigan), Alex Proekt (University of Pennsylvania), Ben Palanca (Washington University), My consciousness-altering practices have included daily thinking and feeling, hatha yoga, deity yoga, as well as, in general, \"focusing\" and \"opening up\" meditation techniques. Bill Zirinsky: Tell us about the continuum within consciousness studies (between pure research and research with realistic applications)? Tarik Bel-Bahar: There is no perfect continuum, but it would be safe to say that it consists of several dimensions, including medical treatment focus, experimental psychology focus, pro-meditation focus, and psychometric focus.Overall, I've had the chance to experience good and very simple/easy experiences in a range of religious and contemplative traditions, including ones that involve others in ritual spaces/movements/chants/ mesmerizations (such as Roman Catholic Mass, Krishna/ Vaishnaivaite celebrations, Buddhist ceremonies, Muslim prayers, Sufi circles, Zen sitting, Sikh ceremonies). Continued on page 70The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 70 The Crazy Wisdom Journal Interview with Dr. Tarik Bel-Bahar Continued from page 69 Andrew McKinstry-Wu (University of Pennsylvania), and Dinesh Pal (University of Michigan). Some highlights included Carhart-Harris' reports on his ground-breaking work on brain dynamics and entropy during psychedelic experience, as well as a small recent study examining the possibility of positive effects of LSD for depression. Dr. Borjigin talked about her innovative work in rats looking at the interaction of heart and brain dynamics during death, providing fascinating insights into how the body attempts to protect itself during serious physical trauma, and how heart, brain, and body systems are coordinated in more ordinary states of consciousness. Other presenters focused on understanding acetylcholine-based arousal systems as a method to perhaps facilitate awakening from anesthesia (Dr. Pal), as well as reports from our multi-center work on neural aspects of anesthesia (Drs. Pallanca and McKinstry-Wu). I noticed that one study at the CCS was about neurophysiological coherence and connectivity in the dying brain. So I asked you about that, and was disheartened, in my naivet\u00e9, to learn that it was an experiment on rats. I understand the practical and ethical and spiritual problems inherent in doing tests on human beings who are dying. But, one day, it sure would be interesting to understand more about \"neurophysiological coherence and connectivity in the dying brain\" especially in the dying brains of those long-time yogis and Zen masters and shamans, in the dying brains of those who say they're reached a state of non-duality, an \"awakened state.\" Can you envision the steps to get there? Any ideas of what we might find? Studies about brain activity during death in humans are possible, it just requires really fine-tuned and humane protocols that work with medical patients that are near death, for example, during advanced stages of cancer. In terms of working with long-time contemplation experts, this would take a lot of specialized hunting down of older experts and having them agree to have brain recordings done around the time of death. One way do this kind of research would be to work with collaborators in hospices and therapists focused on thanatology. One can also imagine a future where most people have their bio-signals recorded via wearable or implanted technology across the lifespan from birth to death. It's hard to know what we would find, because we don't know exactly what happens in typical humans who are not contemplation experts. Let's imagine that the self, memory, expectations, and other features of the brain-mind have been expunged or totally transformed in experts. Let's imagine that experts have somehow connected and merged (temporarily or permanently) with a fundamental matrix of life or consciousness. One simple hypothesis is that, as a result of beliefs and practices over many decades, experts simply would not have brain dynamics related to death that we see in typical humans. The \"death\" of the personal consciousness and body in experts could look very different, or completely \"still\" or \"usual.\" In another sense, it very much depends on the tradition too, as each set of practices emphasizes differing beliefs, realities, selves, and notions of death and after-life. This last point is also important in understanding that most contemplative practices might only be \"correctly practiced\" if they are practiced by individuals fully embedded in the culture and beliefs associated with those particular contemplative practices. This represents a culture-first view that is odds with the de-contextualized and DIY approach of many western contemplative practitioners who believe that they are \"correctly practicing\" a particular set of techniques. Thank you for collaborating on this, Tarik. Finally, what's most personally meaningful to you about the work you've been doing at CCS? Having a chance to grow professionally in an interdisciplinary center, and helping answer basic questions about the nature, architecture, and dynamics of human awareness and consciousness. Contributing to novel and much-needed studies regarding psychological and brain dynamics during practice of contemplative techniques known to generate specific Altered States of Consciousness. Thanks, Bill. Thank you, Tarik. ###However, most of my personal practices (in the past and now) are personal, quiet or musical \"alone time, \" in nature or in a quiet room. Sufi poems and Krishna scriptures such as the Gita were especially useful in pointing out the immanence of a transcendental reality and \"personality. \" Music has played a pivotal role, for achieving some minor trances and ecstasies.

Years ago in one of my parenting classes, a father shared a story about getting triggered when his 10-year-old son went to bed without turning off the family room light. (For reasons of confidentiality, the details of this story have been combined from similar exchanges and do not represent one person.) Accosted by the glare of that bulb, Dad stormed up to his son's bedroom, shook him awake, marched him down to that switch, and stood menacingly over him until the light got turned off. After complying, his son - angry, hurt, and dejected - stormed back off to bed. The following days found Dad flipping from being mad at himself for his intense reaction to feeling anger toward his son for \"making\" him lose it. This pattern had not started with that one event, and by the next class, Dad was committed to digging deeper to find new approaches. We started with the question: what did you make that infraction mean? What triggers one person may not trigger another because it's not the source, but a person's relationship to that source that matters. These relationships usually start when we are young and are formed by various factors, including: our personal sensitivities to stress and anxiety; vulnerabilities within our personal connections; trauma; and current situations that overwhelm our abilities. Beneath these factors, though, what becomes a trigger ultimately stems from underlying beliefs, expectations, and values that are limiting, faulty, unreasonable, rigid, or overly simplistic. Most of these limiting beliefs are some variation of one theme, that the world (circumstances, ourselves, others, the weather, and so on) should be a certain way. Usually a way that makes life work easier, where people know and do what we need them to do. The attachment to this belief gets us in trouble. If the world was the way it was supposed to be, it would do X, Y , and Z. For this dad, it might have looked like: If my son respected and appreciated my hard work, he would not leave the light on (EVER). If I was a good parent, my son would be doing what he was told. Then later: If I was a good parent, I would not have lost it so badly. Deeper discussion about Dad's own childhood unearthed more understanding about where some of those beliefs originated, as he recounted his own dad being even more fanatical with rules and using corporal punishment to teach compliance. When asked to get in touch with his 10-year-old self, Dad recalled how worthless he felt when he couldn't live up to his father's expectations. Recognizing that he was passing on this sense of inadequacy to his own son, Dad set about detangling himself from this trigger and its origins. He reframed this incident to mean that his son, as a 10-year-old boy, was naturally a work in progress, and just did not have this habit down yet. He also expanded his vision of his son to see that he was bigger than this one flaw, bringing a sense of acceptance and more wholeness to who his son was. Dad was also invited to give himself permission to see his own 10-year-old self in the same way, rather than the way his father portrayed his mistakes. Beyond this reframing, Dad used impartial data to challenge his limiting belief that his son was costing him lots of money. In researching this, he discovered that it cost about one penny for an hour of forgetfulness. Gaining this bigger perspective, while still wanting to instill a good habit in his son, Dad was able to find more patience and forgiveness. Finally, we talked about the reasonable belief that creating good habits is best started young, and being conscientious about the electric bill is a good lesson to learn. Moving forward, Dad came at that task from a very different place; still sometimes frustrated and impatient with the amount of success, but working hard to notice improvement in both his son and his own reactions, and replacing his triggered energy with logical and natural consequences. (I believe it was 25 cents an infraction, which led to a great discussion on interest versus principal!) All parents are tasked with not only trying to bring their A game to parenting, but to support their children to do the same. The good news is that even without direct instruction, research has shown that children stay calmer, more present, and more positively engaged when parents and other adults strive for at least a B and practice what they would like to be preaching about this skill. With that dual role in mind, here are some steps to support both parents and their charges in this pursuit. Preventing Triggering Before It Starts Know what your Bigger self looks like.Being Bigger than your triggers means keeping your Bigger self (and your goals, beliefs, intentions, and values) informing your actions and reactions so that the world has less power to distract you from your wiser course. Consider: Do you want to be reasonable, respectful, kind, fair, smart, grateful, honest? Someone who doesn't lose your sense of humor? Someone who does not let trigger sources hijack you so easily? Someone who is kind to yourself when you trip up? Someone who has faith that both you and your children can learn? Contemplating what you want your Bigger self to look like - whether through discussion, journaling, or list making - can help in knowing what to bring when it's crunch time. Be thoughtful with the challenges you bring into your life (or your child's day). Prevention starts with being mindful of what you choose to take on; noticing when there may be too many situations that are overly prone to triggering; noticing hot spots such as transitions or times of day that are adding extra vulnerabilities to losing it. Work with the environment and temperament you (and your child) have. Finding just the right level of challenge where success is possible. Teach. With your children, teach awareness of these concepts. Books, TV, movies, and observations of others are wonderful for finding examples of people grappling with their Bigger and triggered selves. Use analogies of games like Pokemon, Magic: the Gathering, checkers, or chess where you have to counter moves or attacks with different (bigger) moves or skills. The Blind Men and the Elephant is great story for teaching perspective, as are examples of you or your child growing and learning. \"Remember last year when you couldn't read that word, ride a bike, drive that car?\" The poem Autobiography in Five Short Chapters by Portia Nelson is phenomenal for appreciating growth. Teach also about the body and what happens physiologically when it (the limbic system specifically) gets triggered. Intervention in the Midst of Being Triggered Notice your body, your urges, and your thoughts.The mind and body feed off each other. The body influences the mind and visa versa. A racing heart may tell you that you are in danger. Believing you are in danger may trigger the body to increase your heart rate, and so on. Noticing involves becoming aware of yourself, of any physiological sensations that point to being triggered. Consider where you first sense a trigger response. Is it in your chest or your breathing? In clenched fists or sweaty palms? Do your facial expressions say it all? What urges show up? (For example, the urge to run, hit, yell, shut down, sleep, quit, put your child in his or her place, and so on.) What becomes a trigger ultimately stems from underlying beliefs, expectations, and values that are limiting, faulty, unreasonable, rigid, or overly simplistic. All parents are tasked with not only trying to bring their \"A\" game to parenting, but to support their children to do the same. The good news is that even without direct instruction, research has shown that children stay calmer, more present, and more positively engaged when parents and other adults strive for at least a \"B\" and practice what they would like to be preaching about this skill.Prevention starts with being mindful of what you choose to take on; noticing when there may be too many situations that are overly prone to triggering; noticing hot spots such as transitions or times of day that are adding extra vulnerabilities to losing it. Before working to remember that you actually can handle the world's imperfections, it is super valuable to grieve for a second. Letting go of the world in your head that knows what you need and does what you want warrants acknowledgment.How to Help Children be Bigger Than Their TriggersThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 73 The earlier you can notice that your warning system has been activated, the more options you have to intervene without falling all the way into that hole. (Note: If your trigger source is trauma-related, it will likely be more resistant to this kind of cognitive guidance. Please consider working with a professional to find deeper opportunities for healing.) First BREATHE... Breathe... breathe... ahhhh... Then grieve. Before working to remember that you actually can handle the world's imperfections, it is super valuable to grieve for a second. Letting go of the world in your head that knows what you need and does what you want warrants acknowledgment. Yes, it would be really nice if it always worked that way. Yes, it is disappointing that you are having to deal with a less cooperative, more stressful version than you would like. Taking a minute to notice this can actually be incredible for freeing up the space you need to deal with that less than idyllic world, person, or situation. Ask yourself: what am I making this mean? And can I make it mean something else? Remind yourself of a limiting belief that might be feeding your downward slide. Work to make that trigger source mean something much smaller, more do-able, more momentary, less devastating, and less personal. And certainly don't take this moment as any proof that you are not a wonderful, valuable, lovable person - flaws, imperfections, and all. Hold yourself or (within reason) your child to do the least amount of damage possible. Being triggered isn't a free pass to wreak havoc. Work to separate the urge to fight or run away from the action. Support a challenge mindset. Challenge yourself to own how you distorted the threat. Challenge your thoughts. Challenge your limiting belief. Challenge yourself with data. Challenge your disconnect between the Bigger person you want to be and your actions and reactivity now. See your trigger source as the very opportunity to challenge yourself to rise above it. And especially challenge yourself to learn something for next time. After an Episode (and Before the Next One) Hold yourself (or your child) accountable. Hold yourself accountable for your words and actions, and when appropriate, make amends for any damage you've done while being triggered. For your child, teach from a reasonable place, and hold him or her accountable for their triggered selves while asking them to work on getting beyond that triggering response. Here's where reasonable, learning-focused consequences can be an especially valuable part of the growth process. Dig deeper into limiting beliefs. And challenge yourself to grow them into bigger wisdom. Remember: your Bigger self tells you that these limiting beliefs are a trap that takes you away from the very person you want to be. Challenge unreasonable expectations of yourself (perfection?) and your children (think age, temperament, and situational challenges that might limit abilities). Also check that your values have not become rigid \"shoulds.\" Grow perspective. First, validate your own and your child's valid perspectives. Then seek to reach beyond them without making it an either/or set up. Practice strength-spotting. Noticing incremental improvement is the best way to keep energized for learning and growing. Did you (or your child) last longer before getting triggered, or not dig such a deep hole, or fall so far? Maybe you (or your child) got untriggered more quickly, easily, or smartly, or didn't berate yourself as much for getting caught in the first place. Practice spotting these strengths to keep encouragement and energy high. Offer self-compassion (and compassion for your child). Learning the traits and skills of Being Bigger is a lifelong pursuit and a daily practice. No one is ever finished with this pursuit, just as no one is ever finished needing water to sustain themselves. It helps to remember this wisdom when being hard on yourself or your child for getting triggered yet again. Replace harsh judgment with understanding, lightness, and a curiosity for learning. Learn for next time, and teach this to your child. Because: oops, you're triggered again. But maybe this time it is just a little less.

Being triggered means: Reacting to the world (person, situation) as if it is against you. Responding physiologically to a perceived threat by releasing various hormones, altering breathing patterns and heart rate, and preparing the body for action (to fight, flee, freeze or submit in order to survive). Having your thoughts and emotions hijacked by fear and self-preservation (literally losing your mind as the limbic system takes over). Taking actions based on your go-to survival strategies (think of the survival strategies of animals from lions, tigers, and bears to deer, rabbits, chameleons, possums, snakes, turtles, and so on). Losing the ability to appreciate the temporariness of the state you are in. Losing the ability to keep the current threat in a bigger perspective in terms of importance over time, the bigger picture, and nuances. Losing the ability to appreciate that, when triggered, you should question your ability to accurately judge the threat. Examples of Limiting Beliefs along with their wiser alternatives: Limiting Belief: Life should be fair. Bigger Belief: Life isn't really fair, but fair does feel better. Limiting Belief: Kids should do their chores without being told, talk respectfully, think of others, be grateful, tell the truth, and so on.Bigger Belief: It feels better when kids do their chores without being told, talk respectfully, think of others, are grateful, tell the truth, and so on. Limiting Belief: Things should go according to plan. Bigger Belief: Going as planned is nice, but often unlikely, and being ready for unforeseen circumstances is really useful. Unplanned can have advantages, too. Examples of Strength-Spotting: You lasted longer before getting triggered or didn't dig such a deep hole or fall so far. You got untriggered more quickly, easily, or smartly. You showed persistence in trying a new solution. You showed a good sense of humor for your setback. You showed self-compassion or didn't berate yourself so much for getting triggered. You owned your triggered behavior and made amends. You worked to uncover a limiting belief so that you will not repeat the same pattern in the future. You turned that trigger source into an opportunity to fortify and practice your Bigger self, thereby making it stronger and even wiser.Challenge yourself to own how you distorted the threat. Challenge your thoughts. Challenge your limiting belief. Challenge yourself with data. Challenge your disconnect between the Bigger person you want to be and your actions and reactivity now.

Main St., Ann Arbor 734.665.2757 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 74 New , Fun , and Just Plain Cool The University of Michigan Museum of Art's Family ProgramsBy Cathy Gorga Some of the coolest places to take kids are the ones you wouldn't necessarily think of. Sure, there are parks and playgrounds and children's museums \u2014 but have you considered an art museum? And specifically, the University of Michigan Museum of Art? It may not be a place for running and screaming, but UMMA is the perfect venue for kids to explore history and cultures, to exercise their active observation skills, and to develop their own creative processes, all in the company of 20,000 master artworks. Lisa Borgsdorf is the manager of public programs at UMMA, and it's her job to find ways for members of the community, from teenagers to university students to parents and children, to engage with the museum's extensive collection. She coordinates film screenings, concerts, artist talks, and more, all with the goals of, as she put it, \"giving you lots of reasons to come...and reducing barriers to access to the arts.\" Certainly not every program at UMMA is child-friendly, but families are absolutely a primary target audience for the museum. In the past, UMMA had participated in Ann Arbor Family Days, where roughly a dozen campus and downtown organizations offered family-friendly events for a weekend. While that was well received, UMMA wanted to offer regular family-specific activities in lieu of participating in a once-a-year event. To that end, they have developed two programs in the past few years that are for parents and children together: Storytime and the Family Art Studio. During Storytime, which is held nearly every month for children ages four to seven and their parents, families listen to a story while gathered in front of a particular work of art that's related to the story. Afterwards, everyone heads to the multi-purpose room for an activity, combining a hands-on component with the sitting-still-and-listening aspect. Borgsdorf noted how enlightening the Storytime programs were for not only the kids, but their parents, too: \"Parents don't know everything; they're learning also [about the artwork]. And they're learning about ways they can talk with their kids about art, or just creative ways to engage in the space.\" Storytime has proven very successful and well attended, said Borgsdorf, \"and we found that families really responded to the intimate format, the opportunity to interact together in age-appropriate ways in the gallery.\" Many Storytime events are led by U-M student docents reading the stories, which has been a highlight of the program from Borgsdorf's perspective: \"It really has helped us engage two target age groups, Michigan students and area families.\" The UMMA staff knew they wanted to incorporate more family programs, and the perfect chance presented itself in the winter of 2014. The museum was hosting a Doris Duke art collection, which turned out to be especially \"rich in terms of its opportunities for programming,\" Borgsdorf remembered. Duke was an heiress and philanthropist who, through her extensive world travels, cultivated a collection of vibrant, colorful, eye-catching pieces. The staff recognized how children especially could be drawn in to the collection: \"Not every exhibition wants a family program to go with it, but this one did.\" So they piloted the first Family Art Studio, which is for children ages six and up along with their parents. Family Art Studios last about two hours. Docents begin by leading a 20- to 30-minute \"gallery experience,\" which is a focused tour of the works (either in one exhibition or throughout the museum's collection) that are related to the day's theme. The docent leading the gallery experience helps children and parents alike critically examine the artworks, finding ways to connect what they're seeing with the project they'll be doing afterwards. Borgsdorf explained, \"We probably spend more time talking about colors, patterns, decoration, shape, composition, symmetry \u2014 things like that, without being really formal about it.\" They sometimes give the kids clipboards with paper so they can make notes and sketch ideas during the tour, all to bring as a reference into the studio. At the same time, the docents are \"making connections between the art and everyday life\" with the families. During an African mask workshop the museum held, the conversation centered around rites of passage from adolescence to adulthood, as that's what the masks represented. The docent asked the families to think about \"moments in life that we celebrate that mark time,\" like birthdays and bar or bat mitzvahs \u2014 which, as Borgsdorf mentioned, not only connects them to the art but is also a nice way for families to reflect on their own traditions and memories. Following the gallery tour, the families participate in a 90-minute hands-on project, typically facilitated by local artists. The projects could be anything from clay works to African masks to creating mythical creatures. These project sessions at UMMA are unique for a couple reasons. First, many museums have drop-in spaces, but UMMA's Family Art Studios are facilitated by experts, allowing parents to enjoy the experience alongside their children as another adult takes the lead. Borgsdorf pointed out that this kind of shared activity is rare for families these days; it's hard to find family activities where the parent doesn't have to act primarily as the facilitator or supervisor. \"Parents don't know everything; they're learning also [about the artwork]. And they're learning about ways they can talk with their kids about art, or just creative ways to engage in the space.\" -Lisa Borgsdorf, UMMA Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community \"In terms of kids, you hope that you're building over time a comfort level and positive associations and reasons to make art museums and art an ongoing part of their lives.\" -Lisa Borgsdorf, UMMAThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 75 To encourage parent participation, UMMA provides project materials for everyone. \"Sometimes the projects are very specifically collaborative,\" said Borgsdorf, and participants create something together as a family. Other times, participants do individual projects, but are checking in with one another about color choices or how to do a certain step. Borgsdorf said that \"some parents don't participate\" in the projects, which is fine, too: \"We're allowing for a range of family interaction styles. You can be your family unit, however you are, and find a way that it's meaningful to you.\" Borgsdorf is fully aware that the idea of bringing children to an art museum can be a bit intimidating for parents: \"I remember when my kids were that age, and being here can be really exciting \u2014 big tall spaces, that sort of open architecture, and it has that feeling of specialness.\" She then laughed and said, \"At the same time, you're like, 'I hope it's not my kid that goes and sticks their finger through the painting!'\" That's exactly why the family programs at UMMA are structured the way they are, so that there are focused experiences at the art museum. She described them as developmentally appropriate opportunities where parents and kids are \"creating connections and access points with the collection and with the exhibitions.\" The docents, Borgsdorf mentioned, are especially skilled at finding ways for kids to feel connected to the artworks without physically touching them \u2014 for example, by encouraging kids to use their imaginations and think about being inside the art: \"What do you think it sounds like? What do you think it smells like? It's cool because it works with your senses through your imagination, rather than your actual senses.\" UMMA recently increased the frequency of their family programs, thanks to funding from the University of Michigan Credit Union. Borgsdorf said the increase will help them reach even more families, since their Storytimes and Family Art Studios are frequently full. This advances UMMA's belief in the value of exposing children (and adults) to the arts, in part to help us all become more informed global citizens. As Borgsdorf said, \"Part of what's exciting and valuable about [the arts] is the way they provide us a window onto the world. You can learn about other cultures, you can gain perspective of yourself and your place on the planet.\" When families are discussing artworks, either in Storytime or in the Family Art Studios, they wonder together about the artists and the subjects, and what their lives may have been like, which \"builds some of the empathy and desire to work beyond just yourself in the world,\" Borgsdorf said. That's exactly why the chief goal of UMMA's family programs is engagement, versus specific learning goals about, say, art history. They've found that the learning comes naturally with repeated, regular exposure: \"In terms of kids, you hope that you're building over time a comfort level and positive associations and reasons to make art museums and art an ongoing part of their lives.\" The next Storytimes will be on Saturday, January 21, and Saturday, February 18; the next Family Art Studios will be on Saturday, January 14, and Saturday, February 11.

Of course, there was the fact that you were away from the classroom for a morning, but you probably also loved the opportunity to be outside, see cool animals, and get your hands dirty. The Junior Naturalist Program, run through Washtenaw County Parks and Recreation, incorporates those most idyllic parts of outdoor ed into regularly scheduled, hands-on nature discovery programs for young explorers. Led by park naturalists, the program offers year-round opportunities for kids, ages seven to twelve, to dive a little deeper into nature, going beyond a simple trail walk \u2014 and all at no cost to participants. Kelsey Bolda, a naturalist who's been with the park systems for about six years, said that she and the other Parks and Rec naturalists have developed a huge variety of individual programs, covering topics like animal tracking, vernal pools, bees, snowflakes, and wilderness survival. When brainstorming the program's content and curriculum, Bolda explained, \"We all sit down and say, 'What are we passionate about?'\" The naturalists understand that their passion will be contagious. \"For me, I was super pumped \u2014 I know, that's the nerdy side of me \u2014 [about] skulls.\" And so a skull identification session was slotted in, where children learn to examine bone structure and teeth to figure out what animal a skull came from. Bolda is an enthusiastic outdoor educator who remembers being thrilled to learn that she could cultivate a career dedicated to teaching others about nature. When she started working with the Junior Naturalist Program, it ran during the summers only. Recently, though, they expanded it to year-round, reflecting not only increasing interest, but also the range of environmental activities that are accessible during the colder months. Every few Saturdays, a group of about ten kids gathers at a predetermined location, usually a county park like Parker Mill or Independence Lake. The naturalist leading the session begins with an introduction. For example, Bolda said, during their stream ecology lesson, \"We'll give a brief introduction of what is a stream, what kinds of things live in the stream, and here's how we're going to go about exploring the stream.\" For the next hour and a half, the kids \u2014 armed with nets, journals, and data sheets \u2014 are immersed in the details and beauty of nature. They come back together at the end to share their findings and review what they learned.While parents can drop their children off for the programs, Bolda said that many choose to stay. \"I think a lot of times they stay because they love it, too, and they're actually learning things.\" During the wilderness survival lesson, participants hike into the woods with the naturalist and imagine a storm is imminent. How could they stay dry? What kind of shelter could they build with only the materials available in their surroundings? \"I think parents do find it fascinating \u2014 like, how is my kid going to get through this? What would they do if a thunderstorm was about to roll in and they didn't have the right materials?\" It's a unique opportunity to not only learn about nature themselves but also to watch their children's critical thinking skills in action. For those reasons, Bolda said, parents tend to stick around. Parents are also excited to give their kids a chance to engage in expert-led nature discovery outside of the school setting. While the Washtenaw County Parks and Rec naturalists lead frequent school field trips, Bolda acknowledged that budget constraints in many schools make field trips increasingly difficult. She personally believes it's critical \"to provide that outlet for kids that really want to know what's going on in the world around them.\" She once conducted a survey for her own school project that revealed a broad lack of awareness about issues like endangered species. As a naturalist, she said, that was disheartening. Via the Junior Naturalist Program, Bolda takes advantage of every opportunity to inspire a love of the wild in children, which is often sparked by their hands-on interactions with nature. In the middle of the woods, they'll discover everything from tracks to skulls to scat \u2014 memorable encounters for their target age range. \"[They] end up loving it. Instead of just sitting inside watching cartoons, here you are looking at poop! And they get to pick it apart, and you can see fur and bones. It's thrilling.\" Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Junior Naturalist Program ...Parks and Rec naturalists have developed a huge variety of individual programs, covering topics like animal tracking, vernal pools, bees, snowflakes, and wilderness survival. During the wilderness survival lesson, participants hike into the woods with the naturalist and imagine a storm is imminent. How could they stay dry?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 77 Bolda especially appreciates witnessing the moment when a Junior Naturalist participant falls in love with nature. During the vernal pools lesson, kids find and hold tiny pool dwellers like salamanders, often for the first time. Bolda said their eyes light up as they experience a \"tangible item instead of a photo in a book,\" and she recognizes the significance of that moment: \"It's so exciting to see that spark and to hope that even just that one encounter will lead to something \u2014 to, 'Well, now I care about salamanders. Now I want to make sure good things happen for salamanders.'\" Although the participants are typically excited to return for more sessions, Bolda and her colleagues developed a Junior Naturalist certification program to encourage ongoing participation. All participants earn a badge for each program they attend, and after earning four, they're considered certified Junior Naturalists and are eligible for a prize. Bolda's prize bucket is stocked with high-quality naturalist tools, such as drawstring backpacks, scientific journals, magnifying glasses, flashlights, and more. Kids can even earn badges by attending certain adult programs offered through Parks and Rec, such as the Monarchs and Milkweed hike, which is helpful if Saturday mornings don't always work for a particular family. In addition, Bolda noted, there are benefits to attending multiple sessions and allowing for a relationship to build between a participant and the naturalists leading the program. Not only does that promote a deeper level of engagement and learning, but it's also a great way to foster a relationship between community members and the county parks. The kids are also connecting with other kids who share an interest in wildlife, but typically are from different schools and different parts of the county. Bolda said it's especially cool to see the children, strangers to each other at the beginning of a lesson, start to work together and problem-solve as a team \u2014 for example, building a shelter together during the wilderness survival session. Bolda prefers to step back at certain points and \"to not help,\" by design. That way, she doesn't inadvertently limit their imaginations or their opportunities to work collaboratively. Besides earning their Junior Naturalist badges, Bolda speculated that the kids' favorite part of attending the programs is the freedom they're allowed to do things like get dirty, run in streams, and discover living things. \"We always try to make sure each program offers some sort of hands-on [experience], or we're going to see a creature,\" which keeps the excitement level high. Bolda and her co-naturalists are proud to offer the Junior Naturalist Program (along with many other Parks and Recreation programs) completely for free, allowing for greater accessibility to families, \"which is really cool, because you are getting school-level science, and you're not paying anything for it, and you get to go to these beautiful, stunning locations.\" Their goal is to foster a love of nature in as many children as possible, much the way their own passion was nurtured along the way, in a structured but pressure-free setting \u2014 all to the end of cultivating fellow stewards of nature.

Crazy Wisdom Bookstore 114 S. Main St., Ann Arbor 734.665.2757 crazywisdom.net cwpoetrycircle.tumblr.com The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 78 Starting school can be an overwhelming experience for the whole family. It's a huge system for parents to navigate, and children have the daunting task of learning not only their letters and numbers but also how to be around other kids and function in a group setting away from their parents. The state of Michigan understands this, along with the notion that children begin learning long before they enter a kindergarten classroom. So, in 2001, Washtenaw County received a grant from the state to promote early interactions in school settings, and to support parents in their important role as their children's first teachers. These days, the program is known as First Steps-Ann Arbor, and it's thriving as a fun, nurturing, and supportive way for families and schools to collaboratively promote optimal early childhood development. Marj Hyde is the manager of the Early Childhood division for Ann Arbor Rec & Ed, which oversees First Steps, and she's been running the program since day one. She said she loves to spread the word about First Steps classes, reasoning that \"the more people know about it, the better option they can have to be supported.\" She and her team have developed a range of playgroups and classes over the years, hoping to reach families with a variety of needs and interests. Currently, First Steps offers over a dozen class options to choose from, all offered at various times of the day throughout the year. While most classes are held at the Ann Arbor Preschool and Family Center on Boardwalk Drive, there are also options available at Haisley, Eberwhite, and Logan elementary schools. Does your child love acting out stories? Maybe the \"Fairy Tales & Flashlights\" class is for him, where he can do different art, pretend play, sensory, cognitive, and motor activities around the theme of a fairy tale \u2014 and then act out the fairy tale, complete with flashlights for extra fun. Does your little one love to be physical? \"Kids in Motion\" offers tons of organized motor activities, like spinning, jumping, rolling, climbing, throwing, and parachute play. There's an all-outdoors class called \"Nature Kids,\" and there's a mindfulness class called \"Mindful Me.\" There's a \"Jump Into Speech\" class, in case you'd like to help your toddler use more language. There are art classes, music classes, sensory-activity classes, and even classes just for infants \u2014 like \"Curious WiggleWorms,\" where babies can practice tummy time and crawling while their parents connect with their children and with each other. The assortment of classes is important, Hyde explained, in order to engage many different kids and families. After all, the goal is for the classes to be \"[school] practice without pushing, in a child-directed way.\" The First Steps staff see their role with the children as helping them grow and learn while familiarizing them with a school-type setting. Kids in First Steps classes begin to develop a schema of what \"school\" is \u2014 one that's meant to be fun and exciting, which they can later carry over to their first formal school experience, whether that's preschool or kindergarten. They practice important skills: managing themselves in a group setting, interacting with new children, and attempting social tasks like waiting, turn-taking, following directions, and playing together. They experience typical school day events like circle time and snack time, all with the support of a parent, but without the pressure to sit and stay if the child isn't ready yet. And throughout each class, they're getting cognitive stimulation via the play-based activities available. Just as the classes are a gentle introduction to school for children, so can they be for the parents as well, starting right away with the registration process. If that process is confusing, Hyde said, the First Steps staff will do it for and with the parents: \"We do our best to make it easy, and also give them tools so they can do it the next time themselves.\" Once parents are in a class, they have the chance to form a relationship with their child's teacher, which also means they have ready access to the teacher's developmental expertise when questions arise. They can see firsthand how their child's personality and temperament play out in a group setting, which in turn can help them advocate for their child in later years; for example, knowing a child is a kinesthetic learner might help a parent understand that a school with regular recesses would be a good match. The teachers also help parents manage their developmental expectations, explaining why kids might run screaming from circle time or fall apart at a simple parent request. \"We help families feel good about that,\" Hyde said, \"despite the fact that they may feel like their child is the only one who did that.\" All of these learning experiences for parents can be applied to their children's formal schooling later on. Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community First Steps-Ann Arbor Currently, First Steps offers over a dozen class options to choose from, all offered at various times of the day throughout the year. After all, the goal is for the classes to be \"[school] practice without pushing, in a child-directed way.\" They experience typical school day events like circle time and snack time, all with the support of a parent, but without the pressure to sit and stay if the child isn't ready yet.Hyde said that First Steps continues to emphasize the importance of parents understanding their role as their children's first teachers, and that the staff welcome parents as partners: \"We try to nurture them but help them know how [school] systems work so they can use them to their own benefits.\" At the same time, they try to foster relationships between families, since First Steps classes present a unique opportunity to connect with parents who have kids the same age as yours. As Hyde put it, \"We're here to facilitate your relationships with other people doing the same job.\" The early stages of parenting are a particularly vulnerable time for people and represent one of the biggest life shifts. \"It's an equalizer,\" Hyde explained. \"Everybody's child is struggling with doing this, or you're struggling with them doing this, and everybody is enjoying the amazing ideas that you're now hearing come out of this little person.\" The First Steps program, in Hyde's view, is not only an introduction to the school system, but also an entrance into the world community. With a common thread of parenting young children and encouraging real connections among participants, Hyde's belief is that \"peace comes from these kinds of programs.\" Though she and her staff clearly work hard to promote kinship, Hyde noted that the supportive community within First Steps arises from \"each and every family that comes. Thank goodness they come and contribute and share their families and share their stories. That's what makes whatever program they're part of so valuable.\" For class descriptions and schedules, as well as registration and cost information, visit the First Steps-Ann Arbor website at hyde140.wixsite.com/first-steps-annarbor, email firststeps@a2schools.org , or call (734) 994-2300 x 53186.

The deadline for submissions for the May through August issue is March 1, 2017.Importantly, First Steps is closely intertwined with Early On, the state's early intervention program for children ages birth to three who are experiencing developmental delays. Hyde said that moving into the newly-built Ann Arbor Preschool and Family Center on Boardwalk Drive about ten years ago allowed them to provide \"totally integrated services\" among different sectors of early childhood programming. If a First Steps family is \"struggling with something, whether it is behavior or development or speech development or just needing something, then we're going to provide it. And they don't have to do anything\" \u2014 meaning they're already working with Hyde via First Steps, and since she also works with Early On, she can easily facilitate the process of connecting families to the proper Early On services. In fact, Hyde said, it happens \"several times a month\" that a First Steps family will seek a referral for intervention services. \"So we sit down and I do it. I'm the same person, it's the same place,\" which helps break down barriers. Parents tend to feel more comfortable seeking assistance from someone they're already familiar with, and their kids can get quicker access to whatever support they may need. First Steps' biggest current difficulty, said Hyde, is funding. The program operates solely on what it receives in tuition fees, which presents a challenge when the staff are dedicated to offering the classes at costs that work for a range of family incomes. They provide unlimited scholarships, which essentially puts the class costs on a sliding scale, and Hyde said people \"pay by family and not by child, so you don't pay any more if you have three kids [in a class] than if you have one.\" To help sustain the breadth of the program, the staff formed a PTO, which is made up of current First Steps families and general community members. The PTO works hard \"to ensure that First Steps keeps going\" \u2014 for example, that more money is coming in than going out. To that end, the PTO runs two annual fundraisers, a Trike-A-Thon in the fall and Kid Fest in the spring. This year, Kid Fest will be on Saturday, March 11 at Forsythe Middle School, and anyone in the community is welcome to come and bring their kids for a live musical performance by Joe Reilly, followed by food, games, and prizes.

TEACHER, PAIN REDUCTION AND REMOVAL TECHNIQUES, CORD REMOVAL, EXTRACTIONS, AND MORE! zsourceconnection .com Outdoor labyrinth for walking meditation rusticgate@casair .net Train to be an independent spiritual director? Spiritual director Jonathan Ellis is a former co-owner of Crazy Wisdom and then continued to be a mentor and friend to the longtime current owners. He serves five dozen or so individuals each month from a variety of backgrounds, faiths, and professions who seek guidance on their own spiritual journey through life. He writes: \"If you do something over 10,000 times, you are ready to teach! I have had more than that number of sessions with folks, in person in Ann Arbor and by phone around the country, as an independent spiritual director for over 20 years now. \"I will turn age 70 soon and want to train new colleagues in the next few years. As a spiritual director, you are not someone who decides a direction for others. In sessions once a month, you help people sort through their ideas and feelings about the spiritual path of their own choosing. With your support, folks get to step back, see their life from a spiritual perspective, and focus their intention. \"I have so far mentored over a dozen people to become independent spiritual directors, all of whom had a background in a helping profession and a well developed spirituality of their own. Training now involves two individual sessions a month with me for a year, then working yourself under my guidance for a second year. \"In a common practice, I offer this independent spiritual director training on an open donation basis.

Jonathan Ellis \" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 86 By Linda Diane Feldt The name \"A2B3\" comes from the original intent of the group, which was to sample bi bim bop at all of the Korean restaurants in town. So the full name is Ann Arbor Bi Bim Bop. Today the group travels around town, enjoying a selection of restaurants that can accommodate a large group at one table, with separate checks, and in a space quiet enough that everyone can hear one another. Hearing is important because, at 12:30, Ed introduces himself and asks a question. Everyone has a chance to respond after introducing themselves to the group with their name and what they do, with whatever response the question triggers for them. The questions range from the frivolous ( give an answer that is about water; what's in your pocket?) to those that really bring out a chance to be personal \u2014 talk about goals and successes. But sometimes the question is practical \u2014 how do you track appointments, how to get the best service when you are calling tech support, and so on. The group attracts intelligent people, who nearly all have a great sense of humor. Members of the group also have a chance to talk about hobbies and an incredible range of interests. The range of conversation before 12:30 reflects the very broad knowledge and curiosity of the members. Any subject is fair game, it would seem. Everyone has a chance to contribute and to feel welcome and drawn into the group. Ed Vielmetti is a self-employed entrepreneur, who can claim over 30 years experience as a writer and active internet user. He has worked for a number of local software companies, as well as AnnArbor.com as a paid staff person working with blogging. A frequent commenter at Ann Arbor City Council meetings, he has made a name for himself learning the ins and outs of filing FOIA requests and pointing out where transparency is lacking in government. While Ed clearly provides leadership, the group also influences the flow of conversation and interests. One member recently remarked, \"The group itself varies, and that variation changes over time.\" Ed makes leadership look easy, but his style of quiet awareness of the group, ability to find the connections between strangers, and ease in making individuals feel welcome is certainly the largest part of why the group The group has spawned startups, friendships, collaborations, and shared projects. But mostly friendships. A2B3 even has its own diminutive bumper sticker, suitable for car, bike, or laptop. Having a face-to-face weekly gathering is a somewhat outmoded method for connecting, and yet it remains uniquely effective and satisfying. A2B3 has become a gathering of friends and potential friends, people willing and able to make deep connections, and those who recognize a warm and welcoming gathering of people who don't always agree but certainly have a wide range of interests and even expertise. Linda Diane Feldt and Ed Vielmetti The Art of Building a Community \"I'm Ed Vielmetti and I organize lunch.\" For more than ten years, Ed has been organizing lunch. Every Thursday, except for the major holidays, this eclectic and ever evolving group, called A2B3, has met for lunch, and Ed Vielmetti has made it happen. Everyone and anyone is welcome. Some are regulars, some come once. Most of the regulars make it one to two times a month, and some come just when they can or when they are in town. During the recession, A2B3 was a welcoming and sometimes next step for people who were out of work or with too much free time. With the group offering easy access to information about Ann Arbor (especially startups in the area), support and an informal sounding board for ideas, and a chance for making new contacts, many lunch participants found themselves newly launched into the community or a business venture. Lunches were large, with 20 to 35 people most weeks. The location was fixed at Eastern Accents, until they went out of business. In the years since, the number of attendees has settled to somewhere between 6 and 12. We never know how many will show up for lunch, although people can now make a reservation through the Meetup website, which helps limit the guessing. The group has always been great at networking and making connections. Our mailing list on Yahoo Groups is now up to more than 450 members. Here, members can continue the discussion between lunches, share resources, and ask for or offer advice on repairs and technology problems. The list is also used to post job openings, events, and ideas. The group has spawned startups, friendships, collaborations, and shared projects. But mostly friendships. A2B3 even has its own diminutive bumper sticker, suitable for car, bike, or laptop. How Lunch Created and Sustains a Group of Mostly Ann Arborites, Now Numbering Over 450 PeopleThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2017 Page 87 has worked for so many years. During the recession, the group offered a welcoming and non-judgmental environment for people out of work and seeking connections, as well as a social outlet. With so many programmers, contract workers, and self-employed workers in the group, there is an immediate acceptance of life challenges and changes in circumstance. The process of building community and making friends can seem mysterious and also difficult. Ed has found success in doing both. Having a face-to-face weekly gathering is a somewhat outmoded method for connecting, and yet it remains uniquely effective and satisfying. There are members who have never made it to lunch, but who are just part of the online network that communicates via email. A number of new people are drawn to the group for the opportunity for networking, which can be a nerve-wracking and high-stakes process. Those who join primarily to make business contacts usually either fade away or change their goals. The group is more casual and not focused on promotion and certainly not on making sales contacts. If there is common interest found, then something might continue, but a sense of humor or a wise contribution is given much more reinforcement and attention. Newcomers to town have enjoyed the group as a way of jumpstarting friendships and accessing the deep well of information about all aspects of Ann Arbor. Groups can succeed or fail on the strength of a leader. The group functions well with Ed and can also carry on without him. Yet when he is absent, the person who takes his place is jokingly referred to as \"Faux Ed.\" He is receptive to suggestions, he appreciates and perpetrates the tradition of the group, and he is a storyteller that inspires other people's sharing of themselves. It could have simply been a group of technology-oriented geeks and nerds. It could have just been a place to talk about yourself and your work. Instead, A2B3 has become a gathering of friends and potential friends, people willing and able to make deep connections, and those who recognize a warm and welcoming gathering of people who don't always agree but certainly have a wide range of interests and even expertise. It's a true community. A group of self-selected people who have come to care about each other, support each other, and enjoy the chance to share a meal together. Linda Diane Feldt is a local holistic health practitioner, teacher, and writer, who has provided an integrated approach to holistic health care since 1980. She has been a member of A2B3 for about eight years and is a co-organizer of the group. Join A2B3 on Meetup at www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch/ or on Yahoo Groups at groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/a2b3/info.

We need both the masculine energy of the sun and the moon's feminine nurturing energy. Feel the love, beauty, and cosmic support of Sister Moon. We are deeply connected to her and to the sun and stars. The moon has long been a wondrous and mysterious force of nature. Here on Earth, for ages, we've been looking up at her, especially during full moons, reveling in her beauty and magic. Captivated, we aren't even fully aware we are being invited to synchronize with this force and power. Just as we are activated and energized by the sun, soaking up the vitamin D we need for health, we are also deeply affected by the moon. Her energy is more emotional and draws us in. We need both the masculine energy of the sun and the moon's feminine nurturing energy. The power of the moon is evident all around us. When Sister Moon is full, emer - gency rooms are busier, and there are more traffic accidents. She influences the ocean tides. I even had a hairstylist who had me come in for trims during new moon because she said your hair grows more during that cycle. (My hair was down to my waist then.) In my moon classes, I teach that full moons are for releasing and letting go of what you no longer need, and new moons are for new beginnings and starting new projects. Here is a brief rundown of the moon phases: New Moon is the time to plant seeds and starts about three and a half days after the balsamic moon. This is the time to really think about what you want and be crystal clear about your goals. Reverent rituals, like writing your goals down and \"safely\" burn - ing or burying them, super charges your intentions and plants seeds. Celebrating your desires by dancing them in and having a party with your girlfriends to bring in the new is equally as pow - erful, as long as the intention is present. Movement creates energy. Waxing Crescent Moon is for giving energy to your dreams, about three and half days after new moon. Now that you've already written them down, think on them. Read them. Sprinkle them with good juju and manifestation power by pon - dering them. Feel what your wishes would feel like and be like for you as if it were real life. Our subconscious, the part of our brain that creates, responds to images and feelings. First Quarter Moon can be challenging. It is halfway between the new moon and the forthcoming full moon. Keep picturing, feeling, and conjuring. Life challenges and issues can take us away from what we've started. Keep reading and believ - ing. Gibbous Moon Phase is the time in between first quarter moon and full moon. Don't give up. It takes time for the Uni - verse to respond to your requests. You may find the need to change up your intentions or get clearer about what you want. This phase can feel empty. Stand by what you want and stay true to your wishes. Full Moon brings on emotion and intensity and is underway around 14 days or so after new moon. You might not sleep as well, especially if the full moon is in one of your challenging as - trological houses. Full moons naturally stimulate what we need to let go of. They are cosmically doing their work in alignment with the natural lunar cycles. I usually feel great and energized during a Virgo full moon because I am a Virgo, but I could also be highly aware of what I need to organize, get rid of, and clean up, the alchemical virtue of Virgo. Many of my clients call me for a session around the full moon because things can feel challenging and emotional. Intuitive confir - mation of their feelings, wishes, and plans gives them the hope and faith that fuels the manifestation that happens at new moon. Disseminating Moon is when we can relax, be with our emotions, and accept where we are, so we can let go and let the moon do its work. You've released. Be with where you are. Cultivate trust and relax during this time about three and a half days after full moon. Third Quarter Moon \u2014 if you asked for something huge, like a new car, promotion, or a new relationship, they may not have happened. The Universe needs to catch up with our desires, or it could be that something big - ger and beyond what we could imagine is in order. What changes do you see already in yourself? What revelations or insights have popped up letting you know you are on the right track? Have people or opportunities in line with your desires come your way? Balsamic Moon or Dark Moon Phase says surrender. Be soft and vulnerable to what has gone and what will be coming. Be in receiving mode even more so now for your Highest Good and the Good of All. I recom-mend adding that to your desire list. This is said to be a highly psychic time. Be present. Meditate. Take care of yourself. Rest and prepare for the birth of the coming new moon when you will cast your desires. Now that you know the phases of the moon, a good way to start working with her power is to practice rituals at new moon and full moon. Rituals ignite powerful cosmic and spiritual power. I was at a wedding recently, when I was reminded about the power of ritual. Two people declaring their vows and coming together to be one sets an intention, which is then consummated spiritually; two become one in the eyes of Spirit. Through intention and the practice of ritual, a union is activated, sanctified, and put into motion. Life will never be the same for the couple. This same great power can be accessed during a moon ritual. For instance, during a full moon, lighting candles in reverence and taking a sea salt bath, while meditating upon what you would like to release, can be super potent. New moons call for us to sit with and clearly think through our deepest desires. Writing these desires down and then casting them to the Source, or whatever you may call your Higher Power, can lead to their ultimate manifestation. You can cast them into the ocean or a fire to release them to the Source. It's amazing to think our ancestors looked up to Luna like we do, the beautiful femi- nine moon glowing in the sky, heavy and seemingly pregnant with possibility. Many believed the moon was the embodiment of the Goddess and the blessings she bestowed, and many still do. In my work, I recommend my clients work with the moon to achieve balance between goal setting and action. Feel the love, beauty, and cosmic support of Sister Moon. We are deeply connected to her and to the sun and stars. Tatiana Scavnicky is a teacher, intuitive life coach, singer-songwriter, and Angel Therapy Practitioner\u00ae.

The highly sought-after ancient stones in the movie, referred to as \"Sankara Stones,\" were based on Shiva Lingam stones. The Sankara Stones were actually plastic props with lights inside them, representing the \"diamonds\" inside that would only glow if the stones were brought together. Unlike the movie, Shiva Lingams do not actually contain diamonds, but the primal energies stored deep within these stones can bring out beauty, force, and love. When we think of the New Year, we think new beginnings, removal of old patterns, and welcoming change. The Shiva Lingam stone is perfect to incorporate into your healing and wellness practice at this time of year. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but its power can go deep within you, awakening tantric energy and allowing it to flow freely. A Shiva Lingam is an oval shaped stone made of cryptocrystalline quartz. It shares the same metaphysical and healing properties as Jasper. Lingams are found in the Narmada River, which is one of the seven holy sites of India. They also go by several different names, including Shiva, Shiva Lingams, Boji Stones, and Shiva Linga. The stones are gathered from the river once a year and are hand-polished by villagers to correct and balance the shape. The stones represent the Hindu deity Lord Shiva, and for centuries have been an integral part of spiritual practice in Hinduism, only recently being recognized in the West for their healing and restorative powers. Each stone is unique, with different striations, patterns, and spots creating a very personalized, one-of-a-kind crystal for the individual. The markings, also known as the yoni, symbolize the feminine energy manifesting the creative power in the dance of the cosmos. Geologists theorize that the iron oxide, of which the yoni is composed, was pressed into the Narmada river bed millions of years ago by a meteorite. In ancient Sanskrit, \"Shiva Lingam\" means a sign or symbol. Stimulating the electric flow in the body \u2014 its currents, or \"meridians\" \u2014 these symbolic stones can raise and harness Kundalini energy \u2014 great for spiritual evolution. Kundalini refers to primal energies, or shakti, located at the base of the spine. Kundalini is described as lying \"coiled\" at the base of the spine (Wikipedia), represented like a sleeping serpent waiting to be awakened for the purpose of spiritual enlightenment. This symbolizes the Hindu god Shiva's union with the Shakti, or uniting the higher with the lower and moving those energies throughout the entire system, almost like gears on a machine. Activating primal Kundalini energy can assist in having you look deep within yourself to release what you have outgrown in order to move on in your spiritual development. Shiva symbolizes the masculine principle of opening consciousness, while Shakti symbolizes the feminine principle of power and activation of energy \u2014 a lot like balancing the yin and yang of the body. Common folklore states that a Shiva Lingam stone contains a microscopic version of the universe, where its form represents the energy of knowledge and the markings represent the energy of wisdom. Ways to use Shiva Lingam Stones Powerful second (spleen/sexual) chakra healer. Can be placed in the front of the body in the area just two fingers below the belly button or over the lower back/sacrum to assist in correcting emotional health and balance, sexual dysfunction, reproductive issues, prostate health, menopause, infertility, et cetera. Amazing for sexual abuse survivors to help reinstate trust in others. This stone can be placed anywhere on the spine or back for pain issues, spine dysfunctions like scoliosis, or spinal joint disorders. Meditating with this stone on your solar plexus can bring instant corrective healing, balancing the female Shakti/male Shiva energies of ourselves. Perfect for those wanting to get back to a healthy lifestyle! Practicing yoga and using this stone in your meditation can promote great results with posture realignment and restoring proper energetic Kundalini movement throughout your chakra system. Using it with the heart chakra, you can bring unity and openness to receiving unconditional love, beginning a true relationship with one's authentic self while banishing fears. Placing a Shiva Lingam stone in your home, bedroom, or office can bring power to purify and balance energies in a space, as they have been used in sacred temples and holy sites for centuries. *Important Note: Beware of purchasing these stones from unreliable sources (like certain stores on the Internet), as they can be fakes. Copies can be made of Shiva Lingams from a similarly colored African sandstone that is then shaped and polished. No two Lingam stones should look exactly alike. Carol Clarke-Tiseo is a Melody Master Crystologist, Reiki Master, and licensed massage therapist who recently relocated to South Lyon, Michigan. She has ten years of experience in energy healing and eleven years of experience in therapeutic massage and bodywork. Carol can be contacted at cclarke2005@hotmail.com. The stones represent the Hindu deity Lord Shiva, and for centuries have been an integral part of spiritual practice in Hinduism, only recently being recognized in the West for their healing and restorative powers. Common folklore states that a Shiva Lingam stone contains a microscopic version of the universe, where its form represents the energy of knowledge and the markings represent the energy of wisdom.

I received an excellent grade school/high school education, earned a B.A. in English from the University of Michigan, and studied teaching at Eastern Michigan University. I wrote well-formed essays, taught students how to read and write, and thought I had a pretty good understanding of the English language. Until one day I learned that I had missed the point entirely. I came up against my own personal brick wall: the coping mechanisms that I had been using to deal with unprocessed childhood trauma \u2014 overuse of alcohol, food, etc. \u2014 came back to bite me, and I realized that I had to stop assuaging my symptoms and focus more deeply on my underlying wounds. It isn't that I hadn't been working in therapy prior to this \u2014 I had \u2014 but suddenly my attempts to kill the pain did not work; my deeper self broke open, and I was taken to a different place within. It became more painful for me to stay the way I was than to change \u2014 so I changed. I began using my daily writing in a way that I never had before. I let go of some of the previous tight control and let the writing lead me. My notebook became my refuge and my classroom, a literal home. It was a mirror reflecting me to myself, teaching me about my behavior patterns, my emotions, and my unhealed wounds. It was a place for me to practice being me, a cocoon of sorts, in which I could safely develop until I was ready to be launched out into the world again, in a new form. Unhealed emotional wounds, I have found, will always come back to haunt you, and that can be one of the greatest gifts you can ever receive. This has certainly been the case for me. I knew that if I continued to cooperate with this writing process, I would be led to where I needed to go, and it became clear to me that my true calling \u2014 besides writing for myself \u2014 was to help other interested people experience a transformation, in their own way, in their own time, through writing. I felt that I had become, as Pat Schneider states in her book Writing Alone and with Others, \"[a midwife] to that which was already within [my] students.\" Since that day seven years ago, it has been my mission to create a space where new writing can be born, where a writer's authentic voice can surface and be nurtured, and where workshop participants can come together and hold each other up to the light. My first task in accomplishing this was to create a journaling group \u2014 Women Writing for Recovery \u2014 in which women recovering from alcoholism could learn to use writing to further their personal growth. One of the things I witnessed while leading this group was the miraculous way in which each writer was led directly to what she needed in order to heal. The only thing that could interfere with this process was if the writer attempted to control the outcome. So my job became to help people put aside what they had learned in school about writing \u2014 making an outline, using correct grammar, etc. \u2014 and to teach them to let go. I was reading quite a bit during these years, searching for books that seemed to fit what I was trying to accomplish \u2014 Writing from the Body by John Lee; Writing the Natural Way by Gabriele Rico, PhD; Reclaiming the Wild Soul: How Earth's Landscapes Restore Us to Wholeness by Mary Reynolds Thompson; and finally, Writing Alone and with Others by Pat Schneider. While reading Pat Schneider's book, I became intrigued with the teaching method she had developed \u2014 the Amherst Writers & Artists Workshop Method \u2014 and realized that it was much like what I had already been trying to do in my workshop. I signed up for the 40-hour training certification program that was offered, and I became certified in this method. The training was a great experience, in that it gave structure to some of the things I had been trying to do on my own. For instance, I had wanted to move more toward fiction writing rather than journaling in my workshops, and part of what Schneider proposes in the Amherst Writers & Artists Teaching Method is that all workshop writing be treated as fiction (unless the writer specifically states that the writing is autobiographical). This \"keeps the focus on the writing rather than on the writer; it allows members to gain access to, and then express, thoughts and emotions that may be too powerful, painful, embarrassing or surprising to expose otherwise.\" Another aspect of the workshop that I consider essential is that I (the leader) write along with the participants and share my work; this is important for bringing about equality of risk-taking and building of trust. And, as Schneider has said, \"the last thing people want is another 'expert' standing up there behind a lectern, telling everyone, 'Do it like me.'\" Instead they want, \"...someone who will extend the courtesy of listening, rather than lecturing, who will say, don't let me get in the way, this is all about you and your journey.\" During the workshop, participants are given the opportunity to share their newly- written work, and I guide the remaining members in their responses. No criticism, suggestion, or question is directed toward the writer, but instead we comment on what we found strong in their writing, what was memorable and powerful for us, and what we will take with us from the work. In the workshop we deal with just-born writing \u2014 the writer does not even know what they've written yet \u2014 and as such, this writing is not ready for editing. When people's work is honored and supported in the ways that I have been describing, authentic writing voices emerge, self-esteem and self-confidence grow; people become willing to experiment with new writing techniques, and they begin to know each other in deeper than average ways. The whole process feels to me like a breath of fresh air and like we are moving along some invisible highway, being guided to new healing and growth. In my eight years of experience teaching this way, I have watched people open like flowers, revealing layer upon layer of what has been trapped inside them for years. I consider it a great privilege to be able to witness and support such transformations, and I look forward to continuing to do so.

I so enjoy spending time with you. Love anticipating it, love being with you, love remembering it. Crazy, eh? Guess I simply love you. You asked me about meditation, and you hit me right where I truly live. So, I'm go- ing to write a few general instructions that you can look over, and maybe they will serve you as you de-stress. First of all, know that you can quiet the mind, spirit, and inner agitation whether \"sitting, standing, walking, or lying down,\" to quote the ancient masters. And there is no special place you have to be. The old instructions mention leaving town and going to sit under a tree. There is no doubt that nature gives us the most supportive place, but, not to worry, you can find the inner peace on a train, in a bus, at your desk, walking from here to there, standing at a window, stopping anywhere and just being there. Sometimes I teach a curious acronym \u2014 BRFWA. Doesn't spell anything, but sums up the qualities of this practice. I learned it in my yoga train - ing at Kripalu. It stands for breathe, relax, feel, watch, and allow. BREATHE \u2014 This is so basic it would seem unnecessary to mention. But the breath is truly the link in the body/mind loop. We change our whole autonomic nervous system when we observe and take control of our breath. We literally move from \"fight or flight\" to \"easy does it.\" At any moment, we can stop and take three conscious breaths. At any time when we have stopped and are trying to unwind, it will be the breath and the clear awareness of the breath, in some detail, that will settle us down. So, \"know if you are taking in a long breath, know if you are taking in a short breath, know if you are letting out a long/short breath,\" to quote the Buddha directly. Find the apertures in the breath. Rest there. Just let nothing be happening. Return to this breath awareness at any moment in life that gets tough. This can be done at a party with a drink in your hand. RELAX \u2014 As the central experience of meditating mindfully is to simply be able to let the stuff of the mind come and go without attachment, I am convinced that relaxation is what makes this all happen. A great time to practice is after a workout. I use my yoga for this, but I could see stopping after a good run or time in the gym. At those moments, the body is a bit used up and so it is willing to be still. A still body encourages a still mind. At the very least some stretches, loosening of the shoulders, releasing the jaw, getting com-fortable are all strategies that bring us to the optimum place to \"sit,\" which may or may not be in a chair. FEEL \u2014 The body is always in the present moment, and returning to a clear know - ing of how the body is will pay dividends. Some masters advocate a scanning of the body \u2014 mentally sweeping one's awareness from head to feet and back again. We can let this careful experience of the body help relieve any mental stress that is bug-ging us. Along with physical awareness is checking in with what's going on with our emotions. Just noticing any anxiety, fear, wanting of things to be different somehow \u2014 here is the heart of the practice. WATCH \u2014 Okay, so we're just noticing, just watching. No judgement, comment, no decision making. Just a strong feeling experience. I also think that huge doses of kindness to oneself can come into play here. This is especially true if pain, mental or physical, is present. And even more especially true if the pain or distress is self-inflicted. In just observing things as they are, we let go of controlling the situation. A Grandmother's Letter to Her Grandson About Meditation and Awareness In classic instruction, this is often called \"choiceless awareness.\" We really have no idea what the mind is going to cook up next or what itch or body sensation will surface. But here, we have taken a time-out, however brief or long, to simply be with ourselves. And we're paying attention. This whole business is not asking of us something we do not know how to do. We can notice. We can pay attention. Simple. Easy even. But practicing it regularly is rather unusual you could say. ALLOW \u2014 One teacher I've learned from says that this whole practice is like being a child again in the back seat of the car. You are not controlling this experience and really have no say in where it's going. I remember times in my parents' car very vividly, even to this day. Often I would be pressing my nose against a window in the back seat and just seeing what was going by with no particular energy. As I have practiced again and again watching my mind bring up thoughts and stories and observed sounds, smells, or body sensations around me, I have become stronger and stronger in the ability to allow the world, my life, to unfold as it does \u2014 to al - low the meditation experience to unfold as it does. This does not mean that I have become a passive ninny but knowing what's happening and allowing it without re-sistance gives me the ability to then work with the moment from a place of peace. I no longer have to \"try\" or force events in my life. And when a truly big moment comes (Grandpa's death) I am right there, not running from it, not wishing it away, but simply present. From that stance, I can operate with some clarity and effective-ness. Well, my dearest one, I can only hope that these words are helpful to you. Your grandfather and I began to learn such things in our early thirties. So you are ahead of us, already asking to know this stuff in your late twenties. I can only say that this practice so very much contributed to real happiness in both our lives. And I know you recognized the inner strength and fortitude that he had as he faced the end of his days. Deep happiness, less struggle and suffering, clear strength \u2014 a pretty wonderful payoff for taking a few minutes a day to stop, relax, and breathe. I wish you well with all this and am right here any time to talk about it again.Love you so dearly, Grandma Dorothyann Coyne has been practicing yoga and meditation for over 40 years and is currently teaching beginning meditators Vipassana meditation, also known as insight meditation or mindfulness.
