From the early stages of pregnancy to when your teenagers are finally ready to leave the nest (even if they don't want to) we're here to help you through this crazy thing called parenting. You can get advice on potty training, talk about breastfeeding, discuss how to get your baby to sleep or ask if that one weird thing your kid does is normal. I just really need to get this off my chest. Before I start, let me say a few things: - I am pro-vaccine - I'm a heavy proponent of data-driven decision making. I'm actually so deep in the subject, that I have studied methods that drug companies 'package' data to take advantage of how people treat risk-tolerance differently. Without going into it, yes, even objective scientists often fail to make data driven decisions. My son was diagnosed with autism at age 2. The day that I received the diagnosis was the worst day of my life, worse than the day my mom died of brain cancer. For anyone who has never witnessed somebody die of cancer, it is an ignoble, gruesome death that will make you believe in assisted suicide. Autism is worse. For a rationalist, cancer is a well understood disease. We know why it happens, and we know how procedures and treatments affect the outcome. With autism we know nothing. It makes you think long and hard about everything. It makes you search high and low for answers, where there are none. Every parent thinks their children has unlimited potential, but the day you are handed an autism diagnosis, a bunch of ideas are pounded into your head: - Your son is mentally deficient - You should limit your expectations. Bilingual? Trilingual? Abandon your expectations for that, and focus on one language. You'll be lucky if you can achieve that. - Your child may need you for the rest of their life. - Your child is unlikely to get married. His inability to connect with people is likely to cause him severe depression. - You have a million questions, but medical professionals have few answers. - Your son may wear diapers... forever. He may masturbate, anywhere he wants. You won't know until several years later. - He may get better. He may get worse. We don't know what will happen. - The best treatment for your child is Applied Behavioral Analysis: a psychological treatment that takes approximately 5 hours per day, 5 days a week, and requires your presence. You or your spouse will have to quit your job. You may not go on vacation. The treatment will likely need to be sustained, and will last indefinitely. Most people who stop treatment, stop because they run out of funding. Most parents have millions of questions, and can't get any answers, because the answers aren't there. A lot of questions float through our heads. Did we love our kid enough? Did we show enough affection? Were we not diligent enough with prenatal vitamins? Did we vaccinate? The answers are usually \"probably not your fault.\" We search for ways to change our child's outcome. Does a gluten free diet work? Do dairy products cause it? You search for millions of ways to steer your kid back to the 'neurotypical' path, whether or not there's any science behind it or not. Fuck science or rationality... you throw spaghetti on the wall and hope, pray, plead to a god you don't believe in that something will stick. You see other kids talking, growing, socializing at the playground, and it burns you inside that your kid is handicapped in this basic ability. When we decided to have a second kid, we went through the usual motions. Autism may be partially genetic. Everything is a maybe. We thought about what we needed to change. My wife avoided antibiotics. I kept my cell phone away from my balls. My wife was super diligent about prenatal vitamins, BPA laden products (or their substitute), and eventually we had that conversation about vaccines. It lasted about 10 seconds: we decided to vaccinate our kid. Yes, we spread out our vaccines instead of doing them all at once. But we did it. All I'm trying to say is, yes, I believe people should vaccinate, but don't be so hard on people. If there's anything worse that autism, it's seeing a child suffer, become debilitated, or die from a disease that we have the full capability to prevent and eradicate. Even now, I constantly want to scream for help. But I don't want anyone to look at my kid and automatically lower their expectations. So I shutup. We work behind the scenes to help our son, and very few people know that my son has a autism diagnosis. Which is why I have to vent about this anonymously. "}
