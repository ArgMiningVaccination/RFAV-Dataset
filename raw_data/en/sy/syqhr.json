A meditation candle can aid in the creation of a stress-free environment for yoga, mindfulness, and transcendental meditation. Candle gazing meditations are another common technique to help you relax and improve your meditation experience. Focusing on an object, such as a candle flame, might help your mind wander into a more meditative state. There is even solid proof that aromatherapy with essential oils and candles can boost exercise and happiness. Talking about essential oils, they are plant-derived chemicals that capture the aroma and flavour of the plant, or its 'essence'.

Distillation (through steam and/or water) or mechanical processes, such as cold pressing, is used to produce essential oils. After the aromatic chemicals have been extracted, they are combined with carrier oil to create a finished product. The method of extraction is critical because essential oils obtained by chemical methods are not regarded as authentic essential oils. When inhaled, essential oils can stimulate the limbic system, which is the part of the brain responsible for emotions, memories, and motivation, the scents of which can promote feelings of calmness, relaxation, and focus, which makes them ideal for use during meditation.

Oregano oil, Cinnamon bark oil, Jasmine oil, Lemongrass oil, Ylang-ylang oil, Chamomile oil and Bergamot oil are some of them.
