Authors: ESMO Guidelines Committee Clinical Practice Guidelines This update refers to the [Early and locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC): ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and 2017; 28 (suppl 4): iv1-iv21. Section Treatment of locally advanced stage (stage III); Systemic therapy Text update The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved durvalumab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following chemoradiotherapy whose tumours express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on 1% of tumour cells, although the latter was a post hoc subgroup analysis. The recommendation is based on the phase III PACIFIC trial, in which the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab commenced 1-42 days post chemoradiotherapy improved survival [PFS; median PFS 16.8 versus 5.6 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.65, HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.87, P=0.00251) in 473 patients compared patients randomised to placebo [1, 2]. The was 27.0%, again favouring the durvalumab arm. The PFS benefit associated with durvalumab was consistent across all prespecified subgroups, as defined according to patient demographic characteristics, baseline clinicopathological features, and response to previous treatment. The PFS benefit was shown irrespective of PD-L1 expression before chemoradiotherapy. The HR was 0.59 (95% CI 0.43-0.82) for patients with a PD-L1 expression level of <25%, and the HR was 0.41 (95% CI 0.26-0.65) for patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 25%. Objective response rate, as assessed by blinded independent central review, was also significantly higher with durvalumab (28.4% versus 16.0%; P<0.001). At a median follow-up of 33.3 months, updated OS remained improved (stratified HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.86) [3]. A post hoc exploratory analysis of the mature survival data, requested by licensing authorities, observed that benefit with durvalumab was not evident in patients with PD-L1 expression <1%. The significance of this observation is disputed [4]. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were slightly more common with durvalumab (29.9% versus 26.1%). Pneumonia was the most common grade 3/4 AE and was observed in 4.4% of patients in the durvalumab group and 3.8% of patients in the placebo group. About 29% of patients in the durvalumab group experienced serious AEs compared with 22.6% of the placebo arm. Grade 3/4 pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% of the durvalumab group and 2.6% of the placebo group. Overall, safety was similar and durvalumab had no detrimental effect on patient-reported outcomes. Quality of life was evaluated as a secondary outcome and no benefit was observed [5]. Recommendation The consolidation administration of the immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab 1 to 42 days after the end of chemoradiotherapy has demonstrated a survival benefit in unresectable stage III NSCLC and is recommended in patients whose tumours express PD-L1 on 1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (as per the EMA approved indication {[I, A; European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: 4] in the intention to treat population across all PD-L1 categories}.
