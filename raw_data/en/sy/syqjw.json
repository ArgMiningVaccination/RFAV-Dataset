Therefore, this systematic review focuses mainly on children. Medical therapy, especially stimulants, can have many side effects. Our systematic review aims to evaluate the potential of other non-medical treatment options for ADHD, such as yoga or meditation. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as databases for this systematic review. Using different combinations of medical subheadings (MeSH) and key terms, followed by the application of several inclusion/exclusion criteria and filters to narrow down our search. From an initial 51,675 articles, we selected 10 papers that passed our screening process and quality check to analyze in depth. Yoga and meditation positively affect various symptoms in children with ADHD, including attention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior. If done in family group sessions, it also benefited the parents and family dynamics, suggesting a potential option for family therapy. Furthermore, other psychological symptoms, such as anxiety or low self-esteem, appeared to be positively impacted by these interventions. Although yoga and meditation positively influenced children with ADHD, a more in-depth research is necessary with a more significant number of participants and over a more extended period of time. The results of the included studies suggest a substantial benefit. Nonetheless, as the number of studies is limited, at present yoga and meditation could be beneficial as supplemental therapy rather than being used alone as a therapy for ADHD.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-03-14", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
