A copy of the draft Final report of the COT Lowermoor subgroup (LSG) is attached at Annex A for final approval by the COT. 2. The LSG was established in 2001 to advise Health and Environment ministers on the possible long term heal th effects arising from a 1988 water pollution incident in North Cornwall. The te rms of reference of the Subgroup were: \"To advise on whether the exposure to chemicals resulting from the 1988 Lowermoor water pollution incident has caused, or is expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health; and \" To advise whether the existing progra mme of monitoring and research into the human health effects of the incident should be augmented and, if so, to make recommendations.\" 3. The Lowermoor water pollution in cident occurred on 6 July 1988 at the Lowermoor water treatment works near Camelf ord, North Cornwall. A contractor's relief tanker driver put 20 t onnes of aluminium sulphate into the water supply at the works. Water supplies to an estimated 20,000 people were polluted with aluminium, sulphate and other metals dissolved from pipework and plumbing materials (copper, lead, zinc and iron). Flushing of the distribution system to remove the contaminated water resulted in the disturbance of ol d mains sediments, mainly deposits of iron and manganese oxid es, leading to contamination of the water with raised concentrations of these metals. 4. Two previous investigations have cons idered the health implications of the incident. Their conclusions, and the backg round to the current investigation, are given in Chapter 2 of the LSG report under 'Historical Perspective'. Chapters 3 to 6 discuss the information available to the Subgroup on water contaminant concentrations and, hence, possible exposures , on the toxicity of the chemicals of interest, and on the epidemiological and other studies carried out on the local population. The Subgroup also conducted in terviews with 54 people who were in the area at the time of t he contamination and received written information from another 59 (see Chapter 5). Please note that paragraph 5.182 may require a little revision following receipt of two recent literature papers. If so, this will be presented at the COT meeting. 5. The conclusions are given in Chapters 7 and 8. Chapter 7 is a discussion of the implications for health of the cont aminants in relation to modelled and measured levels of exposure. Chapter 8 gives the Subgroup's opinion on whether the adverse health effects which have been reported by some individuals who received the water were caused by expos ure to the contaminants involved. Recommendations for further wo rk are given in Chapter 9. 6. The COT has discussed the report previously on two occasions. In April 2005 it discussed the draft report which wa s out to consultation. Few comments were made by Members. The Committee di scussed the then draft Final Report in October 2007 as reserved business. Memb ers were informed that there had been a severe case of confirmed congophilic angiopathy which occurred at an early age in an individual who was resident in Cornwa ll at the time of the contamination incident in 1988. Higher than usual le vels of aluminium had been found in the brain. The case was referred to t he West Somerset coroner who had opened an inquest into the death of the individual. The minutes of the 2007 meeting are attached at Annex B for Members' information. 7. Following correspondence with the Coroner, and rece ipt of legal advice, completion and publication of the Subgr oup report was then deferred until the Coroner's proceedings were completed. T he inquest finally ended in March 2012. Given the time since the COT last saw the report, it was considered appropriate to bring the draft Final version back to the COT for approval. The major changes since 2007 are as follows: The case of the individual who was t he subject of the Coroner's inquest is discussed in further detail in parag raph 5.137 - 5.149, and the Coroner's verdict is included. This section al so discusses work commissioned by the Coroner into the metal content and pat hology of tissues from 60 postmortem brains donated as part of the MRC st udy on Cognitive Function and Aging. The Coroner's verdict is attached at Appendix 20. Chapter 6 and Appendices 26 - 27 undate the information on aluminium from the scientific literat ure from 2007 to May 2012. Chapter 6 refers to the recent JECFA assessments of alumin ium and lead. The section on metal- metal interactions is also updated, with a review at Appendix 29. Chapter 7 is updated slightly to reflect the changes in Chapter 6. Chapter 8, paragraph 8. 40 provides the Subgr oup's comments on the Coroner's case. Chapter 9 and Appendix 30 provide detailed recommendations worked up with appropriate experts for the neur opsychological an d neuropathological investigations recommended prev iously by the Subgroup. 8. Members will wish to know that t he two local representatives, who were appointed to the Subgroup in 2002 by the lo cal MP Paul Tyler (now Lord Tyler) resigned at the Subgroup's final meeting on 16 October 2012. Written statements have been received from both members. Question for Members 9. COT members are asked whether they have any remaining comments on the Final Report and whether they ar e content for it to be published.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Peter Stewart DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 Page 12 of 213 A Case Study In Human Aluminium Toxicity. Background. The subject was employed in an aluminium remelting plant in the period from February 1996 until December 1998. The plant processed 1200 tonnes/month of aluminium by ingot melting, continuous casting, rolling reduction, annealing, drawing, winding, & scrap reprocessing. Occupational contamination levels were not dete rmined at the time of exposure; however, anecdotal evidence of exposure relates that after being in the plant for more than 20 minutes, a film of oil and metal dust would be present on the skin, and that the plant contained a visible haze. In July 1996 the subject presented to the on- site medical centre complaining of fatigue. Blood glucose was tested and the random result was 4.91 mmol/l, a normal result with no indications of diabetes. In May 1998 the subject's health had deteriorated, so he attended a private hospital health assessment centre for a full check-up. The symptoms evident were gastro-intestinal (IBS), fatigue, and increased number of respiratory infections. Blood test results indicated mildly elevated liver enzymes (GGT and ALT), characteristic of Non Alcoholic Liver Disease (NALD), and anisocytosis, reflected in a high RDW. The problem was incorrectly diagnosed as due to lif estyle factors, and no further tests were conducted. At the same time the subject had been experiencing significant problems with neurological dysfunction, as indicated by short-term memory, decision making, mood, irritability, aggressiveness, and anxiety. There is no history of any other exposure to aluminium. The local water authority has regularly tested for aluminium as per their quality assurance program, and low levels are maintained. There have been no incidences of chemical overdosing to the water supply, or use of Al-based antacids. Discovery. In 2003 the subject contracted cellulitis, which was taking a long time to heal. In the investigation of the reason for the delayed healing, a hair sample was taken on the 16th July 2003 and submitted for mineral analysis. The result reported for Aluminium was 248 parts per million (ppm). The reference interval established by the laboratory in accordance with normal clinical laboratory protocol is less than 18 ppm. A recheck of the result was performed and confirmed prior to release of the data. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 Page 13 of 213 The test was conducted by Trace Elements Inc. (TEI), which is a licensed and certified clinical laboratory that undergoes regular inspections with Clinical Laboratory Division of the Dept. of Health and Human Services, HCFA, USA. Analysis is by ICP-Mass Spectrometry (Sciex Elan 6100) methodology for all trace element determinations. The laboratory is equipped with a trace element class clean room utilizing HEPA filtration systems. The level of Al in the range reported (248 ppm) is found in less than 0.04% within the population tested of over 27,000 patient samples (samples obtained in accordance with established collection protocol) processed by the laboratory. Subsequently the initial hair tissue mineral analysis was supported by tests of other tissues including Toenail, Fingernail, Foot Skin, Semen, and Underarm Hair, with other laboratories, and over a significant period of time. Refer to Graph One for the results mapped over the duration of stage one chelation. In order to confirm the likely source of exposure, semen from 2000 was tested and allowed the construction of the probable contamination curve. The aluminium levels are consistent with a biological half-life of 3 years, and indicate that the level of tissue contamination in 1998 would have been about three times the level detected in 2003. Refer to Graph Two for the backward projection of aluminium levels. Exposure Estimate. Exposure is estimated using actual and estimated physical conditions: Assumed airborne contamination Level, 15 mg/m3 Elevated temperature environment due metal remelting High breathing rates due heat, activity, & level of contamination. Respiration, 10 breaths/minute Lung Volume, 4.5 litres at end, (5.7 litres at start) Duration, 10 hours/day, 50% presence, 1074 days Uptake, at saturation conditions, 15% Total uptake over 3 years = 32,622 mg. Half Life, (non-repeating exposure) = 3 years Calculated body burden 5 years after exp. = 10,765 mg. Exposure is compared to projections based on tissue test results: Tissue tests, (mean) = 102 mg/kg Body weight = 140 kgs. Calculated body burden from tests = 10,529 mg. Hypothetical Clearance of Sequestered Aluminium: Based on possible biological clearanc e rates for aluminium, the following projection can be made for the reduction in sequestered tissue levels between 1998 and 2003: Av. Biological Fluids Al Content = 6.55 ppm, 5/9/2003 Urinary Clearance at this Rate = 17,930 mg Sweat Clearance, (0.3 l/day) = 3,586 mg (impaired) DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 Page 14 of 213 Hair Tissue Clearance = 16.25 mg Nails Tissue Clearance = 15.00 mg Faecal Clearance, (from 3.1) = 3.3 mg/day = 6,022 mg Calculated Clearance over 5 years = 27,569 mg. Calculated body burden from hypothetical clce = 5,053 mg . The clearance of sequestered aluminium from the body is consistent with the calculated half-life, the tissue test results, and the occupational exposure, with the hypothetical clearance being higher than the actual clearance due to the mobilisation at the time of fluids testing (5/9/2003). The Estimated Occupational Exposure exceeds the Recommended Tolerable Weekly Intake (RTWI) of 7 milligrams per Kg body weight for all age groups, as set by the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, (JECFA), by a significant amount, (being factor 3.37). Adverse Health Effects. Adverse health effects from aluminium, experienced by the subject both at exposure, and during chelation, and also reported in medical research are as follows: Psychological dysfunction, tested by QEEG 17/6/2003 Cognitive Impairment, tested by ERP 24/10/2003 CNS Balance Disturbance, tested 26/2/2004 Cognitive Impairment, tested 8/4/2004 Gastro Intestinal disturbance (IBS) Intestinal Flora Imbalance and Leaky Gut Anisocytosis and Haemolytic Anaemia Lymphocytopenia Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ction, as per SPA 9/4/2004 Sperm Morphology, Head Defects, as per SCSA 3/5/2004 Renal Impairment Hepatic Impairment Solar Hyperkeratosis from sweat gland exudation of Al Neuropsychological Testing revealed a pattern of dysfunction which had some similar findings to that of Altmann (19), in a retrospective study of people exposed to contaminated drinking water at Camelford, who found reduced performance on psychomotor speed relative to estimated premorbid IQ, which could not be attributed to anxiety. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 Page 15 of 213 Reproductive Effects. Metals in semen appear to inhibit the function of enzymes contained in the acrosome, the membrane that covers the head of the sperm. The effect is to disrupt the acrosome reaction and inhibit capacitation. The enzyme acrosin, contained in non-reacted acrosome, is thought to have a role in dige stion of the sperm path through the zona pellucida, or in the zona binding process. The acrosome reaction occurs following tight binding to the ZP3 receptor located on the zona pellucida of the oocyte and is a prerequisite for the fertilisation process. Sp erm that acrosome-react prematurely will be unable to bind to the zona pellucida. Sperm which are unable to bind to the oocyte and/or unable to acrosome-react, will also be unable to fertilise the oocyte, Dana (74). The study of Aluminium in Finnish Men, Hovatta (1), found a definite correlation between aluminium in the spermatozoa and motility and morphology of the spermatozoa, but there was no correlation between the co ncentration of aluminium in the seminal plasma and the semen analysis parameters. In addition, \"The semen analysis of the three men with clearly the highest aluminium concentrations in their spermatozoa, (from 8.7 to 21.5 ppm), showed asth enozoospermia in all three cases, (A + B motilities from 16 to 46%)\". In this case the subject recorded an aluminium level of 16.7 ppm in 2000, which is of both semen and spermatozoa, and scored an A + B motility of 53% in 2004. Morphology in 2000 was unknown, and in 2004 was unusually low. In a study of seminal plasma metal levels, Dawson (45), found an inverse relation between aluminium in seminal plasma and sperm viability. Apparently the presence of the metal in the seminal plasma exerts a toxic effect on sperm. The subject's reproductive status is therefore consistent with aluminium toxicity in the period c2000 to the current day. Current Situation. The chelation of aluminium continues in a pulsed manner as allowed by the renal and hepatic capacity. Although the level is within the reference range, it rebounds after the chelation run, indicating that tissue stores still exist. The test of removal will be the no-rebound test, plus a clear brain scan using the PET isotope PIB C-11, which is said to be capable of detecting neural plaques and is currently under clinical trials.

Dear Sir, Please allow me to correct so me misconceptions that are e xpressed in this article: The level of heavy metals in blood or urine will only reflec t a recent exposure since the liver, kidn ey, and spleen perform an e ffective filtration function, An overload of a me tal entering the bloods tream will be sequest ered into tissues and organs, including the brain. The body will excret e the metal with tissues as they grow-out, but will not re-metabolise it into blood without chelation, In all cases of a significant ly abnormal reading that is being used as the basis of chelation therapy, the result s hould be validate d by a retest, In Case One involvi ng dyslexia , there is a low-level overload of twice the reference range. It is noted; \"the pa tient did not receive any treatment and developed normally thereafter\", confirms the overload grew-out naturally, In Case Two involving epilepsy or autism, the actual metal le vels are not cited. It is noted; \"The child showed no signs or symptoms sugg estive of metal poisoning, and gave no history of exposure to heav y metals\". Autism itself is a possible indicator of metal poisoning, and the firs t check for a 3-yo would be to perform the same test on the mother, In Case Three involving feed ing problems and drowsiness, the actual metal levels are not cited. They may not have been the main problem, A real case study is attached and is se lf-explanatory. The pr oblem would not have been diagnosed without hair analysis. I suggest that all practition ers consider hair analysis as a valuable tool if used co rrectly, and recognise that blood and urine analyses are not suitable screening tools for past me tal exposures. Yours sincerely, Peter Stewart. Report References, Yosh inaga (1990), (two papers). Dear Sir, Please note our comments regarding the research articles referenced: 1. Interrelationship between th e concentrations of some elements in the organs of Japanese with special reference to selenium-heavy me tal relationships, Yoshinaga et al, 1990. In the elemental concentrations between organs, there is generally good correlation, with the following predictable exceptions: i. Cadmium accumulates in the liver and kidneys. ii. Copper accumulates in the liver. iii. Iron accumulates in th e liver, and to a lesse r extent, the kidneys. iv. Selenium accumulates in the liver and kidneys, v. Mercury accumulates in the liver and kidneys, vi. Zinc accumulates in the liver and kidneys. There were also some non -predictable exceptions: i. Calcium was lower than the RR in all tissues exce pt the kidney, ii. Potassium readings are all about 20 times norm al hair RR, iii. Sodium levels are all about 10 times normal hair RR, iv. Phosphorus levels are all about 15 times normal hair RR, v. Zinc was lower than the RR in all tissues except as noted above. The study purports to identify correlations betw een the antioxidants Zn & Se, and the toxic elements Hg & Cd in human organs , particularly the liver & kidney, and achieves th is. However, there were some unusual levels obtained for essential el ements that warrant furt her investigation. The causes of the deaths were not given in this paper. The study does show there is a good correlatio n between elemen t levels in di fferent organs , including brain, & al so accumulation in kidney & liver. 2. Lack of significantly positive correlat ions between elemen tal concentrations in hair and in organs, Yoshinaga et al, 1990. Original statistical data appeared in the study in (1) above. Rib data was added from another study wh ich was not reviewed, Please note that individual readings were NOT suppli ed, and abnormal readings do not appear to have been eliminated or validated, Magnesium hair readings are co nsistent with tissue readings, Phosphorus readings are consistent with normal hair RR, (tissues high), Calcium readings for tissues are in fact low. The hair statistical result is high, due probably to a max reading of 7 times normal. Otherwise there is probably reasonable correlation betw een the hair and tissue readings, DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 44 Iron hair readings are cons istent with tissue readings, Copper readings are consis tent, with some distorti on by a high value/s, Zinc in hair is normal, although low in all tissues, Selenium is consistent with a mean of all tissues, The method of statistical analysis is totally inappropriate for the purpose of the study. Abnormal readi ngs do not appear to have been filtered out or validated. Correlation analysis shou ld be performed on each series, and then condensed. The analysis for this study should be repeated using a more appropriate methodology, Hair samples were taken of distal hair and the leng th of the hair sample was NOT CONSTANT for all subjects. Normally hair length may vary from 10mm in males to 300 mm+ in females. At a gr owth rate of about 3-5 mm/week, the time delay between hair sample and analysis could be anything from 1.0 week to 1.5 years, compared to a notional delay of 1.0 week for tissue samples, Even though the hair elem ental readings are cons istent with the tissue readings (except calciu m and phosphorus), and th e quoted hair reference ranges, there are abnor malities in the data. Due to the faulty hair samp ling protocol, th is study is fatally flawed and should be discounted as a reference. Reworking of the analysis is not possible from the data supplied. Yours sincerely, Peter Stewart. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 45COT Lowermoor Subgroup Report Response Source Appendix 16 includ es the document: \"Report On Toxicity Of Aluminium. An update of the 1997 WHO IPCS Repo rt with emphasis on neurotoxicity.\" This will be referred to by the designation RTA. In the RTA, some of the conclusions detailed in th e original docu ment, which is WHO EHC-194, 1997, appear to have been ed ited out. In EHC-194 , the toxicity of aluminium is clearly acknowledged in certain risk populations, and those popula tions are as follows: o Impaired renal function o Occupationally exposed o Premature infants The definition of Risk Population is therefore determined by the probability of an accumulation , not by any inherent differenc es in the biokinetics of the metal or the exposure situation. In addition, it is acknowledg ed in 1.10, 8.6, and 11.1 that al uminium causes the following serious conditions: o Encephalopathy / neurotoxicity o Vitamin-D resistant osteomalacia o Microcytic anaemia There is NO indication that aluminium does NOT follow the no rmal dose dependent relationship for a toxin, ranging from the NOEL, to acute & toxic iatrogenic exposure during dialysis, cau sing encephalopathy. There is every indica tion in the research that the e ffects of aluminium are linear within the effective band between th e NOEL and the saturation level. Therefore, the requir ement for demonstration of the toxic effects of aluminium in any person is the validation of elevated aluminium levels , which will be in tissues rather than serum fo r delayed testing scenarios. 2. Implications For Lowermoor The Lowermoor incident reflects a poor evidence profile in regard to primary levels contributing to the exposure. This ar ose due to the incorrect analysis of the initial water problem, its' short duration & hi gh intensity, the distributed nature of the effects, the operation of li ne flushing, and other factors. Given that there are no reliable blood or urine results that focus on the peak exposure period, the meas ure of exposure must be tissue test results. So, for example, the neur opsychological tests very clearly indicate abnormal results in exposed pe rsons, & the effect is MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), which is on the damage scale from zero to dialysis encephalopathy. Therefore, the conclu sion in 1.14 that; \"It is not antici pated that the increased exposure to aluminium would have cause d, or would be expected to cause, DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 46delayed or persistent harm to health in those who were adults or toddlers at the time of the incident...\" is not consistent with the evidence . In addition, the statement in 1.22 that; \"On the basis of the available data, it is not anticipated that the combination of meta ls which occurred as a result of the pollution incident would have caused or would be expected to cause delayed or persistent additive or sy nergistic effects\" is un supportable, in that no epidemiological studies have tested or re ported the particular scenario, and the Report has ignored the r ecent studie s by Bush et al., and Exley et al., that identify iron, zinc, copper, and aluminium as c ontributors to the amyloid cascade in neurodegeneration. 3. Effects Of The Poisoning There is a serious la ck of hard data in regard to the reported symptoms. The symptoms reported included neuropsychological effects, joint pains and/or swelling, nail problems, can cer, thyroid disease, malais e, tiredness, exhaustion, dry thirst, sensitization, skin problems, gastro problems, arr hythmia, diabetes, & reproductive problems. For example, tiredness and exhaustion are symptoms of haemolytic anaemia caused by aluminiu m poisoning, yet no data has been presented of actual test resu lts. All of the symptoms liste d are linked by research and/or reports to aluminium. It is stated in 1.26 that \"There is no indication fro m the toxicological data that the estimated exposures to the contaminants which occurre d after the incident can cause effects on joints, and it is not possible to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the joint pains and/or swelling reported and exposure to the contaminants.\" It is an undisputable fact that metals cause lipid peroxidation, and in so doing, interfere with the essential fatty acid casca de. Since it is this cascade that is responsible for pr ostaglandin production and inflammati on on a large scale (and not related to infection), the associ ation between aluminium and joint pains is highly probable. Research clearly identifies a link betw een aluminium and skin problems, which would give rise to a condition sim ilar to eczema or derm atitis in certain individuals. In regard to cancer, the size of the aluminium dose may be such that the metal will grow out before it can initiate a canc er. Brain deposits of aluminium are a different problem, th ey do not grow out; they cause neur al degeneration and premature ageing, and most certainly contribute in so me way to the onset of dementias. Aluminium is associated wi th a decrease in ly mphocyte count. I do not recall any results of lymphocyte subs et testing in the Report. The onset of lymphocytopenia represents a severely depre ssed immune condition with a high risk of infection, and hence the link to leukaemia. The statement that \"t he pollution in cident did not cause an increased incidence of infection\" does not seem consistent with the patient feedback. The neuropsychological test results from Altmann are consistent with the toxicity profile for aluminium as stated in WHO EHC-194, an d summarized in 5.111 \"The DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT of abnorma lities seen was similar to findings they had previously described in \"alumi nium loaded but asymptomatic patients undergoing dialysis\" (Altmann et al, 1989; Altmann, 1991). The authors also concluded \"these studies sugg est the participants responded to (their) tests, as a group, in a manner compatible with the pres ence of organic brai n disease and in a way similar to dialysis patie nts exposed to aluminium\". 4. Estimation Of The Contamination The water sampling conducted by SWWL was flawed and th e data is therefore not reliable. As stated in the Report: o In the case of the 2-mi nute flush sample, most of the contaminants from the domestic pipework (c opper, lead or zinc) would have been flushed away before the sample was taken. Therefore, the monitoring data for these metals for water from the cold tap may not have revealed the highest concentrations that occurr ed after the incident. o The exact location of the sampling sites was not s upplied to us as South West Water Ltd consider that they ca nnot supply the na mes of customers at the address from which the sample was taken or information which could identify the customers The data from other sources may be more re liable than that fro m modeling. As per the Report: \" The highest aluminium an d sulphate concentratio ns were recorded in a sample collected at a farm in Helstone near St Teath at 5. 00 am on 7 July 1988. This contained 620 mg aluminium/l and 4, 500 mg sulphate/l. This sample also contained 9.0 mg zinc/l, the highest concen tration recorded in the immediate post- incident period.\" In contrast, it was stated: \"BVCs conclude d: \"Given that this is the only major anomaly with the modeling re sults, it raises se rious doubt about the validity of the sample.\"\" Modeling had predicted that the peak outlet concentration entering the network would be 325 ppm. In the case of reservoir mixing, the following scenario would apply, which is consistent with the Helstone test. The capacity of the tr eated water reservoir is approximately 2,300 cubi c metres (m3), but it was believ ed at the time to be about 60% full, (1,380 m3 water). Therefore, if all the added aluminium sulphate were completely mixed into this volume, the maximum concentratio n in the reservoir would have been approximately 615 ppm of aluminium and 3, 300 mg sulphate/l. (Crowther Clayton Associates, 2003). The WHO utilizes 2 litres/day as the standard consumption of drinking water. At the concentration derived above, the dail y dose of aluminium would have been 615 ppm X 2 Litres /day = 1230 mg. The WHO recommended maximum daily allowance of aluminium is 7 mg/kg bw/ day, applied to a notiona l 60 kg person, equates to a RDA of 420 mg/day. Consequently, the RDA has been exceeded by a factor of 3 , reflecting the sequestration into tissues and the elevated tissue test results. The ATSDR Minimal Risk Le vel Publication (MRL) Ja n 2003, cites the MRL for aluminium as 2.0 mg /kg/day with an endpoint ed as \"neurological\". 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 48exposure has exceeded the MRL by a factor of 10 and has resulted in adverse neurological consequences for many of those exposed. 5. Tissue Test Results Tissue test results deta ils are generally not av ailable. For example: \u0083 Taylor (1990) \u0083 Ward (1989) \u0083 Ward (1990) \u0083 Cross (1990) b \u0083 Powell (1995), & does not indicat e they tested for aluminium \u0083 Howard (1993), but positive corre lation concluded Other tissue test results have shown po sitive, but source data is not provided: \u0083 Eastwood (1990) reported positive and discre te bone stai ning in exposed healthy individuals \u0083 McMillan (1993) repo rted that th e stainable al uminium had disappeared within 18 mont hs in normal individuals In the Report, se ction 5.40, it is stated: \" Dr Newman also repo rted that he arranged for \"approximately 435\" patients to give samp les of blood, hair, nails and/or saliva for analyses by Dr Neil Ward of the Un iversity of Surrey (see paragraph 5.150). These were tested fo r concentrations of metals (Newman, personal communication, 2002). \" This data was availabl e in summary from only. The results are discussed in the Homeopathic Report, Appendix 4. Aluminium, copper, and lead all show elevated levels reflecting the contamination exposure, and the sequestration of elements into tissues. More detailed results are av ailable from the tissue testing of pigs at the piggery at Treburgett, and are repor ted in the document: \"Multielement tissue status of so ws exposed to aluminium in North Cornwall as a result of the Lo wermoor Water Treatment Works Incident\", N. I. Ward, Dept of Chemistry, Univ of Surrey. The data from these tests is comprehens ive and includes a control group with comparative testing. As an ticipated, the following results were characteristic: \u0083 Aluminium, copper, and lead were elevated in the kidneys and livers of the pigs \u0083 The elevated alum inium and copper levels were reflect ed in the hair results in a c onsistent manner \u0083 The elevated aluminium level was reflected in the bone results in a consistent manner \u0083 Corresponding reductions in iron and zinc ar e typical of active metal disturbances The conclusion drawn by Dr Ward is tota lly consistent with the data, and is as follows: \"In conclusion, these results supp ort the case that the chemical nature of the contaminated wat er supplies following the North Cornwall Lowermoor Water Trea tment Works incident is indicative of being res ponsible for the increased Al, Cu, and Pb levels found in the various body organs and tissues of these DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 49affected sows. Moreover, the toxicol ogical effects of such metals in a mixed cocktail of metal species caused imbalances in other essential metals (Zn and Fe) and thereby induced the various behavioural problems and health di sorders of those affected sows.\" The adverse health effects re ported for the sows associat ed with the exposure were reported as: \u0083 Failed matings \u0083 Decreased litter size \u0083 Higher post-nat al mortality \u0083 Reduced growth rate \u0083 Reduced feed conver sion efficiency \u0083 Increased culling of sub-standard breeders These effects are consistent with a toxic exposu re to metals. The continuation of effects after the event had passed is also indicative of the sequestration of metals into tissues extending their effects.

The references were reviewed an d commentary is as follows: \u0083 In Poon (2004) , there is an at tempt to correlate blood, serum, & urine metal levels with hair anal ysis, and of course there is NO essential relationship. Metals are filtered from the biological fluids and will appear normal within 30 days. Chelation was offered but not implemented. There may have been some correlation after chelation. \u0083 In Yoshinaga (1990) (1), heavy metals were analysed in internal organs to determine re lationships, and it was found that there was a correlation between Se & Zn and Hg & Cd, especially in the liver and kidney.

Those individuals re quire testing, treatment, and support until it is demonstrated that the effe cts are fully discharged. P Stewart 20 th April 2005. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 52Dear Frances, We recently were sent a copy of an email from you to Mrs. Sigmund, in which you stated that the study was a 'toxicological ri sk assessment' and e xpressed the view that examining patients' medical records would have been of no assistance in understanding the effects of the Lowermoor Incident. This has now been quoted by Dr. Exley, and must be regarded as being in the public domain. We strongly disagree with these statements. I have been carrying out risk assessments on a professional basi s for over 20 years, as an En vironmental Impact Assessor, and these frequently include health issues. A risk assessment, by definition, is a predictive exercise designed to avoi d future adverse effects. It is possible to interpret part of the Terms of Reference of the LS G study to incl ude this, in the sense that we were asked to assess whether or not future developments could be anticipated. However, the primary purpose of this study was to collect all available evidence on what had happened to people up to the time of our study. That cannot be described as a risk assessment. Nor did we anticipate that th e study would be regarded primarily as a toxicological assessment, and based almost en tirely on the scientific literature. As we have often said, this was a uni que incident and there has been continual political opposition to the full investigation, an d therefore publication, of any comprehensive accounts of it. The literatu re will inevitably be a highly defective source of data on which to rely. The first use of the term 'toxicological asse ssment' in the cont ext of the Lowermoor Incident that we have been able to identify was by Mr.Michael Wari ng, on 24th August 1988, in a letter to Dr. Grai nger at Truro. In this he expre ssed the remarkable view that the Lawrence Report was \" a toxico logical assessment\" of the incident that was \"to the point and, I believe , accurate\". The Lawrence Report was not a toxicological assessment. Its primary purpose was to inve stigate the ha ndling (or perhaps we should say, misha ndling) of the incident at the works, and estimate roughly what levels of aluminium might have existed in the water supply as a result. On both coun ts the Lawrence Report was defect ive but, in the case of his highly conservative estimate of the resultant pollution le vels, our own analysis of the SWWA water quality data ha s revealed just how inaccurate his a ssessment was. Yet Mr. Waring's idiosyncratic asse ssment of the value of the La wrence Report as a basis to assess the toxicological risks arising from the incident appears to have fo rmed the basis for all subsequent dismissive view s expressed by the DoH ever since. This highly un reliable conclusion has been incorp orated into the Executive Summary of the Draft Report. It was al so leaked to the media tw o days before the official release of the Draft, attrac ting a substantial amount of concern both amongst the people of North Cornwall and the scientific community, and compromising the reputations of the me mbers of the LSG. Peter and I are extremely disturbed with sections of the statements contained in the Executive Summary that we believe to be in consistent with the evidence collected by the LSG. We note with extreme concern th at the absence of ad equate evidence or scientific understanding is , in a number of cases, assume d to imply not only the absence of risk th at a future advers e effect may occur, but wo rse, to suggest that DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 53existing symptoms reported by the public are almo st certainly unrelated to exposure to the contamination. It is our position th at the Lowermoor Incident must be treated as a serious industrial accident, and investigated as such. After any such inci dent, examination of those involved must be collected an d evaluated, thor oughly and impartially . In the case of chemical accidents , this always requires full medi cal investigation of those exposed to contact. Since this crucial and elemen tary response has sti ll not been complied with by the health sector, it is essential that this study should now take on this responsibility. We have recently received a communication from Dr. Ex ley expressing similar concern,. He indicates that ev en now suitable medical investigations could be carried out to identify thos e who may still carry a body burden of alum inium. Any that do may have an increased risk of developing aluminium-related pa thological conditions in the future. We th erefore consider that the current Consultation Period must not be regarded as the end of the road for this investigation, and that further direct investigations of both the medical records and of the people expose d to the incident should now be instigat ed. Until all of the remaining evidence - or at least enough to provide a valid assessment - ha s been collected and weighed, the health effects of this industrial acci dent will rema in unverified. In the light of these recent developments, we have prepared a review of the Executive Summary. We have identified t hose - generally very short - sections of the statements included in it on which we have reservations, and provided our pers pectives on how these may require amendment in the final version. These comments are designed to be helpful, not destructive, an d we trust that they will be accepted in that spirit. External criticism of the Draft is liable to be based purely on what is included within it. For scientific assessments this is to be expected. Bu t in identifying any perceived defects in the Draft, public concern is lia ble to include critic ism that the LSG has taken a particular approach to the study th at is perhaps inadequa te. We consider that it is impossible to understan d the context of the study adequately w ithout a clear knowledge of the histor ic and current political constrai nts that operat e upon the work of the LSG. We have therefor e included a section that prov ides at least some of the background to the incide nt, identifying defects in the pa st response fro m the health sector that have led to the appalling shortage of monitoring date th at has been such an obstacle to the work of the LSG. Finally, we feel that the r ecommendations provided in the Draft do not go nearly far enough. Sociological impacts of this incident affect the me ntal health a nd well-being of a substantial number of people with in the local popul ation that we represent. We are concerned that there is no recognition of the need for social action, in addition to purely medical, in dealing with the effects of this incident. We ha ve therefore provided some additional s uggestions about wh at needs to be learned from this incident and its mishandling, so that lessons for future responses may be learned. Doug Cross and Peter Smith Doug Cross, Fore nsic Ecologist DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 54A Review of the Executive Summary of th e Lowermoor Sub-Group's Draft Report of February 2005. Doug Cross and Peter Smith - Local Representatives CoT - Lowermoor Sub-Group 3rd April 2005 Statement by the authors. It is not common practice for memb ers of a specialist group to is sue a dissenting version of a consensual document pr oduced by the group . Past reviews of the e ffects of the Lowermoor Incident have been controversial, and the pres ent study aimed to correct the deficiencies of the earlier studies and shed ne w light upon the incident and its medical effects. In the circumstances, we feel that the LSG has pr ovided a far better a ssessment of probable exposure levels than has ever been made before. However, in our view, the wording of the Executive Summ ary of the Draft Report of the Lowermoor Sub-Group (LSG) of the Committee on Toxicity (CoT) provides unacceptably optimistic conclusions regarding the long-term medical effects of the incident of July 1988. Whilst these statements reflect to some degree the arguments set out in the main text of the Draft, they nevertheless sugges t a degree of unanimity of opinion regarding the interpretation of the evidence available to the LSG th at is unjustified. In reviewing the evidence, too much reli ance has been placed by the LSG on the toxicological literature in order to assess whether or not the effe cts of ill health reported by the people are consistent with published reports on th e toxicology of the relevant substances. As a unique incident, no literat ure sources are entirely relevant , and only clini cal assessment of those still affected by medi cal conditions that they associ ate with exposu re can provide conclusive data on which a true assessment of the impacts of the incident can be made. The LSG has effectively igno red this source of data , refusing to examine medical records unless specifically provided by those gi ving personal evid ence. Even then, no cr itical debate of the validity and implications of such records has been held in LSG meetings. As a result, where caution is me rited, dismissive reassurances are provided. Where lack of knowledge prevents vi able scientific conclu sions being drawn, opti mistic value judgements are offered. Where inconvenient evidence emerges, it is disc arded as unrepresentative of predicted impacts and values. Discrepancy between the study objectives an d the approach of the Department of Health. We believe that the Executive Summary was compil ed by the DoH Secret ariat. It contains generalizations that are incompat ible with evidence provided to the LSG, but th at reflect the adamant refusal of the DoH to acknowledge that this incide nt could have had any serious medical repercussions. The stubborn refusal of the DoH to admit that any seri ous toxic threat wa s implied by the incident has a long history. The first reference th at we have been able to trace in which this attitude is evident is a letter dated 24th August 1988, fro m Mr. Michael Waring, Senior Medical Officer at the DoH. Wr iting to Dr. C R Grainger at The Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Health Authority, he refers to the Lawren ce Report of A ugust 1988 as \" a toxicological assessment\" of the incide nt that was \"to the poi nt and, I believe, ac curate\". At around this DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 55time he circulated a letter to the residents of the area as suring them that no adverse medical effects were likely, yet he appear s not to have cited any toxicol ogical authority to support this claim. In fact Dr. Lawrence's Report wa s nothing of the kind. It inve stigated the incident in its context as an industr ial accident, and pr ovided an initial rough but extremely inaccurate estimate of the extent of the level of contamin ation, based largely on what few records were available from SWWA water sample analyses . The approach adopted by Mr. Waring is consistent with official DoH policy regard ing the incident, at that time and since. In the new Draft, this attitude re-emerges. It re peatedly offers value-la den judgements that are inconsistent with a disintereste d assessment of the evidence pres ented to the LSG, as does the Press Release issued by the Department of Heal th (DoH) two days befo re the release of the Draft. Both assure readers that adverse health effects are not expected to occur. This implies that it is possible to judge the relative prob abilities of adverse effect s developing or not. LSG members have repeatedly stated that there are often insufficient data, or too much scientific uncertainty, to allow them to make any realisti c assessments of the leve l of probability of the risk of delayed e ffects developing. Such optimism is inappropriate in the face of evidence provided to the LSG over the past three years. Indeed, members have felt it ap propriate to recommend renewed studies of selected groups of pe ople exposed to the incident, particularly wi th respect to neuropsychological c onditions and the achievements and we lfare of children exposed to the contamination. In our view, clai ming that the LSG holds opinion s that imply a higher level of certainty than the data justif y misrepresents the views of me mbers. It is mischievous and unacceptable. What was the real objective of this study? Within the last few days the reason for the dichotomy between the intent of the original Terms of Reference for the Sub-Group's study an d the approach adopted by the Secretariat in the preparation of the Dr aft Report's Executive Summary has become clea r. In response to an inquiry from a member of the public the Se cretariat stated, \"The committee took at face value the informat ion which members of the public told them about their health. Members did not consider that there was a need to confirm what they were told by looking at medical notes or by commissioning medical assessments, neither was this the purpose of the investigation. Th e assessment made by the committee was a toxicological risk assessment, in which the key questions were: 1. what levels of exposure we re individuals likely to have had to the contaminants and, 2. given what is known about the to xicity of the contaminants, were they likely to have caused harm to health at these exposures. Medical notes and clinical inves tigations of individuals claimi ng persistent ill-health would not have assisted in this risk assessment.\" (DoH Secretariat, 17th March 2005) This is the first indication th at we have had that the DoH c onsidered this study to be a toxicological risk asse ssment. The statement be ars a disturbing simila rity to th e ill-founded view expressed by War ing about the Lawrence Report almost sixteen years ago. However, the quote above is the key to understanding the root of ou r concern about the general direction of this Draft. The firs t Term of Reference fo r the LSG's work ires it to examine 56whether or not the incident \"caused, or was like ly to cause, delayed or persistent harm to human health\". The key issue was not, was exposure \"likely to have caused harm to health\", but did it actually do so in the past, and on the basis of that ev idence, is it poss ible that it will do so in the future? A risk assessment is pr edictive; except as a purely academ ic exercise it cannot refer to a historic event. Motorway crashes are not investig ated as 'risk assessments', but as analyses of facts, based on verifiable forensic evidence collected about the in cident. The Lowermoor Incident should be analysed in exactly the same way, and this is clearly implied by the first Term of Reference. Also, in order to carry out a risk assessment of th e possible future implications of a histor ic event, the assessors must always draw upon th e actual historic case evidence to validate its conclusions. In examin ing the effects of a chem ical accident such as this, it is imperative that the medical condition of those exposed to its should be investigated by expert toxicologists in the relevant fields. To ignore such evid ence, particularly when the event und er examination wa s unique, is bad science. Attempting then draw unvalidated conclusions about a historic even t, and then to rely on these to extrapolate predictions as to what additional risks the exposed population may face in the future , is irresponsible. We agreed to work as Local Representatives on the assu mption that the LSG would examine all of the available evid ence, to decide if the reported health e ffects were real or not. We did not agree to make a theoretical and retrospec tive analysis of the ri sk of a toxicological response developing, especially one that relied heavil y on published literature sources but not the actual medical records of the exposed population. This incident was un ique, and detailed analysis of it has been continually suppressed. In evitably, the scientific literature cannot be an adequate source of data on which to assess the its medical risks. Dr. Exley's recent criticism of the adequacy of the literature cited in the Draft implies that there may be additional sources of toxicological data so far unexamined by the LSG. This in no way invalidates our perspective that wit hout data specifical ly from this or a very similar incide nt, examination of the literature must always be subservient to examinatio n of the people themselves. The Sub-Group has in fact asse mbled a considerable amount of valuable data within the constraints of the scope of its brief and the inordinate delay in commissioni ng such work. But since no medical records have been examined, the Su b-Group has been fo rced to rely upon anecdotal evidence from individuals who think th at they have experienced some sort of adverse response to thei r exposure. This is not to decry the claims of those giving evidence - some, indeed, have been examined by repu table medical specialists, and can demonstrate real medical damage. But in strict ev idential terms, verb al evidence from unqualified victims of the incident is an unsatisfactory basis on which to attempt to es tablish the damage done and what may occur in future, just as eye-wi tness accounts from bysta nders at an accident mu st be treated with caution. Without detailed examination of actual medical reco rds this approach cannot develop a rigorous and scientific ally valid analysis. The validity of at least some (a nd therefore by association, all) of the medica l records of people claiming medical damage has apparently been compromised, and the practice of 'flagging' is so fraught with defects and inadequacies. We therefore have serious reservations about the va lidity of any analysis or risk assessment (whatever it may be called) that fails to look in critical deta il at the only ta ngible evidence available. 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 stigations of individuals claimi ng persistent ill-health would not have assist ed in this ri sk assessment.\" immediately raises a pertinent qu estion. If this is so, then why did the Sub-Gr oup spend so much time reviewing, and in many cases, reje cting or downgrading the validity of published data from those few such sources of direct medical and biochemical evidence as were accessible? We read the papers published by A ltmann, Miles, Exley, Ward, Macmillan, and many others, and even interviewed them pers onally. Now it appears that we may all have been simply wasting time, enga ging in displacement activity. We therefore stress that without professional (and now, independent) examination of those who appear to exhibit symptoms of a toxic syndrome, we believe that it is impossibl e to assess adequately the full extent of the actual medical damage caused by this incident. On such a flawed basis, no risk assessment (re trospective or otherwise) can ever be prepared. Without evidence, sc ience is powerless. Wit hout science, there can be no interpretation. Understanding the background of the Lowermoor Incident For a balanced underst anding of the impacts of the Lo wermoor Incident, an informed knowledge of its political context is essential. An appreciation of the ex traordinarily sustained political opposition to investigating the health effects and long-term im plications of exposure to the contaminat ed water reveals how dramatically the scop e of the study and its effectiveness have been co mpromised. The following no tes therefore summarize this neglected aspect of the background to the st udy, because they reveal the constr aints that exist on the work of the LSG in its a ttempts to obtain sufficient medi cal data to be able to draw viable conclusions. In the second part of this document, we have reviewed the statements contained in the Executive Summary of the Dr aft Report, in an effort to direct attention to possible alternative, and perhaps more balanced, interpre tations and the ex istence of confoundi ng eviden ce. The dissenting opinions expressed ar e entirely our own, and may no t be taken to represent those of any other member of the LSG. Where we di ssent, we have provided the substance of our arguments and the evidence on which we rely. All of this evidence has been presented to the LSG, yet some does not appear in the Draft, despite being ce ntral to the interpretation of evidence presented in th e Draft Report. In this review, we take the opportunity to place this additional evidence in the public domain, in the hop e that others better qualified than we may find it helpful in drawing their own conclusions, and that the Final Repo rt will provide a more reliable assessment of the hea lth effects of this incident. Our personal backgrounds. The authors of this documen t were appointed to the LS G in October 2001, on the recommendations of Mr. Paul Ty ler, MP for North Cornwall, and Mr. Michael Meacher, who was at that time Minist er for the Environment. Peter Smith is a Registered Homeopath, and has practiced with the people of North Cornwall for many year s. He is Chai rman of the Lowermoor Support Group , a local self-help body established to co mmunicate information amongst those affected by the in cident and to others who wished to be kept abreast of the progress of investigations. (Thi s privately-run self -help group should not be confused with the CoT Lowermoor Sub-Group, wh ich is referred to throughout as the LSG) DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 58 Douglas Cross is an in dependent professional Environmental Analyst and Forensic Ecologist, who was a resident of Camelford at the time of the Lowermoor Incident. He has extensive experience the investigation of environmental an d public health issues in water supply and water pollution incidents in many countries. He acts as a Team Lead er for International Development Agencies preparing Environmental Impact Assessments - i.e., predictive risk assessments - of a very wide range of developments. Our role as members of the Lowermoor Sub-Group Our role has been to provide local know ledge of the incide nt and facilitate contact between the LSG and the local community. Both of us had, and continue to acquire, detailed knowledge of the inci dent and of the effects experienced by some, but certai nly not by all, local people. Our experience of unacceptable water quality in the ar ea extends b ack many years, to well befo re the date of the incident itself (6th July 1988). After the event we both worked to salvage data that the public sector persistently ignor ed, and for many years we have continued to collect new information as it became available. We have no financial or other compromising intere sts in relation to this independent investigative work, or that could affect our position as members of the LSG. General comments on the political constraints on the Draft Report. The Draft Report of the LSG was pub lished in February 2005. It is not the final version, but a consultation document th at aims to provide a comprehensiv e interim review of all available data on the Lowermoor Incident that occurred on 6t h July 1988. This study began in October 2001, and 19 meetings were held in London and two in Camelford. In addi tion, four visits to Camelford were made between Ju ly 2002 and October 2003 to collect evid ence directly from local residents. Evidence was taken orally at both venues , as well as from written submissions, and additional res earch evidence came di rectly from some authors and from the literature. We provided data from our own records, as well as new evidence based on practical investigations duri ng the course of the study. Political obstruction and the scope of the LSG study. The consequences of the poli ticization on all investigatio ns related to the Lowermoor Incident have been dramatic, and it is impossible understand th is incident fu lly without a clear understanding of the pol itical dimension within which all subsequent officially sanctioned follow-up work has been rigidly co ntrolled. Members of the Lowermoor Support Group (that is, the loca l group, not the CoT sub- group) have been awar e throughout the entire life of this incident of covert attempts to bl ock or subvert i ndependent investigations of the incident and of its medical effects. Such misd irection has continued during the course of the LSG's study. The obstruction of ade quate (or indeed, of any) comprehensive medical investigation of the medical effects following the incident has made it impossible to obta in properly researched and analysed epidemiological or clinical data on the expo sed population. The Draft Report makes no significant comme nt on the effect of th is obstruction on the availability of relevant data. Yet many people were surp rised and alarmed that the original remit for the LSG's scope of work, that would have permitted it to take evidence on the handlin g of the incident, was summarily removed immediately after news of the study was first announ ced to the public. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 59This is not irrelevant: even now , sixteen years after the incident, we hear that legal actions initiated by some of those affect ed by the incident ar e being subjected to pr essure to desist. The question arises, precisely what (or whose) interests are threatened by providing victims of this incident with the comprehens ive medical attentio n and legal support that should have been available to them? We deplore these attempts to prevent the exposu re of unethical political objectives and of pr ofessional incompetence, especially as it appears to take precedence over determining the extent of the very real medical probl ems that some people exposed to the incident still experience. It is evident that these spoiling activities originated at a very high level within the Department of Health. But it is also clear that the water sector was implicated; water was a Government- managed asset, and the sector was under the control of the then Minister, Mr. Michael Howard. It was planned to privatize the industry 18 months later, and th e chaotic response to the incident within th e Water Authority undoubte dly alarmed many in Government. Pressure to carry out a covert damage limitation exer cise appears to have become a Government priority, through concern that expos ure of the startling incompet ence underlying the incident would damage the commercial value of the Water Authority. International implications - not just 'a minor local affair'. The exposure of the de fects in the management of the Lowermoor Water Treatment Works has played an impo rtant part in aler ting the water industr y world-wide to th e potential hazards of accidents involving aluminium sulphate. Yet despit e the publicity surrounding the Lowermoor Incident ther e have been many subsequent in stances of accidents involving the loss of, or environmental pollution by, this substa nce, right up to the present day. Even in February this year, spilled al uminium sulphate was recycled through the water treatment process at a facility in the UK, instead of being treated as a to xic, acidic or hazardous waste as is required by law. No formal risk assessment in adva nce of the decision by management to recycle this waste back into the food chain has been reported to us. The need to en sure that all of the lesson s implicit in the incident ar e fully appreciated remains as urgent and important toda y as it was sixteen years ago. Only by gaining a full understanding of th e political dimensions that underlay attempts to c onceal the effects of the incident can the limitations, constraints an d defects of the Draft Report be adequately appreciated. Until this perception is countered and corrected by a balanced and trul y authorita tive Report, industry will continue to regard accidents involving this substa nce as trivial and of little concern. After all, if this 20 tonne spillage directly in to a water supply system really was innocuous, then any less er spillage to a less sensitive environment wi ll inevitably be viewed as being of no r eal consequence. Scope and limitations of the LSG study The new Draft Report is the third official at tempt to publish an accoun t of the evidence about the health impacts of the 1988 incident. Unlike the original study group, head ed by Prof Dame Barbara Clayton, the LS G has obtained access to a wide variety of formerly unavailable records, and has interviewed a fa r greater number of people with direct experience of the in cident and its health eff ects. In consequence, th e LSG has been able to DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 60compile a larger database of evidence than has ever been available to researchers into this affair. The LSG's Draft Report issued in Februa ry 2005 is a work ing document, and not a definitive final report. It is intend ed that this document should be used as the basis for constructive peer review, and to encourage those with relevant expertise and experience to provide comment and new insight into the evidence and its im plications. The Draft has assembled mainly anecdotal evidence on the immediate (acute) medi cal effects of exposure and the subsequent (chronic) medical complaints that have been attr ibuted to it by people who were present at the time of the incident. This forms the substance of the first of the two Terms of Reference for the LSG's work, and we consider that the LSG has car ried out that obligation as well as can be expected under the circumstances. Indeed, the LSG has widened the sc ope of studies on th is incident into fields not considered by earlier studies. For exampl e, it has recognised th e significance of sec ondary contamination of the water supply within domestic plumbing systems, cause d by the solution of additional metals in the highly acidic wate r. By commissioning a hydraulic model of the water treatment and distribution system, for the first time it has been possible to demonstrate the timing and approximate peak concentrations of the prim ary contaminants, both within the Lowermoor Works and in the distribution system close to th e Works. Sadly, even in this important work discrepancies have been allowed to enter the calculations, compromising the value of the model. This is examined in detail at the en d of the Review section of this document. Reliable new sources of medical information ha ve become available, providing analytical data on human tissues (blood, bone, nails, hair) and urine. The LSG has also had access to a limited number of investigativ e medical reports produced afte r the event by independent specialists, and scientific understanding of th e toxicology of the ma in contaminants has developed considerably during the years follow ing the incident. With these innovations, the new Draft is unquesti onably the most comprehe nsive compilation of st ill accessible evidence, and provides an invalu able resource for further analysis and debate. Inadequacies in the medical data that obstruct the LSG's investigation. But against this, in the sixteen years following th is serious industrial a ccident there has been no planned and compre hensive medical assessment of th e entire population on which the LSG could draw for medical data a nd analysis. It is an unfortunate fact that those few clinical studies that have been carried out after the event provide no more than very limited and almost random hints of the more complex issues underlying the incident . A group such as the LSG should have been c onvened much clos er to the time of the Incident, when far more contemporary data would have been easily availa ble. On the other hand, it is also true to observe that wi th the passage of time l ong-term and delaye d effects that were not evident closer to the time of the incide nt have now beco me evident. We deplore the failure of the health sector to take seriously the need to carry out professional quality monitoring of th e health of the communit y in the wake of what is offi cially known as Britain's worst water poisoning incident. It is trag ic that the absence of a comprehensive health monitoring system means that once more there is a real risk that medical information on the conditions of some of th ose affected may still be lost. Critical comment has been made regarding th e apparently limited references cited in the Draft. The literature re view examined scientific publications up to 2003. The s hortness of the DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 61list of cited references is due purely to cons iderations of space; ma ny more documents and sources were examined th an have been not ed in the Draft. However, the Draft should not be seen as a definitive assessment of the literature on the toxicol ogy of the various primary and secondary contaminants involved in this incide nt. For such de tailed information the reader should rely on a systematic review of all of the relevant literature. The system of 'flagging' medical records. The Clayton Committ ee recommended that the local health authority should set up a post-i ncident health monitoring system. The health authority appears to have interpre ted this as requiring it to comp ile statistics on cancer rates and hospital discharge rates. It relies on th e system known as 'fla gging' medical records, which identifies individuals whos e records are of inte rest to some resear ch or mo nitoring programme within the Health Serv ice. The objective is that the local health authority will be alerted when a fl agged individual develops a particular condition. This system is seriously co mpromised. At present it relies on hand-annotated medical records: there is no co mputer-based system that automatically identifies any cluster or trend of unusual medical conditions th at might become ev ident in the flagge d group of records relating to the e xposed population. It appears that flagging doe s not guarantee th at the records of the considerable number of people who ha ve subsequently moved out of the area are always reported back to the heal th authority in Cornwall. Nor do es it appear to apply to those infants that were unborn but in the wo mb at the time of the incident. Failure to collect pathological samples on the decease of people exposed to the incident. Following a seri ous incident involvi ng any potentially toxic chemical, when ever any person from the flagged populace has di ed, pathological tissue sample s should be retained and examined specifically to determ ine whether or not the deceased reveal s any evidence of medical conditions that might be related to the expo sure. Since metal toxicity has been linked with progressive neurodegenerative conditions, th is requirement is especi ally relevant to the Lowermoor Incident. Only detailed examinatio n of appropriate brain and spinal chord preparations post mortem will reveal possible cr yptic toxicological indica tors of exposure to any or all of the contaminants ex perienced during this incident. We understand that no such investig ative pathological examinations have been ca rried out by the health authority. There is therefore no reliable diagnostic evidence based upon prepared tissue specimens (as oppo sed to symptomatic ev idence) on the incide nces of Alzheimer's Disease and other neur odegenerative conditions within defined groups of people known to have been exposed to the contaminated water. Yet within the local community, the risk of developing such c onditions is now an issue of paramount concern and anxiety. In short, there is no evidence of willingness within the health sector to se t up adequate monitoring of the full range of conditions that might develop as a result of exposure to the pollution. The scope of what ineffective health monitoring has been carried out was apparently founded on the inadequa te investigations and placator y assurances is sued by the Clayton Committee, and by DoH advisors with no professional expertise in the relevant toxicological fields. Because of the prolonged delay in setting up the pres ent study, the range of possible follow-up investig ations that could now be r ecommended has been severely limited. We consider that the public health sector policy relating to monito ring this inci dent has been based on incompetent initial ad vice by unqualified advisers, reluctance to i nvestigate the incident by adopting the precaut ionary published da ta from largely superceded scientif ic research. It is surely obvious that since the incident was unprecedented, inevitably ther e can be no clear published guidance on which to identify a specific range of resultant medical cond itions that might be relevant. Rejecting evidence from 'unofficial' tissue samples. In contra st to this lax approach within the public sector, human and/or animal tissue samples were collected by a few concerned health professionals, a nd by both of us. In a number of cases thes e tissue samples provided data on metal contamination levels that were significantly different from established 'normal' ranges. Remarkably, the relevance of the anim al data has been summ arily dismissed by the health sector, with the argume nt that animal models are in appropriate when dealing with human populations. This attitude re jects at a stroke th e validity of all an imal experimentation in the fields of medical an d pharmacologi cal research. A similar bias is evident in th e Draft. The largely worthless water sample data collected from samples taken far too late in th e incident by SWWA are provided in exha ustive detail. In stark contrast, Cross's unique and robust data on the effect of drinking contaminated water by pregnant sows, the subsequent declines in pre- and post-partem survival of the fetuses, and on the growth rates and food conversion rates of th e surviving piglets, are given only limited and passing mention. The concerned reader is left to attempt to recover the original material from relatively inaccessible sources. Dismissing evidence from 'self selected' patients. Privately organise d surveys have been dismissed by the health sector as 'self selected ', as if the on ly randomized surv eys carried out by professional epidem iologists can provide evidence of serious medical damage within a population. In any instance of a disease or environmental contam ination affecting more than a single person, the on ly way that the medical s ector is likely to become aware of it is through those people who are affected sele cting themselves to report the problem to their local health care professional. Cross and Newman's 1988 surv ey of acute symptoms was purely aimed at alerting the health sect or to the existence of widespread and severe health problems in the local community, and its main fi ndings were replicated by subsequent more formal studies. Yet this original study has been repeatedly dismissed on the grounds th at its data originated from 'self selected' sources. The results of ot her clinical studies - even by professional specialists such as Altmann et al - were di smissed for the same s purious reason by the establishment. We have repeated ly argued that the victims of any serious acci dent are not identified by rando m epidemiological surveys; they ei ther refer themselves for medical assistance or are identified at th e scene of the accident by emergency servi ce investigators. It is a matter of deep concern to us that the Do H ordered the emergency response team at Guy's Hospital Poisons Unit not to attend this accident, or to ha ve any contact with the people of North Cornwall. Applying inappropriate statistical analysis. The majority of those few attempts at data analysis that have been made by establishmen t health sector professionals have themselves been severely flaw ed by defects in both the methodol ogy and the statistic al interpretation. Some have obscured possibly significant advers e effects by diluting specific sub-groups with overwhelming numbers of irrelevant and largely unexpose d 'controls' - people who were not exposed to the worst (o r even any) of the contaminated water. The North Cornwall cancer incidence analysis adop ted this defective appr oach. The attempt to discount the Camelford School leukaemia cluster by th is means is another exampl e of confounding data from a specific sub-group by including large nu mbers of non-members. We find unacceptable in this Draft Report the apparently summary dismissal of the significance of these cases with the DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 63claim that they could have been caused by infection. In the text of the Draft Report this was offered as no more than a hypothe sis about the po ssible cause of leukaemias in general. But it was then inflated to justify the suggestion that thes e three specific in stances of childhood leukaemia in a single class were caused by infection. This is a wholly spurious inference in the absence of any corroborative evidence . The case for a Lowermoor Syndrome. Although many people e xposed to the contamination did not experience long-term adverse medical effects, a small group doe s appear to exhibit a common gr oup of health problems that developed immediately after the incident. Th ese include the acknowledged joint pain and swelling and 'neuropsycho logical' complaints. Within this group, the latter c ondition is often referred to as memory loss or co nfusion, but in a nu mber of cases clini cal investigation has revealed the existence of some form of what is generally referred to as 'brain damage' - either cognitive dysfunction or actual physical changes within the tissues of some part of the brain that has been demonstrated in CT and MRI scans. The sufferers are adamant that the symptoms that they experienced immediately or very shortly after e xposure led to them seeking medical assistance that eventually led to the discover y of this damage. Other symptoms that are common to this group ar e the loss of finger and toe nails, persistent skin rashes that are highly resistant to any form of treatment, a conti nuing reduced ability to carry out tasks and occu pations that they were previously able to do with ease, and difficulties with tasks such as wr iting and dealing with numbers. The Draft effectively sepa rates such symptoms an d deals with them - often dismissively - as if they are entirely unrelated. We consider this to be a serious defect, and sugges t instead that these associated symptoms shou ld properly be regard ed as constituting a distinct syndrome caused by severe e xposure or individual su sceptibility to the toxi c insult that they all experienced. It is therefore worth recording that in the course of the inve stigations by the North Cornwall Homoeopathic Project, th e epidemiological data gathered by Smith et al on 70 individuals clearly delineated such a syndrome. This was so widely sh ared that continuing to gather repetitive data seemed superfluous at the time of the st udy. These data were unaccountably omitted from the Appendices of the Draft Repo rt when it was released, and yet the same syndrome emerged as a distinct feature when the LSG interviewe d sufferers - many of them unknown even to the NCHP - to the extent that a member of the LSG us ed the expression \" ... pattern recognition ...\" to describe the repeat ed description of th e condition by local people giving th eir evidence. Conclusion. The shortcomings and defects in the database of available medical evidence on which the LSG has been able to draw for its analysis ha ve had a severe effect on the ability of the members to reach robust conclusions. The misrepresentatio n introduced into the Draft by the opinions expressed in the Executive Summary confound unfortunat e ignorance with unnecessary bias and confusion. The failure of the health sector to recognise the common symptoms of sufferers exhibiting what we refer to as the Lowe rmoor Syndrome is reinforced by the LSG's division of individual symptoms and considering them as if they are unrelated. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 64Review of the Executive Summary In the following pages, original text take n directly from the Electronic Version of the Draft report is in italics; those speci fic sections to whic h our comments refer are underlined. Comments follo w each extract in turn. _____________________________________________________________________________ \"Who received contaminated water and how long was the water supply contaminated after the pollution incident?\" \"1.10 With the exception of those locations fo r which monitoring data exist, it is not possible to determine whether any partic ular point on the Lowermoor distribution network did or did not recei ve contaminated water becaus e of a large scale flushing exercise which was carried out by the water supplier at different points in the distribution network. The extent and severit y of the contamination can only be determined by the analysis of samples of wa ter taken at a particular vicinity and time. Sequential water quality data are not availabl e to enable a description of the progress of the aluminium sulphate as it trave lled through the dist ribution system.\" Comment This is unacceptable. First-hand reports of contaminated water at locations for which no formal monitoring was carried out cannot be discounted purely on the grounds that no analytical data exist. Certai nly the 'extent and severity' - presumably this means conc entration - of the contamin ation remains unknown, but in some cases it is possible to say if such contamination exis ted at such lo cations. It is also a matter of concern that in severa l cases where SWWA water samples were analysed by other fully accredited Publ ic Health Laboratories, the level of contamination of the critical components aluminium and su lphate were often found to be higher in the analyses of the independent laboratory than was indicated by the results obtained by SWWA. ____________________________ \"1.11 The period of contamination with hi gh concentrations of contaminants was short. Both water quality data and modelling of the passage of aluminium in the trunk mains indicate that the concentrations of this metal in the water supply fell rapidly from a high, initial peak. However, thirty per cent of samples taken up to the end of 1988 and 6% in 1989 remained above the 1984 WHO Guideline Value for Drinking Water Quality for aluminium. This value wa s set to avoid deposits in the distribution system and discolouration of wa ter, not because of a risk of adverse health effects above this concentration. Concentrations of copp er and lead were high for approximately a week after the contamination incident and very few water samples exceeded the 1984 WHO Guideline Value for zinc.\" Comment This only applies in the trunk mains. In branches of the distribution system highly contam inated water remained for much longer, and many areas were not flushed for weeks or, in some cases, for up to 18 months afte r the incident. The reiteration of the mantra th at the Aluminium (Al) standa rd is set, in effect, for aesthetic reasons and not because of any he alth implications, deliberately diverts attention from the real medical issue. When this st andard was set ther e was very little appreciation that aluminium wa s a potential toxin - the implication of the repeated use DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 65of this phrase is that there wa s no relevant health considera tion, and not that if any did exist then it could be discount ed. This is an example of th e use of asser tion instead of informed opinion to divert public concer n away from the issues before the LSG. In fact, three out of six stud ies have found a statistical lin k between Al c oncentrations in drinking water and the prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease - hardly a robust assertion of an absolute lack of association between the tw o. With such uncertainty, the efficacy of the current sta ndard for Al in dri nking water to protec t health interests must be considered unpr oven, and is inde ed the subject of offici al concern elsewhere. The study has been totally unable to interpret info rmation that reve als that water quality in the area served by Lowermoor has been unreliable for a long period before the 6 th July 1988 incident . For example: - In 1967 a discharge of sl udge from the Lowermoor Wo rks into th e Tregoodwell Stream in Camelford resulted in a substantial fish kill. As the result of the research by Cross, for over twenty years the water qual ity regulators in the South West had the only environmental st andard in the UK for aluminiu m in freshwater s designed to protect fish life. During the su mmer of 1986 a number of ducklings at Helstone died after drinking tap water, and the owner received a substantial compensation payment from SWWA. On 28 th June 1988, only ei ght days before the Lowerm oor Incident, mains water fed into a new plastic-lined swimming pool in Helstone was so acidic that adolescents who jumped into the pool quick ly left it again, complainin g of a stinging sensation. Shortly after they developed sores and blisters over their bodies. Attempts to neutralise the acidity of this water failed when the supply of sodium bicarbonate proved inadequate. On the morning of 6 th July 1988, some hours before the Lowermoor Incident itself, a young woman at Treveighan, just south of Camelf ord, experien ced ulceration of the mouth when drinking a cup of coffee. The implication is that there have been pers istent and repeated failures over the years to manage the water treatment process at the Lowermoor Works. Lime pump failure alone cannot account for the extreme reduction of pH in the swimming pool at Helstone shortly before the main incident, and it seems probable that there has been over-dosing of aluminium sulphate at least sporadically on a number of occasions in the past. Where this coincided with a lime pu mp failure, sporadic incidents in which severely acidic wate r was released to the mains dist ribution system may account for these earlier instances of acid water delivery. ____________________________ \"1.12 Water quality data on the contaminants arising from the flushing exercises indicated that the proporti on of samples with concentr ations of manganese above the relevant 1984 WHO Guideline Value increased in the month after th e incident but fell markedly thereafter. The proportion of iron samples exceeding the relevant 1984 WHO Guideline Value rose in the month afte r the incident and re mained high to the end of 66Comment High iron concentrat ions indicate that the ol d scale lining the pipes had been either dislodged or even dissolved by the acidic water. Follo wing flushing, some oxidation of the exposed pipe metal woul d have occurred. In fact high iron concentrations were recorded for years after the event. Irrespective of this, however, the toxicological implications of the high levels of uranium (up to 0.2 mg per metre length of pipe ) reported by Powell et al have never been discussed. (Powell J J et al. Assessment of toxic me tal exposure following the Camelford Water Pollution Incident: eviden ce of acute mobiliza tion of lead into drinking water. Analyst March 1995 Vol. 120: 793-8) Although this paper was quoted by the LSG in its di scussions of the implications of the presence of le ad, it entirely failed to pick up the auth ors' comment about the need to review the possible toxicological significance of the subsequent exposure of the populatio n to uranium dissolved from pipe linings and entering the public water supply. ____________________________ \"On the basis of the toxicity data in th e scientific literature and the estimated exposures, would the contaminants be expect ed to cause delayed or persistent harm to human health?\" \"1.13 This question is considered separately for each contaminant in Chapter 7. The possibility of additive or synergistic in teractions is also addressed. For each contaminant, the implications for health of the worst case estimated intakes are considered in the context of the toxico logical and epidemiological data in the scientific literature.\" Comment This is an unsatisfactor y approach. Since this in cident appears to have been unique, no rele vant scientific studies have been published. Th e literature is therefore not a reliable sour ce on which to base conclu sions. The only relevant primary evidence is from the incident itself, yet this report tends to subjugate this in favour of published reports about largely non -comparable studies. Also it is divisive - it attempts to deal with each of the individual symptoms reported by people providing evidence as if it were a discrete me dical condition. The Draft in fact appears to use this tec hnique to discount ma ny of the symptoms revealed, and on that basis it then draws the overall conclusion that further medical developments are unlikely. But in this incident, there has been a clea r pattern of medical effects shared by a number of those who claim to have been most severely affected. In these cases, their symptoms should not be divided a nd examined individually. Instead, they should be treated collectively, as a discrete syndrome, and the evidence must be weighed in that context. ____________________________ \"1.14 It is not anticipated that the increased exposure to aluminium would have caused, or would be expected to cause, dela yed or persistent harm to health in those who were adults or toddlers at the time of the incident. However, the possibility of delayed or persistent harm to health, although unlikely, should be explored further in those who were bottle-fed infants at the tim e of the incident (i.e. below one year of age).\" DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 67 Comment This is a value laden statement, and should surely read 'Nothing in the literature appears to indicat e this'. Such an optimistic conclusion is entirely unjustified. Similarly, 'alt hough unlikely' implie s an ability to judge the relative significance of potential for an d against such dama ge. No adequate foundation for this claim exists. As evidence of the uncertai nty about this subj ect, recent litera ture records the development of amyloi d plaque (a known associate of the symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease - AD) close to the c uproprotein alpha s ynuclein in the brai n that changes its configuration in the presence of aluminium. Despite clai ms that aluminium does not enter the blood to any significant degree, th ere is clear clinical ly reliable evidence from the medical records of a number of Camelford residents that they experienced extremely high plasma alumin ium concentrations for some time after the incident. Contrary to the assumed situat ion, therefore, exposure of their tissues to aluminium (and possibly even of brain tissue) was po ssible, and the rejection of any risks from this source is unjustified. There may be genetic reasons for susceptibi lity to aluminium absorption in a small number of individuals. Neve rtheless, there were thousan ds of poten tially exposed people in the area at the time, and a possible c onsequential increase in the incidence of AD or other ne urodegenerati ve or neurotoxic conditio ns cannot reliably be discounted. It has been reported that th e cause of death of AD victims may be officially recorded as some other acute development. If this is correct, then the effectiveness of any local health authority monitoring system must be in serious doubt. This conclusion that any consequential effect is unlikely is th erefore unsound. Confining future monitoring to those who we re below one year of age and bottle fed at the time is unjustified. Mo reover, there is an additiona l reason for including all unweaned infants in future monitoring (see ou r notes on section 1.17, below) Because there is doubt a bout the potential of an exposure in this in cident to initiate delayed effects a ll exposed people wh o can be shown to have been at risk should be monitored. Those still exhibiting severe disa bility that they at tribute to exposure should be offered comprehens ive medical examinat ion by specialists who are expert in aluminium (and related) toxicology. These experts must also be immune from Government pressures to conf orm with the politic ally-acceptable mant ra that exposure presents little real health risk. This has prevented bo th local people and those who were visiting the area at the time from receiving the medi cal assistance to which they are entitled under the pr ovisions of the Human Rights legislation. ____________________________ \"1.15 The increased concentrations of copper in the first week or thereabouts after the incident probably contributed to acute, adverse gastroi ntestinal symptoms. It is not anticipated that they would have caused, or would be expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health.\" Comment Again, this is an unsafe conclusion. There are still no reliable data on the actual copper concentrations experienced by some people during th is incident. Cross's research contribution to this debate s uggests that inve stigations should be considering the possible effects of exposu res of up to around 2000+ through DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr some cas es. The toxicological literatu re relating to copper is unhelpful in such instances, especially si nce uniquely in this cas e such exposure was contemporary with e xposure to both alumin ium and sulphuric aci d. The significance of dermal exposure to some people with sk in damaged by sunburn or other existing forms of dermatological da mage should be reviewed. Once again, geneti c defects in some indi viduals may result in abnormalities of copper homeostasis that may make them vulnerable to changed configuration of the brain cuproprotein alpha synuclein. The role of encephalopathies associated with cuproproteins is now becoming of increasing research interest in ne uropathological research, especially in the field of atyp ical Parkinsonism-lik e neurodegenerative conditions. As with alumin ium, alpha synuclein respond s to the pres ence of the cupric ion by changi ng its configuration; this time Lewy Bodies typical of the development of some forms of Parkinson's Disease are reported to form close to the site of the reconfigured cuproprotein. These conditions are very often misdiagnose d, and the British ( but not other) medical establishment is curiously unwilling to acknowledge the existence of similar neurodegenerative sy ndromes that result from exposu re to copper, aluminium and pesticides, although th ey are well documented. These conditions can be induced at any time in the life of a person , but typically do not manifest until late middle age, when the damage become s progressively intolerable, and ultimately fatal. With such a severe health risk , the adoption of the 'Precautionary Principle' is particularly vital. Without far more effort bein g put into screening all deat hs in the exposed population for all possible (eve n if improbable or rare) conditi ons, our underst anding of the vulnerability of human populatio ns to such exposur es will remain uncertain. The total absence of detail ed analysis of tissues taken from peopl e exposed to the incident and who have subsequently died is unacceptabl e and demonstrates a serious procedural anomaly that merits investigation. \"1.16 The occasional high concentrations of zi nc which occurred after the incident may have contributed to acute, adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. It is not anticipated that they would have caused, or would be expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health.\" Comment This seems to be reasonabl e overall, but again, su ch apparent optimism is not justified. Dr. Neil Ward's work on induced zinc deficiency and metabolism seems to suggest otherwise. \"1.17 It is unlikely that the potential brief period of increased exposure to lead, would have caused, or would be expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health. However, any additional exposure of young children to lead is undesirable and the possibility of a delayed or persistent effect should be explored further in those who were bottle-fed infants at the time of the incident , potentially the most highly exposed group. Inorganic lead compounds are consider ed to be possible carcinogens in humans and it is not possible to say whethe r the small additional exposures to lead will have any effect on cancer incidence. Comment The statement relies on the fact that the fluid in take of unweaned infants may be as much as 2.5 times as great for each un it of body weight as that of weaned DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 69infants. It therefore identifies bottle-fed infants as having a far greater relative exposure level to contaminat ed water (assuming that their feeds were made with tap water and not bottled water). This is a dangerously fl awed assumption. In fact, Cross recorded a 20-f old increase in the concentrat ion of aluminiu m in a batch of cows' milk made into ice cream at one dairy near Camelford, only four days after this incident. In consider ing the capacity of the body to eliminat e absorbed aluminium, the Draft id entifies no literatur e source in which lact ation has been found to provide such a pathway; the observa tion of this additional excretory pathway is apparently unprecedent ed. In the absence of evidence to the co ntrary, it must be assumed that this indicates a potential new source of exposure for brea st-fed infants. Before this excretory pathway was revealed, the possibility of increased exposure to lead of breast-fed infants would have been re jected, yet it raises the question, can lead (and indeed, both primary and second ary pollutant metal ions involved in this incident) also be excreted via this pathway? If mothers were excr eting even a part of any of their own exces s lead (or other metal) body bu rden through lactation, the possible risk of th e exposure of their in fants to this indir ect source of lead contamination is uncertain , but cannot be ignored. Older children in the Camelford area have been reported to ha ve shown signs of sudden and long-lasti ng changes in behavi our after the incident , a known effect of even very small incr eases in blood lead levels. Ou r comments above relating to possible repeated incident s of acidic water discharges from the Lowermoor Works also imply a need for a much more cautious approach to the claim that any long-term effect from exposure to lead is 'unlikely' Although it is not direc tly related to the above extract, it is necessary to refer here to the apparently ignored part of one paper that has been used by LSG in its analysis of the implications of exposure to lead. In their pa per on lead contamin ation extracted by the acid water passing through steel mains pipes, Powell at al (1995) no ted that the acid would also have extracted uranium from the pipes, and that this represented a potential toxicological hazard to people drinking the water. It is unclear why the authors' recommendation that the presence of this uranium merited further investigation has not been not ed by the LSG in the Draft Report. Th ere is clearly a need to review th e toxicological analysis of the health hazards of this entire incident using a much wider view than has been adopted so far. ______________ \"1.18 It is not anticipated that concentratio ns of manganese after the incident would have caused, or would be expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health in those who were adults at the time of the inci dent, nor is it consid ered that there would be any substantial increased risk to health to those who were toddlers at the time. It is unlikely that there would have been any delayed or persistent harm to health in those who were bottle-fed infants but recomme ndations have been made for further monitoring of this age group.\" Comment Again, the s uggestion is that onl y bottle-fed infants were at particular risk. Until it is certain that manganese is not excreted by lactat ion, it is unsafe to DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 70assume that those infants that were breast-fed were at less risk than those that were bottle-fed. There was recently a case of a rapidly fatal Parkinson-like neurodegenerative disease in Tintagel (the pers on concerned was not present during the 1988 incident) where it has been reported that manganese levels have be en persistently extremely high recently. Manganese is reported to affect the same brain cuproprotein that is affected by aluminium and copper ions. If there is a link between any of these metals and Parkinson-like or other neurodegenerative conditions, it implies that older people in the population expo sed in 1988 may also be at ri sk. Although evid ence of this possible link between these metals, sensitive neuroproteins and neurodegenerative or neurotoxic conditions was pres ented to the LSG, no mention of this appears in the Draft. ____________________________ \"1.19 It is not anticipated that the concentrations of iron in drinking water after the incident would have caused or would be expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health.\" Comment This is based on evidence from the literature sources consulted. However, some characteristics of iron metabolism are incr easingly suspec ted of being a contributory factor in the pathology of Parkinson-li ke conditions, and this view needs to be subject to expert appraisal. ____________________________ \"1.20 The sporadic high concentrations of sulphate in drinking water after the incident may have caused acute, adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. It is not anticipated that they would have caused, or would be expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health.\" Comment The toxicological implications of drinking what was effectively dilute sulphuric have not been ad equately examined by the LSG. Sul phuric acid is a Schedule 2 Poison under the 1972 Poisons Act. Since pH of itself do es not appear to be responsible for damage to the mouth mucosa (Cross's measurement of the pH of common consumable products -section 7.40, Fig. 33 - is relevant here) there is clearly some unidentified mechanism, possibly but not inevitably asso ciated with the sulphate ions) that the LSG has failed to identify to explain this very common symptom of drinking the highly acidic water (see below also) ____________________________ \"1.21 There may have been an additive effect of those contaminants with the potential to cause adverse gastrointestinal effects and this may have led to an unpleasant, acute gastrointestinal response among those w ho drank the water, even when the concentration of individual contaminants alone was not high enough to cause such a response. The recorded pH values of the water after the incident were not low enough to cause the cases of sore th roat and skin irritation which are reported. It may be that high concentrations of sulphate and metal sa lts rendered the water more irritant than would be anticipated from its pH alone.\" DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 71Comment Despite the apparently far higher acidity of ma ny common foodstuffs, as demonstrated in the Draft, the mouth and throat ulceration reported by some of the people who drank the acidic water cannot be explained by a ny mechanism so far proposed. This apparently simple observation is very impo rtant. If the pH was not low enough to cause the widely re ported mucosal damage (the existence and severity of which is supported by pathological eviden ce in animals that dr ank the water, and obtained from creditable veterinary sources) an d nothing in the toxicological literature explains it, then the LSG has clearly failed to iden tify the cause of this damage All toxicological data on the absorption of metals from th e gut relies on the assumption that the gut lining is intact, so this is clearly a se rious obstruction to the diagnosis of risks and possible consequential effects. Whilst most of the liter ature dealing with the toxicology of sulphuric acid deals with the corrosive effects of e xposure to more concentrated solu tions, the potential synergistic effects of consuming a combination of dilute sulphuric acid and the relevant metals in combination appears not to have been ex plored. The pH of water is an important ecotoxicological fa ctor in metal pollution, as metals such as aluminium, copper, zinc and lead become much more to xic in acidic solution, and show a greatly enhanced toxicity to fish in waters with a pH value below 7. Although the human stomach may contain considerable amounts of hydrochloric acid, the combined effects of metals and sulphuric acid in the stomach and intestin e cannot be assumed to be identical to that of the sa me metals when present in the naturally acidic human stomach. ____________________________ \"1.22 On the basis of the availabl e data, it is not anticipated that the combination of metals which occurred as a result of th e pollution incident would have caused or would be expected to cause delayed or persistent additive or synergistic effects.\" Comment The literature does not pr ovide adequate data on the possible synergistic effects of consuming two or more of the meta ls prominent in this study to draw such a conclusion, and is even less forthcoming wh en dealing with them in conjunction with the extraordinarily improbable presence of the registered poison, sulphuric acid. Nor is it safe to accept the general assumption th at the low apparent toxicity of one of the metals present would have indicated relative immunity from toxic effects on all ages and conditions of peop le exposed to them. This is example of the failure of the compilers of the Executive Su mmary to recognise that lack of adequate understanding is an unsuitable basis for assu ming a consequent lack of risk. ____________________________ \"Are the symptoms or illnesses report ed by individuals or identified from epidemiological studies considered to ha ve been caused by delayed or persistent effects of the contaminants?\" \"1.23 The symptoms reported as being health ef fects of the incident were identified using a number of sources. The types of chronic symptoms and diseases which were most commonly reported to the Subgroup in interviews with, and written submissions from, individuals fell into the categories of neuropsychological effects, joint pains and/or swelling, nail problems, cancer and thyroid disease. These were similar to those reported by 70 people in the report of a homeopathic project in 1992; this also reported malaise, tiredness and exhaustion, a dr y thirst, and a sensitivity to tapwater. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 72The Subgroup recognised that the incide nt was unique and that there was a recognizable pattern of symptoms and di agnoses among the individuals who provided personal evidence. It also recognised, thr ough its contact with the local population , that many individuals were concerne d and distressed about the possible health consequences of the incident in relation bot h to themselves and to the community as a whole.\" Comment The clinical evidence of brain da mage in a number of people who complained of severe mental effects, including memory loss, within a short period of exposure is well documented, and is not a matter of opinion. However, information on medical consultation rates is di fficult to assess. It is impo rtant to bear in mind that many people have repor ted that they were very active ly dissuaded from reporting later symptoms to their medical advi sers - indeed, in some cases they claim to have been asked to leave surgerie s when they attempted to consu lt on related issues. Some local GPs are reported to ha ve been reluctant to examine or treat an yone presenting with conditions that th ey believed to have been caus ed by the incident. This may be attributed to a lett er circulated from Mr. Michael Waring (D oH) in Augu st 1988, in which he assured the local medical sector th at adverse health eff ects were unlikely to occur. Unlike the detailed critique of published medical papers provided in this Draft, there is no corresponding re view of the apparent reliability of verbal evid ence about the responses of the medical servic es following this incident, ye t this is relevant to the evaluation of the re liability of da ta from all sources. Re aders without relevant professional qualifications s hould not be left to infer any inconsistencies in recorded evidence, and thereby decide for themselves on the reli ability of the evidence from their own reading of this complex and long document. We also note with concer n that the detailed epidemiologi cal data (refer red to above) of the North Cornwall Homo eopathic Project was omitted from the Draft Report, and appeared on the COT website only after its exclusion was drawn to the attention of the Secretariat. ____________________________ \"1.24 In Chapter 8, each of the symptoms, or symptom groups and disease is considered in the context of the evidence relating to the potential exposures to the contaminants, their known toxic effects , and the results of studies on the exposed population . An assessment is made of the likelih ood that the reported health effects were caused by the contaminants.\" Comment This is, of course, a fundamental point that mu st be made clear to the public. The toxic effects of the contaminants are 'know n' only as far as past experimentation or study relates to the unique c onditions of this in cident, and as they are accordingly re ported in the literatur e. Without an appropri ate precedent , there can be no truly relevant literature! As for the epidemiological st udies described and assessed in the text , some that were carried out by me dical specialists for lawyers acting for claimants ha ve been wrongly denigrated as having been somehow tainted by association with vulgar financial interests. Other studies have been so obstructed by the inaction of the health sector that vital evidence has been irretrievably lost . And a few, as detailed below, have been DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 73of such dubious qu ality that their value as scientific studies must be rejected. It is improper to draw benign conclu sions from such sources - where a potentially lethal or debilitating outcome may be possible, adopting the 'P recautionary Prin ciple' is an absolute requirement. When the balance of probability indicates a possible adverse outcome with a low safe ty factor, then that should be sufficient to trigger a 'fail safe' response. Adopting scie ntific aloofness and applying the test of 'b eyond reasonable doubt' is a danger ous and unacceptable ap proach when th e health, and ev en lives, of many may be at risk. ____________________________ \"1.25 The estimated exposures to the contami nants are not considered to have been sufficient to cause neurotoxic effects in adults nor in t hose who were children at the time of the incident. However, the Subgroup wa s advised that the overall pattern of results in one of the neuropsychological studies indicated subtle effects in the individuals tested but that it was not possible to determine whether these effects were due to the contaminated wate r because of deficiencies in the design of these studies. Further work is recommended on this endpoint.\" Comment These statements ar e mutually exclusive. The advice indicated that such effects were poss ibly the re sult of exposure. There has been abundant ev idence, both from the public and from some medical specialists, that in their opinion su ch a direct causative link was present, ev en if the mechanism was unc lear. This is always the case when a new medical condition appears. The scope of the neur opsychological effects that appe ar to have resulted from exposure therefore need s to be clearly define d. The issue is not what the literature does or does not sugg est, but what actually appears to have occurred amongst some individuals following their expo sure, especially amongst thos e that were entirely free of such problems immediately before the in cident. Any initial monitoring needs to cover the widest possible field. It must at tempt to identify thos e effects that are now amenable to further ex amination and relevant to the st udy. Then a target ed series of studies is required to quantify as far as possible th e effects on specif ic conditions. And also note that a neurod egenerative conditi on is not necessar ily in its elf an 'endpoint'. The real endpoint is death. ____________________________ \"1.26 There is no indication from the toxicological data that the estimated exposures to the contaminants which occurred after the incident can cause ef fects on joints and it is not possible to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the joint pains and/or swelling reported and exposure to the contaminants. It should be borne in mind that arthritis and related pr oblems occur commonly in the population. However, the Subgroup recognised that many in dividuals with whom they spoke were concerned about joint problems. Therefor e, further work is recommended on this endpoint.\" Comment Joint pain, especially amongst males, was a pr ominent finding of the Cross and Newman study in 1988. In many cas es people were virt ually crippled for weeks or months afterwards. This paragraph suggests that any causal relationship is unlikely - the facts sugge st otherwise. Whilst it may not be possible to conclude that there was a direct relatio nship on the basis of evidence from the literature , or to DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 74discover if such an effect has previously be en recorded, th is does not mean that it is impossible - only that it may result from a novel form of exposure that has triggered a response that is more familiar as the result of other causes. However, since such c onditions naturally do develop an d progress as pe ople age, the possibility that any instance s that have developed in people exposed can now be recognised as in some way distinct from those that ar ise naturally is likely now to be remote. Unless exposure caused some new an d unique form of joint damage, it is unclear what the recommended study might be capable of revealing at such a late stage. ____________________________ \"1.27 A consultant dermatologist who, two years after th e incident, examined individuals suffering from nail and skin pr oblems reported that the types of nail problems seen were common and that further metabolic in vestigation of the patients' nails was not required. There is no relev ant information in the epidemiological studies nor from the toxico logical data on possible eff ects of the contaminants on nails which can add to this opinion.\" Comment On the contrary, se veral specialist who also saw some of these patients stated that they could not identify the cause , but in some cases at least the cause was emphatically not fungal. Precise ly what 'types of nail pr oblems' did this specialist refer to? How typical were the instances from Camelford people, and how prevalent is non-fungal damage that ar ises spontaneously and pers ists for years after its appearance? Why di d other specialists say that at least some of these examples were not typical of the usua l nail loss conditions? It is crucial to understand that people reporting nail loss also consistently presented with a number of other conditions that also appeared at the same time - in other words they exhibited a syndrome . It is completely unacceptab le to discount one of the symptoms within such linked conditions - or indeed, several of them - by dividing them from the entire spectrum of medical conditions shared by the group. This dismissal of any significance in the shedding of finger and toenails is unjustified. At the time local doctors were baffled by the repeated loss of nails. The statement in section 1.27 indicates that th is decision is based on the opinion of a single specialist, irrespective of the opinion of others, and is therefore unacceptabl e. Metals of Group 3A in the periodic table (inc luding aluminium, gallium and thallium) are all known to concentrate in nails after exposure, and skin rashes and nail losses that were commonly reported with in this group have be en improperly dismi ssed in isolation. ____________________________ \"1.28 The results of a study of cancer incidence and mortality between 1988 and 1998 in the population living in the area which received contaminated water provide no evidence of an increased overall cancer ri sk arising from the incident.\" Comment This dismissal of the significance of cancer ra tes is based on a single flawed study by Dr. Miles and his colleagues - why is this unreliable study used to support this claim? This study diluted the 'test' group with the entire remaining population of North Cornwall, a technique guaran teed to conceal all but the most overwhelming incidence of abnormal inciden ce of a pathologi cal condition. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 75The significance of cancer in the community as a whole is in fact open to interpretation. We have heard a number of local people observe th at people from the exposed area seem to have a much shorter life expectancy following initial diagnosis than people elsewhere, but no data have been made availa ble on the survival time of cancer patients that might di scredit such a claim. Purely recording mortality rates would not identify any other factor, such as more rapid lethal ity, that might be relevant. Unfortunately, the issue of cancer is impossible to evaluate at present, not least because of the uncertainty of the accuracy of either reporting, re cord keeping or the effectiveness of 'flagging' patients' medical records. Th e incidence of lost medical records, or the re ported alteration of so me long after they have been written, has become an issue of concern for some patients. Such records should never be subject to revision, only addi tion, since this inevitably raises th e question of possi ble attempts to conceal past medical mistakes. Although this Report makes no recommendation regarding the management of medical and other official records, it is our view that all relevant records should be sealed and never subjected to any form of retrospective editing. This would include both medical records, school a ttendance reco rds, and any other relevant quantitative reco rds that might be of value for statistical analysis after an incident such as this. Their relevance to future i nvestigations needs to be preserved and they should be properly protec ted from disposal. Where a large population is exposed to a potentially dangerous emergency, all previous and subsequent medical record s should be accessi ble to official investigation; there is no reason that medica l confidentiality should be used to frustrate the identi fication of population responses that could pr ove of vital importance in managing the consequential eff ects. Access to some information is also provided under the ne w Freedom of Information Act, as well as the Freedom of Access to Environmental Inform ation Act. All rele vant records must be preserved and made available to investigators, and medical records should not be exem pt from such protection and accessibility. ____________________________ \"1.29 The results of an investigation of a cluste r of three cases of acute leukaemia in children attending a secondary school in the area which had received contaminated water were consistent with the hypothesis that the incidence of leukaemia could be affected by prior exposure to infectious agents. However, the study found that the pollution incident did not cause an increased inciden ce of infection.\" Comment The LSG did not find that the incident did no t cause an increase in leukaemia cases. It has accept ed the proposal that some cases of leukaemia may be caused by infection, but has then assumed th at this provides sufficient evidence of causation in these cases. It has not estab lished that infection was the only possible such explanation. In fact, the three le ukaemia cases occurred in a singe group of 22 ch ildren who were, apparently uniquely, given or ange juice with their mornin g drink in the nursery class at Camelford on 7 th July 1988. This forms a valid sub-group agains t which other matched groups shoul d be compared. Diluti ng data from such a sub-group with the entire population of No rth Cornwall is not a sc ientifically or this cluster. A new an alysis of the health of that sub-group of children must be made immediately. The recommendation that more investigat ions of properly sel ected sub-groups should be undertaken to assess possible delayed or persistent neuropsychologic al effects of exposure should certainly include this sub-group, but s hould also identify the causes of chronic illness (including morbid psyc hological conditions ) or death in any members of all identifiable sub-groups. During its investig ations and case-taking, the North Cornwall Homoeopathic Project reco rded many instances in which subjects needed four, five or six prescriptions of antibiotics to clear in fections that would normally have been expected to res ponded to one or two prescription s. This suggests lowered immunity and, by implication, an im paired ability to hold back the rate of growth of cancers. ____________________________ \"1.30 There was no indication from the toxicological data on the contaminants of an adverse effect on the thyroid gland. Thyroid disease is common in the population and the cases reported are considered unlikel y to be caused by exposure to the contaminants resulting from the incident.\" Comment This is again linear thinking in a situation that demands a lateral approach. Why should there be relevant literature upon which to draw when this incident was unique? The factual evid ence of unu sual thyroid conditions (Hashimoto's Disease, for ex ample) is available; conclu sions should be drawn from it, not 'reverse to discount the signif icance of the evid ential data. The thyroid gland is sensitive to many forms of infection and toxic assault, and may provide an early warning of developing conditions. ____________________________ \"1.31 The homeopathic report cited a sensitiv ity to tap water as a common finding after the incident but, from the symptoms described, this does not appear to be the immune condition termed \"sensitisation\". It has been proposed that it may be a manifestation of the non-imm une condition termed \"chemical sensitivity\". It is difficult to assess the potential significance of this process in the context of the Lowermoor incident in view of the lack of firm mechanistic evidence and of robust means of diagnosis. Therefore, at this stage, it is not possible to draw conclusions or make recommendations in relation to these symptoms.\" Comment There is abundant resear ch and case-study lite rature dealing with chemical sensitivity, yet the LSG has failed to treat this topic with the rigour that it deserves. The argument that th ere is no immunolog ical basis for such 'sensitivity' has been proposed to dismi ss conditions such as ME, yet that is now known to be a real and debilitating condition. Sensitisation to local tapwater has been shown to occur under 'double blind' ( but non-clinical trial) conditions; its sign ificance should be investigated, not simply dismissed as inexplicable. The 'lack of evidence and of a robust means of diagnosis' bl amed for the LSG's inability to reach a conclusion is attributable to the failure of the health sector to consider the claim of sensitivity as a serious issue, despite the eas e with which the claims of those reporting it could be tested. ____________________________ DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 77 \"1.32 The Subgroup was informed that there was a higher proportion of children with a statement of Special Educati onal Needs (SEN) (\"Statements\") in North Cornwall than in the rest of Cornwall and concern was expressed that this might be related to the pollution incident. The Subgroup received exp ert advice that the determination of children with SEN is influenced by many different factors and that no conclusions could be drawn from SEN figures about the long- term impact of the incident on health. In addition, a detaile d investigation did not find th ere to be any consistent difference between the rates of children with St atements in the s econdary school likely to have had the highest proportion of childre n from the affected area and those in other schools in Cornwall.\" Comment This statement indi cates an unwillingnes s to examine the data critically. The Richmond Test methodology from the USA used as the m easurement criterion has been widely dismissed by teachers throughout Britain as inapprop riate for British children. Available SEN an d Statement data for the area and schools are indeed useless, but this statement fails to highlig ht the fundamental flaw in relying on any formal method of classify ing children that is based upon the economic provisions within the Education Sector for the suppo rt of children with special needs. To put it bluntly, if an Education Aut hority does not prov ide adequate funds according to the actual dema nds of a community, then th e rate of Statementing, and any other formal classificatio n of less serious educationa l problems, will not reflect the needs of the childre n, but simply the de pth of the purse of the School that they attend. We have received authoritative reports th at after the incident the proportion of children in some gr oups recognised by their teachers (but not by the funding provided) as having special educational ne eds was over 30%. This is not merely a 'higher proportion' but one far above the national upper average limit of around 16%. This needs to taken at face value and investigat ed in detail. If ther e was an increase in children having difficul ties, then the possibility that this may be linked to the incident, even if only in a proportion of cases, is of extreme concern an d requires immediate investigation. We have seen from the modelling, and lear ned from members of the public giving evidence to the LSG, that exposure to ex treme levels of contamination could differ wildly, even between adjacent dwellings. Co nsequently, the validity of attempting to use residential postal code groupings as the basis for broad-based epidemiological studies is highly questionabl e. In contrast, ch ildren attending the schools (particularly in Camelford where the model shows that expo sure levels would have been at their highest) can be identified as members of specific sub-groups, all of whom were subject to similar exposure risks. It is our contention that the achievements and behaviour of sub- groups of children who at tended the schools shoul d form the basis of detailed surveys into the possible long-t erm and delayed effects of the incident. ____________________________ \"Recommendations for further research\" TOX/2012/38 78Neuropsychological investigations \"1.33 Further studies should be carried out to explore the neuropsychological status of those individuals who consumed the cont aminated water. Expert advice will be required on both the design and conduct of a suit able study or studies. It is suggested that the following groups are investigated: individuals who drank the water and have symptoms a matched sample of individuals who drank the water and are without symptoms a matched control group from another co mmunity where exposure did not occur.\" Comment The school classes provide valid sub-groups, since their members were, in general, all in the same large premises at the relevant time of highest contamination within the same area of the water distributio n network. If the attendance records still exist, then the actual presen ce of individuals could be es tablished, and if possible these sub-groups s hould be identified from class attendance reco rds. The use in the health authority studies of statistics based on subjects' residential post-codes is clearly invalid. This is further exacer bated by the mode l's indication that the worst affected area was around Camelford itself; many children travelled to the school from outside the worst affected area, but ar e more likely to ha ve been exposed to similar levels of contamination through the drinki ng water fountains at the school, even if no t at home. ____________________________ \"Investigations of the cognitive, behavioural and educational development of children\" \"1.34 Investigations should be carried out into the cognitive and educational development of individuals who were under 1 year of age at the time of the incident . Expert advice will be required on both th e design and conduct of suitable studies.\" Comment We do not accept this; the medical history of ALL children present in the worst affected area must be investigated. There were and are alarming reports concerning some children's behavioral problems that cannot simply be ignored because they were not members of this highly se lective age cohort. Extra non- teaching staff had to be recruited to help the teachers to cont rol certain classes. ____________________________ \"Joint pains and/or swelling\" \"1.35 Routine health statistics cannot be us ed to monitor the prevalence of joint problems . It is recommended that, if feasible, a study should be carried out to assess whether the prevalence of joint pains and/ or swelling in the population receiving contaminated water is higher than normal.\" Comment It is almost certainly now too late to carry out any such study. If initial pathological changes di d occur after the inci dent, they may well now be obscured by the subsequent devel opment of more conventional arthro sis at the damaged sites. We know that even the unique aluminium-ri ch surface laye r shown in the bone biopsies disappeared af ter a year or so. Any persistent physical changes remaining now are likely to be indistinguishab le from subsequent consequent ial or incident al changes. ____________________________ DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 79\"Monitoring of routine of routine health st atistics for the popul ation potentially exposed to contaminated water after the Lowermoor pollution incident, recommended by the Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (1991), should continue. The monitoring should include analysis of overal l cancer incidence and mortality rates, and analysis of cancer subgroups. If possi ble, the assessmen t of the exposed population should be refined to take account of the fact that some areas experienced a higher level of contamination than others. If such a refine ment is possible, it could also be applied retrospectivel y. It is suggested that m onitoring is continued until 2008 , twenty years after the incident, and that the burden of this work is removed from the local primary care trust and is , in future, carried out by an academic department familiar with the analysis of routine health statistics. Comment The LIHAG monito ring proposal was far too re stricted, and credit for the original proposal should not be permitted. Had ade quate professional monitoring been carried out, then the LSG might well have had far better evidence on which to base its conclusions now. Given the histor y of public sector pre ssure on scientists an d others wishing to investigate this inci dent, that an independent rese arch body should undertake such studies should not be a recomm endation but an ab solute requirement. It must have no dependence on research funding from the health sector, and the termination date should not be set merely at 2008. The relevan ce of the effects of aluminium and copper on neurop roteins, for instance, may cause da mage that becomes fatal only as the affected person ag es. It is possible that some individuals who were young adults or even middle aged may eventually develop dang erous or lethal cond itions in the next twenty five years, whilst those who were infants at the time ma y eventually develop fatal conditions only in their mid-fifties, as far ahead as 2040. Since improper medical advi ce was issued to the public by both the Water Authority (\" the water is bacteriologica lly pure!\", and, \"If you don't like the ta ste, mix it with orange juice!\") and the health sector at the time of the incident, the possibility that the public prosecutor's o ffice might wish to consider br inging charges of corporate manslaughter and/or medical ne gligence cannot be ruled out. Th ere is no limitation on the time for bringing such a serious charge against a defendant, and in such eventuality the requirement for transparently independent forensic analysis of all data and relevant materials is central to the concept of justice. ____________________________ \"Toxicological studies\" \"1.37 The toxicological data on aluminium, alth ough extensive, is insufficient to make a definitive hazard assessment. There is a need for furthe r work on the toxicity of aluminium, including: studies to identify No Observed Adverse Effect Levels for aluminum salts using both acute and chronic exposure and a rang e of salts of different bioavailabilities mechanistic data on the neurotoxicity of aluminium and of its potential role in neurological disease and other disord ers such as macrophagic myofasciitis DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 80 further investigations of the bioavailabil ity of aluminium in humans, including of the reasons for the reported in terindividual variation.\" Comments This recommendation refers only to th e toxicology of aluminium, and not to the possible synergistic effects of a cocktail of contaminants. We still do not (and probably never shall) know what subs tances might have be en leached from the sludge layer within the contact tank at the tim e of the incident, or the implications of the possible mobilizati on of uranium proposed by Powell et al. The refusal of the medical establishment to recognise the potent ial significance of animal data collected from the affected area as an 'early warning' tool is unacceptable. Animal data provided new insights into unexpected mechanisms of toxicity that would have alerted health authorities to possible adverse e ffects in the human population. Examples includ e the previously unreporte d excretion pathway of aluminium in lactating cows; the altered metal status of pig tissues; changes in reproductive performance, reduced fetal and neonatal survival of pigs; and the death of livestock forced to drink the worst of th e contaminated water. All of these indicated at least a potential risk to hu man consumers, yet were enti rely rejected by both the veterinary specialist employed by SWWA and by those (bot h lay and medically trained) dealing with requests for advi ce on the possible hazards and medical consequences of exposure. No other pathological materials were either available or could ethically have been secured, yet the potential significance of this animal evidence has been repeatedly dismissed. We suggest that further wo rk on the response of common livestock and their suitability as early warning models for possible effects in humans is merited; they represent important sources of reference data and tissue pr eparations in investigation future chemical accidents. The failure of the Health sector to carry out post mortem examin ations on people from the exposed area who have subsequently di ed, with the specific aim of determining whether or not their death was related to th e incident, is astonish ing. Until exposure can be conclusively proven not to have b een responsible for huma n fatalities, all such incidents should be su bjected to detailed investigations to discover the scope of any pathological or biochemical ch anges that may have occurred in those subj ected to the incident. The relationship between the metals - specif ically aluminium, c opper and manganese - involved in this incident and possible induce d changes in neurological tissues and biochemical components is an emerging issue as a result of this incident. Research should be directed at more re liable identification of rare c onditions that may result in unusual sensitivity to exposure to me tals, as a marker to the epidemiological implications of chemical accidents in which large populatio ns are exposed. In particular, the incidence of Alzheimer's Dise ase, and of Parkinson-like neurodegenerative and neur otoxic conditions over long periods foll owing such incidents may be of relevance to the Lowe rmoor Incident. Special attention needs to be paid to identifying appr opriate methods of assessing the neurotoxicol ogy of these metals, and the long-term implications of the response of critical brain components to DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 81them. The possibility that rare genetic conditions may be implicated in the e xpression of neurological c onditions, even if only in a small minority within a population, should be discussed. ____________________________ \"Future handling of similar incidents\" \"1.38 There have been considerable improvem ents in contingency arrangements for and the management of any future chemical incidents since 1988. Ho wever, it is noted that the following areas may require particular consideratio n in the management of a future incident of the type which occurred in Cornwall: the early identification of populations which may need to be monitored in any later epidemiological studies rapid, widespread dissemination of clear and accurate advice. I ndividuals should be informed about what has happened, the likel y consequences and any action they may need to take as promptly as possible . An information point, such as an enquiry line or drop-in centre , should be set up and should continue to operate for some time after the incident so that individuals can s eek advice on new concerns if and when they arise if the exposed population includes a la rge number of transient individuals e.g. holiday makers who are in the area tem porarily at the time of the incident, consideration must be given as to how to identify this population for inclusion in any future monitoring programme consideration of the effect of contamination upon the in take of chemical species from food when there are either direct or indirect routes for the contamination of food.\" Comment What improvements have been made? An internationally important effect of the initial analyses of the 1988 incident was that the Clayton Reports were adopted by the Food and Agri cultural Organization of the United Nations as an example of how to manage a chemical spillage - which is simply bizarre! Unless the LSG is prepared to spell out these improvements, this section is worthless as a discussion of the lessons that should be learned about ha ndling such incidents Nor do these recommendations relate to th e need for a more pr ecautionary approach to the response to ch emical spillages of aluminium su lphate. In a recent incident, approximately 1.3 tonn es of concentrated aluminium su lphate solution was spilled at South West Water plc's Pynes Water Treat ment Works in Exet er, Devonshire. The spilled chemical, along with an unspecified amount of wa ter from an underground channel below the works, wa s 'recovered and subjected to a cleaning process' - apparently the dead fish were strained out of the water into which it leaked - and then recycled through the water treatment process. There ap pears to have been no consideration of the possible chemical effects of the extremely acidic water on unspecified detritus lying in that channel before the dirty solution was recovered and recycled into the food chain. This illustrates the exte nt of the industr y's failure to appreciate the potential hazard s of spillages of this chemi cal, and brings into question whether in fact lessons have been learned. Early identification of vulnera ble populations depends on w ho decides what the threat is and on what basis the risk is assessed. This paragraph provides no proposal on how the manifest defects in the management of this incident could be replaced by an effective non-political respons e system. The Guy's Hospital Poisons Unit is reported to have been ordered not to send the emergency team promised immediately after the incident. The lack of authority of the Dir ector of the Unit to over-riding any such political instructions in the face of Britain' s worst ever water po isoning incident is alarming. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 82It suggests that political expediency may still play a controllin g role in obstructing rapid and effective emergency responses, even when the situation presents an overwhelming need fo r coordinating public re sponses and essentia l data salvage in politically sensitive circumstances. The role of the public in organizing community responses to such inci dents is repeatedly ignored by Government. Ev en quite recently, the public sector's priority in any chemical emergency was stil l stated to be to get the publ ic out of an incident area, by military force if necessary, and not to allow local people any autonomy or authority in dealing with local social issues. The Camelfor d Scientific Advisory Panel is now internationally cited as an exampl e of how such incide nts can draw on the skills of local people to deal with their problems. Communiti es do not always panic if provided with full information, and it is pa tronizing and insulting to try to exclude them and let 'authority' take over. A crucial question is, who will pay for running the 'd rop-in centre' proposed above? The reluctance of Government to ensure that emergency funds allocated for even overwhelmingly severe disasters such as th e recent Asian tsunam i actually get to the target locations do es not provide confiden ce that adequate - or indeed, any - funding would be available in a purely local incident su ch as this. It is now quite apparent that the Department of Health does not wish to incur the costs implicit in a full assessment of the health of the people of North Corn wall affected by this incident. Expecting it to pay for a 'dro p-in centre' for an indefinite period is probably equally na\u00efve. After the Lowermoo r Incident, the need for this essential social function was recognised and carried out without funding or support by local people in North Cornwall from the start of the incident until the present day. Indeed, the demand for this service has actually increased as time has passed. The social dimension of community support ha s expanded to include many aspects of personal and group interaction and advice that are entirely absent from any official recognition or acknowledgement. The cost of this, if supplied from the public purse, would have been substantial. Instead it ha s fallen on lo cal people already financially compromised by the failure of the public sector to provide even the most basic of support services to the traumatized population. _________________________________ Assessment of the hydraulic model of the Lowermoor Works. As part of its technical in vestigations, the LSG commi ssioned a deta iled hydraulic model of the Lowermoor Works and the ma in distribution pipelines and service reservoirs from Black and Veat ch Consultants. The purpose was to provide estimates of the time and concentrations of contamin ation within the Works and as the polluted water travelled through the distribution netw ork to consumers around North Cornwall. It was hoped that th e output from such a model would help to extrapolate from the information provided by the delayed and s poradic water sampling programme carried out by South West Water Auth ority (SWWA) following the incident. This would give the LSG a clearer over-all pi cture of the physica l characteristics of the incident, and assist it in estimating the limits of exposure of the people in differe nt parts of the area served by the dist ribution network. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 83What the model does well. Previously, the only predictive model was a physical one construc ted and tested by Philip Allen of SWWA in 1988-9. On running an aluminium su lphate solution through a wooden mock-up of the contact tank, he found that the ou tflow could have contained between 600 and 1200 mg Al/l. But no i ndication of the ti me scale, or of the concentrations of aluminium that might have appeared in the water distribution system to North Cornwall was possible. An important benefit of the new model is th at it is now possible for the first time to understand the time-scale and approximate levels of contamination that could have been associated with the water distribution sy stem. It describes the rate of mixing of the aluminium sulphate within the treatment works, and identifi es the time when it entered the main distribution sy stem. It also predicts the contamination levels over a period of four days , both within the Lowermoor Treat ment Works itself and in the water distribution system in at least the more proximal part of the area se rved by the Lowermoor Works. The sampling operation initia ted by SWWA immediately fo llowing the incident was hopelessly inadequa te. It collected only ten water samples on the 7 th July and twelve on the 8th July, yet the results of the anal ysis of samples taken on the 8th appear to form the basis of all subseque nt official estimates of the health implications of the incident. The new hydraulic model reveals that in fact the peak concentration of contaminated water passed through the syst em in the Camelford area ma ny hours before any attempt was made by SWWA to collect samples fro m the distribution syst em. It establishes that virtually all of the data obtained by analyz ing those water samples that were taken on the 7 th and 8th July have very little practical valu e in helping to assess the level of contamination in the critical few hours immedi ately after the inci dent. The value of such delayed sampling in assessing the possib le medical implicatio ns of the incident is low. We know that shortly after th e incident two SWWA chem ists were sent to the Lowermoor Treatment Work s on the evening of 6 th July. They spent a large part of the night attempting to find out where the contamination came from, and \"they were getting such high aluminium readings that they did not believ e their instruments\". Unfortunately, no trace of any records that they might have made has emerged, and no reference to such information was made in the Lawrence Report on the incident in 1988. Consequently, data that could have be en used to calibrat e the new model have been lost. In the Lawrence Report, the cl aim was made that concentrations of aluminium of '4 mg/l, peaking at 40 mg/l' were experience d briefly, then fell rapidly. This was misleading, because it was applied only to data collected on the 8 th of July and later - at least one and a half to two days after th e incident, and long af ter the actual peak contamination levels had pa ssed through the sections of the system close to Camelford. The very sparse SWWA water qua lity data relating to conditions on the 7th July indicated the existen ce of much higher levels of aluminium contamination, including one of 109 mg Al/l, but although briefly acknowledged by Lawrence, DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 84remarkably these were not treated as particularly important, and were relegated to a more or less coin cidental status. Yet this assessment fo rmed the foundation of the reassuring repor ts issued by Waring (DoH) and the Clayton Comm ittee a short time after the incident, and repeated interminably whenever any discussion of the Lowermoor Incident takes place. They also provided the basis on wh ich highly dismissive view s on the potential adverse health effects were issued repeatedly by th e health sector, right up to the present. What the model fails to describe adequately Even in the present study the validity of the new model has been compromised. There is a curious abse nce of data on the ti mes that SWWA water sa mples were taken; none of the sample times are record ed in the material provided to the LSG. Yet one of us has direct practical experien ce in this work with SWWA's predecessor; we can state categorically that recordin g sampling times has always been a fundamental and routine requirement wh en collecting water sa mples for the SWWA. As a result of this unexplained deletion, the new model has had to assume that all samples from this source were collected at mid-day on the date indicated; this is reflected by plotting of all samp le data at the mid-day point for the relevant date in the plots shown in the Draft. The model itself concludes that '99.9% of the aluminium would have been disc harged from the (contact) tank after 10 hours', 'After 24 hours, 92% sulphate . . . was predicted to the clear water tank' (paragraphs 3.67 and 3.68). Introducing an un certainty factor of up to 12 hours in the times at which these downstream samples were take n seriously compromises ca pacity to calibrate the model using real-time field data derive d from SWWA's own analytical data. The peak contamination spread to relatively distant sections of th e system within 48 hours, yet the SWWA sampling regime still failed to locate the peaks of contamination that were cri tical to understandi ng the incident, because their sampling programme started far too late. Yet one crucial privately-coll ected water sample for which the exact time of sampling is available is treated by the modellers as if the time at which it was taken is also uncertain. If the information is correctly re-plotted in Fig 19 (page 68), it reveals that the May Rose Farm sample actually provi des the only reliable indication of the concentration of aluminium present in those parts of the distribution system immediately following the incident. Yet the Draft contains the following extraordinary statement, \"Given that this (sample containing 620 mg Al/l) is the only major anomaly with the modelling results, it raises serious doubt about the validity of the sample.\" (para 3.70) In other words, if th e evidence does not fi t the theory, then it is the evidence (and not the model) that must be wrong! DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 85 It is a fundamental pr inciple of scientific methodology that the test of any theory is whether or not it reflects real ity. When evidence indicates a theory is wrong , then it is the theory that shou ld be modified, and not the eviden ce. Discarding inconvenient evidence is a serious scientific mischief, to be de plored in any research study. Yet at present this new model remains purely a th eoretical construct; remarkably, it has not been calibrated. It is wrongly assumed that si nce the predicted de cay curves of the contamination in the system correspond well with almost all of SWWA analytical results from the 7 th and 8th July onwards, they must therefore reflect reasonably well what happened during the crucial early hours after the incident. This is unacceptable - the data that it claims to reflect accurately were all obtained from sample s that were taken after the initial slug of highly cont aminated water had passed th rough much of the system. There are also questions regarding the accuracy of some of the analyses. Evidence of a deep layer of solids in the contact tank. In fact, data from the May Rose Farm sample could and should be used to calibrate the model. Two witnesses have provided wr itten depositions to the LSG recording the evidence of sludge in the contact tank at the time of the incident. This was given by a former SWWA staff member to a formal meeting of the Lowermoor Incident Liaison Group in Camelford, a few mont hs after the incident. He st ated that the contact tank into which the aluminium sulphate was discha rged did not in fact contain only treated water under chlorination at th e time. Instead, there was \"about a metre of sludge on the bed of the contact tank, firm enough for a man to walk on it, and reaching up to the level of the outlet.\" As the modellers themselves state, the contact tank ou tlet was approximately one metre above the floor of the tank. Unfortunately, the schematic showing the components of the Lowermoor Treatment Works (Fig 2, page 30) shows every component except the cont act tank in profile - the tank is in plan. So the vertical relationship between the outlet pipe and the fl oor of the tank is not evident in the plan of the treatment works. The configuration of this 'high level outlet ' has led to a remarkab le dispute that has distorted the out put of the model. This has resulte d in an unduly optim istic (i.e., low) estimate of the concentration of aluminium sulphate that existed in the distributions system near to Camelford im mediately after the incident. It also sugge sts that the estimate of the time when th e peak concentration left the works and passed through the distribution system may require revision. In his original analysis of the incide nt, Cross (1990) noted th at the bottom of the contact tank, below the level of the outlet pipe, effectively fo rmed a 'sump' into which the dense solution of aluminium sulpha te would have flowed. This would have slowed the rate at which th e solution mixed w ith the water flowin g through the tank, and would have provided more time for SW WA to have realized that there was a serious water quality prob lem, and to have respond ed more effectively. The existence of this 'sump' has been disput ed, yet the original ev idence came from a SWWA staff member who had inspected the co ntact tank shortly af ter the incident. A cross-sectional view at the location of th e outlet of the contact tank shows that the DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 86outlet was and remains, as the modellers state, a 'high- level outlet', approximately half way up the side wall of th e tank. The lower half of the contact tank would therefore have acted as a partial trap fo r the extremely dense aluminium sulphate solution as it was poured into the contact ta nk. The claim of the ey e-witness that there was a layer of sludge to a depth of one metre is therefore credible, especially in view of the mismanagement at the works for many years before th is incident. In fact the model, as it has been run so fa r, effectively recogni zes the existence of Cross's 'sump effect'. He commented that th e effect of sludge in this 'sump' would have been to accelerate the ra te at which the pol lutant could have passed out of the system. The model output ther efore mirrors the potentially delayed release of the aluminium sulphate into the distribution system had the 'sump' been clear of sludge, as postulated by Cross fifteen years ago. In the account of the modellin g the level of the water record ed in the cont act tank at the time of the incident in dicated an apparent depth of 2.2m, (Appendix 10. Page 267), and the calculated flushing time and concentrations of contaminants entering and leaving the treated water tank downstream were based on the assumption that the true depth of water in the c ontact tank was i ndeed 2.2m. But if the sludge was present as the witness records, then the actual volume of the tank would have been only around half of that assumed in the model. Th is would have accelerated the rate at which the contamination pa ssed through the works, and increased the peak concentration of the contamination entering the distribution system. Indeed, without the 1 metre high differential betw een the bottom of the tank and the outlet, the aluminium sulphate solu tion would have begun to emerge from the contact tank within, at most, a few minutes of the start of the delivery. The model therefore does not provide a reliable description of the time and concentration of pollutant in th e outflow in the presence of the sludge deposit filling half of the contact tank. The so-called 'anomalous' Ma y Rose Farm water sample contained 620 mg Al/l, and is the sole evidence of the actual concentr ation from the distribution mains. It would have been drawn into the long feeder pipe to the Farm during the late evening of the 6th July, exactly when the model indicates that the highest concentration of pollutant would have been in the region of Helstone . It was stored overni ght in the pipes and tanks of the cottages on the Farm, and used to make mo rning drinks at 053o hrs on the 7th July. The concentration of al uminium in this sample is probably close to the concentration that the model would have predicted had the modellers accepted that the sludge was indeed present as stated. Remarkably, they did not re-run the model to assess this alternative scenario, which wo uld in effect have calibrated the model against the actual field evidence. Instead they sought the views of a specialist in water treatment who was not present at the time, and indeed may never have visi ted the Lowermoor Work s. They accepted his view that it was extremely improbable th at there had been an y such sludge in the tank, or that it could support the weight of a man. Inst ead he apparently proposed that those making the observation must have mistaken the sludge fo r some hypothetical and non-existent 'benching' in the cont act tank. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 been suppo rt theory! Conflicting evidence from 'blue baths' downstream of service reservoirs. Had the model been adjusted and calibrated as described above, the result would almost certainly have been mo re consistent with other ob servations that also raise doubts about the validity of its predictions. For instance, Cross demonstr ated to the LSDG that when water contai ning the secondary contam inant copper comes into contact with some soaps and detergents, it only develops th e strong blue coloration reported by many lo cal people if the copper concentr ation is in ex cess of 1000mg/l. The aluminium concentration in the pollu ted water wherever a 'blue bath' was reported would have ha d to be in the region of 285 mg /l or greater to release sufficient sulphuric acid to disso lve sufficient c opper in the aci dic water. The model predicts that the maximum concentrations of aluminium in the outflow of the service reservoirs at Delabole and St Endellion would have been around 125 mg Al/l, yet 'blue baths' were reported downstream of these reservoirs. The concentrations predicted by the model for these reservoir outflo ws are too low to account for the development of this indicative phenome non. Had the model accepted the presence of the sl udge layer, the resultan t output predictions for these reservoirs would have been consistent with the development of the 'blue bath' effects downstream. Additional toxicological implications of th e contamination of the water supply by sludge in the contact tank. One important potential health implication of the presence of sludge in the contact tank is obscured by the modellers' decisi on to reject of the evidence of its presence. The extremely acidic water above this layer would have diss olved out some components of th e sludge, and possibly mo re would have been physically mobilized and carried out into th e distribution mains. Bu t since there is no information about the composition of that sludge, this is likely to remain an unresolved additional factor in the toxicology of the incident. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 88In conclusion The Local Representative Member s of the LSG St udy of the 1988 Lowermoor Incident disassoci ate themselves from the conclusions expressed in the Executive Summary of the Draft Repo rt. The view that this study was a 'toxicological risk assessment' is incons istent with the requi rements of the Terms of Reference and inappropriate for th e analysis of a hi storic event. The study has failed to in vestigate all of the availa ble evidence, notably the past and present medical condition of th ose exposed to the contamination, and particularly of those who continue to exhibit residual medical conditions that they attribute to th eir exposure to it. We note with concern the re-emergence of the reassurance first issued by the DoH immediately after the incident, a nd repeated interminably for the past sixteen years, that the Lowermoor Incident is no t expected to pose any substantial threat to human health. In the Executive Summa ry this outdated official mantra is resur rected, and implies discredit to the members of the Lowermoor Sub-Group who have worked hard to compile an invaluable summary of evidence on the actual effect s of the incident. 1. Methodology Because the incident was unprecedented, the Dr aft's assessment of its medical risks relies far too he avily on inadequate literature sources It is not with the collecti on and recording of data in the Draft that we are concerned, but with the interpretations pl aced upon that evidence expressed in the Executive Summary. The statements are dependent on analyses based far too heavily on literature sources and previous experience for an understanding of an incident in which th e health risks to a large and disparate popu lation were in fact unprecedented and unpredictable. Failure examine personal medical records means that the conclusions presented in the Draft are no t supported by any clinical ly robust assessment of the present conditions of those still claiming to be ex periencing seve re and long- lasting symptoms. Instead, reliance is placed upon a ra ndom and extremely small collection of often-controversial studies, most carried out over a decade before this present study. 2. The Lowermoor syndrome Within a small group of severely affected people there is a di stinct syndrome that should be investigated as such; the atte mpt by the Draft to deal with, and even dismiss, individual symptoms as if th ey were unrelated is inappropriate. In analyzing the i ndividual symptoms, the Draft fa ils to consider the common set of symptoms exhibited by a small but clearly defined group of complainants as possibly constituting a novel clinical syndrome. We hold that the totality of the symptoms should be regarded as indicative of a to xic overload resulting from DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 89exposure to an und contaminan ts; individual symptoms should be re-assessed within th at framework, and not as if they are unrelated . The assistance of experts in aluminiu m (and other metal) toxicology, in relevant associated fields of neurotoxicol ogy, and in the fi eld of chemical sensitivity, shou ld be sought to provi de a more comprehe nsive view of the implications of this incident. Those peopl e exhibiting this c ondition should receive immediately the detailed medical exam ination to which th ey are entitled. 3. Political obstruction The study has been hamstrung by politi cal obstruction and the failure of the health sector to collect rel iable and comprehensive data on the medical effects of the incident. The origins of this obstruction and those responsible for implementing it should be identified and replaced by sound and accountable strategies for dealing with such chemical accidents a nd their health impacts in the future. Political obstruction to providing an effective medical res ponse to the incident has been evident from July 1988, and remains an issue right through to the present day. At the time of the Incident the health sector accepted wit hout question medically unjustified dismissals of the hea lth risks, and has s tifled all subsequent dissenting concern. Access to medical services and justice for those affected has been blocked repeatedly, resulting in an absence of critical data on the medical effects of exposure. This has seriously obstructed the work of the LSG in assessing the implications of the evidence now available to it. The death of a wide range of livestock forced to drink the contaminated water provided important early warnings of the potential severity of the toxicological risks to people. The persistent dismissa l of the relevance of such data when applied to a large an d diverse populati on implies a serious fa iling in pr ofessional standards. Those persons and policies res ponsible for obstructing the victims of this incident from having such assistan ce for the past sixt een years should be identified and removed, to ensure th at such injustice is not repeated. The Terms of Reference fo r the LSG study were ame nded at the last moment by the DoH to prohibit th e Sub-Group from identifying the reasons and persons responsible for the resultant absence of reliable medica l data. The failure of the health sector to advi se the population of health risks at the time, without political bias, or to engage subseque ntly in an adequate monitoring and support programme for those worst affected, must be investigated. Suitable safeguards s hould be put in place to en sure that such bias and deficiencies in re sponding to chemical emergencies do no t occur again. The study's second Te rm of Reference requires the LSG to make recommendations on future management of the medical monitoring of, and research on, the incident. Th is is impossible without a full understanding of those aspects of its administrati ve and political history that are responsible for the present difficulties in coll ecting and interpreting data. The scope of the all such studies should be wide ned to allow them to identify an d comment on the defects in the medical management of the incident and their consequences. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 90 4. Public policy in chemical emergencies The Draft recommends that drop-in cen tres should be funded in similar circumstances. But it fa ils to recognise that providing financial and administrative support to lo cal self-help groups is th e most socially- and cost- effective method of promoting strong liaisons between public sector authorities, the emergency services and the public exposed to su ch incidents. The Draft should contain more targeted proposals, which can be used as a model for responding to future ch emical emergencies. In chemical emergencies of this type, provided that the immediate threats to public safety are abated, public involvement is the only reliable means whereby any resultant social problems may be ma naged and all possible relevant data salvaged without political interference. Public funds should be rapi dly available for local sel f-help groups to establish community contact centres an d support services , and liaise with public authorities and experts in the management and recordin g of such incidents and their impacts. The policies and procedures of local and nati onal emergency res ponse services engaged in dealing with su ch incidents should be revi ewed, and robust structures developed to ensure that interference in the name of political expediency does not occur. 5. The hydraulic mode l of the Lowermoor Works and distribution system . The hydraulic model used in the study sh ould be revised to take into account evidence that has been im properly rejected in the initial computations. The strengths and limitations of the model to predict the full range of chemical implications in this incident shou ld be identified and explained. Whilst providing valuable provisional insights into the timing of the peak contamination levels in an d close to Camelford, and in some of the nearby communities, the refusal to recognise evidence on the pres ence of the sludge layer in the contact tank is unjustified. The model should be re-run to include this additional factor, and the out put calibrated against the water quality data from the May Rose Farm water sample, to reflect recorded field cond itions. The revised output data s hould then be re-interpreted. The output from the model reveals that the Water Author ity failed to act quickly enough to secu re crucial water qual ity data during th e critical periods when peak contamination concentrations ex isted in the distribu tion mains, but the Draft fails to emphasize th is important lesson. Contingency planning in industries in which chem ical accidents could affect large areas should in clude provisions to identify crit ical nodes in the distribution system or potential contamination areas at which recording pollu tion monitors can be installed to provide adequate monitori ng data on the timi ng and intensity of public exposure or risk. Su ch records should be secu rely sealed and in the possession of local pub lic health authorities to ensure their availability id they become relevant to fu ture incidents or emer gent health issues. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr ical data show that seconda ry chemical re actions were taking place between the pr imary pollutants and materi als deposited ove r a period within the distribution system itself. Th e model does not provide information on the potential extent of contamination of secondary pollutants su ch as copper, lead and manganese. There is a clear chemical relationship between the potential of primary contaminants (such as the su lphuric acid releas ed in this incident) to engage in complex secondary chemical reactions. Within broad limits, the theoretical maxima of the resultant secondary cont aminants resulting from acid attack of domestic plumbing systems are predictabl e. The model can be used to estimate some 'worst case' scenarios that could ha ve developed in different parts of the distribution system. The Draf t has failed to discuss the use of the calibrated model's predictions to expand understanding of potential 'downs tream' effects in incidents of this type. 6. The importance of so cial factors in community perceptions of the incident. The social disruption caused by the inci dent, and the social damage resulting from the defective re sponse of the medical sector , are important but neglected aspects of this study. The Draft should provide a clearer analysis of how socio- economic factors regulated the individual risks of exposu re to the contamination. It should also provide a section explaining the relev ance of the sociological factors that subsequently affected comm unity relations within the population after this incident. Severe social divisions have developed within the local community as a direct result of the pub lic sector's refusal to provide fu ll medical and so cial support to those needing them. The variability of in dividual exposure to the contaminated water, of individual medical responses to it, and of the failure of the health sector to be seen to be providing the best possible respon se and assistance to those in need of support have promot ed conflicting entr enched beliefs a bout the incident. These could have been avoided with fu ll and open admission by the medical establishment of its uncertainty of the implications of the incident. Socio-economic factors were highly relevant in affecting the exposure risks experienced in different lo cations. There were very significant discrepancies between the actual exposure to contaminants of indivi duals living in different properties, even if they were adjacent . Different houses ha d widely differing plumbing systems; some had direct cold water supply to thei r taps, others had header tanks in their loft s; domestic water pipes we re of copper , cast iron, polyethylene, or even in some cases of lead. In some holiday accommodation properties, high occupancy rates resulted in large nu mbers of people using the toilet facilities before reti ring on the evening of the 6th July. Consequently, some properties were more likely to draw off highly contaminated water passing through the ne arby water mains, and become exposed to the worst of the contamin ated water during the following morning. The salvage of the most critical water qua lity data of the entire in cident from such a location emphasizes the importance of recognizing su ch factors in plan ning emergency and monitoring responses to such in cidents. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 92 The public needs to be help ed to understand how variables within the system, the characteristics of different proper ties, and the physiol ogical differences between individuals ca n result in hi ghly variable exposures and medical responses in homes and those living in them. This is necessary to reconc ile disparate and by now entrenched views of the physical and chemical effect s of the contamination in homes and on the health of the population. The Draft should provide a clearer explanatio n of the reasons for the variability in exposure risks, and prov ide more discussion on the sociological factors that led to th e present climate of social divi sion and public di strust of the health sector. Doug Cross and Peter Smith 4th April 2005 DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 93Subgroup Report on the Lowerm oor Water Pollution Incident COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT FOR CONSULTATION General Point I am extremely disappointed about the general tone of the report. In particular it does not come across as being independent, rather it gives the im pression of always looking for ways to di smiss any possibility that indivi duals were harmed or will be harmed by the poisoning of their drinking water with aluminium sulphate . In doing so the subgroup have ch osen to ignore, or have not consulted, large swathes of the scientific literature and have chosen to cite a limited literature which supports what appears to be a prejudic ed view of the event. I have no intention of di rectly addressing these inadequacies in this submission. The subgroup had more than enough time and opportunity to unde rtake a thorough re view of the relevant l iterature and they have decided that such would not be necessary. Whil st ignorance cannot change the facts it can help to keep them under wraps and this seems to have been the motive of the subgroup. Why the Department of Health should pr efer to protect the interests of South West Water Ltd and the Aluminium Federation and not the health of the residents of this area of the United Ki ngdom is an open question. Specific Points 1. The subgroup has no expert ise in any aspect of the en vironmental toxicology of aluminium. The subgroup made almost no atte mpt to remedy this situation. Review data pertaining to aluminium were provided by the Department of Health Toxicology Unit at Imperial College, L ondon, and all documents were written by postgraduate and postdoctoral staff with no direct experience of any aspect of the environmental toxicology of aluminium. The subgroup took or al evidence on al uminium from only four individuals with recognised experien ce in the environmental toxicology of aluminium. I was one of these individuals (the others were, Dr P Altmann, Dr N Ward and Dr N Roberts) though I wa s not invited to gi ve evidence I, in dependently, offered to give evidence. In addition to my oral evidence I also provided the subgroup with a written critique of their summ ary document LSG/02/29. I am not aware that any of the information which I supp lied to the subgroup in ei ther oral or writte n form has formed any part of the consultation document. In addition after I had given my oral evidence to the subgroup the ch airman, Professor HF Woods, th anked me and as ked if I would be prepared to a ssist the subgroup in prep aring the sections of the final report which pertained to the environmental toxicology of aluminium. In spite of my agreement to this effect I have never had any furthe r communication with Professor Woods. The latter was in spite of the f act that I was in regular c ontact with members of the secretariat, Mr George Kowa lczyk and Mr Khandu Mistry for the entire duration of the enquiry. 2. The subgroup took oral evidence from the Aluminium Federation though they omitted to point out in the report (Appendix 3) th at Professor J Edwardson and Professor N Priest gave their evidence on behalf of the Aluminium Federation. Thus the subgroup took oral evidence from four representatives of th e Aluminium Industry and only four representatives of independent research on the environmental toxicology of aluminium. Why did the subgroup take ev idence from an umbrella organisation the members of which are the wo rldwide aluminium industry which is an industry which does not fund any open resear ch on the environmen tal toxicology of DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 94aluminium ? I have been told that it is only a coincidence that the Aluminium Federation gave evidence at the meeting which immediatel y followed the meeting at which I gave evidence and th at they wrot e to the subgroup and requested to give evidence without any prior knowledge that I had give n evidence. Documentary evidence to support th is chain of even ts should be ma de forthcoming as an alternative scenario is th at the subgroup or someone asso ciated with the subgroup invited the Aluminium Federation to give evidence at this time. Is it a coincidence that the Department of Health are supporting financially at leas t one of the individuals, (Priest) who gave evidence on behalf of the Aluminiu m Federation? Professor N Priest was awarded a contract by the Depa rtment of Health to commence on the 1st of January 1999 valued at \u00a395,600 to undertake studies on; 'The deve lopment of assays for the determination burden in man' (D.H. Reference No: PRIEST/CHEM/98/1). The indivi dual in the Department of Health whom acted as signatory to this contract was Miss FD Pollitt , who also happens to be the Scientific Secretary to the Lowermoor subgroup . Questions should be asked as to why the Department of Health funded an individual (who they new to be a representative of the aluminium industry) who, to use Priest 's own words as writt en in the contract, 'is a consultant to the Intern ational Aluminium Industry' !? The award of this contract is even more of a scandal if one considers that even though the contract was due to expire on the 1st of November 2001 the Department of Health ha ve, over three years later, still not received a single publishe d outcome from the research . Indeed, upon my latest enquiry I was told that they were still awaiting the interim report on this project! It is also a scandal that th is award to a consultant of the aluminium industry represents the only grant of any kind awarded by government , including all of the research counc ils, during the past ten years in the subject area of aluminium and human health. 3. The fact that the subgr oup took evidence from the Aluminium Federation would not be so important if it wa s not that the evidence of Priest and Edwardson was the most heavily used and cited in the report . The scandalous misu se of the published literature is one of the subj ects of a Letter to the Editor recently published in the British Medical Journal ( http://bmj.bmjjournals.com /cgi/eletters/330/7486/275- a?ck=nck ). A particular example of the subgroup's misuse of the published literature is their extensive refere nce to Priest (2004). No t only is this a revi ew article written by a known representative of the Aluminium Federation it is also currently the subject of a Letter to the Editor of the Journal of Environmental Monitoring (the RSC journal which published the paper) c oncerning the author's failure to disclose 'conflicts of interest' relating to his connections with the international aluminium industry. This letter will appear in the May Issue of the journal. Clearl y the connections between the Department of Health and the Internatio nal Aluminium Industry run deep and the Lowermoor subgroup would have been better advise d to have steere d clear of such complications. 4. The terms of reference of the COT Lowermoor subgroup are outlined in section 2.9 on page 23 of their report; \"To advise on whether the exposure to chemi cals resulting from the 1988 Lowermoor water pollution incident has caused, or is ex pected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to human health; and DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 95To advise whether the existing programme of monitoring and rese arch into the human health effects of the incident should be augmented and, if so, to make recommendations.\" These terms of reference ha ve since been amended to; \"The committee took at face value the information which members of th e public told them about their health . Members did not consider that there was a need to confirm what they were told by looking at medical notes or by commissioning medical assessments, neither was this the purpose of the investigat ion. The assessment made by the committee was a toxicological risk assessment, in whic h the key questions were: 1. what levels of exposure were indivi duals likely to have had to the contaminants and, 2. given what is known about the toxi city of the contaminan ts, were they likely to have caused harm to health at these exposures. Medical notes and clinical inve stigations of individuals clai ming persistent ill-health would not have assisted in this risk assessment.\" (Frances Pollitt, DoH Secret ariat, 17th March 2005) The above is a quotation whic h was made in response to a question concerning whether or not any assessme nt was made by the subgroup of the 'medical' evidence presented to the subgroup. Clearly, and pe rhaps in spite of th e original terms of reference, the subgroup were not concerned with the health of individuals who might have been affe cted by the incident . They have interpreted the terms of reference such that their remit is limited to a risk assessment of an hypothetical exposure to the pois oned drinking water s upply. In this respec t the subgroup have employed a number of strategi es to try to ascertain the concentration of aluminium to which individuals were expo sed and how this concentration would have changed in the days which followed the incident. Much of the available info rmation is contained in Chapter 3. One do es not have to read far into this chapter to have the ignorance of the subgroup's knowledge of anything to do with aluminium confirmed. The equation in section 3.14 and its corre sponding footnote ar e non-sensical and ye t the information that the subgroup was tr ying to deliver by using them was absolu tely critical to their understanding of this aspect of the po isoning event. This is not a good start! The majority of the water qualit y data were provid ed by the po lluters, South West Water Ltd. However, in a simila r approach to the medica l evidence, th e subgroup have not appraised this data in any way . Neither the ha phazard manner in which water samples were collected for analysis (the sampling) nor the me thods by which the samples were analysed have be en critically appraised. Th ese water quality data will form the major part of the subgroup's risk assessment analysis and yet the risks associated with using these potentially flawed data were not dete rmined. From only a preliminary look at the data presented in Table 4 it is immediately obvious that there are some significant discrepancies between the concentrations recorded for aluminium and those recorded for sul phate. (Remember that the al uminium was 'dumped' into the water supply as a slurry of aluminium sul phate.) Conveniently , perhaps, there were not any measurements for sulphate on the days immediately following the incident. However, the m easurements for sulphate and aluminium on the 9th of July (three days after the incident) revealed th at the measurements gi ven for aluminium are a significant underestimate of what would have been expected from the corresponding sulphate concen tration. The aluminium co ncentrations offered by South West Water Ltd are between 2 and 5 times lower than would be predicted by DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 96the sulphate concentr ation. Interestingly the trend of underestimating the aluminium concentration is only continued for wate r samples collected up to about the 18th of July at which time the meas ured aluminium concentrations (which are now all at or below 1 mg/L) are exactly as would be predicted by the corresponding sulphate concentrations. The significant discrepancies between the me asured concentrations of aluminium and sulphate are mentioned in se ction 3.65 on page 63 of the report but they do not prevent the subgroup from con tinuing to use the South West Water Ltd data in their subsequent risk assessm ents. The data con cerning aluminium concentrations in tapwater in the days followin g the poisoning of the potable supply are clearly flawed in such a way as to underestimate the degree to which individuals were exposed to aluminium. These data, though pr etty horrendous in themselves, are clearly what So uth West Water Ltd. are willing to ac cept in the terms of their liability though they have little if any scientific cred ibility and this should have been clear to anyone with any relevant ex perience on the subg roup. In many wa ys the subgroup allowed themselves, conveniently, to be conf used by the modelling exercise that they commissioned to try to dete rmine how the aluminium which had been dumped into the treatment tank at Lowermoor would subsequently have been distributed throughout the potable water ne twork. Like many models this can only be a very crude approximation of events and as such may be usef ul to present ideas concerning proportional differences in aluminium concentration th roughout the network but it cannot be definitive in term s of the absolute concentrations of aluminium. Indeed, even the modellers have th emselves questioned the validity of their model beyond twenty four hours after the event. The subgroup would have been better serv ed by asking the question as to whether the water quality analyses which were at their disposal were sufficiently reliable to be used in their subsequent risk assessments. Cl early, if they had aske d this ques tion they would have concluded that such reliable da ta were not availabl e to them. No one could have argued with such a conclusion. 5. The subgroup then proceede d to use the flawed water quality data to calculate estimates of human exposure to aluminium and ot her contaminants in the po isoned tap waters. The fu tility of the textbook approach taken by th e subgroup should be evident to anyone interested in the scientif ic method. The test of the validity of their approach should be that it would survive peer review and could be published in a quality scientific journal. Irrespective of the fact that the water quali ty data used in the calculations of exposure were flawed it is the simplistic manner in which these data were used that negates their scientific cr edibility. I am making my assessment as someone who reviews more than thirty sc ientific manuscripts each year and as someone who has reviewed for more than fift y different scientific journals. There are members of the subgroup wh o should have a similar experience in the scientific method and yet they have not question ed the approach taken in the draft report. Why ? For whatever reas on, though it cannot have a scientific basis, it is clear that the subgroup believe that their es timates of 'worst-case expo sures' for al uminium (and other contaminants) are of considerable value and consequently all of their recommendations concer ning the likely impact of th e pollution incident on human health have been based upon them. In my original su bmission to the subgroup I pointed out that it would be impossible to determin e human exposure without looking at the individua ls that were exposed . The subgroup ignored this advice as being outside of their remit, almost certainly their under standing and most probably their budget. Later on in these comments I shall include some brief recommendations on how we might, even today, be able to determin e the likely exposure of the DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 97Camelford residents to alum inium without rely ing upon unsatisfact ory water quality analyses supplied by the polluters. 6. Chapter 5 of the draft repo rt is at least useful in that it confirms that many individuals were exposed to the contaminated drinking water and suffered ill effects commensurate with aluminium poisoning. All of the ill effects reported in this chapter are documented in the scientific literature in re spect of exposure to environmental aluminium. However, what is truly intriguing about the evidence presented in this chapter is not what was repor ted but indeed what was no t reported. Human exposure to aluminium has been linked with a numb er of classes of disease, namely, (i) neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease, multiple scle rosis, epilepsy ..etc. (ii) diseases of the bone and connective tissues including osteomalacia, adynam ic bone disease, arthritic conditions..etc. and (iii) haematological conditions including an anaemia and an insensitivity to erythr opoetin. There is an exhaustive scientific and medical literature covering the role or putative role of alum inium in these diseases (including effects relating to the thyroi d !!) and yet the Department of Health, as part of their ongoing assessment of the possible he alth effects of th e incident funded st udies looking at, pregnancy outcomes, child growth, mortality , cancer incidence in cluding leukaemia, and educational achievements of schoolchildren. Why were these 'health outcomes' chosen whilst those which might have identified likely exposure to aluminium largely ignored. The subgroup we re often dismissive of the acc ounts of the health of many individuals in that they were criticised for being 'self- reported'. It is quite clear that whoever was responsible for organising the so -called monitoring of the health of the local population following the poisoning was extremely care ful in selecting health criteria which were least li kely to indicate an y influence of the known exposure to aluminium. Why were th ese criteria chosen ? 7. As someone who lives and breathes the subject of alum inium, whethe r through its chemistry with silicic acid to form hydroxyaluminosilicates and so to keep aluminium out of biota or its interact ion with beta-amylo id in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease, I am confident when I say that even with the best will in the world and all of the relevant scientific literature immediatel y available because of the lack of reliable data concerning individual e xposure to aluminiu m during and follow ing the poisoning incident it would not be poss ible to provide un equivocal answers relating to the terms of reference of the Lowerm oor enquiry. We have two unas sailable facts; (i) twenty tonnes of aluminium sulpha te were dumped into the potable water supply of Camelford and the surrounding areas and (ii) many indivi duals were exposed to the poisoned water and ma ny of those experienced illnes ses following exposure. We now need to know ho w many people; (i) contin ued to suffer ill- effects; (ii) have developed ill-effects as a consequence of their exposure and (iii) are st ill to suffer ill-effects as a consequence of their exposure. This cannot be achieved in any other way than by looking at the affect ed population. A first approach woul d be to dete rmine if the population had a higher than normal body burden of aluminium. We are all aware that our bodies have no requireme nt for aluminium and so th e storage or retention of aluminium in our bodies can only put unneccessary stre ss upon our physiology. How this may manifest itself will be entirely depe ndent upon the indivi dual and individual susceptibility to disease. Larger body burdens of aluminium will increase our individual susceptibilit y to an aluminium-related diseas e. Thus estimates of the body burden of aluminium will enable a better und erstanding of the likelihood that an individual has suffered, is su ffering or will suffer in the future from an aluminium-DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 98related illness. The de termination of an estimate of the body burden of aluminium in an individual is not a trivial matter but there are a nu mber of almost completely non- invasive techniques which c ould be used to achieve this. For example, it was announced at the Sixth Keele Meeting on Aluminium (26th Feb - 2nd March, 2005) that the aluminium content of bone, which is an important indicator of a prior exposure to aluminiu m, can now be measured without the requiremen t of a biopsy using in vivo neutron activation. The 'patient ' will simply be asked to place th eir hand in small tube for a s hort period of time during which the hand will be bombarded with neutrons and data corres ponding to the aluminium co ntent of the bone will be collected. This is only one of a number of ways th at we should be able to make useful estimates of the body burden of alum inium in individuals. Th ese body burdens will be a first step in establishing that people absorbed and retain ed aluminium in their bodies following the pollution incide nt. Those individuals showin g the highest burdens might then have their past, present and future health scrutinised more thoroughly to establish whether or not their health had been or wa s being impacted by th eir exposure to the poisoned drinking wate r. Only by such a human-based approa ch will any subgroup be able to make strong conclu sions concerning th e possible health effects of what happened at Lowermoor tr eatment work s on the 6th of Ju ly 1988. The conclusions drawn by the present subgroup and contained within their draft report have neither scientific foundat ion nor credibility and can do nothing to allay the very real fears of the individuals who believe that they we re poisoned by the polluted drinking water.

On the basis of the available data, the Royal College of Physicians concurs with the conclusion of the Report that the combinatio n of metals which occurred as a result of the pollution incident would not have caused, or woul d not be expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health. The Royal College of Physicians supports the recomm endations that: (i) Further studies should be carried out to explore the neuropsyc hological status of those individuals who consumed the contam inated water; (ii) Investigations should be carried out into the cognitive, behavioural and educational development of individuals wh o were under one ye ar of age at the time of the incident; (iii) A study should be performed to assess whether the prevalence of joint pains and/or swelling in the population receivin g the contaminated wa ter is higher than normal; (iv) The monitoring of routine health statistics for the popu lation potentially exposed to contaminated water after the Lowerm oor pollution incident should continue; (v) There is a need for furthe r work on the toxicity of aluminium, specifically studies to identify the N OAEL (no-observed-adverse-e ffect-level) for aluminium salts, for both acute and ch ronic exposure and a range of salts at different bioavailabilities; (vi) Mechanistic data on the ne urotoxicity of aluminium and its potential role in neurological disease and other di sorders should be generated; (vii) Further studies on the bi oavailability of aluminium in humans should be performed. From The Registrar Rodney Burnham MD FRCP Telephone extension 235 Direct endorses the recomme ndation that there should be rapid and widespread dissemination of accurate advice, partic ularly to medical practitioners, if further ch emical incidents of this kind were to take place. In conclusion the College is reassured by the thor oughness of the evaluations contained in the report and the fact that no neurotoxic effects have been identified almost seven years since the exposure. I trust these comments are of use.

I trust you shall pass this on to the committee. Sincerely Dr Bettina Platt DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 102 Comments on the subg roup report on the Lowermoor Water Pollution Incident As a neuroscientists working in a medical research institute , and with an interest and an expertise in metal toxicity and mental health, I have to express my concern about the enquiry in the abov e incident. My main c oncern lies with the lack of medical and epidemiological data sought by the committee from the individuals exposed. It is entirely unacceptable to conduct an enquiry of such an incident w ithout essential medical data and related continuous monitoring of the affected population. Furthermore, the assessment of parameters relevant in cases of al uminium exposure should be the focus of such an assessment, such as repeated cognitive and neurological assessments , particularly in the elderly and in people with pre-existing neurological conditions. Monitori ng of the current aluminium load and correlations to relevant neurological parameters are also still possible , and should be investigated in connection with the indi viduals' medical history. Other points of concern are: 1) I could not find any eviden ce that the committee has sought appropriate expert advice on various issues of aluminium toxicology. Aluminium is unique in many aspects related to its chemical pr operties, interactions with biological system, and analytical prob lems related to its determ ination in the environment and in biological sa mples, and this is not consider ed appropriatel y in the your report. 2) The involvement of the Aluminium Federation in the proceedings, and scientists associated with them, is rath er questionable and of major concern. 3) Clarification is required with regards to why the company that caused the pollution (South West Water Ltd.) wa s involved in the water analyses following the incident. The resulting data cannot stand up to scientific and indeed ethical scrutiny. 4) As an expert in the filed of aluminium neurotoxicity, I would like to stress that the scientific data and information cons idered by the committee appears to be more than inadequa te and incomplete. I sincerely urge the committee to take action to rectify this situation. This incident requires more rigorous scrutiny , firstly to he lp the affected population, but also to gain insights into the effects of high Al exposure to the human body, and learn necessary lessons on how to deal with other pollution incidents in the future. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 103Re: Comments on COT Lo wermoor Subgroup Report on Water Pollution Incident Dear Sirs, We have reviewed the Lowerm oor Subgroup report on the 20 ton aluminum sulphate accidental dumping into the water supply at Camelford in July 1988. We have to totally agree with the comments of Dr. Chris Exley. We have seen so many of these types of reports in the United States, wher e many pages ar e produced to generate the illusion that th e environmental and public heal th matter at ha nd has been considered. We are so regretfu l to conclude that the repo rt appears to be aimed at whitewashing the issue. It is well known that aluminum causes c ognitive impairment in humans, and the Camelford spill involv ed a very large dosage. Prof ound effects are seen in very young children, in elde rly persons. For ex ample, there are now 22 drinking water epidemiology studies statis tically linking aluminum to either elderly cognitive impairment or Alzheiemr's disease. Cognitive effects are al so seen in high dosage situations like welders for middle-aged persons. (1) It is documented by many s ources that individuals diffe r in their absorption of aluminum. For example, P.Bria n Moore et al found the ab sorption of aluminum-26 to average higher in Alzheimer's disease pa tients. But there was a considerable individual scatter of absorpti on in both the c ontrol group and the AD cases. (2) And so, in Camelford one would expect some i ndividuals to be more significantly and aversely affect ed than others , just based on diffe ring absorpti on rates. Undoubtedly, there are also metabolic or dietary variable s that would make some individuals more prone to injury th an others from th e massive exposure. We are most impressed with the study of Paul Altmann et al, of the Camelford incident. Significant differen ces in cognitive f unction was found in exposed persons, compared to sibling controls using a range of tests, but most importantly the very sensitive flash and pattern visual evoked potentials. (3) This type of test is not only very sensitive, but it is also non-subjective. We conclude that Lowermoor Water Pollution Incident Subgr oup Report ne eds to be reworked by experts who have actual experience with al uminum in biology. The public deserves safe dr inking water, and alternative sa fer purification systems such as iron based coagulants are used widely in Europe, in a number of ci ties in the United States, and undoubtedly in locatio ns in the UK. Ma ny utilities, su ch as th at in Philadelphia, fi nd that they can reduce cost s by using iron coagulants. For all these reasons, we think that you should a dopt the recommendations of Dr. Chris Exley on this situation. We are a US-Canadian group, and have worked on the aluminum in health issue si nce 1989. Best regards, Erik Jansson, Pres.

DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 107Appendix 6: Reply to the Consultation Responses Introduction 1. A draft version of the Subgroup's repo rt was publish ed in Januar y 2005 and a consultation exercise to cons ider the draft report was run from 26 January to 20 May 2005. Twenty-six consultation responses were re ceived, four of wh ich were from one correspondent. Two submissions were received from one of the lay re presentatives on the subgroup; one of these reported information provided by an individual who had previously given oral evid ence to us. Five subm issions were received from individuals who had previously provided pe rsonal evidence about the incident to the Subgroup, and one from an individual who provided new personal evidence. This was reviewed but the evidence was not adde d to Tables 31 and 32 of the report, because it had not been provided in oral form (see Chapter 5, paragr aph 5.16). Four responses were received from individuals who had previously pr ovided technical information. Several responses provided ne w technical information, raised new issues or pointed out minor erro rs in the report. 2. A public consultati on meeting was held in Came lford on 17 Fe bruary 2005. Thirty-three individuals attende d and a number of helpful po ints were raised. These were considered by the S ubgroup with the written consultation responses. 3. The responses were helpfu l to us and we ar e grateful to the correspondents for their contribution to the development of this report. The exercise raised issues which we had not previously addressed, such as the question of what other trace contaminants might be presen t in the contaminat ed water (see Chapter 3, paragraphs 3.90 to 3.96). It has allowed us to identif y issues which require further explanation, such as why we did not revi ew individual medical records (see below) or why it has been difficult for us to ma ke use of medical samples pr ovided as pers onal evidence (see Chapter 5, paragraph 5.180). We have also been alerted to further scientific references on aluminium, which has enab led us to extend our review of this contaminant (see Chapter 6, paras 6.7 to 6. 84). As a result of the consultation exercise, we have extended the recommendation for investig ations into the cognitive, behavioural and educational development of children who were under 1 year of age at this time of the incident to include children who were in utero at the time of the incident (see Chapter 9, paragraph 9.4). We also recommend that the monitoring of routine cance r incidence and mortality statistics for the previously established cohort which was exposed to contaminated water after the pollution incide nt should con tinue. 4. Many of the points raised by the consu ltation exercise have been dealt with by amendments or further text in the body of the report. Howe ver, the responses raised a number of generic issues whic h it became clear to us had e ither not been addressed or had not been adequately e xplained in the draf t report. We disc uss these below. Individual medical records 5. Three responses expresse d disappointment that we had not asked to see the medical records of those who provided person al evidence to us and who were worried that the incident had adversel y affected their health.

We discussed the question of in dividual medical records during the investigation and again in detail after receiv ing these responses . We considered whether obtaining and reviewing the records of individuals who had been exposed to the contaminated water would provide us with any new information or would be useful within the remit of our study. Our terms of reference is \"to advise on whether the exposure to ch emicals resulting from the 1988 Lowermoor wate r pollution incident has caused, or is expected to cause, delayed or persistent harm to human health.\" It is not to discover the reason(s) why indi viduals are experi encing health complaints nor to develop a treatment protoc ol. Within the context of our terms of reference, medical records are of limited va lue. The re cord of the consultation between the doctor an d patient made in a medical re cord reports the symptoms the patient is experiencing and discusses what is wrong with the patie nt from the point of view of the doctor and patie nt. The consultation, and the record of it, is not made from the point of view of whether the patient's symptoms are caused by the contaminants released in th e Lowermoor incident . There is no prio r hypothesis which we could test in an examination of medical records, as there would be if a scientific study was carried out , such as those we have re commended in Chapter 9. 7. We wish to emphasise that we accept ed the information which individuals provided to us about th eir health at face value and, ther efore, it is not clear what further information would be gained from seeing the medica l records of these individuals. However, we al so wish to emphasi se that we recogni se, from both the oral evidence and written evidence we received, that some individuals have continuing ill health fo r which they are concerned to find a cause. Adequacy of scientific da ta reviewed by the Subgroup 8. Three respondents were critical of the extent to which we ha d reviewed the scientific literature on the contaminants whose water concentrations were increased after the incident. Another respondent comm ented that there were 22 drinking water epidemiology studies statis tically linking aluminium to either elderly cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. All four respondents who addressed this issue were asked for further details of missing re ferences which they regarded as important and two replie d with these details. So me of the references c ited by these respondents were already referenced in th e report or in the reviews prepared by the Department of Health Toxicology Unit at Imperial College (see Appe ndices 20, 21 and 22). Abstracts of any which had not been cons idered previously were reviewed and relevant papers obtained. Chapters 6 and 7 of the report were updated accordingly. 8. We do not agree that we conducted an inad equate review of the scientific literature on the contaminants . We describe in Chapter 6 the way we we nt about our review and the data which was used. 9. Another responden t provided a list of 548 hyperlinks to references on aluminium. We obtained and re viewed the abstracts of the papers and determined that some had already been reviewed and some were not relevant to the exposure of individuals from the contaminants in wa ter, for reasons whic h are described in Chapter 6. Nine references were relevant and we are grateful th at these have been brought to our attention. We have referred to these in the revise d text on the human and animal toxicity of aluminium. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 109 Adequacy of other informatio n available to the Subgroup 10. Some correspondents cons idered that we had cited inappropriate information and studies. For example, we were crit icised for including a published study of Richmond tests of educational attainment in schoolchildren (see paragraphs 5.116 to 5.122) and data on Special Educational Needs (SEN) (par agraphs 5.146 to 5.155). The data on Richm ond tests was included becaus e it was a publish ed study on children in the aff ected area and, in ou r report, we discuss all relevant published studies. We discusse d the (SEN) data because we were asked to consider these data by a local journalist. We expressed reservations about the suitability of using SEN data to assess effects on health in the draft report (paragraph 5.155). 11. Other correspondents expr essed reservations that th e report made use of water quality data from SWW plc. These were the only water qualit y data that were available for the greater part of the period of contamination. It should be noted that these data were not used ex clusively and, in our assessm ent of the implications for health of exposure to the c ontaminants (Chapter 7), we ha ve also includ ed estimated exposures based on contaminan t concentrations in the water samples taken by private individuals. 12. In our investigation, we have attempte d to use all the data which is available and we are aware of the limita tions of some of these data. We wrote to a number of individuals who responded in the consultation exercise to ob tain further information. Where we consider th at further studies would be beneficial, we have recommended them in Chapter 9 of the report. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 110Appendix 7: Drinking wate r quality - the legislative framework for public drinking water supplies The situation before 1989 1. Under the Water Act 1945, water undertakers - the Wa ter Authorities, created in 1974, and the statut ory water supply compan ies - were required to \"... provide in their mains and communication pipes a supply of wholesome water sufficient for the domestic purposes of all owners and occupi ers within the limits of supply...\" . UK law did not define a quant itative measure of what made water wholesome and there was no requirement to monitor the quality of supplies. 2. General guidance on safe levels of substances that might be permitted in drinking water suppli es, and safeguards and best pract ice to be adopt ed to ensure production and delivery of a wholesome supply of wa ter were availa ble when WHO published its 1 st edition of \"Internation al Standards for Drinking Water\" in 1958. This was updated in 1964 when the 2nd edition of \"Internationa l Standards for Drinking Water\" were publi shed and the 1st edition of \"E uropean Standards for Drinking Water\" were also published. Bo th these were upda ted in 1970 and 1971 respectively. In 1984 the two ed itions were combined and publishe d as the WHO \"G uidelines for Drinking Water Quality\". 3. The 1980 EC Directiv e on 'Water Intended for Human Consumption' (80/778/EEC) set out standard s for drinking water quality. However, this was not enshrined in national law until 1989 (see belo w). There was no re gulatory regime to oversee that water undertakers were carrying out their duties in re spect of supplying wholesome water. There was no offence of supplyi ng water unfit for human consumption. There was a formal requiremen t to notify the appr opriate department (usually the then Department of the Enviro nment) of major incidents affecting water supplies. Usually, but not always, the local Me dical Officer of Health would be informed if there was a health risk. 4. In the case of the Lowe rmoor water pollution incident , this lack of suitable water/environment legislation under which investigation and prosecution could take place resulted in the pol ice investigating the incident. A prosecut ion was initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions for P ublic Nuisance by supp lying contaminated water. South West Water Authority was fi ned \u00a31,000 and required to pay costs of \u00a325,000. The situation since 1989 5. EC Directive 80/778 on 'the Quality of Wat er Intended for Human Consumption' came into e ffect on 17 July 1980. It set out Maximum Admissible Concentrations (MACs) (often and usually based on WHO Guideline Values) for various chemical, aesthetic and microbiologi cal quality parameters which tap water was required to meet. 6. In 1989 the water indu stry was privatised under the water Act 1989 and the Water Authorities became th e ten Water and Sewerage Companies of today. The DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 111Statutory Water Companies became private water supply only co mpanies. All the water companies were appointed water under takers under section 6 of the Act. 7. The Water Act 1989, whic h was consolidated into the Wate r Industry Act 1991 (\"the Act\"), made it a legal duty for wa ter undertakers to \" ... supply on ly water which is wholesome at the tim e of supply\" (Secti on 68). The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989, made under section 69 of the Act, came fu lly into force on 1 January 1990. These Regulations for preserving the quality of wate r reflected the requirements of Dire ctive 80/778 in terms of standards to be met, and also set some nationally derived st andards. The 1989 Regu lations remained in force until the end of 2003. 8. A new EC 'Drinking Wate r Directive' came into fo rce on 25 December 1998 and its requirements are inco rporated into the new Water Supply (Wat er Quality) Regulations 2000 (the new Re gulations). These new Re gulations appl y to water companies whose area of supply is wholly or mainly in Englan d. The National Assembly for Wales adopted similar new Regulations at the end of 2001 and these apply to water companies whose area of supply is wholly or mainly in Wales. Whilst some of the requirements of these new Regulations came into force as early as 2001, the majority came into force at the end of December 2003. The new Regulations set some new standards, tightened some existing standards, relaxed some standards, and dispensed with others. Ther e are also changes in the mo nitoring requ irements of supplies. 9. During 2006/7 revisions of the 2000 Regulations we re proposed an d consulted upon. It is likely th at the 2000 Re gulations will be amended at the end of 2007 to take into account changes in EU legislation contained in the Surface Water Abstraction Directive and Water Framewor k Directive. The opportunity has also b een taken to incorporate the use of Drinki ng Water Safety Plans, re commended by WHO, as the most effective means of consis tently ensuring the safety of a drinking water supply through the use of a compre hensive risk assessment and risk management approach that encompasses all steps in water s upply from catchment to consumer. 10. The standards provide a numerical definition of wholesomeness. Water supplied which contravenes one or more of th e standards listed in the Regulations is, by definition, unwholesome. The old and new Re gulations (and th e proposed 2007 amendment) set out requirements on: monitoring drinki ng water quality water treatment the provision of information the use of water treatment chemicals drinking water system c onstruction products. 11. Figure 1 shows th e number of tests carried out between 1992 an d 2003 in the South West and Nationally wh ich met the required standa rds. From 2004 onwards, when the new Regulations and revised standards came fully into force, the method of reporting on compliance al so changed. It is not possible therefore to compare data from 2004 - 2006 with those from previous years. It was rec ognised that simply reporting on the number of te sts meeting the standards, wh ich indicated that overall DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 112compliance was high, could mask localised pr oblems experienced by consumers. The Chief Drinking Water Inspector's Annual Re ports on drinking wate r quality for these years have therefore been issued on a regional basis and more detailed reporting provided on perf ormance by water comp anies. These reports can be found at www.dwi.gov.uk . For information on water quality in the South West Water area, the Western Regional Reports s hould be cons ulted. 12. Section 18 of the 1991 Act requires enforcement action to be taken for any breach of wholesomeness standards, monitoring and treatment, and/or records and information requirements of the Regulations. However, enforcement action is not taken forward if the breach is deemed to be trivial or unlikely to recur or if the water company has ta ken immediate remedial acti on to preven t a recurrence or if the water company has submitted a le gally-binding programme of work to achieve compliance within an acceptable timescale.

Section 70 of th e 1991 Act made it a criminal of fence to supply water which is unfit for human consumption. It also provides a defence for the company if it can show that it had no reasonable grounds for su specting that the water would be used for human consumption; or took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence for securing that the water was fit for human co nsumption on leaving it s pipes, or was not used for human consumption. It is for the c ourts to decide whethe r water is unfit but, in general, water that causes illness on consumption, or where its appearance, taste or smell is such that people canno t reasonably be expected to drink it, is likely to be deemed unfit. It is important to und erstand, however, that whilst water which is unfit is likely to be unw holesome, unwholesome water is no t necessarily water unfit for human consumption. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 113Deterioration of water be yond the point of supply 14. Water companies ar e not responsible for any deterioration in the quality of the water within a consumer's premises, except in the case of concentrat ions of copper or lead (the 1989 regulati ons also included zinc but there is now no longer a st andard for this parameter under the new regulations). If the standards for these metals are likely to be exceeded in the water supplied to the cold tap in the kitchen, then the water company must consider further treatment of the water to reduce the risk of the water becoming unwholesome. This measure is intended prim arily to reduce exposure of consumers to lead. The role of the Drinki ng Water Inspectorate 15. Under the 1991 (a nd 1989) Act, respon sibility for regula ting the quality of public drinking water s upplies lay with the Se cretary of State for the then Department of the Environment. Technical Assessors we re appointed under se ction 86 of the Act to act on their behalf in thes e matters. Following devolution, this duty also applied to the National Assembly for Wales. 16. The Water Act 2003 amends section 86 of the Act to reflect that such assessors are more generally known as the Drinki ng Water Inspectorate and to enable the Chief Inspector of Drinking Water to init iate prosecutions in relation to drinking water quality in hi s/her own name. 17. Water companies are responsible for m onitoring the quality of their supplies. This 'self-monitoring' role is subject to checks by local authorities and the Drinking Water Inspectorate. One of the main tasks of the Inspecto rate is a rolling programme of continuous technical audit to ensure that water companies are meeting all their regulatory obligations. Water companies must make all results of regulatory sampling available to the general publi c via their public record. Drinking Water Quality Incidents 18. The Water Industry (S uppliers' Information) Direction 2009 (and earlier versions) require water companies to notify the Secretary of St ate or the National Assembly for Wales (in practi ce, the Inspectorate) of any event, which by reason of its effect on the qualit y or sufficiency of dri nking water, may give rise to a significant risk to consumers' health. The Regulations requir e that similar notifications are made to health authorities (normally the rele vant Consultant in Communicable Disease Control in the Health Protectio n Agency and Director of Public Health in the relevant Primary Care Trust) and local authoritie s (normally the relevant Environmental Health Officer). The Inspectorate investigates all su ch notifications and, in some cases, the investigation could result in the water company being prosecuted for supplying water unfi t for human consumption. Th e results and recommendations arising from the Inspectorate's investigations are made public.

October 1988 : The water supply to properties in Hatfield, Hertfordshire was contaminated with alumin ium sulphate (Cross, 1990) March - April 1989 : Penwhirn water supply distri ct of Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council: because of a change in raw water qua lity and subsequent plant failure, water entering the supply contained 'flocculated material ' including raised concentrations of aluminium. The maximu m concentration of al uminium entering the supply was 3.5 mg/l (Water Research Centre, 1989). June 1989 : The water supply to residents around Newry, Ulster was contaminated with concentrated aluminium sulphate solu tion (amount unclear, may be up to 30 tonnes) (Cross, 1990). November 1989 : Amlaird, Kilmarno ck: a breakdown in trea tment led to raised aluminium concentrations in the water supply fo r at least 4 mont hs (Cross, 1990). March 2011 : Control of the treatment process at Burncrooks water treatment works, Glasgow, was lost for appr oximately four hours. Conc entrations of aluminium exceeded the regulatory standard for a pe riod of 24 hours, with co ncentrations exceeding 4 mg/l for approxima tely 6 hours (Dri nking Water Qualit y Regulator for Scotland, 2011).

Th is report is a further update, describing relevant publications from the period Jan 2002-October 2003 (by publication date). The data included have been restricted to to xic and/or other biological effects of Al in humans and in animal models . In vitro/mechanistic studies have not been described, but a bibliography of th ese recent publications is provided in Appendix 1. 2 Aluminium toxicity publications 2002-2003 2.1 General literature The US Food and Drug Ad ministration (FDA) publish ed a final monograph on antiperspirant drug produ cts for over-the-counter hu man use (Food and Drug Administration, 2003). Section II. F. of this ruling detail s comments on th e safety of aluminium ingredients, including critical di scussion of some publications regarding the potential toxicity of aluminium by va rious routes of inta ke, in particular, neurotoxicity and the possi ble involvement of alumin ium in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and amyotr ophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The FDA concluded that the literature showed that high doses and long-term industrial exposures to alum inium can be associ ated with recogn isable specific neurological effects, but that the evidence to date was insu fficient to link aluminium to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or ALS. It was note d that people with renal dysfunction should be aler ted to consult a doctor befo re using or continuing to use Al-containing antiperspira nt products. It was also recommende d that a general warning be included to keep antip erspirant drug products aw ay from infants, who may be at higher risk from Al exposure due to im mature renal function. In support of this, the agency stated that it \"... acknowledges that small am ounts of aluminum can be absorbed from the GI tract and through th e skin. Assuming a person has normal renal function, accumulation of aluminum resulting from usual exposures to antiperspirant drug products (application to the underarms once or twice dail y) and subsequent absorption is consider ed minimal. However, people wi th renal dysfun ction have an impairment in normal renal excretion of al uminum... The agency considers it prudent to alert these people to consult a doctor before using or continuing to use these products on a regular basis and is including a warning in the final m onograph: 'Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney 2.2 Human data DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 1272.2.1 Acute/sub-acute (Owen et al., 2002) carried out a retr ospective study to evaluate mortal ity rates (from July 1988 to December 1997) in the population of a region of Corn wall supplied by water from the Lowermoor tr eatment works at the time of the 1988 aluminium sulphate contamination incide nt. The ratio of standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for subjects living in an area supplied by th e Lowermoor works ( n = 11 114), as compared with thos e in an adjacent area with a differe nt water supply ( n = 5359) was 1.08 SMR for the Lowerm oor-supplied regi on was lower than that for the county of Cornwall as a whole (81.6; 95% CI, 77.2-86.2) and lower than that for the England and Wales stan dard population (77.7; 95% CI, 73.5-82.0). 2.2.2 Chronic exposure Renal failure patients Encephalopathy due to aluminium overload in renal failure pa tients is a well- documented syndrome (see LSG/ 02/7) and further publicatio ns will generally not be described here. One recent cas e report describe d autopsy findings in a 59-year-old female encephalopathy patient , who had chronic renal failu re and took 3.0 g hydroxy- aluminium gel per day du ring a 15-year period. Aluminium deposition and neuropathological cha nges in the brain were noted, but there were no signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), s upporting the hypothesis that aluminium al one is not causal for AD (Shirabe et al., 2002). Occupational exposure (Polizzi et al., 2002) reported that foundry workers who had previously ( 10 years before) been exposed to aluminium dust (low -level occupational exposure for several years) had signific antly higher serum al uminium concentrati ons and blood iron concentrations th an a control group wi thout occupational e xposure. A positive relationship was observed between serum al uminium concentration and some tests of cognitive function. 2.3 Animal data Studies described have been restricted to those in which aluminium administration was by the oral route. 2.3.1 Biodistribution (Ogasawara et al., 2002) reported th at oral administration of 270 mg/l aluminium (as hydroxide or ch loride, in tap water) and citric acid (molar ratio aluminium : citric acid = 1:2) for 7 weeks did not increase brain aluminium levels in rats. 2.3.2 Acute exposure (Micic et al., 2003) reported that oral application of a single, high dose of aluminium chloride (3.7 g/kg bw AlCl 3.6H pattern of increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activ ity in the brai ns of Mongolian gerbils during the subseque nt 4 days (up to 200% 171% increase as compared DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 128with control animals at 24 hours and 96 hours , respectively, after treatment; no significant difference between treate d and control anim als at 48 hours). Twenty of the 52 treated animals died within 24 hours of alum inium treatment, th e other 32 animals survived until the end of the experiment, but show ed signs of sickne ss such as slow gait, splaying of extremitie s and loss of appetite. 2.3.3 Reproductive/developmental effects A reproductive toxicity study in which hi gh dose (probably 1000 mg/kg diet, ~ 150 mg/kg bw/day, although this is unclear 36) was fed to female Swiss Webster mice from conception to weaning showed reduced wean ing weight associat ed with aluminium treatment. Pregnancy weight gain was not affected. Ma ternal food intake was not reported (Golub et al., 2003). 2.3.4 Sub-chronic/chronic exposure Neurobehavioural effects Treatment for 6 months with 0.1% aluminium, as sulphate in drinking water (~ 200 mg/kg bw/day aluminium) did not affect test s of spatial working me mory in rats (von Linstow et al., 2002). Treatment of young and old male rats for 100 days with 100 mg/kg bw/day Al 37 (as nitrate nonahydrate, in drinki ng water, + citric acid) di d not affect performance in behavioural tests. The total number of synapses in the le ft CA1 fields of hippocampal formation decreased with bo th age (~ 22 % lower in control ag ed vv. control young rats) and aluminium exposure (~ 32% lower in aluminiu m -loaded youn g vv. aluminium-loaded aged vv. cont rol aged rats) (Colomina et al., 2002). Gavage treatment of rats with 50 or 200 mg/kg bw/day aluminium ch loride (~ 10 or 40 mg/kg bw/day aluminium, described by the authors as one tw entieth and one fifth of the oral LD 50, respectively) for 8 weeks (5 days/week) had no significant effect on central electrophysiological or behavioural parameters eval uated. Brain aluminium levels were increased by ~ 34% and 153% in the low and high-dose aluminium groups, respectively, as compared with a contro l group (Baydar et al., 2003). Neuropathology Chronic (24 month) exposure of mice to a diet containi ng very high levels of aluminium (15600 mg/kg di et aluminium hydroxide, ~ 810 mg/kg bw/day aluminium), with or withou t low levels of Ca and Mg , resulted in a significant increase in tau-positive neurons in the brains of these animals (Kihira et al., 2002). (El Rahman, 2003) reported that gavage treatm ent of rats with al uminium (43, 86 or 172 mg/kg bw/day, as sulphate) for 35 days was asso ciated with pat hological changes in brain tissue. These chan ges included congestion of cerebral blood vessels (all 36 The dose given is unclear - described variously throughout the report as 1000 g/g, 1000 mg/g and 1000 g/kg diet. 37 It is not entirely clear from the report whether the dose was 100 mg/kg bw/day Al (highest dose); cortex (all gr oups, dose-dependent), subcortical region, base of the brain and hippo campus (2 higher dose s). Dose-depende nt increases in brain glutamate and glutamine, decreases in GABA, and incr eases in brain aluminium levels were observed. Neurophysiology (Chen et al., 2002) reported that neonatal exposure of rats to aluminium from birth to weaning (day 21) aff ected electrophysiological indicator s of pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms of (central) synaptic transmi ssion which were eval uated at 90-120 days. (Exposure was via breast milk, dams were given water contain 0.3% aluminium chloride [~ (ACh E) activity was in creased (around 1. 5-fold) in mice given 10 mg/day alumin ium (~ 500 mg/kg bw/day , chloride or lactate) for 1-3 months (Zatta et al., 2002). (Dave et al., 2002) reported th at dietary supplementation with aluminiu m (100 mg/kg 100-115 days was associated with inhi bition of rat brain AChE activity ( V max of soluble fraction component I of soluble form decreased by 34%; Vmax of components I and II of membrane-bound form by 20% and 19%, respec tively), whilst butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities in heart an d liver were increased ( Vmax soluble fraction components I and II heart increased 2.3-fold; Vmax components I and II membrane bound heart increased 74% and 160 %, respectively; Vmax components I and II soluble form liver increased by 58% and 83%, respectively; Vmax components I and 168%, resp oral ministration of aluminiu m to rats as aluminium chloride (320 mg/kg bw, ~ 36 mg/kg bw/day Al, by gavage) for peri ods of 4 to 60 days had varying effects on brain 5-HT le vels depending on th e brain region and duration of exposure. The au thors suggested that these ch anges may be related to the cholinergic toxicity of aluminium. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) Rats were exposed to 0, 5 and 10 mM aluminium chloride (in drinking water) beginning 3 weeks af ter birth and continuing thr ough mating and gestation, and suckling (pups exposed for 3 weeks gestation, 3 week s suckling). Pu ps were then analysed for nNOS-immunoreac tive neurons in regions of the cortex; levels were increased (10%) in the 5mM group and de creased (17%) in th e 10 mM group. The authors suggested that impair ed expression of nNOS indu ced by aluminium treatment may be neurotoxic becaus e it disturbs the link between glutamatergic urons (Kim, 2003).

Blood -ALAD were decreased by ~ 25% and Z PP increased by ~ 40%. Aluminium levels were significantly increased by the treatment (~ 5-fold increase in blood; ~ 2- fold increase in brain) (Flora et al., 2003). (Pratico et al., 2002) reported that feeding an aluminium-en riched diet (2 mg/kg diet, ~ 0.3 mg/kg bw/day aluminium) for 9 mont hs to transgenic mice which over-express human amyloid precursor protein led to an in crease in markers of oxidative stress and increased amyloid peptide formation and deposition in the brain. These effects were ameliorated by co-inclusi on of vitamin E in the diet. 2.4 In vitro/mechanistic studies Several recent papers have described studie s of the effects of aluminium in vitro. Many of these studies have used neural cell cultures to investigate the possible effects/mechanisms of aluminium involvem ent in neurodegenerative syndromes such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease an d ALS. These studies are not described here. 3 Summary Very few new studies have been published re garding potential ad verse effects of aluminium in healthy (i.e. non-renal fail ure) human subjects . One study (Owen et al., 2002) compared mort ality rates in subjects likely to have been exposed to aluminium sulphate-contaminated water following the 1988 Lo wermoor incident with those in a neighbouring area (not Lowermoor-supplied). The ra te for the \"supp lied\" population was slightly higher (1 .08), but the difference was not significant, and rates in both areas were lower than nation al rates and those for the c ounty of Cornwall. (This paper has previously been di scussed by the LSG). Several recently-publishe d studies have evaluated effects of oral aluminium dosing in animal models. The majority of these stud ies have focussed on neurological effects. Studies in rats showed no effects of chronic alumin ium supplementation (10-200 mg/kg bw/day 38 for several weeks or months) on behavioural measures. Some adverse effects (neuropathol ogical and neurophysiological ) were observed in cases where chronic treatment with very high levels of aluminium was given. Gavage treatment of rats with high levels of aluminium sulphate (4 3-172 mg/kg bw/day aluminium) for 5 weeks was also asso ciated with neur opathological and 38 For comparison, the maximum theoretical Al concentration in the water supply following the Lowermoor incident was esti mated as 21 mg/kg bw /day for a 60 kg adult (based on daily intake of 2l wa ter containing 620 mg /l Al [the maximum estimated concentration in the co ld water supply - see LSG/03/07] . The time period of exposure is uncl ear, but perhaps in the region of seve ral hours or days.

Gavage treatment of rats with aluminium chloride 3.6H 2O, ~ 36 mg/kg bw/day aluminium) for periods of 4 to 60 days was associated with increased, decreased or unaltered brain 5-HT levels , depending on the sp ecific region of the brain and the duration of treatment (Kumar, 2002).

A report prepared for the Department of Health Committee on Toxicity, Lowermoor Subgroup by the Depa rtment of Health Toxicology Unit at Imperial College London. 1. Aluminium toxicity was reviewed in deta il in an update of the 1997 WHO (IPCS) Environmental Health Cr iteria 194 report on aluminium, prepared for the COT Lowermoor Subgroup in Spring 2002 an d updated in 2003 . This followi ng report is an update of studies from 2003 to date, relating to biologi cal and toxic effects of aluminium in humans and in animal models . The report is di vided into two main sections: A] neurotoxicity and effects on th e brain, and B] other toxic and biological effects. Reports of experime ntal studies in animals were only included if aluminium treatment was given by the oral route. A. Neurotoxicity and effects on the brain Human data Epidemiological studies of cognitive impairm ent, dementia and Alzheimer's disease 2. An association was observed betwee n serum aluminium concentrations and Alzheimer's disease in a gr oup of 35 elderly patients evaluated for potential correlations between serum tr ace element concentrations and presence of cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Patients were divided into 4 groups: control [n = 11], cognitive ts that trace element serum concentrations were in a normality rang e in all subjects. Serum aluminium concentrations (mean \u00b1 SD, in mg/ml) co rrelation was also noted between MODA scores ('Mil an Overall Dementia Asse ssment' - a test for the presence of dementia) and serum aluminium co ncentration in this group of 35 subjects (ie, higher aluminium correla ted with lower cognitive fu nction; r = -0 .628, p<0.0001). MODA scores were also nega tively correlated and positively correl ated with selenium, co balt, chromium and iron levels (Smorgon et al., 2004). 3. (Gillette-Guyonnet et al., 2005) reported an eval uation of potential associations between drinking water co mposition (aluminium, silica and calcium content) and cognitive impairment in a group of 7598 women aged 75 in Fr ance (the EPIDOS study cohort). Daily intakes of aluminium, sili ca and calcium supplied by drinking water were 0.0231 \u00b1 0.025, 10.17 \u00b1 10.01 and 134 \u00b1 154 .1 mg, respectively (mean \u00b1 SD). Cognitive perf ormance was positi vely correlated with daily silica intake, but not with aluminiu m or calcium intakes. The authors concluded that the study did not show any evidence for alumin ium as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Inhalation 39 There is a question regarding the units cited by the authors here, as most reports cite standard serum Al concentrations in a range around ~ 10 g/l. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 1354. (Buchta et al., 2003) described evaluations made in 1999 and 2001 as part of a longitudinal study of 98 we lders with occupational expo sure to alum inium welding fumes, as compared to a c ontrol group of 50 car-production workers at the same plant in Germany. Median plasma aluminium concentrations we re approximately 10 (range ~ 2-40) g/l in 1999 and 4 (range ~ 1-11) g/l in 2001, whilst median urinary aluminium concentrations were around 40-70 (range ~ 30-40 (range ~ 5-230) g /g creatinine] (data for control subjects were not re ported). Th ere were no significant differences between test and c ontrol subjects in ps ychomotor performance and other neurobehavioural task s, except that test subjects showed slow er reaction times. The difference in reac tions times between the group s did not change during the period of evaluation, and th e authors suggested that it may be du e to pre-exposure differences between the groups. Further evaluations were sc heduled to be carried out in 2003. 5. A study in China showed differences in neurobehavioural parameters between a group of 32 men with occupational (14.91 \u00b1 6.31 years, mean \u00b1 SD) aluminium exposure, as compared with a control group (workers at a flour plant). The aluminium workers had significantly hi gher scores for confusion and tension/anxiety, lower scores for standard reaction times, and lower scores for DS Y (described as \"digital symbol\") and PA (pursuit aiming) tests. Other parameters tested were not significantly different between the two groups 40. Mean urinary aluminium concentrations were 40.08 \u00b1 9.36 and 26.84 \u00b1 8.93 g/mg creatine, in test and control groups, respectively (He et al., 2003). Renal failure patients 6. Calcium intoxication was suspected in a group of 27 end-stage renal disease patients in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, who presented with symptoms including nausea, vomiting and hyperca lcaemia. Despite subseque ntly changing to a low- calcium dialysate, a number of the patients developed microcytic anaemia and neurological symptoms. Ten pa tients died of convulsions, se psis and coma. Analysis showed mean ante mortem serum alumin ium concentrations of 808 (359-1275) g/l and 255 (113-490) g/l in deceased patients and survivors, respectively (normal aluminium concentration < 10 g/l, or < 50 g/l in non-symptomatic dialysis patients). Investigations reve aled high calcium and aluminium levels in the dialysis water supply due to leaching from a replacement suppl y pipe (de Wolff et al., 2002). 7. A patient with chronic renal failure, but not on dialys is, developed fatal aluminium-related encephalopat hy due to self-dos ing with large doses of antacids (total cited as at l east 3 kg) for approxim ately 3 years (Zatta et al., 2004). Reviews 8. (Gupta et al., 2005) published a review of the literatu re regarding potential associations of aluminium and Alzheime r's disease (AD). They concluded that aluminium is undoubtedly neurot oxic, that th e involvement of alum inium as a factor 40 The scoring systems are not explained in the report and it is not clear to the non-specialist what increases or decreases in scores indicate, except that , in the discussion, the aut hors state that Al workers performed better in neurobehavioural tests than controls, with quicker reaction times. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 136in AD cannot be discar ded. However, whethe r aluminium is a sole factor in AD and whether it is a factor in all AD cases still needs to be understood. Animal studies Rats 9. (Jing et al., 2004) reported that treatment of adult male rats for 3 months with 500 mg/kg bw/day alum inium (in water solu tion, by perfusion through the stomach) led to increased brain alumin ium content, changes in syna ptic ultrastructure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex , and adverse effects on m easures of memory function. 10. Wistar rats treat ed intragastrically with 500 mg /kg bw/day aluminium chloride (~ 100 mg/kg bw/day alumin ium) for one month, follow ed by continuou s exposure via drinking water c ontaining 1600 ppm al uminium chloride fo r up to 5 months, showed impaired ability in tests of lear ning and memory func tion (Morris water maze). Subsequent treatm ent for 2 months with Ginkgo biloba extract was reported to ameliorate these effects (Gong et al., 2005). 11. Zhang et al. (2003) reported that th ey carried out a study to asse ss the potential of a herbal medicine ( Dipsacus asper ) to protect against cognitive impairment and overexpression of hippocampal -amyloid protein induced by chronic aluminium exposure in rats (s alt not specified). In this study groups of male, Sprague-Dawley rats (total aluminium -treated n = 84) were treated for 90 days with drinking water containing 0.3% alumin ium chloride. Treated animals showed decreased performance in the one measure of cogn itive function evaluated (p assive avoidance task/step through latency), as compar ed with a gr oup of 15 control an imals treated with distilled water (mean latency of aluminium-exposed rats re ported as only 19% that for control group). Treated animals also showed increased staining for -amyloid protein in the brain (123 % more positive A cells in aluminium-tr eated compared with control rats). Subsequent treatment with Dipsacus asper was reported to ameliorate some of these effects (Zhang et al., 2003). 12. Brain myelin phos pholipid profiles were altered in male, al bino rats treated with 100 mg/kg bw/day alumin ium chloride (estimated to be ~ 20.3 mg/kg bw/day aluminium) in the diet, for 90 to 100 days. The authors noted th at many of the changes observed were similar to those seen in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (Pandya et al., 2004). 13. Dietary supplementation for 4 months with 0.03 g/day aluminium chloride (estimated to be ~ 75 mg/kg bw/day al uminium chloride or ~ 15 mg/kg bw/day aluminium) was reported to alter the kinetic behaviour of brain Na +/K+ ATPase in adult, male rats (Silva and Goncalves, 2003). 14. (Fattoretti et al., 2003) measured copp er, zinc and manganese concentrations in three + pons- medulla, PMD) Wi rats treated with dri nking water containing 2 g/l aluminium chloride (AlCl 3.6H to be ~ 11 mg/kg bw/day aluminium ) for 6 months. Aluminium content increased in all three region s. The only other significant changes observed were incr eased PMD copper content and cerebellum zinc content. Hist ological examination showed an animals were repor ted to show aggressive behaviour. A subsequent report by the same authors, apparently describing the same experiments and data, determined that all th e changes (increases) measured in copper, zinc and manganese levels in PME and PM D regions were signi ficant, wh ilst no significant changes occurred in the cerebellum (Fattoretti et al., 2004). 15. Treatment of male albino rats for 90 days with 2% aluminium chloride in drinking water (described by the authors as equivalent to 50 mg/kg bw/day aluminium chloride, or ~ 10 mg/kg bw/day alumin ium) was reported to enhance lead deposition when co-treatment with 2.5% lead acetate was given. Some effects of leas and/or aluminium treatment were also noted on brain AChE and lipid peroxidation levels and on motor neurological functions (Shakoor et al., 2003). 16. (Kaur and Gill, 2005) repo rted that in tragastric application of 10 mg/kg bw/day aluminium (as lactat e) to male, albino rats for 12 weeks altered brain intrasynaptosomal calcium homeostasis. 17. Treatment of male and female HS d:W1 rats with 91.8 mg/kg bw/day days ciated with decreased brai n synaptosomal ATPase and AChE activities. The differe nce was detected two weeks, but not immediately, after discontinuation of treatment (Kohila et al., 2004). 18. Indicators of lipid pe roxidation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were increased, whilst AChE activity was decreased, in th e brains of male Sprague- Dawley rats treated orally with 34 mg/kg bw aluminium chloride , on alternate days, for a period of 30 da ys (El Demerdash, 2004). Mice 19. Aluminium accumulated in the brains and other organs of male ddy mice given drinking water supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml (~ 16.7 mg/kg bw/day) aluminium, as chloride (ionic) or malt olate (complex), for up to 120 days. In aluminium maltolate-treated rats, brain aluminium accumula tion peaked at 60 days, then fell, which the authors in terpreted as suggesting that aluminium accumulation in the brain is a reversible pr ocess. Brain tissue from al uminium maltolate-treated, but not aluminium chloride -treated animals showed indicat ors of oxidative stress (TBARS and NOx levels), and clusters of neurofil ament cells upon imm unostaining (Kaneko et al., 2004). 20. Increased levels of so me indicators of inflamma tion were observed in the brains of male B/6C3F1 mice treated with dr inking water containi ng 0.01, 0.01 or 1 mM aluminium, as lactate (0.26, 2.6, 26 mg/l aluminium; ~ 0.043, 0.43, 4.3 mg/kg bw/day aluminium) for 10 wks, bu t there was no clear pattern of dose-response and no increase in brain aluminium levels (Campbell et al., 2004). Rabbits 41 It is not entirely clear whether the dose was 91.8 mg/kg Groups of 6 male New Z ealand white rabbits were tr eated every ot her day, by gavage, with 40 mg/kg bw L-ascorbic acid (AA) and/or 34 by the au thors as 1/25 LD 50), for 16 weeks. Al uminium treatment was associated with indica tors of increased oxidative damage in plasma, liver, brain, testes and kidney, decreases in liver and testes AST, ALT, ALP and AcP enzyme activities, whilst plasma, liver, testes and brain LDH activities were increased . The activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were decr eased in brain an d plasma. Some haematological paramete rs were also affected. Co-adm inistration of ascorbic acid provided some protectio n against these eff ects (Yousef, 2004). B. Other biological and toxic effects Human data Inhalation and effects on the respiratory system 22. (Fishwick et al., 2004) reported that workplace e xposure to aluminium fume was associated with reduced respiratory function (FEV 1) (at least 5% reduction after 15 min exposure) in we lders in New Zealand. 23. Studies have described ev aluations of asthmatic manifestations in workers at aluminium smelting plants (\"potroom asthma\"). It is not currently clear what is the specific cause of these effects (workers ar e exposed to a mixture of particulates and gases including aluminium ox ide), although the ma jor candidate is suggested to be fluoride compounds (Barnard et al., 2004; Sjaheim et al., 2004). Dermal absorption and effects 24. A 43 year old woman who presented with bone pa in and fatigue showed normal values for biochemi cal/haematological analyses, but an elevated plasma aluminium concentration of ~ 3.9 M (~ 10.4 g/dl, or ~ 100 g/l) (normal values ~ 10 g/l or less). Neur opsychologic and electroencepha lographic tests were normal. The patient had no hi story of aluminium an tacid use or occupa tional exposure to aluminium, and raised levels were attribut ed to use for the preceding 4 years of ~ 1 g/day aluminium-containing antiperspirant cream. Bone pain symptoms disappeared within a few months of discontinuation of antiperspirant use (Guillard et al., 2004). 25. (Akyol et al., 2004) described the case of a 9 ye ar old boy wh o exhibited contact sensitivity to aluminium. This was apparent as an accidental finding when positive reactions at all test sites were observed in allergen patch-test evaluations (presumably due to the use of aluminium test chambers). The authors attributed this aluminium sensitivity to prior exposure to aluminium-absorbed vaccines (although they noted that th e patient had re ceived his childhood vacc inations without any adverse effects). 26. Some reports have desc ribed the developmen t of persistent itching nodules at the site of injection of aluminium-cont aining vaccines in children (Bergfors et al., 42 It is not entirely clear from the report whether the dose was 34 mg/kg bw Frederiksen and Tofte, 2004). Others 27. (Cimma et al., 2004) reported th at consuming foods cooke d in Al pots was not associated with adverse eff ects on parameters of calciu m metabolism or increased serum aluminium con centrations in y oung Bangladeshi child ren with calcium- deficient rickets ( note: data taken from the abstract: the full text of this paper was not available during the pr eparation of this report) . Animal studies Developmental/repr oductive effects 28. (Wiles et al., 2003) evaluated the bi oavailability an d toxicological effects of montmorillonite clays (which are frequently added to animal feeds, and of which aluminium is a major compon ent) by supplementi ng clay minerals to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats throughout pregnancy at a le vel of 2% (w/w). Aluminium was not detected above ba ckground levels in an y tissues evaluated an d no effects were seen on fetal or maternal toxicity ( note: these data taken from the abstract: the full text of this paper was not available during the preparation of this report) . Haematological effects 29. Groups of adult female Wi star rats were exposed for 18 months to tap water, 35 mM sodium citrate soluti on, or a solution of 35 mM sodium citrate + 30 mM aluminium sulphate (~ 810 mg/l aluminium, or ~ 46 mg/kg bw /day aluminium). Aluminium treatment was associated with significant decreases in red blood cell count, haematocrit, serum ir on concentration, and an increase in bone marrow - ALA-D activity (Farina et al., 2005) Absorption/bioavailability 30. (Arnich et al., 2004) reported a compar ative study of the intestinal absorption of aluminium, manganese, nickel and lead in rats using the in situ intestinal perfusion technique. Perfused metal so lutions at concentrations lik ely to occur during oral intoxication were used. The authors report ed that aluminium (48 and 64 mM), even as citrate complex, crossed the brush bord er with difficulty ( 0.4% of the perfused amount). Of this, ~ 60 % wa s retained in the intestine and the re mainder was found in target tissues ( note: data taken from the abstract, the full text of th is paper was not available during the preparation of this report) . 31. (Yumoto et al., 2003) used aluminium 26 chloride as a tracer to measure aluminium26 incorporation into the brain of suckling rats by accelerator mass spectrometry. Lactating ra ts were subcutaneously injected with aluminium26 chloride from day 1 to day 20 postpartum. Su ckling rats were weaned from day 21 postpartum. From day 5 to day 20 postpartum, the amounts of aluminium26 measured in the cerebrum, cerebe llum, spinal cord , liver, and kidneys of suckling rats increased significantly. After weaning, the amounts of aluminium26 in the liver and kidneys decreased remarkably. A lternatively, in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord, as DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 140much as 12 to 20 % of the aluminium26 amounts present on day 20 postpartum remained in the tissues on day 730 postpartum. The authors concluded that considerable amount s of the aluminium26 taken up into the brain of suckling rats through maternal milk remain in their brain throughout their lifetime ( note: these data taken from the abstract: the full text of this paper was not available during the preparation of this report) .

Adult study The purpose of this study would be to assess whether exposure to th e contaminated water in the 1988 cont amination incident is associated with an incr eased risk of abnormal neuropsycho logical status. This study would examine two groups of individuals: i. Randomly selected adults of 42 years or over 44 who were living in 1988 in an area supplied with contam inated water and who drank the water. ii. A reference group of matc hed individuals wh o were living in 1988 in an area not supplied with contaminated water and who did not drink the contaminated water. The subjects would under go an appropriate assessment of pre-morbid IQ and a battery of neuropsychological tests to assess neuropsy chological status. Th ese should address factors such as attention, me mory, learning and informatio n processing speed, and the potential moderating influences of depression and anxiety. 2. Developmental study The purpose of this study would be to assess whether exposure to th e contaminated water in the 1988 cont amination incident has affected the cognitive development of children who were unde r 1 year of age at the time of the incide nt and children who were in utero at the time of the incident. This study would exam ine the following groups of individuals: i. Randomly selected i ndividuals who were in utero during the pe riod 7 to 10 July 1988, inclusive, and wh ose mothers were living in an area supp lied with contaminated water and drank the water. ii. A reference group of matched individu als whose mothers we re living during the period 7 to 10 July 1988 in an area not supplied w ith contaminated water and who did not drink the contaminated water. iii. Randomly selected individuals who were children under one year of age at the time of the contamination incident, were living in an area supplied with contaminated water and who drank the water. iv. A reference group of matched individu als who were livin g in an area not supplied with contaminat ed water and who did not drink the water. Sufficient individu als should be recruite d to inclusion of subj ects potentially exposed to the contaminat ed water during the first, second , and third trimesters and throughout to first postnatal year. 44 This is to ensure that the individuals were adults (> 18 years) at the time of exposure. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 209 The subjects would be tested 1) with a broad neurops ychological test battery which addresses factors such as attention, memo ry, learning and information processing speed, and the potential moderating influences of depression and a nxiety; 2) with an appropriate estimate of pre- morbid IQ, and 3) with questionnaires which assess implications in daily life, such as a quality of life qu estionnaire. In both the adult study and the developmen tal study, applicants should provide the following: i. Evidence that they are experienced in the administration and interpretation of the neuropsychologic al tests describe d in the tender. ii. Details of how the tests will be analysed and interpreted. iii. Justification of th e group sizes to be used with power ca lculations. iv. A consideration of whether it is poss ible to incorporate a dose-response assessment into th e study design. v. Information on how results will be fed back to indi vidual subjects. vi. Full costings. Neuropathological studies 1. Long-term study This study would use an enhanced protoc ol from the Medica l Research Council (MRC) study on Cogn itive Function and Aging (CFAS) and would recruit a random sample from GP practices in Cornwa ll, including the area which received contaminated water following the 1988 incident. Particip ants would be invited to donate their brains wh en they die. If the study was to determine and compare the emergi ng incidence of dementia in different regions of Cornwall , a large sample size would be needed to account for attrition. Follow-up would be required every 2 years. To assess whether any higher incidence in the contaminated area was due to aluminium exposu re, the study would need to include a deta iled lifestyle ques tionnaire with relevant questions to determine total exposure to aluminiu m and, if possible , an assessment of body burden of aluminium. Donated brains would under go neuropathological examination and aluminium estimation on frozen brain samp les. In order to diagnose CAA, th e whole brain would be required. This study was considered to be most likely to produce va luable results. It could produce incidence rates within 4 years to comp are with the rest of the country but any work relying on accrue d brain donation could take up to 20 years. The questions which co uld be answered by such a study are: Does the incidence of different types of dementias in individuals living in the area which received co ntaminated water differ from those in other parts of Cornwall and England and Wales? DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 210 Is any higher individuals in the contamin ated area asso ciated with either a higher past or cu rrent intake of aluminiu m, or with a higher body burden of aluminium? 2. Shorter term study This would only be ap propriate for individuals developi ng dementia befo re the age of 65 as health serv ice records are poor for as sessing the prevalence of dementia cases in older patients. The study would use existing data from clinics, GP prac tices and other sources to draw up a register of early-onset dementia cases. Where possible, cases with CAA should also be include d, although these may not presen t as dementia but with other symptoms. Those whose next-of-kin have symptoms would be invited to donate the brains of the individuals on the register at the time of death for full neuropathological examination and aluminium estimatio n on frozen brain samples. The register could th en be used to comp are early-onset demen tia prevalence in the area receiving the contaminated water with that in other parts of Cornwall and, if sufficient brains samples were donated, to compar e the incidence of neuropathological diagnoses in different areas and the aluminium concentrati ons in individua ls with the same neuropathology from different areas. This study would indicate whether the prevalence of early-onset dementia in individuals living in the area which receive d contaminated water differed from those in other parts of Cornwall. DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 211Appendix 31: Current procedur es for the management of chemical incidents 1. At the time of the Lowermoor incident, th ere were essentially no structures in place to deal with chem ical incidents such as pollution of the wate r supply. Following the incident, a number of new procedures and organisations were established by the Department of Health to improve th e arrangements within the NHS for the investigation and public health management of chemical incident s. Together with other major chemical incidents, such as the Bhopa l disaster of 1985 and the deliberate release of the organo -phosphate nerve agent sarin on the Tokyo under ground in 1995, the Lowermoor incident provided a major impetus to the development of local, regional and national structures for the management of the public health consequences of chemical inci dents in the UK. 3. In the mid 1990s, regiona l service provider units (R SPUs) were established in England, Wales and Scotland, providing advice and support in the event of a chemical incident across the whol e of the UK, as well as Eire. Health authorities were required to contract with one of the four RSPUs, which were in Birmingham , Cardiff, London and Newcastle. As a conse quence of the \"internal ma rket\" and the \"purchaser- provider\" split of the time, the provision of advice to health au thorities by RSPUs was geographically dive rse, with neighbouring areas frequently r eceiving support from different RSPUs. The Scottish Centre for In fection and Health (S CIEH) served as the RSPU in Scotland. 4. The estab lishment of RSPUs was further suppl emented by the fo rmation of the National Focus for Chemical In cidents in 1997. F unded by the Department of Health and devolved administrations, the National Focu s for Chemical Inci dents served to co-ordinate the activities of the RSPUs and coll ected, integrated and collated information from all agencies and organisations involved in management of incidents, providing timely a dvice to the DH and/or devolved administrations. All these organisations were consolidat ed in April 2003 when th e Health Protec tion Agency (HPA) was established. 5. In the event of a chemical contamination of the water supply, there is now a statutory requirement fo r water companies to inform the Director of Publ ic Health in the primary care trust 45 covering the affected area. The primary care trust would seek support from the local Hea lth Protection Un it (HPU). HPUs are part of the Local and Regional Services Division of the HPA (LARS) and ther e are about 100 serving the 301 primary care trus ts in England, giving support in the event of chemical, biological or radiological incidents. 6. In Wales, the infrastructure is slightly different, with the formation of 23 local health boards inst ead of primary care tr usts. These are suppor ted by the National Public Health Service for Wales, which is composed of consultants in communicable disease control, support sta ff and the former Public Hea lth Labora tory Serv ices in Wales. Although not a part of the HPA per se , the National Public Health Service for Wales has functions analogous to LARS. 45 Primary Care Trusts have taken over most of the duties of district health authorities. They cover a smaller area and population size than the old health authorities DDDRRRAAAFFFTTT DDDeeeccceeemmmbbbeeerrr 222000111222 TOX/2012/38 2127. The model, therefore, is fo r local expertise, whether in LARS or the National Public Health Service for Wales, to provi de the initial management of chemical, biological and radiation events. 8. To support the HPUs and National Public Health Se rvice for Wales in the management of chemical incidents, the HPA has 4 regional centres of chemical expertise in its Radiation, Chemicals and Environmental Hazards Direct orate (CRCE), which has a headquarters in Harwell, Oxon. CRCE provi des 24 hour, 365-day/year support and advice to first line responders, the NH S, local authorities, the HPA and other agencies, and government departments on the likely public health consequences of exposure to environmental chemicals. Advice provided encomp asses the principal areas of environmental ri sk assessment and decontamination, modelling and sampling, clinical management and biological sampling, public health consequences, risk communication and epidemiological follow up. 9. The local structures, whether primar y care trusts and HPU or local health boards and National Public Health Servi ce for Wales, would decide, in discussion with other releva nt bodies, what action was necessary to ensure protec tion of public health, and whether any follow-up action shoul d be taken and, if so, what th e action should be. The Water Industry 10. Changes in the organisati on and regulation of the wa ter industry were already planned at the time of the in cident. The legal framewor k before and after 1989 is outlined in Appendix 7 of this report. The incident itself led to at least three changes: immediate new procedures by water companies to prevent such an incident happening again (eg stringent procedures for checking and supervision of chemical deliveries, improved monitoring of the water treatment process and of the finished water); a new criminal offence of supplying water unfit for human consumption; and, as mentioned above, a statutor y requirement for water companies to inform the NHS in the event of an incident. 11. Also, with the privatisation of th e water industry, th e Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) was establis hed. This body acts as a technical auditor. It has three main functions: assessment of comp liance data against statutory standards; inspection of sites, procedures and policies in relation to the s upply and treatment of drinking water; and assessment of water quality incidents. In the event of an incident, it can take enforcement action and initiate prosecutions unde r Section 70 of the Water Industry Act 1991. DWI is notif ied of all events and, where appropria te, notifies the HPA and other stakeholders based on an asse ssment of the indivi dual circumstances. In the case of major incident s (not just pollution incide nts but, for example, plane crashes which might affect th e water supply) the water comp any must also notify the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) which oversees water-related major emergencies. Water co mpanies must have c ontingency plans in place in the event of an emergency eg provi sion of alternative 213Appendix 32: Declaration of LSG Members' Interests To be completed "}
