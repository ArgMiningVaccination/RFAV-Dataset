As part of the preparation for our new Crystal Healing Diploma that will be ready to launch at CAMExpo this September, (and don't forget to book onto our [Introduction to Crystal Healing Workshop](https://www.complementaryhealthprofessionals.co.uk/cpd) in August 2016), we have been researching lots of information, which naturally has thrown up many interesting questions! When discussing how students on the diploma will learn how to make gem elixirs as part of the course a colleague asked me how these differ from flower remedies or homeopathic remedies. Here is the answer: Gemstones function between flower essences and homeopathic remedies. When a gemstone is crushed and ingested, it is closer to homeopathic remedies and influences the physical body with medicinal, nutritional and antibiotic properties. When made into an elixir, it functions slightly more closely to flower essences and is more ethereal. Gems carry the pattern of crystalline structure within them and flowers contain patterns of consciousness because they are living organisms and possess a life force. Gemstones on the other hand act as an amplified consciousness as they are somewhat inanimate. Both flower remedies and gem elixirs adjust the flow of consciousness and karma that create the \"disease state\". They influence the subtle bodies and ethereal properties of the anatomy and then gradually influence the physical body. They work slowly but surely. Homoeopathic remedies come from dense inorganic material and usually vibrationally duplicate physical disease with a person to push the imbalance out. It does integrate into the subtle bodies but still functions on the vibrational level of the molecular structure. It seeks to alleviate biochemical patterns that contribute to the personality and works more on levels of the mind and stress, incorporating principles of consciousness. So they all work subtly affecting the consciousness in different ways. The important aspect is that they treat the underlying cause of the disease at a very deep level and the reason I like gem elixirs is how they affect the human energy field to help us resonate with the energy we need from the chosen crystals to bring about balance and healing. It is a great way to help your clients continue their healing journey in between crystal healing sessions. "}
