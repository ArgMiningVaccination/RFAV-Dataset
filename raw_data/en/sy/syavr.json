Here's how you can support them both.", "sitename": "SELF", "date": "2022-09-23", "cleaned_text": "I think there should be a new rule at baby showers: No more onesies. Okay, there's nothing wrong with onesies, per se; I had plenty of them given to me. Babies do need clothes (albeit a limited amount). But what we fail to recognize when we curate baby registries full of expensive products we [may or may not use](https://www.self.com/gallery/first-year-baby-items) and gift new parents clothing that their babies will outgrow in mere months is that the best gift a parent can receive is the gift of support. \"Parenting is hard\u2014and it's not a solo sport,\" [Katayune Kaeni, PsyD](https://wellmindperinatal.com/), a California-based psychologist who specializes in perinatal mental health, tells SELF. \"We need a team, we need community. New parents are often in a fog of learning their new baby and trying to sleep when they can. It can feel lonely and overwhelming. Any bit of help to reduce their stress or their workload can support their wellness.\" You won't find these seven gifts on most traditional registries, but talk to any new parent, doula, psychologist, or doctor who works with new moms and dads and they'll tell you that what matters most in those early days is having a support network that shows up in some of these ways. 1. Be a helper, not a guest. When you visit a new parent, forbid the new parent to \"host\" you, Alexis Barad-Cutler, a New York-based mother and the creative director of [The Chamber of Mothers](https://www.chamberofmothers.com/), a new nonprofit that centers mothers' rights, tells SELF. \"The worst thing that we do to new parents is expect them to entertain.\" Come ready to help and to listen instead. \"Helping is not holding the sleeping baby. It means letting the new parent nap, doing laundry, doing dishes, or tidying up.\" 2. Support their sleep. New parents need downtime, but taking care of an infant is relentless, often never-ending work. \"Without an extra pair of hands, the whole day feels like triage. Giving new parents the gift of rest is so important to their mental health, recovery, and their relationships. It's the most helpful thing you can do to support a new parent,\" says Barad-Cutler. After all, sleep deprivation has a link with perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, such as [postpartum depression](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/postpartum-depression) and postpartum anxiety, [Pooja Lakshmin, MD](https://www.poojalakshmin.com/), a board-certified and founder of [Gemma](https://www.gemmawomen.com/), a women's mental health EdTech platform, tells SELF. \"Sleep protection needs to be a part of how we support new parents. In my opinion, proactively discussing sleep is just as important as decisions around how to feed babies or birth plans. Offer to help with a night shift, plan a time when you can watch the baby so a parent can nap, or give the gift of a night nurse or doula.\" Some newer registries (see: [Little Honey Money](https://www.littlehoneymoney.com/)) include cash fund registries dedicated toward support structures like overnight help or doula care. 3. Ask them what their needs are\u2014and be specific. The best way to help support a new parent? Support them in the way they want and need to be supported, Dr. Kaeni says. Sure, it sounds obvious. But too often we assume what people want and need. Asking someone what they need might sound something like this, she says: What would help lighten your load right now? What kind of tasks can I take off of your hands today? Would you rather I help with the baby or help with the chores? Met with a response that the parent in need doesn't need anything? That brings us to our next point.... 4. Don't wait on them to ask for help. It's a well-meaning statement: \"Let me know if you need anything!\" But too often it's met with silence from those who, well, need things. That's why many new parenthood experts suggest simply doing without asking. \"Drop off a meal or two, ask them what diapers and wipes they use and drop those off, make them a gift or goodie basket of things you think they could use or need,\" Dr. Kaeni says. This takes the pressure off the person on the receiving end and provides help. \"When we say 'childcare is infrastructure,' this is what's meant: Every basic need is stressed under the weight of parenting young children, so parents need scaffolding to get through the day,\" Erin Erenberg, the executive director of The Chamber of Mothers, tells SELF. \"A simple gesture like covering a meal can sister a weak joist and keep the house from collapsing.\" 5. Hold space without expectation or advice. New parents need social support and to know that those around them care about them without being on the receiving end of advice or pressure to respond. \"Text them just to say you're thinking about them, but preface it with 'no pressure to respond,'\" suggests Lexi Tabor, a certified postpartum doula, certified lactation support counselor, and virtual doula with [Major Care](https://thatismajor.com/) based in Ohio. \"Those messages sent on the regular can really boost moods and make someone feel loved,\" she tells SELF. They help someone feel less alone and do away with any feelings of guilt if a new parent forgets to respond in a sleep-deprived haze. Resist the urge to give advice too. \"New parents are so used to being inundated with unsolicited advice that oftentimes they hesitate reaching out to people because reiterating boundaries gets exhausting,\" says Tabor. \"Many times we respond by sharing a story of our own experience in order to try to connect, but that can feel invalidating to the other person or turn it around to be about you.\" The fix: Simply be there. Ask questions unrelated to the baby's sleep, eating, or development, and really listen. If you're not sure what they want, ask them if they would like feedback or just need someone to hear them. Most of the time it's the latter, Tabor says. Remember too: Parenthood changes people, but your new parent friends are still people. And as much as they want to talk about their new baby, they might also want to joke about that viral TikTok or that new show they've been able to catch one or two episodes of. Talk to them about the things you would have pre-baby\u2014whether that was politics, pop culture, or hearing some juicy gossip about an ex. In fact, they'll probably appreciate the no-baby talk. 6. Honor cultural postpartum rituals. In the United States, new parents are woefully under supported. The US is one of only a few countries around the world without a federal paid family leave program, and by some counts, [one in four moms](https://inthesetimes.com/article/the-real-war-on-families) return to work just two weeks after giving birth; only about [23% of people](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/factsheet/family-leave-benefits-fact-sheet.htm) in the US have access to paid family leave. But that's not the way things are in other parts of the world. Many cultures, including Latin American culture, Indian culture, and many Asian cultures, honor and respect the postpartum period. \"I love exploring the different ways traditional cultures nurture new parents [through food],\" Lana Mihaiyu, a with [Major Care](https://thatismajor.com/) in California, tells SELF. \"Taiwanese sesame oil chicken soup and Korean seaweed soup are some of my favorites. They are both easy to prepare and super delicious, but also rich in nutrients to promote healing, support the immune system, and boost energy.\" Culture, comfort foods, and companionship can all be healing. \"Early postpartum is a time of major transition for the entire family, and a nourishing meal or a thoughtful message can be so therapeutic for body and soul,\" Mihaiyu says. 7. Be genuinely curious. How often have you started a conversation with a new parent with, \"Aren't you just so in love?\" On the surface, it's innocuous, but when we tell a new parent how they are \"supposed\" to feel and they don't feel that way, it can actually wind up making them feel worse, Paige Bellenbaum, LMSW, founding director of [The Motherhood Center](https://www.themotherhoodcenter.com/), tells SELF. Instead, try something like: \"How are you feeling about being a parent?\" or \"What is it like for you to have a baby now?\" Here's why that language shift matters: \"We need to give new parents permission to talk about how hard this can be,\" explains Bellenbaum. \"If we can normalize the hard parts, maybe then we can start to address some of the fundamental needs in this country like adequate and extended paid family leave, subsidized childcare, and better supporting the needs of new and "}
