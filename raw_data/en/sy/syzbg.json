McLane, Bob Pipinich Members Excused: None Members Absent: None Staff Present: Tom Gomez, Legislative Council Dorothy Quinn, Committee Secretary Announcements/Discussion: None HEARING ON SENATE BILL '133 Presentation and openin~ Statement by Sponsor: Senator Tom Rasmussen, Senate D~strict 22, advised the committee that Senate Bill 133 will license the practice of naturopathic medicine and creates this profession in the eyes of state law. It does exist in practice, but licensing has not been available. One of the concerns about this bill relates to the matter of Sunrise legislation. This provision was dealt with and he believed the naturopathic profession is the only profession which prepared a report which met the criteria of the Sunrise legislation. This was brought to the Legislative Audi t Committee last fall. At that point the matter of the $6500 fee arose. After some discussion, the practitioner$ indicated they were not in a position to come up with that fee. He stated he has an amendment to this bill which would say the profession would come up with this fee and go through the provisions of the Sunrise audit, if necessary.

Eden, M.D., MMA Committee on Legislation Mona Jamison, Montana Chapter of Physical Therapy Association Jack McMahon, M.D., Montana Medical Association Testimony: Dr. Brent Mathieu, Naturopathic Physician, stated he is a native Montanan from Sidney, and is the primary author of SB 133. He declared that naturopathic health care is a distinct health care profession, and should be fully recognized by the state of Montana. He believes the public needs SB 133 to protect their rights to the naturopathic's service in this free enterprise and democratic society. According to Dr. Mathieu, Montana does deny naturopathic physicians the equal privileges granted to other health care professionals. Naturopath\u00adic health care now needs to become part of the state system of professional licensure. SB 133 is based on compar ison studies of other state laws for licensing naturopathic physicians. It has evolved and is much improved since previous legislative attempts in 1983 and 1985. He stated it updates and clarifies the profes\u00ad sion's definitions and scope of practice. It concisely states what naturopathic physicians can and cannot do in their practice. This bill recognizes that naturopathic physicians diagnose and treat human health conditions. SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY January 27, 1989 Page 3 of 10 It expresses the principles which guide their practice and distinguish their profession. According to Dr. Mathieu, the scope of practice defined in the bill allows them to do what they have been taught and that is to be general practitioners providing primary, quality health care to the thousands of Montanans who now freely choose their services. They realize that some aspects of their practice as defined in SB 133 are of concern to other health professionals and may be to some members of this legislature. He stated that the Montana Medical Associa\u00ad tion has declined requests for discussion of these issues. He requested the committee members to look beyond a few controversial practice issues and realize that the\u00b7chief purpose of the naturopathic bill is to gain recognition of their practice in Montana. This bill defines what that practice is, it determines who qualifi\u00ad es to call himself a naturopathic physician, and it provides for the Montana public's right to choose our services. He called the committee's attention to certain sections of SB 133 and gave a brief explanation of those sections. Dr. Michael Bergkamp, Naturopathic Physician and Acupuncturist, stated his busy practices in both Great Falls and Helena indicate the growing demand for this type of health care. He read and submitted written testimony which described the attempts to address the concerns of their licensing proposal. (Exhibit 11). He requested the support of the committee on SB 133. He closed by requesting two patients come up and tell of their experience with naturopathic health care. Phyllis Lefohn told of her medical care received from a naturopathic physician and its outcome. She read and submitted her written testimony to the Committee. (Exhibit 12). She believed the underlying importance of sa 133 to be freedom of choice. John Fine stated he was here testifying as an individual familiar with naturopathic medical care. He described in detail the treatment his two sons received from a naturopath, Dr. Michael Bergkamp. This testimony is set forth in a written statement which was read and submitted to the committee. (Exhibit '3). As a consumer of medical services, he urged that SB 133 be passed. Dr. James Sensenig, Naturopathic Physician practicing in New Haven, Connecticut, stated he was formerly the Academic Dean at the National Col.lege of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon, and currently immediate past president of the American Association of Naturopath\u00adic Physicians. He addressed the issue of naturopathic SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY January 27, 1989 Page 4 of 10 education, stating it is a four-year full time program following standard pre-medical studies. The number of hours of clinical and classroom required for graduation with a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree are comparable to those found in conventional medical schools. He referred to the curriculum comparison fact sheet which shows hour for hour the courses taught in four U.S. medical schools compared with two U.S. naturop\u00ad athic school. (Exhibit 14). He stated that most courses are taught by physicians who are experts in their field, as well as by naturopathic physicians. According to Dr. Sensenig, there are only two U.S. schools approved by any of the other licensing boards in this country. The schools in Washington and Oregon are both approved by their department of education -by whatever name -and they are also approved by all the Boards of Examiners in the U. S. which license naturopathic physicians, and they are approved or accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education, which is the accrediting agency for naturopathic medicine which is listed by the U. S. Department of Education. He referred to the Complementary Medicine Index (Exhibit 15). He pointed out that it contained at least 200 references to scientific articles supporting the use of therapeutic values used by naturopathic physicians. He also directed the committee's attention to the Clinical Nutrition Review (Exhibit 16). In addition he mentioned that malpractice insurance can be purchased for lower premiums by naturopathic physicians indicating the risk of problems associated with that practice is minimal. He believes that those who do have problems probably do not meet the criteria established by this law. He touched briefly on the matter of referring patients. Among 270 recent patients from his office, 25% were also seeing medical doctors concurrently, based on an informal survey. He believes there is scientific evidence to support the work of the naturopathic physician. He urged the commi ttee to give favorable consideration of this bill. Riley Ostby of Billings advised that his daughter elected to pursue study to become a naturopathic physician. His comments are set forth in his written testimony which he presented to the committee. (Exhibit 17). Nancy Aagenes informed the committee that in 1983 she chose the field of naturopathic medicine because she wanted to work one on one with people. She stated she is often asked why licensure is important. She addressed the fact that she did not want to be put in the position of practicing medicine without a license. She stated the cost of defending a charge like that could be $100,000. SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY January 27, 1989 Page 5 of 10 She stated that after six years of school, she would be about $60,000 in debt, and then still would have to go to court to protect her right to practice. Another reason she feels they need to be licensed is because they need to have referrals and consultation relationships with conventional medical practitioners. Naturopathic education teaches the limits of its education. Naturopathic physicians know that naturopathic medicine is not a panacea. She advised that currently there are good referral relationships between naturopathic physicians and individual doctors, but each time they need to consult a medical doctor, they are placing themselves in a position where there may be reprisal. She stated this bill does not limit the scope of any other practice. There are persons in Montana calling themselves naturopathic physicians who have not seen the inside of medical schools nor attended any classes. She stated this bill is the recourse to discourage that type practice. Judge Gene Daly stated that medical doctors have done him a great service, but he related the favorable experience his wife had with the services of a naturopathic physician. Based on this experience, he believes that naturopaths should be given an opportunity to help others, and urged passage of SB 133. Darlene Otis stated she is a licensed social worker who practices in Hamilton. She related her experience of being blind in one eye, and after her medical doctors could not help her, she sought alternative treatment and was led to naturopathic physicians. She stated she no longer has a blind spot in her eye and has passed the Montana Drivers License test the past eight years without any assistance of glasses. She stated that as a coun\u00ad selor it is part of her work to help people help themsel\u00ad ves. She stated she lets people know what is available in the community and makes referral to naturopathic physicians. Of the small percentage of her clients who take that option, each has improved, according to her testimony. She related further work experiences that lead her to request that SB be passed. Bill Hallinan testified on his own behalf in favor of licensing naturopathic physicians. He read and submitted his testimony. (Exhibit 8). Jim Ahrens, President of the Montana Hospital Association, stated that he was opposed to SB 133. It is the view of his Association that in order to license a medical category there must be a compelling need that would require this type of licensing. They have long lists in SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY January 27, 1989 Page 6 of 10 hospitals of groups seeking licenses. Therefore, there must be some well founded interest of the state to take upon itself the insurance of the public welfare. In his opinion there are no well established standards of criteria and no compelling need to establish a new licensing category. He urged the committee to oppose this bill. Jerry Loendorf stated he was appearing on behalf of the Montana Medical Association. He indicated they have no dispute with regard to whether naturopathic physicians compete in the area of medicine. When a bill of this type wants to create a new health care profession in the state of Montana, you have one threshold question: does it work? That question must be answered before you get into the details of the bill. He stated it is the duty of the government to be sure to seek proof that what is proposed will work. In medicine there must be scientific tests before substances or standard procedures can be used on patients. In this bill naturopathy is defined as something that cures disease by utilizing natural forces, natural processes, and natural substances. He believes that questions should be asked regarding the scientific studies to show natural forces, natural processes and natural substances cure diseases. A general reference to some scientific study somewhere does not answer these questions, according to Mr. Loendorf. He declared that when the state stamp of approval is put on a health care license, you are saying to the state of Montana, \"this works\", and those questions should be answered. He concluded by asking what will the law become if it does not require standards. He urged the committee not to pass SB 133. Frank Kerins, President of Carroll College in Helena, advised that he was not speaking either in support of or in opposition to the bill. He stated his purpose was to describe for the committee's information the nature and kinds of accreditation. He read and submitted his written testimony to the committee. (Exhibit '9). Cindy Brown, M.S.,R.D., stated the Montana Dietetic Association opposes SB 133 because nutrition care, like any other area of medical care, should be based on scientific principles and standards. She stated nutri\u00ad tion therapies and treatments used by naturopathic physicians are often not subjected to scientific evalua\u00adtion. She read and submitted her written testimony to the committee. (Exhibit '10). Gary Lusin, PT, President of the Montana Chapter of the American Physical Therapy Association, stated their SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY January 27, 1989 Page 7 of 10 group's opposition to SB 133 was based on as much study of Naturopathy as their resources would allow. His testimony sets forth detailed observations regarding the language of the bill, which they regard as vague, and addresses other concerns. He read and submitted his testimony to the committee. (Exhibit #11). Sharon Dieziger, Montana Nurses' Association, spoke in opposition to SB 133. She urged the committee to vote against SB 133 if there is any question in their minds that there is safe, scientific evidence sanctioning this licensure. (Exhibit #12). Kenneth V. Eden, M.D. stated his reason for opposition to SB is that naturopathic medicine has no basis whatsoever in scientific fact, and there exists no standard of practice based on an unbiased search for the truth. He read his written testimony (EXHIBIT 113). Mona Jamison, Montana Chapter of American Physical Therapy Association, raised numerous questions on various sections of the bill, particularly P.4, lines 15 and 16 regarding definition of natural forces: P.6, lines 5 through 13, concerning scope of practice: P.7, line 7, referring to rule making; Pgs. 11 and 12 regarding powers and duties of Board; Page 12, lines 2-4, rule making delegation; P 15 regarding continuing education. Jack McMahon, M.D. stated that he believed Dr. Eden summarized in general terms the Montana Medical Association's objections to this bill. He stated he would like to expand on the proponents' testimony. He advised that streptococcal illness is a bacterial infection which, if not adequately managed by antibiotics, can cause significant illnesses such as rheumatic fever. He stated most people are familiar with open heart operations and coronary heart disease. Those procedures were originally designed to treat the after effects of rheumatic heart disease. To even suggest that acute respiratory infections can be worked off and treated with acidophilus is absurd, he stated. If any of those patients actually had the streptococcal infection, the gate would be open for an exceptionally bad outcome. Many in the fully licensed field of medicine have seen problems with emotional illness in their practices. We have been able to de- institutionalize the majority of our psychiatric institutions because of the medications that have become available, according to Dr. McMaho~. He discussed some of the requirements of study in the general practice of medicine. He strongly urged the committee to not license anything in the field of health care unless those SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY January 27, 1989 Page 8 of 10 requirements, mentioned by Mr. Loendorf, are obtained. He claimed there must be scientific basis anytime a license is issued. Dr. McMahon submitted a publication for the committee's inspection. (Exhibit #14). Questions from Committee Members: Senator Lynch expressed concern regarding immunizations of young children. Dr. McMahon advised that he did not believe the bill intended that immunization is not appropriate. Senator Lynch then questioned a proponent if the profession would not in any way advise against the immunization of children. Dr. Bergkamp stated that this is not specifically stated in their bill. He stated that he gives the parent the decision. Vaccination is not in the scope of their practice. Senator Himsl asked how many naturopathic physicians are currently practicing in Montana. Nancy Aagenes answered that there are approximately 12 naturopathic physicians who will be qualified for licensure under this act. In addition, there are some native Montanans who are practicing in other states who would want to return to this state if the licensure act is passed. There are Montana natives in schools who would want to practice here. Senator Himsl asked if these 12 are certified. She answered by stating they are qualified for licensure by having graduated from an accredited naturopathic school, that they have passed board exams and that they are licensed to practice in another state. Sen. Himsl also asked if any licensing agency has stopped anyone from practicing. Ms. Aagenes stated, to her knowledge, there has not been an effort to stop practice of naturopathic medicine in the state. Senator Rasmussen asked what is the situation regarding the scope of their work. Ms. Aagenes responded by stating that she is trained as a general practitioner. She stated she will do whole person health care. Senator Lynch asked how a consumer would know the difference between a qualified naturopath and one who has had no education in that field. In reply, Ms. Aagenes stated that they display their diplomas. Senator Hager questioned Ms. Aagenes as to why they did not use Washington laws since one person mentioned Washington laws are kinder. Ms. Aagenes stated that their bill was patterned after many different bills. She stated that they have worked hard with many different SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY January 27, 1989 Page 9 of 10 groups. She stated that in Washington the medical professionals were willing to sit down and work out a bill with the naturopathic physicians that was acceptable to their legislature. She stated she would like to see that happen in Montana. Senator Hager stated that there is a statute which requires a Legislative Audit Committee report must be attached to any bill reported out of committee of the Legislature. That refers to the Sunrise Audit Bill. Nancy Aagenes stated that to her knowledge they are the only group that attempted to go through a Sunrise audit. She stated they have completed application. They appeared before the Legislative Audit Committee twice attempting to get a Sunrise Audit. According to her, their group would welcome the scrutiny. What they object to is paying the fee. They do not want to pay $6500 for the privilege of having their legislation heard. If, however, their licensing legislation was passed, they are prepared to amend the bill to say that it could not be enacted until the Sunrise Audit was complete. If the bill was passed, they would be happy to pay the fee, which the Legislative Audit staff stated would be the maximum $6500. Closing by Comments by Sponsor: Senator Rasmussen stated there has been a lot of talk about scientific evidence, and he quoted a report from a 1978 U. S. Congressional Technology. It states that it has been estimated that only 10 to 20% of all procedures currently used in medical practice have been shown to be effective by controlled trials. He stated it is a David vs. Goliath situation. He stated that it is from the roots of natural medicine that these particular medical fields have arisen. He added that we have only had the orthodox medicine of today since the rise of the pharmaceutical industry in the late 1800's, which is now controlling medical practice in this country. He stated in all of Europe there is natural medicine practiced very openly and side by side with drug-oriented medicine. In this country there is a rising interest in natural medicine and the holistic health concept. He stated it is time that the Legislature recognizes that this ancient brand of medicine is legitimate in Montana. There are many citizens of this state seeking it out, and we need to legitimize it.

T .. ~ ..... e:eP\"\"'y~.2 to Great Falls in 1982, where I took over an existing~~ Naturopathic practice. My family and I moved to Helena the following\u00b7 year where I started an additional practice. I maintained both for another year until a graduate of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine could take over the Great Falls practice. Both of these practices were and are'highly successful and very busy. This represents the growing demand for this type of health care. As President of the Montana Association of Naturopathic Physicians I have been involved with communicating with other health care professionals about our licensing proposal. We have modified SB 133 to address every ,and any specific change these groups have requested. A draft of the bill was sent to. these groups well in advance of this hearing with a letter asking for suggestions or any problems they may have with the bill. We also felt the state wo~ld prefer that our profession be licensed under an existing board, negating the need for another new board. Last spring I presented our case for licensure to the Board of Medical Examiner. Dr. Malee, president of the board felt the board was already to busy to take on another licensed profession. He does support and recognize our need for licensure. Unfortunately this has been the only real communication with the medical profession after both written and phone attempts. I would like the committee to know that we still are in a posture of open communication with the opposition and would invite any dialogue concerning problems SB 133 may represent to their profession. Presently two counties, Lewis and Clark and Missoula, have included naturopathy in their employee health care coverage. They did this on their own initiative. Intermountain Insurance stated one of the reasons they accepted naturopathic health care was because of its cost effectiveness. The important issue this decision has raised is the absence of state licensure. At this time anyone can call themselves a naturopath and turn in their services for reimbursement. This serious misrepresentation would be prevented with the passing of SB 133. I will close by bringing up two patients who have experience with Naturopathic Health Care. They represent the growing demand for natural health care both in Montana and this country. A recent Harris poll found approximately 46 million Americans, over a quarter of those polled, use alternative health care, and they were among the most educated of the respondents. Please recognize these peoples right to freedom of health care choice by supporting SB 133. Sincerely yc.urs, (S) ' .............. - Testimony supporting S8 133: Licensure 1989 n /'\" Bllt. No ...2-!? Senator Hager and Members of the Committee: .~ Licensure of Naturopaths is crucially important to patients--to those who are the consumers, if you will--of our medical system. I ought to know; I am able to be here today, speaking to you, because of the medical care I received from a Naturopathic Physician. A year and a half ago I became ill with Chronic Epstein Barr Virus, a long-lasting, severe, mono-like illness. My own internist explained that there was nothing he or any other doctor could do for me. At least 20 different medical journal articles told me the same thing. Within 2 months, it was all I could do to get out of bed. The muscles of my face sagged, my feet would not move properly when I walked. I could no longer cook for my family, clean house, or take my children to music lessons. I could barely make it to the office once in awhile to keep books for my husband's business. Even sitting straight up in a chair for any length of time was nearly impossible. Of necessity, I resigned from everything, including taking call with Clancy Quick Response Unit. Fortunately, it was at this point that I talked with Dr. Bergkamp. Within a week of beginning treatment with acupuncture and botanical medicine, I began feeling better. Three weeks later, I overheard one of my sons telling a friend, \"Mom's much better, she's cooking dinner tonite.\" I could even walk normally. Improvement continued; gradually I could work a few hours a day and do the shopping myself. After several months, I even skied a few runs and began to believe that there was life after Epstein-Barr. This past Fall, I had the pleasure of attending an international Naturopathic Medical Conference in Missoula. During one session, I listened to a Naturopathic Physician from Portland describe the Chronic Epstein Barr Virus, from lab tests, to a profile of its victims, to a thorough discussion of successful treatment options. From personal experience, I knew the accuracy of the information and could appreciate the excellent medical care that these Naturopathic Physicians would provide to future Chronic Epstein Barr Virus patients. The conventional medical articles tell me that I should barely be beginning to move around now. Thanks to Naturopathic medicine, I 1 found myself able to hike 12 miles in 1 day this summer ... and find that I am able to maintain a full schedule now. After my experience of the past year and a half, I look at medical help differently. My family and I go to conventional doctors when it is appropriate ... but we go to those who work easily with Dr. Bergkamp. We also go to Dr. Bergkamp, appreciating his different approach, and knowing that he will work with conventional doctors whenever the situation warrants it. There have been no problems for my family, as patients, and we fully intend to continue seeking our own eclectic medical care. Which brings me to the point of my testimony and the underlying importance of SB 133: FREEDOM OF CHOICE. The freedom of a patient --me, my family, you--to choose. the medical care that makes sense to us, that works for us. SB 133 will protect us by insuring that the Naturopathic Physician offering medical care is fully trained and licensed; it will also assure us that we will have the freedom to choose our own medical care. Freedom of choice is a freedom that Americans like to assume is theirs. Providing for a Licensing Board for Naturopathic Physicians will protect that freedom. ~o~. ~ery~~c~. ~'\u00a3~~'--' Phyllis from: John Re: Senate January 26,.

What is the Naturopathic Health Care Practice Act?'.' This is the bill being introduced into the 1989 Montana Legislature by Senator Tom Rasmussen. It will define and limit the scope of naturopathic medicine in the state. It will require that certain educational requirements be met, that is, graduation from an approved college' of naturopathic medicine, before a person can be licensed in Montana. I I It will set up a board of 3 members, two naturopathic physicians and on member of I' the public, to regulate the practice. It will be entirely financed by the profession NOT by the taxpayers. It allowsnaturopaths to practice their profession but does NOT limit any other i profession. Why is it important for this bill to pass? i It will do three things: 1) provide protection to the naturopathic physicians now practicing in the state; 2) keep untrained persons from passing themselves off to 1 the public as naturopathic physicians; 3) provide the public with an alternative and qualified medical practice and opinion. What is naturopathic medicine? Naturopathic medicine is based on treating the whole person, preventing illness, using the healing power of nature, removing underlying causes of illness, and using non-invasive treabnents. For sure, it does no harm. It is said that conventional medicine works to prevent death; but naturopathic medicine works to promote life. Some of the natural therapies used by naturopathic physicians include theraputic nutrition, botanical medicine (herbs), manipulation, acupuncture and acupressure, natural childbirth, homeopathic medicine, counselling and stress management, and minor surgery. What do naturopathic physicians NOT do? They do NOT do major surgery nor prescribe drugs other than natural substances. Where those treabnents appear necessary, they refer to M.D.s. How many naturopathic physicians are there now in Montana? Probably about 12 who would meet the licensing requirements of the proposed law. Once licensing is in effect, it is e~pected that others, some native Montanans, will come here to practice. Are naturopathls licensed in other siates? Yes. Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Alaska, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Utah and Washington D.C. Why should this bill pass? It all boils down to freedom of choice. This bill will provide another choice. The Montana Medical Association, or any' other single group, should not be able to tell our citizens that they can or cannot use any specific system of medicine. By and large, naturopathic medicine is effective and inexpensive. It should be encouraged as one way of promoting health and cutting back medical costs. What it is ... What it can do for you!

American Association of Naturopathic PhYSicians P.O. Box 33046, Portland, OR 97223 (503) 255-4863 The College \u00b7JOHN BASTYR COLLEGE Seattle, Washington John Bastyr College was established in 1978 to meet the growing need for scientifically trained naturopathic physicians brought about by Increased consumer interest in and demand for health-oriented care and preventive medicine. It offers three unique degree programs in the natural health sciences: a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, a Master of Science in Nutrition, and a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. The degree programs In nutrition were added to the College's curricula in 1984 to meet the increasing demand for exceptional programs In nutrition. Students are attracted to all of these programs because they are scientifically based and humanistically oriented comprehensive natural-health-care degree programs. John Bastyr College was founded in 1978 as a naturopathic medical college. In 1984, as part of the college's mission of providing comprehensive education in natural health sciences, graduate and undergraduate programs in nutrition were added. Currently, JBC is the only naturopathic medical school in the United States that has achieved full accreditation from a federally recognized accrediting agency, the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education. The institution is also a candidate for accreditation with the Northwest ASSOCiation of Schools and Colleges. (Candidacy is not accreditation, nor does it ensure eventual accreditation; it is a status of affiliation with a recognized accrediting body that indicates that the institution has achieved initial recognition and is progressing toward accreditation.) Students attending the College are strongly motivated, highly independent, and creative. At JBC there is a strong sense of community that offers each student both academic and personal support. The College also benefits from a highly dedicated faculty and administration. The College's total enrollment in 1987-88 was 161 (134 in the naturopathic medical program and 27 in the nutrition programs); 60 percent were women and 40 percent were men. Their average age was 33, and 25 percent were married. Thirty-five percent were Washington State reSidents, and twenty-seven other states were represented; 13 percent were from other countries, primarily Canada. Ten of the students had earned graduate degrees previously, 4 were doctors, and 29 held professional degrees. Part of the College's mission is to pursue scientifiC research on the use of nutrition and natural therapies to improve the management of health-care problems and to focus on long-term prevention of chronic disease. Original research projects are conducted regularly, a journal has been published, and a research fellowship has been funded. Location The campus is located in an urban setting in northeast Seattle. The College's building has views of both the Olympic and Cascade mountains. Downtown Seattle is approximately 4 miles away. The College's clinic is located nearby in the center of the University District. Seattle is one of the Northwest's most attractive cities and has mountains, beaches, lakes, extensive parks, and clean air. The city offers a full range of facilities and activities, including museums, theaters, fine restaurants, a symphony orchestra, sports, and outdoor activities. The Puget Sound area is rich in academic institutions, including five universities and many more colleges, community colleges, and professional schools. Majors and Degrees John Bastyr College offers a Bachelor of Science degree in nutrition. The B.S. degree program provides the third and fourth years of an undergraduate program and is designed to educate students who are interested in a career in the nutrition field, desire a foundation in the health sciences, or need to meet prerequisites for a degree in naturopathic medicine. At this time, JBC is considering offering a' Bachelor of Science degree in natural health sciences with a concentration in Oriental medicine. Academic Program John Bastyr College's academic year is from September to June. The calendar Is divided into three quarters. There is a three-week interim after the fall term and a two-week interim after the winter term. Students in the Bachelor of Science degree program in nutrition enter as juniors and must be prepared for the study of organic chemistry, biochemistry, and human physiology. The program emphasizes nutrient chemistry and metabolism; the personal, cultural, and socioeconomic aspects of food and their influence on nutritional status, dietary evaluation, and modification; and the evaluation of current research in nutrition. An emphasis on field observation exposes seniors to nutritional education seltings and to community food and nutrition programs and businesses. Graduates are prepared for work with professional health-care providers as nutrition educators, for jobs with food and nutrition programs and businesses in the health and fitness industry, and for graduate work in related science and health fields. The B.S. program consists of 90 quarter credits, including clinical observation. Students take courses in two broad areas: science and counseling (organic chemistry, fOCUSing on metabolism and nutrition; biochemistry; human physiology and anatomy; developmental psychology; disease processes; communication and counseling skills; clinical observation; and statistics) and nutrition (general nutrition: macronutrients and micronutrients, digestion and metabolism, nutritional needs throughout the life cycle, dietary planning, food science, food ways, introduction to therapeutic nutrition, and introduction to analysis and assessment). Undergraduates may take as electives certain approved courses from the master's program in nutrition or the doctoral program in naturopathic medicine; they often find that this broadens their exposure to principles of preventive and holistic health care. Academic Facilities The College maintains a medical library with current journals, special collections in the areas of nutrition and naturopathiC medicine, and audiovisual aids. The library has access to DIALOG, a computer research service. Students at JBC also have full access to the nearby Health Science Ubrary of the University of Washington. Costs Tuition for the 1988-89 academic year is $76 per credit. Fees are $105 per quarter. The total cost of tuition and fees for a full-time student is approximately $3735 per year. Students spend approximately $400 per year on books and supplias. The College does not provide housing. Many students live in shared housing facilities off campus; the average rent per person ranges from $150 to $200 per month. The College's Student Services DiviSion maintains listings of available housing. The Washington Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators estimates John Bastyr College Financial Aid Faculty Student Government Admission Requirements Application and Information that living expenses average $500 per month for housing and food. Medical care, transportation, and personal expenses are extra. Students in all programs are eligible to participate in the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL), Pell Grant, Perkins Loan (formerly NDSl), and College Work-Study (CWS) programs. There are also a limited number of professional and community scholarships available. Applicants seeking financial aid must submit the Financial' Aid Form (FAF) to the College Scholarship Service by April 15 for maximum consideration. Complete financial aid Information will be provided by the College on request. The JBC student-faculty ratio is approximately 1 : 1. There are 2 full-time and 18 part-time faculty members. Over 70 percent hold doctoral degrees, and all faculty members are involved in teaching and are dedicated to providing students with a program of the highest quality in human nutrition. The primary focus of community partiCipation Is the All-College Meeting, scheduled as necessary during the year. This is the forum for interchange of information, ideas, and deCisions, and every member of the College community is encouraged to participate. There also are a number of groups in which students partiCipate, such as the Curriculum Review, Admissions, and library committees, as well as the All-Student Committee, which oversees the use of students' activities fees. Students also serve on the Promotions Committee, Resident Selection Committee, Appeals Board, and Clinic Planning Group. Students are represented on the Board of Directors by an elected student from the most senior class, who also attends the weekly College management meeting. The College relies upon this participation by students to create a more effective leaming environment. Community service is expected of all students, and JBC offers community service credits for activities that benefit the College. Credit has been granted for such activities as interviewing prospective students, serving on committees, staffing the library, tutoring, improving the facilities, contributing to JBC publications, and helping out with fund-raising. Admission is based on academic achievement, personal and social development, relevant experience, financial planning, and demonstrated humanistic qualities. The College maintains a rolling admissions policy. Minimum prerequisites for the bachelor's programs are two years of college-level general education (90 quarter or 60 semester credits), which must include 2 terms of English, 1 term of major-level general chemistry with laboratory, and 1 term each of biology, social science (psychology or sociology), and college algebra. Transfer credit and advanced standing will be evaluated on an individual basis following completion of the application process and an interview. All applicants who satisfy the basic admission standards meet with the dean of admissions. Applications should be received by the College by June 1 for fall admiSSion, although late applications are considered if space is available. Application for admission may be made by submitting the JBC application for the B.S. program in nutrition with the $35 nonrefundable application fee, all official transcripts, and two letters of recommendation.

I have no academic degrees, preparation or experience in medicine or any health-care field, and am not knowledgeable about naturopathic medicine or its practice. ACCREDITATION. The following paragraphs are excerpts from the 1988 Accreditation Handbook of the Northwest Association, pages 1-5. Accreditation is a process of recognizing educational institutions for performance, integrity, and quality which entitles them to the confidence of the educational community and the public. In the United States this recognition is extended largely through non\u00ad governmental, voluntary institutional or professional associations which have responsibility for establishing criteria, visiting and evaluating institutions at their requests, and approving those institutions and programs which meet their criteria .. An, IAI .lrt nA~1\"'\\ Page Two Institutional accreditation is granted by the regional accrediting commissions or the associations of schools and colleges which together cover institutions chartered and/or licensed in the United States and its possessions. These commissions or associations accredit total operating units only, not parts of them. Specialized accreditation of professional schools and programs is granted by a number of national organizations, each representing a professional area such as architecture, law, medicine, or social work. Though each of these organizations has its distinctive definitions of eligibility, criteria for accreditation, and operating procedures, most of them have undertaken accreditation as one means of protecting the public against professional incompetence. The Northwest Association is one of six similar regional associations in the United States which accredits schools and colleges. The Northwest region includes Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Definition of Institutional Accreditation. Accreditation by the Commission on Colleges'of the Northwest Association means that a postsecondary institution's own goals are soundly conceived, that its educational programs have been intelligently devised, that its purposes are being accomplished, and that the institution is so organized, staffed, and supported that it should continue to merit confidence. The Council on Postsecondary Accreditation (COPA) is a nongovernmental, non-profit body organized to foster and facilitate the roles of both institutional and specialized accrediting agencies in promoting and insuring the quality and diversity in American post\u00ad secondary education. To achieve these ends, the Council recognizes, coordinates, and periodically reviews the work of its member accrediting agencies, determines the appropriateness of the existing or proposed accrediting activities, and performs other related functions. For purposes of determining eligibility for United States government assistance under certain legislation, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies and associations which he/she determines to be reliable authorities as to the quality of training offered by educational institutions and programs. (end of excerpts from handbook.) Page Three Naturopathic Medical Education in the Northwest There are, to my knowledge, two institutions located in the Northwest region which offer degrees in naturopathic medicine. One is the John Bastyr College in Seattle, the other is the National College of Naturopathic Hedicine in Portland. John Bastyr College is a Candidate for Accreditation with the Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Association. Candidate for Accreditation is an affiliated. nonaccredited relationship with the Commission. Only accredited institutions are members of the Association. Candidacy indicates that an institution is progressing toward accreditation. Attainment of the affiliate status does not assure accreditation. (Handbook, p. 11.) John Bastyr College is accredited by a specialized agency called the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education. The National College of Naturopathic Medicine has no relationship at this time with the Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Association. It has a provisional or probationary accreditation from the Commission on Naturopathic Medical Education. The Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education is not presently recognized by COPA, and does not have an application in process with COPA. It is recognized by the Secretary of Education. In conclusion, no institution offering degrees in naturopathic medicine is at this time accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Association or, to the best of my knowledge, by any of the six regional institutional accrediting bodies in the United States.

Montana 59624 I Testimony of Cindy Brown, M.S., R.D., Montana Dietetic Association, to cormnittee of the Montana Senate regarding Senate Bill 133, to license naturopathic physicians for I.> practice in the State of Montana: Mr. Chairman and members of the cormnittee: -LL whc.&\\ h.a.s ~h\\~~ I~~' My name is C~y Brown. I am a Registered Dietitian and represent the Montana Dietetic Association~--~e oppose Senate Bill 133, licensing for naturopathic physicians in the State of Montana. I Our opposition has nothing to do with monopolizing the nutrition assessment and counselil fields nor with restricting freedom of choice. We oppose Senate Bill 133 because \" nutrition care, like any other area of medical care, should be based on scientific principles and standards. Nutrition therapies and treatments used by naturopathic physicians are often not subjected to scientific evaluation. I Anecdotes and t:~~~~ experiences cannot be used as proof of effectiveness and safety of nutritian therapy. Plausability of usefulness -such as if a little vitamin A is good, a lot if better -does not always mean scientific validity. Unproven health care methods could potentially be both safe and effective.- or could just as easily be I ineffective and dangerous. The only way to differentiate these conditions is by t unbiased experiments, which are generally lacking in naturopathic education and training.1 The Council on Post-Secondary Education in the Office of the Secretary of Education (202/452-1433) has stated clearly that they do not recognize naturopathy as an accredited form of study. This lack of accreditation indicates how questionable their study is. When the pub~ic participates in unproven practices, and when these unproven practices are sanctioned by state licensing, both are allowing self-experimentation. We are aware of questionable and unproven nutrition assessment and counseling practices in I this state by practicing naturopaths. Nutritional assessments done incorrectly using unsound methods provide incorrect information resulting in the person making unnecessary iI dietary changes or perhaps taking excessive amounts of vitamin/mineral supplements. II Vitamins and minerals in food are part of food. Taken out of food and given singly in large doses, they are drugs and can be harmful. i I The scientific approach is based on the hypothesis that a treatment is useless and perhaps harmful unless proven otherwise. Much of the philosophy of naturopathy is based on the idea that a therapy is innocent until proven guilty. This philosophy works well in the courtroom, but does not belong in nutrition or any other area of health care. i rb~ ~1Il f tfl ~ Thank you. Respectfully submitted, Ci:d~ M.S., R.D.

'-'fAlI DA 0 // BIll ~ C,)~ CF = Testimony regarding SB 133, Licensing of Naturopathic PhYSiCia~NO~ .~ Presented by Gary Lusin, PT, President of the Montana Chapter of the ~ American Physical Therapy Association Our opposition to this bill is based on as much study of Naturopathy as our re\u00ad sources would allow. We have written to 4 of the ~ states that presently license Naturopaths to review their licensing acts. We received information from 3. We have also written to both schools of naturopathy and have received general information from them including their curriculum. We wrote to 7 physical therapy schools around the country and received their curriculum information as well. We then compared courses from all programs to determine credit hours, and as much as possible determine the content of the courses. We have also spoken with 2 naturopaths in the state in the attempt to get some perspective on the philosophy of naturopathy, their education and background, specifically in areas that may relate to physical therapy, to determine how many naturopaths are in the state (which we have been told there are 12), to ascertain how naturopathy started, and to get some perspective of why they want to be licensed and if they have full support of their members in this endeavor. After gathering this information, and in reading the bill carefully, my chapter has concluded that we must oppose the bill as it is written. We had, and still have, many questions about certain language in the bill that we feel should be answered to adequately define the practice of naturopathy and further, to legally determine its scope of practice. In general, we feel the language is very vague and in many respects leaves items open to wide interpretation. We believe a profession that practices across such a broad spectrum of health care should have licensing language commensurate with the responsibilities and obligations specific to those respective areas of care, ie, medicine, pharmacy, surgery, physical therapy, and nutrition. We feel the questions we have regarding this bill are coming from us as physical therapists, and because we too are consumers of health care. We found through our investigation of naturopathy that the profession originated ,in the early 1900's and apparently came out of chiropractic, and was started be\u00ad cause some of the individuals wanted to address health issues in a holistic manner. Therefore, naturopathy encompasses several different aspects of health care. This raises a basic question of what is the philosophy of naturopath~c care? What is the why of their profession? What is i,t that dictates or provides the rationale for what they do? These were several areas of the bill we h~d questions about but the major ones are: 1) Section 2: We have not perceived or seen indication that a \"significant number of Montanans choose naturopathic health care\". Page two Section 3, We also wonder if the \"legislature finds that a significant number \" If these are indeed valid statements then we would not want to deprive the citizens of Montana their choice. There are only apparently 12 naturopaths in the state and by report not all of them are practicing naturopathy. We know that one is delivering babies and another is working as a massage therapist. We question whether licensure is indicated at this time and if the public is requesting licensure because of significant problems that only licensure would resolve. paragraph 8 and its subsections is one of the areas we have the most concern as it is this section that we feel relates very closely with the profession of physical therapy. The language is very close to that found in the physical therapy practice act. We believe that the general vagueness of this bill, along I I i i i with the specific reference to language very close to physical therapy, that at least a clear written distinction must be attempt- r ed so as not to confuse the public, or the professions as time . goes on should this bill be put into law. Paragraphs 8 (a)(i), (ii), (iv), b(i) reference areas specific in the practice of physical therapy. We are not concerned about the technical application of various modalities such as heat, cold, ultrasound or electro modalities, but more importantly what is the rationale within naturopathy that leads them to use those procedures. Another example is in the area-of\u00b7corrective exercise . In\"one conversation I have had with a naturopath, and in\"reviewing their curriculum, I am convinced that this area needs very close definition and clarification. Prescribing proper and appropriate exercise for various conditions requires careful evaluation, instruct\u00ad ion, understanding of tissue pathology and mechanics, and appropriate monitoring to progress those exercises. My experience thus far causes me to have considerable question as to whether naturopaths should be vaguely licensed in this area. We believe this is not in the best interest of the public. Paragraph 8, (a)(ii) requires considerable defintion as we are not aware of what the \"therapeutic effects of the natural processes of life, and of rest and activity, whether m~ntal or physical\" are. This appears to leave wide open any type of treatment approach and this language appears to be bad for any profession to have. Paragraph 8, (a)(iv) is particularly disturbing to us. This leaves wide open the use of any \"natural\" therapies as taught by approved naturo\u00ad pathic medical colleges and as approved by the board\". This raises questions of the standards of their education and whether those standards regulate enough why and what is taught. Page three This further raises questions as to the power given the board in this bill to approve practice methods. Section 3, paragraph 2(c) appears to allow the board to approve a college if they conform to educational standards equivalent to thos established by the Council on Naturopathic Education. We really know very little about naturopathy and it behooves us to question closely their educational standards. We also find conflict with the language cited above regarding physical therapy and Section 9, paragraph 4, which indicates that it is a violation to practice or claim to practice any licensed health care profession or system of treatment other than naturopathic health care unless holding a separate license in that profession. We believe, by the language in Section 3, paragraph 8, that they are attempting to practice the system of physical therapy and a substantial change in language appears necessary to see that they don't violate their proposed prac\u00ad tice act. Finally, we trust and hope that the legislature will satisfy all questions surround\u00ad ing this bill and look closely at the vagueness of it. It does not appear to adequately address public protection. In addition, consideration should be given to the broad, ill-defined scope of practice within this bill, and recognition that some of the language is extremely specific to physical therapy which is a respectably licensed profession for nearly 30 years. We are all obligated to look closely at this bill, just as all other~. However, close scrutiny of this bill, as it deserves, demonstrates the extreme vagueness, and prompts the thought that every thing a naturopath claims to do is already available to the public through other specific and licensed professions. If all the others show considerably greater education than what naturopaths have in those respective areas, as physical therapy does, it may be necessary for naturopaths to present language that recognizes and makes better distinction between their practice and others. We respectfully request your close scrutiny of this bill to be sure the language is clear and terms well defined. Questions raised should be addressed and answer\u00ad ed with the sole purpose of public protection. If the vagueness, lack of defini\u00ad tions, and apparent practice of physical therapy cannot be satisfactorily explored and addressed, we ask that you defeat this bill.

EDEN, M.D., MMA COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION Dear Senators\u00b7: The reason I'm here to speak in opposition to Senate Bill 133 is simple: naturopathic medicine has no basis whatsoever in scientific fact, and there exists no standard of practice based on an unbiased search for the truth~ For over 400 years advances in science, including medicine, have been based on the scientific method: an observation in nature lead to an hypothesis to explain the observation. The hypothesis is then tested and if it fails to pass the test, it is rejected and a new hypothesis formed. In this way Newton described gravity and other natural forces, Einstein's hypothesis led to atomic fission and Laetrile was exposed as not just a worthless drug but a harmful one. The people of Montana have a right to expect that their state government and its agencies will not participate in the fiction of licensing a method of health care which stops after observation and hypothesis; no testing, no objective search for the truth, no unbiased standard by which to define good vs bad practice and, most importantly, no means to expose the next \"Laetrile.\" Defeat of this bill will not limit freedom of choice: Montanans can still seek the provider of their choice: (over) ,Page 2 ,\"\u00b7Medical doctor, naturopath, chiropractor, rolfer.
