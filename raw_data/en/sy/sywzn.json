What About IKEA, Pottery Barn or Amazon? Finding non-toxic rugs takes a little bit of effort, which is why it is nice to recommend brands so that you can order a rug with confidence. There are a lot of questions to ask a company about their rugs, and everyone's tolerance of chemicals is different, regardless of whether you are chemically sensitive or just trying to be mindful of what you bring into your home. Natural area rugs that are budget friendly can be found at larger stores such as IKEA, Pottery Barn, West Elm or Amazon. You just need to be very mindful of the materials used in each type of rug, and what chemicals you are personally trying to avoid. IKEA natural fiber rugs are great choices, especially since the company has made such a commitment to eliminating harmful materials in their products. (You might want to buy in-store, though, rather than online. [Here's why](https://www.getgreenbewell.com/ikea-usa-online-ordering/).) I personally bought [my wool rug for my living room](https://rstyle.me/+SgdfaI3HvuXC9iiNYJDDrQ) from Pottery Barn. I was able to ask a variety of questions from their customer service department about chemicals used and possible moth-proofing pesticides that could have been applied. Thickness of the rug was very important to me. I didn't want a thin rug, which I found with so many of the zero VOC rugs I was looking at. I am very happy with my wool area rug, which I was able to save money on using a Pottery Barn sale. What to Avoid in Area Rugs Rugs can have a lot of hidden chemicals and problems that you might not realize before bringing them into your home. When shopping for chemical free area rugs, keep these tips in mind: - Avoid synthetic materials such as polypropylene and nylon, which are made of plastics. - Natural materials, such as cotton and wool, can be treated with chemicals, such as toxic dyes, flame retardants or pesticides. Make sure that the natural fibers are untreated. - The backing used in area rugs so that they do not slip can often be synthetic rubber. Look for rugs with no backing or only using natural materials as backing. - Many colors are made with toxic dyes that could contain heavy metals. Dyed wool rugs must be treated with especially harsh chemicals to absorb colors. Of particular concern are AZO dyes, which could be [potential carcinogens](https://www.twosistersecotextiles.com/pages/azo-dyes). Choose companies that use non-toxic dyes or vegetable-sourced colorings. - Glues and adhesives used in the backings are often made with formaldehyde and other chemicals. Natural latex is a safer adhesive in rugs. - Pesticides and fungicides are commonly used in fibers for rugs. Especially chemicals for moth-proofing wool. - Flame retardant chemicals are another source of exposure in traditional area rugs. While wool is naturally fire resistant, plastic fibers generally need to be coated with a fire retardant to make them safer. - Stain resistant and water repellant coatings are made from chemicals such as PFCs. Avoid these coatings. For the chemically sensitive, many conventional rugs can cause problems because of the off gassing smell. However, lack of any bad smell does not make a rug non-toxic. If you are only doing a sniff-test to see if you can tolerate a rug in your home, you could be unintentionally exposing yourself to other chemicals that are off-gassing with no odor. Choosing a low VOC rug is similar to choosing low VOC flooring. Here is my shopping "}
