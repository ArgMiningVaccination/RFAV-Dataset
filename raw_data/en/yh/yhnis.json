[Daily saliva testing](https://sc.edu/safety/coronavirus/testing_and_services/testing/index.php)is available on campus. Please check the schedule often as times and locations may change. - You can also [get tested off campus](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/health_services/medical-services/covid-19/covid19_testing/off-campus_testing/index.php). - It is very important that anyone that develops significant symptoms of COVID-19, like fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact their healthcare provider for evaluation. If needed, an appointment for a test will be scheduled. - At this time, diagnostic tests are at covered at no cost for State Health Plan members. Please visit [PEBA's website](https://www.peba.sc.gov/covid-19)for the most Plan and MoneyPlus coverage information) The university strongly encourages all students, faculty, and staff to get fully vaccinated in order to protect themselves and the community. In addition, we recommend everyone complete their booster vaccination once eligible. - University Health Services has free walk-up vaccine clinics and booster shots at the Center for Health and Well-Being from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. daily. - Vaccine appointments on campus can also be made through [MyHealthSpace](http://sc.edu/myhealthspace), or you can [find a vaccine in the community](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/). - COVID-19 vaccine booster shots are also available at the Center for Health and Well-Being. University Health Services is currently administering Moderna and Johnson and Johnson boosters. See more information on the [UHS site](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/health_services/about/news-publications/COVID19-Updates.php). - If you have received the vaccine, please upload your vaccine record into the [MyHealthSpace](http://sc.edu/myhealthspace)portal. The portal is compliant with federal health privacy law and your records will not be shared. For instructions on how to upload a copy of your completed vaccine card to [MyHealthSpace](http://sc.edu/myhealthspace)visit our [COVID-19 Vaccine Information page](https://sc.edu/safety/coronavirus/testing_and_services/vaccine/index.php). If you received your vaccine on campus through University Health Services, your vaccine status will be updated automatically. State Health Plan Insurance Coverage PEBA, BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina and Express Scripts are continuing to monitor information about the COVID-19 vaccines. Visit [PEBA's website](https://www.peba.sc.gov/covid-19) for the most recent information regarding vaccine coverage for State Health Plan and MoneyPlus participants. On November 29, 2021 we sent notification to impacted employees regarding federal [Executive Order 14042](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/), \"Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors.\" The Executive Order requires federal contractors--including the University of South Carolina--to ensure that all employees who work on or in connection with a federal contract to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or receive approval for a medical or religious exemption. On December 7, 2021, a federal court in Georgia issued a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government nationwide from enforcing the Executive Order's vaccine mandate for federal contractors and employees. Therefore, the university is suspending the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for our employees who work on or in connection with a federal contract. Vaccinations are still recommended for those who are medically eligible. Visit [our COVID-19 site](https://sc.edu/safety/coronavirus/testing_and_services/vaccine/index.php) for more information. The University of South Carolina is committed to complying with all federal requirements and we will provide additional updates as needed. Face coverings are required in the following spaces: - Medical facilities, including the Center for Health and Well-Being, Thomson Health Center, COVID-19 testing facilities, VA School of Medicine campus and any other medical facility. Face coverings are encouraged for people in the following situations: - If you are at high risk for illness - those who are elderly, immunocompromised, pregnant or who have certain medical conditions. - If you live or regularly interact with someone at high risk for illness. - If you have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine. - If you have symptoms of COVID-19. - If you work in spaces where it is difficult to remain a safe distance apart. - On public transportation. Additional guidelines and recommendations: - Voluntary masking in all remaining areas of campus is supported. - The face covering requirements will remain until conditions and public health recommendations dictate a policy modification. - Medical-grade face coverings, such as N95, KN95 or surgical masks, are more effective than cloth coverings. No matter the face covering you choose, make sure it fits tightly over your nose and mouth to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets. - Employees who have medical conditions that make wearing a face covering difficult are encouraged to talk with their supervisor about alternative options. Depending on the situation and the needs of the unit, these alternatives may include using a plastic face shield as an alternative or modifications to a physical workspace such as a transparent physical barrier. [Policy UNIV 3.04 Communicable Disease Outbreak Mitigation Measures [pdf]](http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/univ304.pdf)includes specific directives concerning the need for and use of face coverings on campus. For more information about face coverings, please refer to our [frequently asked questions](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/human_resources/toolbox/covid_guidelines/index.php#covidfaq). The university has [modified its operations](https://web.qa.sc.edu/safety/coronavirus/safety_guidelines/index.php) to protect the health and well-being of our campus community. The most important thing you can do to keep yourself and others safe is to follow the safety guidelines. This includes: - Monitoring yourself for symptoms every day. - Staying home if you are sick. - Wearing your face covering. - Washing your hands frequently. - Maintaining a safe distance from others. - Disinfecting surfaces and maintaining a clean workspace.

[Notify Environmental Health and Safety](/about/offices_and_divisions/human_resources/docs/osha_covid19_flyer.pdf)at 803-528-8191 so EHS can investigate and determine if this potential illness meets the OSHA reporting requirements for a workplace illness. - University Health Services offers [quick tips for appropriate actions](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/health_services/medical-services/covid-19/exposure_protocols_and_care/covid19_exposure/index.php)to take if an employee has been in [close contact [pdf]](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_health_services/medical-services/covid-19/shs-covid19-decision-flow-chart-03aug2020_v6.pdf)with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Remote Work Status Tracker: As additional employees return to work on campus, be sure to keep your records current. College and Division HR Contacts are responsible for updating their personnel rosters using the [Employee Remote Status Checker [pdf]](/about/offices_and_divisions/human_resources/docs/employee_remote_status_app_qr.pdf). This application allows College/Division HR contacts to identify faculty and staff who are working 100% remotely. The roster can be updated as frequently as necessary and allows colleges and divisions to track personnel accurately. "}
