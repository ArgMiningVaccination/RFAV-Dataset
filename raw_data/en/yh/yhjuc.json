We have so much to learn from each other. This program is born out of intensives I have taught in the past, mentorship circles I have held, and requests from students of Ayurveda to dive deeper into their herbal studies. Self healing tools and herbs are the things I know the most about, learned and utilized in my own body and the cycles I have gone through thus far (menstruation, fertility, pregnancy, birth, postpartum and beyond) and the things I utilize with my clients the most effectively. There is always so much more to learn. This is not a comprehensive class. It is what I know the best, and my hopes are that it serves to deepen your practice of Ayurveda and relationship with herbs and medicines and support you to feel more confident in sharing them. It is not a total beginner's program, and it is also not the most advance you might find. But I feel that it is a wonderful middle place to find ourselves, coming strongly into the intermediate level of study and practice of Ayurveda, herbalism and self-empowered healing. \"Adena is meant for women's health, education and support.

This training pulls from my studies and practice in Ayurveda, Maya Abdominal Therapy, Yoga and Western Herbalism...and not in the least from my personal experience with my own healing and my clients This is not 'classical Ayurveda' per se, but practical Ayurveda within a Western cultural context with respect and always turning back to the texts and teachers I revere most when needed My experience and my training is mainly in serving those who live in female bodies and identify as women, but this is not a 'requirement.' Ayurveda principles can be applied to all of nature. If you have questions or concerns about this, there is a space to bring it up on the application. The immersion is not designed to be comprehensive. Thank you ! "}
