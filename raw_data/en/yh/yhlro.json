Should any shipments not be made as specified in the manual it will be removed by the official contractor and stored until the hall is ready to accept materials for APIC 2023 Rules & Regulations16 www.annual.apic.orgthe exhibition and all costs involved will be charged to exhibiting company. Exhibitors are responsible for all information provided in the Exhibitor Services Manual. 10. Arrangements of Exhibits. Any portion of an exhibit that obstructs the view, interferes with the privileges of other exhibitors, extends beyond the designated booth space or for any reason becomes objectionable, must be immediately modified, or removed by the exhibitor. The show management reserves the right to inspect the quality of the appearance of each booth prior to show opening. Where necessary, masking drape or other covering material will be placed to cover unsightly wires, unfinished backwalls exposed waterpipes or hoses, etc. at the exhibitor's expense. 11. Booth Design. The regulations listed herein are not intended to unduly restrict exhibits as to either design or utility. The spirit in which the rules are presented is to create and maintain an open atmosphere on the exhibit floor. In designing exhibits, traffic flow, good judgment and consideration for neighboring exhibitors and attendees should be primary objectives. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of all information distributed by APIC; however, due to the ever-changing needs and maintenance schedules of facilities, such as the Orange County Convention Center, up-to-the-minute information is not always available. With this in mind, we remind all exhibitors that APIC, the Orange County Convention Center and its contractors or agents can make no warranties as to the accuracy of floor plans issued in conjunction with or pertaining to the exposition. If locations of building columns, utilities or other architectural components of the facility are considerations in the construction of an exhibit, it is the responsibility of the exhibitor and/or his/her agent to physically inspect the facility to verify all dimensions and locations. IN-LINE BOOTHS: In-line booths have only one side exposed to an aisle and are generally arranged in a series along a straight line. Regardless of the number of in- line booths utilized, (e.g., 10' x 20', 10'x 30', 10' x 40', etc.), display materials must be arranged in such a manner so as not to obstruct sight lines of neighboring exhibitors. The maximum height of 8 feet is allowed only in the rear half of the booth space, with a 4-foot height restriction imposed on all materials in the remaining space forward to the aisle. When three or more in-line booths are used in combination, as a single exhibit space, the 4-foot height limitation is applied only to that portion of exhibit space that is within 10 feet of an adjoining booth. A Perimeter Booth is an in-line booth that backs to an outside wall of the exhibit facility rather than to another exhibit. All guidelines for in-line booths apply to Perimeter Booths except that the maximum back wall height is 12 feet. APIC does not allow end cap booths, meaning booths exposed to aisles on three sides and composed of two 10-foot x 10-foot booths. APIC does not allow in-booth education for linear booths. ISLAND BOOTHS: Island booths are any size booths exposed to aisles on all four sides. Supplementary regulations governing such exhibits are the following: The entire cubic content of the space may be used up to the maximum allowable height of 20 feet including signage (hanging or stationary), banners, trusses and hanging lighting systems. Any hanging signage will be hung at 20 feet from the floor to the top of the sign. Canopies, including ceilings, umbrellas, and canopy frames, can be either decorative or functional (such as to shade computer monitors from ambient light or for hanging products). The base of the canopy should not be lower than 7 feet from the floor within 5 feet of any aisle. Canopy supports should be no wider than 3 inches. This applies to any booth configuration that has a sight restriction. Fire and safety regulations in many facilities strictly govern the use of canopies, ceilings, and other similar coverings. Check with the appropriate local agencies prior to determining specific exhibition rules. Island Exhibitors should adhere to the following minimum guidelines when determining booth lighting. No lighting fixtures, lighting trusses, or overhead lighting are allowed outside the boundaries of the exhibit space Lighting should be directed to the inner confines of the booth space. Lighting must not project onto other exhibits or show aisles. Lighting that is potentially harmful, such as lasers or ultraviolet lighting, must comply with facility rules and be approved in writing by exhibition management. Lighting that spins, rotates, pulsates and other specialized lighting effects should be in good taste and not interfere with neighboring exhibitors or otherwise detract from the general atmosphere of the event. 12. Exhibitor Services Manual. Each exhibitor will be provided with an official Exhibitor Services Manual. The Exhibitor Services Manual describes the type and arrangement of exhibit space and the standard equipment provided by Show Management for booth construction. All booth space must be arranged and constructed in accordance with the guidelines, provisions, and limitations contained in the Exhibitor Services Manual. In the sole opinion of Show Management, any exhibit that fails to conform to the Exhibitor Services Manual guidelines or the provisions set forth herein, such exhibit will be prohibited from functioning at any time during the exhibition. Each exhibitor is responsible for keeping the aisles near its exhibit space free of congestion caused by demonstrations or other promotions. All demonstrators or other promotional activities must be confined to the limits of the exhibit space. Sufficient space must be provided within the exhibit space for the comfort and safety or persons watching demonstrations and other promotional activities. Island booths are restricted to 20 feet in height. All booths must be carpeted. Exhibiting companies are responsible for furnishing, cleaning, and carpeting their booths.

Conduct. All exhibits will be to serve the interest of APIC members and will be operated in a way that will not detract from other exhibits, the exhibition, or the meeting as a whole.

Selling Products/Merchandise. Selling of products or merchandise on the exhibit floor is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate eviction from the conference. 19. Sound Devices, Lighting, and other Presentation Devices.

Speakers and other sound devices should be positioned to direct sound into the booth rather than into the aisle. Noise levels must be held to a 70-decibel maximum at all times. Show Management will monitor the 70-decibel regulation onsite. If an exhibitor is in violation of the 70-decibel regulation, they will receive one warning. If the exhibitor continues to operate noisemaking exhibits in excess of 70-decibels after the first warning, Show Management reserves the right to cut the power of the offending mechanism, or otherwise ensure the noisemaking mechanism is shut off.
