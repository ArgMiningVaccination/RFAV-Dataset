Published: 22nd April 2017 10:00 PM | Last Updated: 22nd April 2017 05:30 PM | A+A A- Respiratory diseases cause most illnesses and it depends upon several parameters, including environmental factors such as inhalation of toxic gases individual sensitivity, genetic factors, lifestyle choices such as smoking, untreated colds, bacterial infections, and so on. Fortunately, respiratory diseases are well-controlled because of antibiotics and vaccines. In the last two decades, much interest has been aroused in acupuncture techniques (including electroacupuncture (EA), laser acupuncture) for addressing these diseases. This is because the World Health Organisation and the National Institutes of Health have promoted clinical practice and research work in alternative medical practices. Also, progress has been made to establish a close relationship between acupuncture and western medical sciences, and, in some cases, scientific explanations have been provided or observed from clinical results obtained from acupuncture and EA techniques. All these efforts have helped increase confidence in EA. It is well-known that if EA is successfully applied to patients, it can treat chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, bronchitis, and abnormal heart rhythms. There are a few reports about the safety of EA treatment, and it is recommended that exhaustive study has to be done before beginning the treatment. Almost all irregularities related to breathing originate from obstruction in the ventilation ducts, either because of the narrowing of the tubes or because of the disorder in air circulation resulting from problems such as bronchitis. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this condition has been divided according to symptoms: wheezing and breathing irregularities. In TCM the condition is considered Xiao-Chuan. The cause is associated with abnormalities in Qi, which narrows the airways in the lungs and creates obstacles so that the flow of phlegm is perturbed. As per some acupuncture specialists, wetness disturbs the yin-yang and creates not only discomforts but also difficulties in respiration. In such cases, Chinese treatment along with western medication, proper use of antibiotics, is recommended. The problem is solved by normalising and activating Qi in specific points by the passage of an electric current of low intensity and frequency. Many clinical results show that acupuncture and EA work in some cases, but the exact cause of using the basis of western medical sciences has not been investigated. However, abnormalities in pulmonary disease in the light of western medicine have not been carried out so far, and the purpose of this discussion is to examine how EA and western approaches may be used together. In western science, bronchitis is treated with bronchodilators. The intensity of the treatment depends upon the condition of the patient. Certain bronchodilators, such as albuterol and salmeterol, are effective. Ipratropium bromide can also be used for a short period. Chronic pulmonary diseases are often associated with secondary infections. In such cases, studies are recommended, and, if such an infection is confirmed by a specialist, then suitable antibiotics are recommended.
