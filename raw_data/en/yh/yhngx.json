With a history spanning thousands of years, acupuncture has proven its effectiveness in countless cases. In fact, the US National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine boasts over 31,000 research papers on the subject, with more than 6,100 specifically focused on animals ( [www.pubmed.gov](http://www.pubmed.gov/)). At Hatton Veterinary Hospital, we are thrilled to merge our expertise in Western medicine and surgery with the artful practice of acupuncture. Our goal is to enhance pain management and improve the overall quality of life for our patients. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. As the identification of imbalances requires a different perspective on disease, we may need to ask additional questions that may not have been covered during your regular office visits. Often, multiple issues need to be addressed, but we may not be able to tackle all of them simultaneously. We kindly request that you plan for three initial acupuncture sessions to assess your pet's response. Within this timeframe, most conditions should show noticeable improvement if they are likely to respond positively. Depending on the condition, your pet may benefit from periodic \"tune ups\" or additional therapy thereafter. Our approach to Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM) is truly integrative, as we strive to combine the best of Eastern and Western medicine to deliver optimal care for your beloved pet. "}
