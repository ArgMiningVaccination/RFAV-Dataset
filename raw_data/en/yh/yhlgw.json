Beyond pharmaceuticals, I prefer to employ several paradigms of thought when considering treatment and diagnosis. I am passionate about nutrition, pre- and post-natal care, including all recent developments, and love having the opportunity to spend enough time with patients to assess every facet of their life to maximize wellness. Dr. Cohen has been most excited by all forms of science since a very young age. She completed medical school at Ross University and her residency at United Health Services Wilson Medical Center, then went on to practice family medicine for one of the more underserved communities in Harlem. In recognition of the limitations of western medicine, she chose to broaden her scope of practice towards a more holistic approach, coincidentally around the same time that she got engaged to her now husband, an acupuncturist. Dr. Cohen completed Dr. Andrew Weil's two-year Fellowship in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona as well as a one-year Fellowship in Integrative Medicine at Weill Cornell's Integrative Health and Wellbeing, where she now serves as Fellowship Director in the department. She is board certified in both Family Medicine and Integrative Medicine. She has a passion for taking the time with each patient to understand their individual pattern and tailoring a lifestyle strategy that will be most beneficial. In addition to energy healing, becoming a mom herself has made fertility, pre- and post-natal care special areas of passion and expertise. Dr. Cohen is an Integrative Medicine Physician and a consultation with her does not replace a primary care visit. - M.D.Ross University School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine (Dominica, WI)2012 - B.A.State University of New York at Binghamton2007 - Assistant Attending PhysicianNewYork-Presbyterian Hospital - Assistant Professor of Clinical MedicineWeill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University News & Media External Relationships Relationships and collaborations with for-profit and not-for profit organizations are of vital importance to our faculty because these exchanges of scientific information foster innovation.
