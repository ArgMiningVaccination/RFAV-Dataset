Recognition of thewidespread use of CAM by the people of the United States has given newemphasis to the need to better understand the effects of these treatmentsfrom the perspective of personal and public health. To provide a rational,effective, efficient, and personally satisfactory health care system, it is im-portant and useful to know who is using CAM therapies and why, how thepublic obtains information about CAM and how credible that informationis, why many users of CAM do not inform their physicians about such use,just what CAM is, and whether these therapies are safe and effective. It is only relatively recently, however, that there has been a serious general interest in the United States in investigating and evaluating thesetherapies. In 1992 the U.S. Congress established the Office of AlternativeMedicine (OAM) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to begin todevelop a baseline of information on CAM use in the United States. In 1999the Congress elevated OAM to the National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine and appropriated $48.9 million to carry outwork directly related to CAM. Other institutes of NIH and other federalagencies also engaged in the effort and by 2003, 19 institutes and centerswithin NIH were collectively spending $315.5 million on CAM-relatedresearch and other activities. This report was commissioned in September 2002, when 16 NIH insti- tutes, centers, and offices plus the Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality asked the Institute of Medicine to convene a study committee toexplore scientific, policy, and practice questions that arise from the signifi-viii PREFACE cant and increasing use of CAM therapies by the American public. Specifi- cally, this study was asked to 1. Describe the use of CAM therapies by the American public and provide a comprehensive overview, to the extent that data are available, ofthe therapies in widespread use, the populations that use them, and what isknown about how they are provided. 2. Identify the major scientific, policy, and practice issues related to CAM research and to the translation of validated therapies into conven-tional medical practice. 3. Develop conceptual models or frameworks to guide public- and private-sector decision making as research and practice communities con-front the challenges of conducting research on CAM, translating researchfindings into practice, and addressing the distinct policy and practice bar-riers inherent in that translation. Furthermore, the committee was asked to explore several issues, including the methodological difficulties in the conduct of rigorous research on CAM therapies and how these relate to issues in regulation and practice,with exploration of the options that can be used to address the difficultiesidentified. the shortage of highly skilled practitioners who are able to partici- pate in scientific inquiry that meets NIH guidelines and who have access tothe institutions where such research is conducted. the shortage of receptive, integrated research environments and the barriers to developing multidisciplinary teams that include CAM and con-ventional medical practitioners. the availability of standardized and well-characterized materials and practices to be studied and incorporated, when appropriate, into practice. the existing decision-making models used to determine whether or not to incorporate new therapies and practices into conventional medicine,including evidence thresholds. the applicability of these decision-making models to CAM therapies and practices; that is, do they form good precedents for decisions relating toregulation, accreditation, or integration of CAM therapies? identification and analysis of successful approaches to the incorpo- ration of CAM into health professions education. the impact of current regulations and legislation on CAM research and integration.PREFACE ix Committee membership was chosen to represent the most salient per- spectives and competences, since there was no possibility that all or evenmost of the interest groups could be represented. Members included provid-ers of CAM and conventional health care as well as analysts, observers, andmanagers of CAM and conventional health care systems. To ensure effec-tive input from CAM providers, the committee established a working liai-son group composed of 35 leaders of CAM and conventional medical disci-plines and held a number of formal and informal interchanges with thesegroups. The committee proceeded to educate and inform itself through a sys- tematic review of the extensive relevant literature, a series of expert presen-tations, discussions, and public comments in open meetings, and focusedinterchange and deliberation in committee meetings. The work of the com-mittee was especially informed by discussions and a paper on experimentaldesign written for the committee by Naihua Duan, Joel Braslow, AlisonHamilton Brown, Ted J. Kaptchuk, and Louise E. Tallen. The agendas andparticipants in the public meetings are listed in Appendix G. As described more extensively in Chapter 1 of the report, the commit- tee deliberated at length concerning whether and how to define CAM mostusefully for the purpose of this report. All proposed definitions were impre-cise, ambiguous, or otherwise subject to misinterpretation. Judging that adefinition was necessary, for the purposes of this report the committeeadopted the definition stated on page 19. Several important caveats need tobe understood to interpret correctly the committee 's meaning of statements concerning CAM in this report. The definition is necessarily imprecise andnonlimiting since it is based in part on the implied intended purpose of thepractitioner and the user (i.e., improvement of health outcomes) and in parton exclusion from a category (the dominant health care system) that itself isnot precisely defined and that changes substantially over time. The term CAM , as used in this report, encompasses a large, diverse, and changing set of \"systems, modalities, and practices and their theories and beliefs. \" The diversity of practice within CAM is so great that there are few, if any, generalizations that apply equally to all systems, modalities,and practices defined as CAM. When the term CAM is used in this report,it is not intended to include all CAM practices equally but, rather, to referto a substantial group of CAM practices. The work of the committee began with the question, what do patients and health professionals need to know to make good decisions about theuse of health care interventions, including CAM? Of primary importance inmaking decisions about whether to use specific CAM therapies is determin-ing that they are safe and effective. There are extremes of belief abouteffectiveness; for some individuals, no other evidence than hearsay or theirx PREFACE own experience or knowledge is necessary to determine that a CAM therapy is effective. For others, no evidence of any quality or quantity is sufficient toprove CAM effective. This report will please neither of those extremes. Recognizing that all scientific conclusions are tentative, the committee adopted proven and conventional standards of scientific evidence as thebasis for judgments of the safety and effectiveness of both CAM and con-ventional medicine. The widespread use of CAM has focused attention on the need to find answers to the numerous questions surrounding such use, questions such aswho is using CAM therapies and why, how does the public obtain informa-tion about CAM and how credible is that information, why aren 't users of CAM informing their physicians about such use, just what is CAM and arethese therapies safe and effective? A significant portion of this report is devoted to an examination and analysis of evidence: what it is, how we obtain it, and how it is used byvarious stakeholders to make decisions. Methodological challenges are ex-amined, and innovative study designs are discussed. Existing evidence aboutthe effectiveness of some CAM therapies is reviewed and gaps in our knowl-edge are identified. Input from the liaison panel was particularly importantas the committee explored the issue of evidence and how we know what weknow. The report also addresses a number of issues related to the integration of CAM and conventional medicine, including how a therapy moves from anew idea to an accepted practice, a framework for advising patients aboutCAM, and approaches to integration. The committee concluded that thegoal should be the provision of comprehensive medical care that is based onthe best scientific evidence available regarding benefits and harm, that en-courages patients to share in decision making about therapeutic options,and that promotes choices in care that can include CAM therapies, whenappropriate. Our challenge was to eliminate parochial bias and to apply thebest-available means of assessment of safety and effectiveness adapted toparticular clinical circumstances of both CAM and conventional medicine.In this way we will be able to ensure that we are making informed, rea-soned, and knowledge-based decisions about the safety, effectiveness, anduse of CAM in health care. On behalf of every member of the committee, I want to express our unbounded respect and appreciation for the wisdom, industry, and judg-ment that Lyla Hernandez put into this study. At many critical juncturesshe kept the committee on track; and she was regularly a source of impor-tant ideas, data, and experts. The study would not have been completedwithout her gracious perseverance. We also want to thank Kysa Christie,PREFACE xi who provided thoughtful and invaluable research support. Ms. Christie identified, evaluated, and synthesized background information and issuesthroughout the committee 's deliberations. And we thank Makisha Wiley, who expertly managed our administrative, meeting, and travel needs.

More thana third of American adults report using some form of CAM, with total visitsto CAM providers each year now exceeding those to primary-care physi-cians. An estimated 15 million adults take herbal remedies or high-dosevitamins along with prescription drugs. It all adds up to annual out-of-pocket costs for CAM that are estimated to exceed $27 billion. Friends confer with friends about CAM remedies for specific problems, CAM-related stories appear frequently in the print and broadcast media,and the Internet is replete with CAM information. Many hospitals, man-aged care plans, and conventional practitioners are incorporating CAMtherapies into their practices, and schools of medicine, nursing, and phar-macy are beginning to teach about CAM. CAM's influence is substantial yet much remains unknown about these therapies, particularly with regard to scientific studies that might convinc-ingly demonstrate the value of individual therapies. Against this backgroundthe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine(NCCAM), 15 other centers and institutes of the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality com-missioned the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to convene a committee thatwould Describe the use of CAM therapies by the American public and provide a comprehensive overview, to the extent that data are available, of2 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE the therapies in widespread use, the populations that use them, and what is known about how they are provided. Identify major scientific, policy, and practice issues related to CAM research and to the translation of validated therapies into conventionalmedical practice. Develop conceptual models or frameworks to guide public- and private-sector decisionmaking as research and practice communities in-creasingly conduct research on CAM, translate the research findings intopractice, and address the barriers that may impede such translation. TOWARD COMMON RESEARCH GROUND Decisions about the use of specific CAM therapies should primarily depend on whether they have been shown to be safe and effective. But thisis easier said than done, as there are extremes of belief about what counts asevidence. For some individuals, evidence limited to their own experience orknowledge is all that is necessary as proof that a CAM therapy is successful;for others, no amount of evidence is sufficient. This report will please neither of those extremes. There are unproven ideas of all kinds, stemming from CAM and con- ventional medicine alike, and the committee believes that the same prin-ciples and standards of evidence should apply regardless of a treatment 's origin. Study results may then move useful therapies from unproven ideasinto evidence-based practice. The goal should be the provision of comprehensive care that respects contributions from all sources. Such care requires decisions based on theresults of scientific inquiry, which in turn can lead to new information thatresults in improvements in patient care. This report 's core message is therefore as follows: The committee rec- ommends that the same principles and standards of evidence of treatmenteffectiveness apply to all treatments, whether currently labeled as conven-tional medicine or CAM. Implementing this recommendation requires thatinvestigators use and develop as necessary common methods, measures,and standards for the generation and interpretation of evidence necessaryfor making decisions about the use of CAM and conventional therapies. The committee acknowledges that the characteristics of some CAM therapies \u2014such as variable practitioner approaches, customized treatments, \"bundles \" (combinations) of treatments, and hard-to-measure outcomes \u2014 are difficult to incorporate into treatment-effectiveness studies. These char-acteristics are not unique to CAM, but they are more frequently found inCAM than in conventional therapies. The effects of mass-produced, essen-tially identical prescription drugs, for example, are somewhat easier toEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3 study than those of Chinese herbal medicines tailored to the needs of indi- vidual patients. But while randomized controlled trials (RCTs ) remain the \"gold stan- dard\" of evidence for treatment efficacy, other study designs can be used to provide information about effectiveness when RCTs cannot be done orwhen their results may not be generalizable to the real world of CAMpractice. These innovative designs include: Preference RCTs : trials that include randomized and non-random- ized arms, which then permit comparisons between patients who chose aparticular treatment and those who were randomly assigned to it Observational and cohort studies , which involve the identification of patients who are eligible for study and who may receive a specifiedtreatment, but are not randomly assigned to the specified treatment as partof the study Case-control studies , which involve identifying patients who have good or bad outcomes, then \"working back \" to find aspects of treatment associated with those different outcomes Studies of bundles of therapies : analyses of the effectiveness, as a whole, of particular packages of treatments Studies that specifically incorporate, measure, or account for pla- cebo or expectation effects : patients ' hopes, emotional states, energies, and other self-healing processes are not considered extraneous but are includedas part of the therapy 's main \"mechanisms of action \" Attribute-treatment interaction analyses : a way of accounting for differences in effectiveness outcomes among patients within a study andamong different studies of varying design Given limited available funding, prioritization is necessary regarding which CAM therapies to evaluate. The following criteria could be used tohelp make this determination: A biologically plausible mechanism exists for the intervention, but the science base on which plausibility is judged is a work in progress. Research could plausibly lead to the discovery of biological mecha- nisms of disease or treatment effect. The condition is highly prevalent (e.g., diabetes mellitus). The condition causes a heavy burden of suffering. The potential benefit is great. Some evidence that the intervention is effective already exists. Some evidence exists that there are safety concerns.4 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE The research design is feasible, and research will likely yield an unambiguous result. The target condition or the intervention is important enough to have been detected by existing population-surveillance mechanisms. A therapy should not be excluded from consideration because it does not meet any one particular criterion \u2014say, biological plausibility. How- ever, the absence of such a mechanism will inevitably raise the level ofskepticism about the potential effectiveness of the treatment (whether con-ventional or CAM). Moreover, the amount of basic research needed tojustify funding for clinical studies of the treatment, and the level of evidencefrom those studies that is needed to consider the treatment as \"established, \" will both increase under such circumstances. A NEW POSITION ON DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS The committee has taken a similarly pragmatic approach to dietary supplements, which have become a prominent part of American popularhealth culture but continue to present unique regulatory, safety, and effi-cacy challenges. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 \u2014the capstone, thus far, of herbal-medicine regulation \u2014the Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) was authorized to establish good-manufacturing-prac-tice regulations specific to dietary supplements. But the Act did not subjectsupplements to the same safety precautions that apply to prescription andover-the-counter medications. Instead, it designated that supplements beregulated like foods, a crucial distinction that exempted manufacturersfrom conducting premarket safety and efficacy testing. Similarly, FDA 's regulatory-approval process \u2014which would be standard operating proce- dure if supplements had been classified as drugs \u2014was eliminated, thereby limiting the agency to a reactive, postmarketing role. The committee is concerned about the quality of dietary supplements in the United States. Product reliability is low, and because patent protectionis not available for natural substances there is little incentive for manufac-turers to invest resources in improving product standardization. Yet reli-able and standardized supplements are needed not only for consumer pro-tection but also for research on safety and efficacy. Without consistentproducts, research is extremely difficult to conduct or generalize. And with-out high-quality research, medical practitioners cannot make evidence-basedrecommendations to help guide patients. Therefore the committee recommends that the U.S. Congress and fed- eral agencies, in consultation with industry, research scientists, consumers,and other stakeholders, amend the Dietary Supplement Health and Educa-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 tion Act of 1994 and the current regulatory scheme for dietary supple- ments, with emphasis on strengthening: Seed-to-shelf quality-control (based on standards for each step of the manufacturing process \u2014from planting to growth, harvest, extraction, and screening for impurities), Accuracy and comprehensiveness in labeling and other disclosures, Enforcement efforts against inaccurate and misleading claims, Research into how consumers use supplements, Incentives for privately funded research into the efficacies of prod- ucts and brands, and Consumer protection against all potential hazards. FILLING THE GAPS Evidence of the safety and efficacy of individual CAM treatments is essential, but it represents just one facet of the research that is needed. Forexample, there is a paucity of clinical research that compares CAM thera-pies with each other or with conventional interventions. Very little researchhas been done on the cost-effectiveness of CAM. And although there isgreat opportunity for scientific discovery in the study of CAM treatments, itis an opportunity largely missed. Such investigations are hindered by shortages of established scientists engaged in CAM research, which tends to involve subject matter beyondthe conventional scientist 's knowledge base. CAM also needs a cadre of new junior researchers. While major U.S. health-sciences campuses havelong offered training in basic and clinical research for conventional medi-cine, the challenge is to induce these schools to embrace CAM research aswell. One approach might be to add specific CAM content to conventional-medicine postdoctoral training programs. Furthermore, CAM research will benefit from the contributions of more than one discipline. In addition to providers who have specialized knowl-edge of CAM treatments and methodologists who can address the chal-lenges inherent in CAM study design, investigators with backgrounds infields such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics, genetics,pharmacology, neuroscience, health services, and health policy can makeimportant contributions. Interdisciplinary teams, grouped into \"critical masses \" at various locations, will be favorably positioned to probe the many factors that influence individuals to use CAM treatments and thatdetermine the outcomes of those treatments. Research on CAM is inextricably linked to practice. CAM therapies are already in widespread use today; it is reasonable to attempt to evaluate theoutcomes of that use, and in the practice setting one can focus on research6 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE that answers questions about how therapies function in the \"real world \" where patients vary, often have a number of health problems, and are usingmultiple therapies. Practice-based research addresses real world practiceissues and facilitates adoption of practice changes that are based on re-search results. To address these gaps, the committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other public agencies provide the supportnecessary to: develop and implement a sentinel surveillance system (composed of selected sites able to collect and report data on patterns of use of CAM andconventional medicine); practice-based research networks (defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as \"a group of ambulatory practices devoted principally to the primary care of patients, affiliated witheach other [and often with an academic or professional organization] inorder to investigate questions related to community-based practice \"); and CAM research centers to facilitate the work of the networks (by collecting and analyzing information from national surveys, identifying importantquestions, designing studies, coordinating data collection and analysis, andproviding training in research and other areas). include questions relevant to CAM on federally funded health care surveys (e.g., the National Health Interview Survey) and in ongoing longi-tudinal cohort studies (e.g., the Nurses ' Health Study and Framingham Heart Study). implement periodic comprehensive, representative national surveys to assess the changes in prevalence, patterns, perceptions, and costs oftherapy use (both CAM and conventional), with oversampling of ethnicminorities. INTEGRATING CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE Even as CAM and conventional medicine each maintain their identities, traditions, and practitioners, integration of CAM and conventional medi-cine is occuring in many settings. Hospitals are offering CAM therapies, agrowing number of physicians are using them in their private practices,integrative-medicine centers (many with close ties to medical schools andteaching hospitals) are being established, and health maintenance organiza-tions and insurance companies are covering CAM. Cancer treatment centers in particular often use CAM therapies in combination with conventional approaches. For example, the MemorialSloan-Kettering Cancer Center has developed an Integrative Medicine Ser-vice that offers music therapy, massage, reflexology, and mind-body thera-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7 pies. As the Website of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute 's own Zakim Center for Integrated Therapies explains, \"When patients integrate these therapies into their medical and surgical care, they are creating a morecomprehensive treatment plan and helping their own bodies to regain healthand vitality. \" In response to the growing recognition of CAM therapies by conventional-medicine practitioners for their patients ' care, the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States has developed Model Guide- lines for the Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in MedicalPractice . Other tools are also needed to aid conventional practitioners ' decisionmaking about offering or recommending CAM, where patientsmight be referred, and what organizational structures are most appropriatefor the delivery of integrated care. The committee believes that theoverarching rubric for guiding the development of these tools should be thegoal of providing comprehensive care that is safe, effective, interdiscipli-nary, and collaborative; is based on the best scientific evidence available;recognizes the importance of compassion and caring; and encourages pa-tients to share in the choices of therapeutic options. Studies show that patients frequently do not limit themselves to a single modality of care \u2014they do not see CAM and conventional medicine as being mutually exclusive \u2014and this pattern will probably continue and may even expand as evidence of therapies ' effectiveness accumulates. Therefore it is important to understand how CAM and conventional medical treat-ments (and providers) interact with each other and to study models of howthe two kinds of treatments can be provided in coordinated ways. In that spirit, there is an urgent need for health systems research that focuses on identifying the elements of these integrative-medicine models,their outcomes, and whether they are cost-effective when compared toconventional practice. The committee recommends that NIH and other public and private agencies sponsor research to compare: the outcomes and costs of combinations of CAM and conventional medical treatments and models that deliver such care models of care delivery involving CAM practitioners alone, both CAM and conventional medical practitioners, and conventional practitio-ners alone. Outcome measures should include reproducibility, safety, cost-effectiveness, and research capacity Additionally, the committee recommends that the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the U.S.Department of Veterans Affairs support research on integrated medical8 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE care delivery, as well as the development of a research infrastructure within such organizations and clinical training programs to expand the number ofproviders able to work in integrated care. The pursuit of such goals requires examination of the ethics of medi- cine, both in the provision of personal health services and the profession 's advocacy for public health. Medicine is continuously shaped by larger so-cial, cultural, and political forces, and the integration of CAM therapies isanother juncture in this evolutionary process. The ethical principles that guide conventional biomedical research should also be applied to CAM research. Legal and ethical issues often ariseand sometimes conflict with use of CAM therapies because the decisionfacing a conventional practitioner or institution may engender a conflictbetween medical paternalism (the desire to protect patients from foolish orill-informed, though voluntary decisions) and patient autonomy. The ModelGuidelines noted above seek to establish greater balance between physicianand patient preferences. In addition, a number of legal rules \u2014including state licensure laws, precedents regarding malpractice liability and profes-sional discipline, state and federal food and drug laws, and statutes onhealth care fraud \u2014protect patients by enhancing quality assurance, offer- ing enhanced access to therapies, and honoring medical pluralism in creat-ing models of integrative care. Without rejecting what has been of great value and service in the past, it is important that these ethical and legal norms be brought under criticalscrutiny and evolve along with medicine 's expanding knowledge base and the larger aims and meanings of medical practice. The integration of CAMtherapies with conventional medicine requires that practitioners and re-searchers be open to diverse interpretations of health and healing, to find-ing innovative ways of obtaining evidence, and to expanding the medicalknowledge base. EDUCATING FOR IMPROVED CARE Essential to conventional and CAM practitioners alike is education about the others ' field. Conventional professionals in particular need enough CAM-related training, the committee believes, so that they can counselpatients in a manner consistent with high-quality comprehensive care.Therefore the committee recommends that health profession schools (e.g., schools of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and allied health) incorporate suf-ficient information about CAM into the standard curriculum at the under-graduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels to enable licensed professionalsto competently advise their patients about CAM.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 9 Because the content and organization of an education initiative on CAM will vary from institution to institution, depending on the objectivesof each program, there is no consensus on what should be taught and howto fit it into an already crowded set of courses. At Brown University Schoolof Medicine, for example, the program includes didactic sessions in acu-puncture, chiropractic, and massage therapy and an elective clinical experi-ence; and variations exist at many of the other leading schools. Some ofthese initiatives have been aided by NCCAM 's education projects, which aim to develop new ways of incorporating CAM into health-professionalcurricula and training programs. CAM practitioners, for their part, need training that will enable them to participate as full partners and leaders in research so that studies mayaccurately reflect how CAM therapies are practiced. But many CAM insti-tutions do not have an infrastructure for research or the financial resourcesto develop them. Training in research has not traditionally been part ofCAM curricula, nor for the most part have practitioners ' careers been dependent on publishing research findings. CAM institutions focus prima-rily on training for practice. Strategic partnerships between CAM institutions, NIH, and health- sciences universities would help foster development of the necessary infra-structure; and NCCAM has already begun funding such partnerships. Inaddition, lessons can be learned from other fields, such as geriatrics andHIV/AIDS research, which have gone through processes relevant to CAM 's current need to develop qualified researchers. In geriatrics, for instance, theestablishment of centers of excellence at major academic health centers,foundation support for the development of curricula and partnerships, andcontinuing-education mechanisms such as summer institutes illustrate theimportance of using multiple strategies to create an environment in whichnew science has been able to flourish. The committee recommends that federal and state agencies, and private and corporate foundations, alone and in partnership, create models in re-search training for CAM practitioners. Furthermore, both CAM research and the quality of CAM treatment would be fostered by the development of practice guidelines \u2014what a 1992 IOM report defined as \"systematically developed statements to assist prac- titioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specificclinical circumstances. \" Key to guideline development is the participation of those who will be most directly affected. This means that CAM practitio-ners, possibly through their own professional organizations, should formu-late guidelines for their own therapies. The committee recommends that national professional organizations for all CAM disciplines ensure the presence of training standards and de-velop practice guidelines. Health care professional licensing boards and10 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE accrediting and certifying agencies (for both CAM and conventional medi- cine) should set competency standards in the appropriate use of both con-ventional medicine and CAM therapies, consistent with practitioners ' scope of practice and standards of referral across health professions. KNOWNS AND UNKNOWNS ABOUT CAM USE Prevalence estimates for CAM use range from 30 percent to 62 percent of U.S. adults, depending on the definition of CAM. Women are more likelythan men to seek CAM therapies, use appears to increase as education levelincreases, and there are varying patterns of use by race. Adults who un-dergo CAM therapies usually draw on more than one type, and they tend todo so in combination with conventional medical care \u2014though a majority do not disclose the CAM use to their physicians, thereby incurring the risk,for example, of potential interactions between prescription drugs and CAM-related herbs. Studies of specific illnesses have documented the popularityof CAM for health problems that lack definitive cures, have unpredictablecourses and prognoses, and are associated with substantial pain, discom-fort, or medicinal side effects. Existing surveys tell us little, however, about how CAM treatment is initiated (Does the patient unilaterally decide to use a therapy? Does aCAM or a conventional provider recommend the therapy?), and we havescant data about how the American public makes decisions about accessingCAM options. While there is an extensive literature on adherence to con-ventional treatment, there are virtually no data available on adherence toCAM treatment. This is an important issue given that any therapy, even ifefficacious, may place users at risk of harm, or cause them to experiencelittle or no effect, when used in the wrong way. Similarly, we have virtuallyno information about the extent to which the use of a CAM therapy mayinterfere with compliance in the use of conventional therapies, how people 's self-administration of CAM therapies changes over time, and the factorsthat influence such change. Moreover, there is little research on the public 's perceptions of infor- mation as alternatively credible, marginal, or spurious; how people under-stand such information in terms of risks and benefits; and what they expecttheir providers to tell them. Because the few small studies that have oc-curred suggest that considerable misinformation is dispensed by vendorsand on the Web, a closer monitoring of Websites, enhanced enforcement ofthe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act as well as of FederalTrade Commission regulations, and the creation of a user-friendly authori-tative Website on CAM modalities are needed. As a means of remedying the dearth of information noted above, the committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and otherEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 11 public or private agencies sponsor quantitative and qualitative research to examine: The social and cultural dimensions of illness experiences, health care-seeking processes and preferences, and practitioner-patient interac-tions; How often users of CAM, including patients and providers, adhere to treatment instructions and guidelines; The effects of CAM on wellness and disease-prevention; How the American public accesses and evaluates information about CAM modalities; Adverse events associated with CAM therapies and interactions between CAM and conventional treatments. Further, the committee recommends that the National Library of Medi- cine and other federal agencies develop criteria to assess the quality andreliability of information about CAM. We are in the midst of an exciting time of discovery, when evidence- based approaches to health bring opportunities for incorporating the bestfrom all sources of care, be they conventional medicine or CAM. Ourchallenge is to keep an open mind and to regard each treatment possibilitywith an appropriate degree of skepticism. Only then will we be able toensure that we are making informed and reasoned decisions.131 Introduction The widespread use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is of major importance to today's health care consumers, practitioners,researchers, and policy makers. For example, look at the following statis-tics on CAM: 42 percent of people in the United States report that theyhave used at least one CAM therapy: however, less than 40 percent ofthose using CAM disclosed such use to a physician. In 1997, an estimated15 million adults took prescription medications concurrently with herbalremedies or high-dose vitamins, bringing into play the possibility of nega-tive interactions. Total visits to CAM providers exceed total visits to allprimary-care physicians. Out-of-pocket costs for CAM are estimated toexceed $27 billion, which shows that CAM is now big business. Hospitals,managed care plans, and conventional practitioners are incorporatingCAM therapies into their practices. Medical schools, nursing schools, andschools of pharmacy are teaching their students about CAM. Informationabout CAM flows freely in various media: newspapers, magazines, books,pamphlets, and the Internet. Friends talk to friends about remedies forspecific problems. Just what is CAM? Who is using CAM, and why are they doing so? Are CAM therapies safe? Are they effective? These are just a few of the ques-tions surrounding the use of CAM by the American public. This chapterprovides a framework for thinking about questions related to CAM use,explores the definition of CAM, describes a taxonomy for thinking aboutvarious CAM modalities, provides an overview of recent events in thehistory of CAM use in the United States, and briefly describes CAM activi-14 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE ties currently under way at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). This chapter begins by setting the context for the committee 's consider- ation of CAM on the basis of a more general model of health care decisionmaking. CONTEXT Questions about CAM use arise at a time when providers of conven- tional medical care are being challenged as never before to examine theeffectiveness and efficiency of health care in the United States. The Instituteof Medicine 's (IOM 's) Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001) provides ample evidence for the underuse of effective care, the overuse of marginallyeffective or ineffective care, and the misuse of care, including preventableerrors, in its delivery. Widespread variation in rates of surgery and otherinterventions for common conditions among seemingly similar populationsin different geographic regions raises concern about how doctors and pa-tients make decisions. The Crossing the Quality Chasm report concludes that fragmentary, incremental change will be insufficient to reach achievable levels of qualityimprovement in American health care. Fundamental redesign will be re-quired, and the report offers 10 rules for redesign. Taken together, thesesuggestions advocate a systems-minded approach to making health caremore knowledge based and patient centered. This report is about CAM, not about the quality of conventional medi- cine or the way in which it is delivered. However, as will be seen, central tothe definition of CAM is that its constituent elements are \"other than \" conventional medicine. Therefore, an appreciation of both the strengthsand the limitations of conventional medicine, especially as perceived byCAM users in the United States, is necessary context for development ofconceptual models to guide public and private decision making about CAMresearch and practices. The principal conceptual model that the committee used to frame this report begins with the question, What do patients and health professionalsneed to know to make good decisions about the use of health care interven-tions, including CAM? Corollary questions for policy makers relate to theresearch necessary to support decisions as well as policies and resources toensure the quality and efficiency of services as well as equitable access. Themore general nature of the question and its corollaries, addressing healthcare interventions rather than CAM interventions alone, reflects thecommittee 's view that the decision-making needs of stakeholders in the American health care economy are equivalent for conventional and CAMhealth care services.INTRODUCTION 15 For the patient with symptoms or signs that diminish the quality of life or raise concerns about the length of life, answers to simple but compellingquestions are necessary for decision making. What is wrong? What willhappen if I do nothing: will things get better, worse, or stay the same? Whatare my treatment options, and what are the benefits and harms? What willthe experience of treatment feel like? How likely am I to benefit, by howmuch, and for how long? How likely am I to be harmed, in what way, andfor how long? Those who are well and want to stay that way by preventingpreventable illness ask similar questions. The best answers to these ques-tions come from a professional knowledge base that may be more or lesssupported by conclusive evidence relevant to the circumstances of the par-ticular patient at hand. When such evidence does exist and is effectivelymarshaled and communicated, the decisions and resulting care attain thegoal of being \"knowledge based. \" Good decisions depend on more than professional knowledge about treatment options and probabilities of outcomes. Different patients may bemore or less bothered by the same symptoms. They may react differently tothe experience of treatment itself and anticipate different reactions to thebenefits or the harms, or both. Furthermore, no matter how good theevidence, there is always some uncertainty about outcomes for the indi-vidual patient. Risks that are acceptable to some may be unacceptable toothers. Benefits or harms may be more or less likely to occur early or late,and patients ' willingness to make trade-offs between the two is variably influenced by the timing of the good versus the bad. When particular pa-tients ' attitudes and preferences are elicited and respected, decisions about treatment and prevention and the resulting care attain the goal of being\"patient centered. \" It has been argued that there is much unwarranted variation in medical practice because of failures related to management of the professionalknowledge base. In some cases the necessary research has not been done. Inothers, it is inaccessible to clinicians at the time that decisions are made.Evidence is also misinterpreted or inappropriately applied to a patient whois different from those whose experience provided the basis for the evi-dence. Furthermore, different clinicians have different understandings ofhow a profession knows what it knows and how the knowledge base isadvanced. These epistemological differences may be even greater amongusers of conventional and CAM interventions. Among clinicians who practice conventional medicine, there has been a marked shift over past decades from a reliance on professional experienceto a greater emphasis on more rigorous quantitative evidence derived fromrandomized trials and systematic reviews of multiple trials. These morerigorous approaches have more recently been used in investigations of CAM.However, among the heterogeneous interventions that comprise CAM, par-16 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE ticularly those that depend on variable practitioner approaches and the customization of interventions to individual patients, there are significantobstacles to use of the methods that have gained dominance in testing andadvancing the knowledge base for conventional medical practitioners. Despite the evident differences between conventional clinical practice and CAM, perhaps the most promising way to find common ground is toask the question, What kind of knowledge do people need to make goodhealth care decisions, and how can that knowledge be continuously testedand improved? This question provides the framework for considering theappropriate clinical and policy responses to the widespread use of CAM bythe American public. Furthermore, this framework is based on a set of ethical commitments that informed the work of the committee as it proceeded with its task.These commitments are explored in detail in Chapter 6: 1. a social commitment to public welfare, 2. a commitment to protect patients and the public,3. respect for patient autonomy,4. a recognition of medical pluralism, and5. public accountability. One of the first questions that the committee considered was, What is CAM? The following section explores this issue. DEFINITION OF CAM One of the difficulties in any study of CAM is trying to determine what is included in the definition of CAM. Does CAM include vitamin use,nutrition and diets, behavioral medicine, exercise and other treatmentsthat have been integrated into conventional medical systems? Should CAMinclude prayer, shamanism, or other therapies that may not be consideredhealth care practices? As discussed further in Chapter 6, the reasons fordefining modalities as \"CAM therapies \" are not only scientific but also \"political, social, [and] conceptual \" (Jonas, 2002). In the United States, some of the most frequently used and well-known therapies that are recog-nized as CAM are relaxation techniques, herbs, chiropractic, and massagetherapy (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Chiropractic, acupuncture, and massagetherapy are licensed in most states. Naturopathy and homeopathy arelicensed in fewer states. Numerous other therapies and modalities areconsidered unlicensed practices and at present few or no formal regula-tions apply to these therapies and modalities. The New York State Officeof Regulatory Reform and CAM has identified more than 100 therapies,practices, and systems that could be considered CAM (see Appendix A fora list of therapies).INTRODUCTION 17 A lack of consistency in the definition of what is included in CAM is found throughout the literature. The National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) of NIH defines CAM as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that arenot presently considered to be part of conventional medicine \" (NCCAM, 2002). However, many would argue that a therapy does not cease to be aCAM therapy because it has been proven to be safe and effective and is usedin conventional practice. \"Simply because an herbal remedy comes to be used by physicians does not mean that herbalists cease to practice, or thatthe practice of the one becomes like that of the other \" (Hufford, 2002:29). Descriptive definitions of CAM include one by Ernst et al. (1995), who write that CAM is a \"diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention which complements mainstream medicine by contributing to a common whole,satisfying a demand not met by orthodox, or diversifying the conceptualframework of medicine. \" Gevitz (1988) proposes that CAM includes \"practices that are not accepted as correct, proper, or appropriate or are not in conformity with the beliefs or standards of the dominant group ofmedical practitioners in a society. \" In 1993, Eisenberg et al. defined CAM as \"interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in hospitals. \" Kopelman (2002) argues that descriptive definitions such as those of- fered by Ernst et al. and Gevitz do not adequately answer the question,What is CAM? Definitions that place CAM outside the politically domi-nant health care system fail \"to offer a standard for differentiating conven- tional interventions and CAM other than by appealing to what is or is notintrinsic to the practices of the dominant culture. This assumes there is areliable and useful way to count cultures or subcultures and sort them intothose that are dominant and those that are not \" (Kopelman, 2002). Other descriptive definitions fail because conditions change, and therefore, de-scriptions of the conditions are no longer accurate. For example, look at thedefinition of Eisenberg and colleagues (1993), which states that CAM com-prises inteventions that are neither taught widely in medical schools norgenerally available in hospitals; however, more than half of all U.S. medicalschools provide education about CAM, health care institutions are offeringCAM services, and the numbers of insurers offering reimbursement forCAM therapies is growing (see Chapters 7 and 8). According to Kopelman, normative definitions (e.g., untested or unsci- entific) also fail to distinguish CAM from conventional medicine. For ex-ample, Angell and Kassier (1998) write \"there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not. \" However such a defini- tion does not distinguish between conventional medicine and CAM becausemany conventional treatments have not been supported by rigorous testing.For example, a review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews of the effective-ness of conventional biomedical procedures found that 20 percent showed18 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE no effect, whereas insufficient evidence was available for another 21 per- cent (Ezzo et al., 2001). Furthermore, \"some CAM manufacturers adopt higher standards than are currently required in the United States and rigor-ously test their CAM products \" (Kopelman, 2002). Stipulative definitions (i.e., lists of therapies) are not successful in dis- tinguishing CAM from conventional therapies, Kopelman argues, becausethey are not consistent from source to source and they provide no justifica-tion for the exclusion of therapies that are not included. Given the lack of a consistent definition of CAM, some have tried to bring clarity to the situation by proposing classification systems that can beused to organize the field. One of the most widely used classification struc-tures, developed by NCCAM (2000), divides CAM modalities into fivecategories: 1. Alternative medical systems, 2. Mind-body interventions,3. Biologically based treatments,4. Manipulative and body-based methods, and5. Energy therapies. As the name implies, alternative medical systems is a category that extends beyond a single modality, and refers to an entire system of theoryand practice that developed separately from conventional medicine. Ex-amples of these systems include traditional Chinese medicine, ayurvedicmedicine, homeopathy, and naturopathy. The second category in the NCCAM classification scheme is mind- body interventions, which include practices that are based on the humanmind, but that have an effect on the human body and physical health, suchas meditation, prayer, and mental healing. The third category, biologically based therapies, includes specialized diets, herbal products, and other natural products such as minerals, hor-mones, and biologicals. Specialized diets include those proposed by Drs.Atkins and Ornish, as well as the broader field of functional foods that mayreduce the risk of disease or promote health. A few of the well-knownherbals for which there is evidence of effectiveness include St. John 's wort for the treatment of mild to moderate depression and Ginkgo biloba for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment. An example of a nonherbal naturalproduct is fish oil for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions. The fourth category, manipulative and body-based methods, includes therapies that involve movement or manipulation of the body. Chiropracticis the best known in this category, and chiropractors are licensed to practicein every U.S. state. A defining feature of chiropractic treatment is spinalmanipulation, also known as spinal adjustment, to correct spinal jointINTRODUCTION 19 abnormalities (Meeker and Haldeman, 2002). Massage therapy is another example of a body-based therapy. The final category described by NCCAM is energy therapies which include the manipulation and application of energy fields to the body. Inaddition to electromagnetic fields outside of the body, it is hypothesizedthat energy fields exist within the body. The existence of these biofields hasnot been experimentally proven; however, a number of therapies includethem, such as qi gong, Reiki, and therapeutic touch. A different approach to classifying CAM modalities is a descriptive taxonomy that groups therapies according to their philosophical and theo-retical identities (Kaptchuk and Eisenberg, 2001). Practices are divided intotwo groups. The first group appeals to the general public and has becomepopularly known as CAM. This group includes professionalized or distinctmedical systems (e.g., chiropratic, acupuncture, homeopathy), popularhealth reform (e.g., dietary supplement use and specialized diets), New Agehealing (e.g., qi gong, Reiki, magnets), psychological interventions, andnonnormative scientific enterprises (conventional therapies used in uncon-ventional ways or unconventional therapies used by conventionally trainedmedical or scientific professionals). The second group includes practicesthat are more relevant to specific populations, such as ethnic or religiousgroups (e.g., Native American traditional medicine, Puerto Rican spiritis,folk medicine, and religious healing). This discussion of definitions shows that no clear and consistent defini- tion of CAM exists, nor is there a recognized taxonomy to organize thefield, although the one proposed by NCCAM is commonly used. Given thecommittee 's charge and focus, for the purposes of this report, the commit- tee has chosen to use as its working definition of CAM a modification ofthe definition proposed by the Panel on Definition and Description at a1995 NIH research methodology conference (Defining and describingcomplementary and alternative medicine, 1997). This modified definitionstates that Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems, modalities, and practices andtheir accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given histor- ical period. CAM includes such resources perceived by their users as asso-ciated with positive health outcomes. Boundaries within CAM and be- tween the CAM domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed. The committee chose this definition for several reasons. First, this broad definition reflects the scope and essence of CAM as used by the Americanpublic. Second, it avoids excluding common practices from the research20 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE agenda. The effect of such a broad definition means that all statements and recommendations made in this report will not apply equally to all CAMmodalities and there may even be some CAM modalities for which particu-lar statements do not apply at all. The third reason for choosing to defineCAM as stated above is that it is patient centered and includes practicesthat people perceive to have health benefits. Fourth, it encompasses thepotential for change. That is, this definition allows a therapy to be acceptedas standard practice when there is evidence of effectiveness but still allowsthe therapy to remain a part of CAM. Furthermore, the chosen definitionrecognizes that the definition of \"conventional \" medicine will vary from time to time and from country to country, it does not presume that provenpractices will be adopted, and it allows CAM to be evaluated over time. The next section of this chapter is devoted to describing milestones in the recent history of CAM in the United States. RECENT MILESTONES IN THE HISTORY OF CAM In 1992 the U.S. Congress established the Office of Unconventional Therapies, later changed to the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), toexplore \"unconventional medical practices. \" Two million dollars was ap- propriated, and OAM began to develop a baseline of information on CAMuse in the United States. Alternative Medicine: Expanding Medical Hori- zons was released in 1995 (Workshop on Alternative Medicine, 1995) and summarized the results of two workshops on CAM convened by OAM. Thereport (often referred to as the \"Chantilly Report \" because the workshops were held in Chantilly, Virginia, in 1992) examined six fields of alternativemedicine and addressed issues such as research infrastructure, researchdatabases, and research methodologies. Many of the recommendationsmade addressed research needs and opportunities. The report was signifi-cant because it was the result of the first NIH-sanctioned meetings held todiscuss the field of CAM as a whole. Responding to public and industry input, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) in 1994. DSHEA legallyestablished the term \"dietary supplement \" and decreed that supplements were to be regulated similar to foods. This distinction exempted manufac-turers from conducting premarketing safety and efficacy testing and elimi-nated the Food and Drug Administrations 's (FDA 's) premarketing regula- tory authority. In 1995, NIH funded the Research Centers Program toprovide a nationwide focus for interdisciplinary CAM research in academicinstitutions. Also in 1995, following a 1994 NIH and FDA workshop onacupuncture, FDA declassified acupuncture needles as an experimentalproduct. In 1996 the Public Information Clearinghouse on CAM was estab-lished and NIH sponsored the Consensus Conference on Acupuncture,INTRODUCTION 21 which provided evidence of the effectiveness of acupuncture for some con- ditions (e.g., dental pain and nausea). The first large, multicenter trial of a CAM therapy was cofunded in 1997 by OAM, the National Institute on Mental Health, and the NIHOffice of Dietary Supplements. The trial tested the effect of Hypericum (St. John's wort) for depression. By 1998 the use of CAM was widely discussed and hotly debated. A New England Journal of Medicine editorial (Angell and Kassirer, 1998) argued that \"It's time for the scientific community to stop giving CAM a free ride. There can not be two kinds of medicine \u2014conventional and alter- native. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicinethat has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may notwork. \" An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association contended that \"There is no Alternative Medicine. There is only scientifi- cally proven, evidence-based medicine supported by solid data or unproven medicine, for which scientific evidence is lacking \" (Fontanarosa and Lundberg, 1998). The American Medical Association devoted space to thetopic of CAM in its theme journals and published a total of 80 articles andthe results of 18 randomized trials. Included were editorials, descriptivearticles, systematic reviews, and results of randomized controlled trials. Forthe first time, CAM was addressed as a complex issue and journal editorswere willing to subject these articles to the same criteria and editorialreview as articles addressing topics in conventional medicine. Meanwhile, Congress, having increased the OAM budget from the original $2 million to $19.5 million, elevated OAM to the level of a na-tional center named NCCAM in 1998, awarded it $48.9 million for fiscalyear (FY) 1999, and required that NCCAM appoint CAM practitioners asmembers of its Advisory Council. In 1999, the Cancer Advisory Panel forCAM was established for the purpose of assessing clinical data related toCAM treatment of cancer and the first Dietary Supplements Research Cen-ter was funded jointly by NCCAM and the NIH Office of Dietary Supple-ments. NIH funded nine Centers for Research of Complementary and Al-ternative Medicine to conduct interdisciplinary research and training. Threemulticenter research studies were funded: one on Ginkgo biloba for the treatment of dementia (cofunded by NCCAM and the National Institute onAging), one on glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for the treatment ofknee osteoarthritis (cofunded by NCCAM and the National Institute ofArthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases), and one on acupuncturefor osteoarthritis of the knee (funded by NCCAM). Also in 1999 largepharmaceutical companies entered the CAM market with herbal productlines and other dietary supplements. Several major events occurred in 2000 and 2001. In March 2000, President Clinton created the White House Commission on Complemen-22 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE tary and Alternative Medicine Policy. The purpose of the commission was to \"study and report on public policy issues in the rapidly expanding field of complementary and alternative medicine. \" Furthermore, the commission was asked to report on \"legislative and administrative recommendations to assure that public policy maximizes the benefits to Americans of appropri-ate use of complementary and alternative medicine \" (Executive Order 13147, 2000). The commission 's report provided recommendations about research on CAM, education and training in CAM, CAM informationdissemination, delivery of CAM practices, coverage and reimbursement forCAM services, the potential role of CAM in wellness and health promotion,and the need for coordination of CAM-related efforts (WHCCAMP, 2002). The Federation of State Medical Boards began work on CAM guide- lines for physicians in 2000. The initiative was focused on \"encouraging the medical community to adopt consistent standards, ensuring the publichealth and safety by facilitating the proper and effective use of both conven-tional and CAM treatments, while educating physicians on the adequatesafeguards needed to assure these services are provided within the boundsof acceptable professional practice \" (FSMB, 2002). The federation 's House of Delegates approved the guidelines in April 2002. The Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine was launched in 2000 and by 2003 it had 22 member medical schools (seeAppendix B for a list of member centers). To become a member, either thedean or chancellor is required to commit to developing programs in re-search, education, and clinical delivery of CAM and the school must dem-onstrate an organized and robust program in two of those three areas. Themission of the consortium is \"to help transform medicine and healthcare through rigorous scientific studies, new models of clinical care, and innova-tive educational programs that integrate biomedicine, the complexity ofhuman beings, the intrinsic nature of healing and the rich diversity oftherapeutic systems \" (Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integra- tive Medicine, 2004). Skeptics of CAM had long contended that the only benefit derived from CAM therapies was due to a placebo effect, not \"real\" effects. In November 2000 NIH hosted a workshop, The Science of the Placebo:Toward an Interdisciplinary Research Agenda, thereby helping to placeplacebo in the category of a \"real\" effect. The August 2001 issue of Science published an article on basic science mechanisms of placebo (de la Fuente-Fernandez et al., 2001). These two events triggered expanded interestamong the neuroscience community in the study of the impact of nonspe-cific effects (e.g., expectation, context, belief) on clinical outcomes. Pla-cebo was no longer something to be discarded or dismissed but, rather,something to be studied.INTRODUCTION 23 Also in 2001, NCCAM and the National Library of Medicine devel- oped CAM on PubMed, a free, web-based access to journal citations di-rectly related to CAM. At present, almost 40,000 citations on CAM can befound on the PubMed website. Additionally, clinically significant adversedrug-herb interactions were documented in case studies (Fugh-Berman,2000), and St. John 's wort was shown to reduce the level of indinavir, a protease inhibitor taken by AIDS patients, in plasma (Piscitelli et al., 2000). In 2002, NCCAM launched its Intramural Program to explore CAM treatment strategies for patients at the NIH Clinical Center, the world 's largest facility dedicated to patient-oriented research. Also in that year, theU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs agreed to provide reimbursement forchiropractic care, the Annals of Internal Medicine began a special series on CAM (17 publications), and Science Xpress published an article on positron emission spectrometry, imaging of the placebo response versusthe response to opiod analgesics, thereby signalling continued interest inthe application of modern technology to the mechanistic study of placebo-related phenomena. NCCAM, whose budget had grown to $104.6 million in 2002, funded 10 international planning grants, and across NIH more than 200 researchprojects on CAM were ongoing. Also in that year, IOM established theCommittee on the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by theAmerican Public. In 2003, the first two Centers of Excellence for Researchon CAM were funded to increase scientific rigor in research on CAM. By2004 the NCCAM budget was $117.8 million. The following section explores in greater detail, the kinds of research and training efforts undertaken by NIH and the AHRQ CAM ACTIVITIES AT NIH AND AHRQ National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Twenty institutes and centers within NIH support ongoing CAM- related research, with NCCAM being the primary center for such research.According to the legislation creating NCCAM (P.L. 105-277), NCCAM 's mandate is the \"conduct and support of basic and applied research (intra- mural and extramural), research training, and [to] disseminate health infor-mation and other programs with respect to identifying, investigating, andvalidating CAM treatments, diagnostic and prevention modalities, disci-plines and systems. \" To achieve its mandate, NCCAM focuses on four primary areas: research, research training and career development, out-reach, and integration. To guide its research efforts, NCCAM develops program priorities through a semiannual formal review process. At present, its three priority24 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE areas are to elucidate the mechanisms of action and conduct small, well- developed Phase I and II studies; build infrastructure to support research atCAM institutions; and encourage collaboration between institutions thatprovide conventional medical therapies and those that provide CAM thera-pies (http://nccam.nih.gov/research/priorities/index.htm). The development of research centers is the main method used to pursue research. NCCAM 's CAM-related research centers can be placed into sev- eral categories: Dietary Supplement Research, Developmental Centers thatpartner institutions where CAM is practiced and those where conventionalmedicine is practiced, Centers of Excellence, Centers for CAM Research,and Exploratory Program Grants for Frontier Medicine Research. The es-tablishment of international centers for CAM research is also an initiativein development. Unlike the other centers at NIH, which invest about two-thirds of their research funding in basic research, NCCAM places the larg-est proportion of its resources in clinical research; the ratio of funding forclinical research to funding for basic research was 2.5:1 in FY 2003(NCCAM, 2004). An impressive number of patients are participating in NCCAM- supported clinical trials (10,708 participants in 2002), more than half ofwhom are in Phase III clinical trials. Research on prevention (e.g., researchdirected to such areas as dementia, prostate cancer, and myocardial infarc-tion) is another emphasis of NCCAM, as are studies on women 's health (e.g., research examining the effects of plant-based estrogens), research onreducing or eliminating health disparities, and age-related health research. In addition to increasing support for research project grants and re- search centers, since FY 1999 NCCAM has dramatically increased thefunding devoted to training, career, and curriculum awards (Straus, 2003).Such funds are consistent with NCCAM 's goal of increasing the number of skilled CAM researchers by making awards for CAM-related researchavailable to pre- and postdoctoral students, CAM practitioners, conven-tional medical researchers and practitioners, and members of underrepre-sented populations in scientific research (http://nccam.nih.gov/training/overview.htm). NCCAM also participates in a variety of outreach efforts. It maintains several outlets for both the public and the research community. TheNCCAM website (http://nccam.nih.gov/) provides detailed descriptions ofits ongoing activities as well as fact sheets about CAM, information onfactors related to decision making about treatments, cost and paymentquestions, and safety alerts and advisories. NCCAM also publishes a quar-terly newsletter containing updates on new and ongoing activities of thecenter. NCCAM also uses lectures, town meetings, and exhibits at scientificmeetings as opportunities to increase people 's awareness of CAM and the center.INTRODUCTION 25 In addition, NCCAM has established a clearinghouse, accessible by Internet and telephone in both English and Spanish, for people seekinginformation about CAM. The clearinghouse does not provide medical ad-vice but does disseminate scientifically based information on CAM. Twoother activities that assist with outreach are publications in peer-reviewedscientific journals, the number of which is increasing, and the developmentof the CAM on PubMed subsection of the National Library of Medicine 's MEDLINE database. One of NCCAM 's stated goals is to \"integrate scientifically proven CAM practices into conventional medicine \" (http://nccam.nih.gov/about/ aboutnccam/index.htm). Integration is an obvious extension of NCCAM 's investments in research, research training, and expanding outreach.NCCAM hopes to aid integration by publishing research results, investigat-ing ways in which evidence-based CAM practices can be integrated intoconventional medical practice, and supporting programs that develop mod-els for the incorporation of CAM into medical, dental, and nursing schoolcurricula. NCCAM is in the process of developing its second 5-year strategic plan, which will be released in January 2005. NCCAM plans to continuefocusing on research, research training, outreach, and integration and in-tends for its second strategic plan to provide greater specificity andprioritization within these areas. One can see from this discussion that NCCAM has an impressive and well-organized series of activities designed to advance the state of knowl-edge about CAM therapies and their use. NCCAM 's mandated focus is on CAM, however other centers and institutes within the NIH also have im-pressive portfolios evaluating CAM therapies. NCCAM established the 40-member Trans-Agency CAM Coordinating Committee in 1999 to fostercollaboration across these various institutes and other federal agencies in-volved with research on CAM. The following section describes some of theactivities of NIH institutes and centers. NIH Institutes and Centers As seen in Table 1-1, institutes and centers other than NCCAM collec- tively spend millions of dollars on CAM-related activities. The NIH insti-tutes and centers conduct research in partnership with each other andindependently, facilitating a broad scope of activity in both clinical andbasic research. There is ongoing research on the safety and efficacy of CAMpractices for disease treatment and prevention; mechanisms of therapiesincluding dietary supplements such as soy isoflavones and acupuncture;placebo effects; the role of spirituality in health; as well as animal studies ofalternative therapies for Parkinson 's disease. Table 1-1 displays the level of funding for CAM research by center or institute for the past few years.26 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE TABLE 1-1 CAM Funding by NIH Institute or Center Participating Institutes and Centersa1997 1998 1999 2000 NCI 2.2 28.2 36.6 43.0 NHLBI 5.9 5.6 2.8 4.1 NIDCR 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.6NIDDK 1.2 1.2 1.4 1.6 NINDS 4.3 5.8 5.3 4.6 NIAID 3.4 6.2 7.5 7.9NICHD 1.2 0.4 1.2 1.6 NEI 0.7 0.8 0.7 1.0 NIEHS 1.2 2.9 1.4 3.0NIA 2.8 3.3 3.1 6.0 NIAMS 0.2 2.2 0.2 0.3 NIMH 2.7 3.8 5.1 5.8NIDA 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.3 NIAAA 0.3 0.3 0.0 1.1 NINR 0.6 0.7 1.7 3.3NCRR 2.9 5.5 6.8 7.4 NCCAM \u2014 0.0 40.5 77.8 NCMHD \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014 FIC 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 OD 19.5 0.0 0.1 NIH 42.0 88.0 116.0 170.6 NOTE: Amounts are in millions of dollars per fiscal year.

Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine The Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) within the National Cancer Institute (NCI) develops and coor-dinates CAM activities related to cancer. OCCAM was established in 1998.Program efforts are divided among three areas: Research Developmentand Support Program, Practice Assessment Program, and CommunicationsProgram. The Research Development and Support Program funds research on CAM for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; CAM forcancer-related symptoms; and CAM modalities that can address the sideeffects of conventional treatment. Examples of recent activities include amethodology working group on research on cancer symptom managementby the use of CAM, the provision of competitive supplementary funds forINTRODUCTION 27 2004 2005 2001 2002 2003 Estimate Estimate 50.8 85.3 123.5 128.5 132.4 6.2 8.9 7.2 7.4 7.5 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.81.8 2.4 3.2 3.3 3.4 6.6 6.8 4.5 4.6 4.7 8.0 11.5 18.8 19.2 19.43.1 2.5 1.7 1.7 1.8 1.0 2.1 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.2 3.6 4.9 5.0 5.25.1 5.2 7.1 7.3 7.5 0.6 1.6 1.7 1.7 1.8 6.7 3.9 5.9 6.1 6.30.3 0.3 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.7 1.5 1.5 1.5 4.2 4.1 3.1 3.2 3.26.1 6.6 7.7 7.8 8.1 89.1 104.3 113.4 116.9 121.1 \u2014 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.8 0.8 16.7 0.2 5.6 4.8 4.9 212.9 252.9 315.5 325.0 334.9 SOURCE: NIH Office of the Director, Office of Budget, Budget Reporting and Legislative Branch.

NCI-designated cancer centers, and a workshop on how to write a grant to receive funding for research on cancer-related CAM modalities. The Practice Assessment Program has two primary objectives: (1) to evaluate potential therapies and assess whether future research is warrantedand (2) to build a dialogue between health practitioners and researchersabout CAM and cancer issues. The Practice Assessment supports the BestCase Series Program for groups of cancer patients treated with CAM thera-pies. Examples of best case series that have been completed are the Kelly-Gonzalez Regimen for pancreatic cancer and insulin potentiation therapyinvestigated by Steven Ayre. Lastly, the Communications Program develops and disseminates infor- mation about NCI activities and obtains feedback about interests and ob-stacles in CAM-related research on cancer. Like NCCAM, OCCAM spon-sors conferences, lectures, and expert panels to increase the quality andawareness of ongoing CAM-related research on cancer.28 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Office of Dietary Supplements The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) is part of the Office of NIH Director and was established in 1995 in response to a congressional man-date (DSHEA, 1994). Its mission is to \"strengthen knowledge and under- standing of dietary supplements by evaluating scientific information, stimu-lating and supporting research, disseminating research results, and educatingthe public to foster an enhanced quality of life and health for the U.S.population. \" ODS, unlike the NIH institutes and centers, cannot directly fund investigator-initiated research. However, it partners with the NIH insti-tutes and centers and government and private agencies to achieve its mis-sion by supporting research, sponsoring conferences, and disseminatinginformation. In January 2004, ODS released its 2004-2009 Strategic Plan,its second such plan, which contained five overarching goals related toresearch, information communication, and education. Although these goalshave been adopted for the second strategic plan, greater emphasis will beplaced on the use of emerging technologies, cross-disciplinary studies, train-ing and education of investigators, translation of research, and establish-ment of a process for regular evaluation of ODS programs and activities. In the last 5 years, ODS has initiated many efforts to improve the quality of research on dietary supplements. For example, ODS established aprogram to enhance analytical methodologies and develop standard refer-ence preparations of dietary supplements and also created two databasesthat are accessible to everyone: the Computer Access to Research on Di-etary Supplements database (CARDS) and the International BibliographicInformation on Dietary Supplements (IBIDS). CARDS contains informa-tion on federally funded dietary supplement research and is continuallyupdated. IBIDS provides access to bibliographic citations and abstractsfrom published, international, scientific literature on dietary supplements.An additional resource for the research community and general public areevidence-based review reports commissioned through a partnership betweenODS and NCCAM from AHRQ Evidence-Based Practice Centers. ODS, in various partnerships with NCCAM, the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, the Office of Research on Women 's Health, and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, funds six Centersfor Dietary Supplement Research. The centers emphasize botanicals andaim to identify and characterize these compounds, assess theirbioavailabilities and activities, explore their mechanisms of action, conductpreclinical and clinical evaluations, establish training and career develop-ment, and help select the botanicals to be tested in clinical trials.INTRODUCTION 29 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality The AHRQ, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Hu- man Services, is authorized to sponsor, conduct, and disseminate research to improve the quality and effectiveness of health care. AHRQ administersEvidence-Based Practice Centers (EPCs), which have produced evidence-based reports requested by other federal agencies on the effectiveness andsafety of a limited number of dietary supplements. The reports of the EPCsare based on a systematic analysis of the relevant scientific data and aredesigned to differentiate the types and strengths of a comprehensive body ofevidence. Nominations for clinical topics to be reviewed by an EPC are solicited through notices in the Federal Register . The clinical topics must meet spe- cific selection criteria including a high incidence; significance for the needsof Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health programs; high cost; contro-versy about their effectiveness; and the availability of scientific data. On thebasis of this process, reports on six dietary supplements 1 have been re- viewed as of October 2003. In addition to the evidence-based practicereports, AHRQ also funds investigator-initiated research and supports asmall number of grants for CAM-related research. The Institute of Medicine Study of CAM The previous pages have described the progress that has been made in evaluating and understanding CAM. Yet, numerous challenges remain tobe confronted as individuals seek to make decisions about the safety, effec-tiveness, and use of various CAM therapies and modalities. In September2002, NCCAM, 15 other NIH centers and institutes, and AHRQ commis-sioned the IOM to conduct a study on the use of CAM by the Americanpublic. Specifically, the study was to: 1. Describe the use of CAM therapies by the American public and provide a comprehensive overview, to the extent that data are available, ofthe therapies in widespread use, the populations that use them, and what isknown about how they are provided. 1The topics of the six reports are as follows: Antioxidant supplements for the prevention and treatment of cancer (October 2003); Antioxidant supplements for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (July 2003); Ephedra and ephedrine for weightloss and athletic performance enhancement (March 2003); S-adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe) for depression, osteoarthritis, and liver disease (August 2002); Garlic for CVD cardiovasculardisease (October 2000); and Milk thistle effects (September 2000).30 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2. Identify major scientific, policy, and practice issues related to CAM research and to the translation of validated therapies into conventionalmedical practice. 3. Develop conceptual models or frameworks to guide public- and private-sector decision making as research and practice communities con-front the challenges of conducting research on CAM, translating researchfindings into practice, and addressing the distinct policy and practice barri-ers inherent in that translation. Guidance was specifically sought on the following matters:Study the methodological difficulties in the conduct of rigorous research on CAM therapies and how these relate to issues in regulation andpractice, with exploration of options to address the identified difficulties. The shortage of highly skilled practitioners who are able to partici- pate in scientific inquiry that meets NIH guidelines and who have access tothe institutions where such research is conducted. The shortage of receptive, integrated research environments and the barriers to developing multidisciplinary teams that include CAM andconventional medical practitioners. The availability of standardized and well-characterized materials and practices to be studied and incorporated, when appropriate, intopractice. Existing decision-making models used to determine whether or not to incorporate new therapies and practices into conventional medicine,including evidence thresholds. Applicability of these decision-making models to CAM therapies and practices; that is, do they form good precedents for decisions relating toregulation, accreditation, or integration of CAM therapies? Identification and analysis of successful approaches to the incorpo- ration of CAM into health professions education. Impact of current regulation and legislation on CAM research and integration. IOM convened the Committee on the Use of Complementary and Al- ternative Medicine (CAM) by the American Public. Between February 2003and May 2004 the committee met seven times and held five information-gathering workshops, during which testimony was solicited from any indi-vidual wishing to provide input to the committee. Over the course of thisstudy the committee met and talked with representatives of various federalagencies, the CAM and conventional medicine communities, researchers,practitioners, educators, and patients. A liaison panel was convened withrepresentatives both from CAM practice communities and from the con-INTRODUCTION 31 ventional medicine community (Appendix D). The liaison panel met with the committee three times and provided critical input regarding many im-portant issues including major challenges, methodological issues (e.g., out-come concepts and measures), and factors facilitating or inhibiting commu-nication and cooperation across disciplines. Collectively, the committee read, summarized, and analyzed articles and other information on CAM therapies, evaluation of evidence, CAM-related decision making, education on CAM, and much more. The commit-tee commissioned a paper on methodological issues, which provided theinformation from which Chapter 4 was developed. The work of the com-mittee has been challenging yet rewarding. The results of that work arecontained in this report. REPORT CONTENTS This report identifies the major scientific, policy, and practice issues related to CAM. It explores what is known about the use of CAM, themethods and approaches used for CAM-related research, and how thisknowledge is being translated into practice. Finally, the report providesrecommendations to research and practice communities as they make deci-sions and confront the challenges of conducting research on CAM, trans-late the research findings into practice, and address the distinct policy andpractice barriers inherent in that translation. This chapter has provided the context within which this report was developed, the definition and description of CAM, and a brief history andthe present view of CAM-related activities under way at NIH and AHRQ.Chapter 2 describes what is known about the prevalence, cost, and patternsof use of CAM therapies and identifies the areas in which more informationis needed. A discussion of the approaches to the evaluation of evidence oftreatment effectiveness is presented in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 examines theneed for innovative designs in research on CAM. Chapter 5 explores theexisting evidence of the effectiveness for CAM and the gaps in that evidenceand describes a research framework for use in filling the gaps that havebeen identified. Chapter 6 presents an ethical framework for CAM re-search, policy, and practice. Chapter 7 reviews the growing integration ofCAM and explores why such integration is occurring, and Chapter 8 dis-cusses the education of both conventional practitioners and CAM practi-tioners. Chapter 9 focuses on dietary supplements, and Chapter 10 presentsthe conclusion of the report. For the body of the report, the committee reviewed a broad cross section of studies on use of CAM in clinical populations that were pub-lished in peer-reviewed journals. The list of studies was generated by aPubMed search covering the past 8 years plus all reviews of studies on32 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CAM use for particular health complaints and special populations. The committee did not seek to quantify such results as studies were carried outin different clinical settings using different procedures for data collection.CAM use in such settings was cited as common if such appeared to be thecase or was cited as illustrative as noted in the text. Table 2-1 and much ofthe content for Chapter 2 relies on an exhaustive review of those epidemio-logical studies of CAM use by the U.S. public which involved random,nationally representative samples that were published in the peer-reviewedmedical literature. Apart from those studies cited in Table 2-1, we are notaware of additional publications which meet these straightforward criteria. For report comments in the qualitative realm (e.g., reasons why differ- ent types of people use CAM \u2014Table 2-2) and those referring to individual populations (i.e., CAM use among population subgroups), publicationswere generated by (1) a PubMed search, (2) a search of major health socialscience journals covering the fields of anthropology, sociology, psychologyand geography, and (3) a library search of books and book chapters onCAM written by those holding advanced academic degrees and havingacademic positions in reputable U.S., Canadian, Australian, and Britishuniversities. Data on the range of motivations for using CAM was qualita-tive, and the committee made no attempt to quantify results. Data on thelack of studies on compliance/adherence with CAM was based on a PubMedsearch that went back 12 years. REFERENCES Angell M, Kassirer JP. 1998.

Washington DC: NIH.342 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use OVERALL USE The first nationally representative survey of prevalence, costs, and pat- terns of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) involved arandom sample of 1,539 adults who were interviewed by phone in 1990.That survey inquired about the use of 16 CAM therapies and reported thatone in three respondents (34 percent) had used at least one complementarytherapy during the past year to treat their most serious or bothersomemedical condition(s). It also found that those who saw providers for CAMtherapies made an average of 19 visits per year, that complementary thera-pies were used primarily for chronic conditions as opposed to acute or life-threatening conditions, and that CAM therapies were predominantly usedin addition to\u2014and not as replacements for\u2014conventional medical thera-pies. Importantly, it also found that 72 percent of CAM therapy users didnot inform their medical doctors that they used CAM (Eisenberg et al.,1993). Extrapolation of the results of the 1990 survey to the U.S. population suggests that in 1990 Americans made an estimated 425 million visits toproviders of complementary care. This number exceeded the number ofvisits to U.S. primary care physicians (388 million) and was associated withan annual expenditure of approximately $13.7 billion, three-quarters ofwhich ($10.3 billion) were paid out of pocket. This amount was compa-rable to the $12.8 billion spent out of pocket annually for all hospitaliza-tions in the United States. A national follow-up survey indicated a dramatic increase in CAM usePREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 35 by the American public between 1990 and 1997 (Eisenberg et al., 1998). (See Table 2-1 for a summary of the surveys of CAM use that have beenconducted.) Specifically: The prevalence of CAM use increased by 25 percent from 33.8 percent in 1990 to 42.1 percent in 1997. The prevalence of herbal remedy use increased by 380 percent. The prevalence of high-dose vitamin use increased by 130 percent. The total number of visits to CAM providers increased by 47 per- cent from 427 million in 1990 to 629 million in 1997. The total visits to CAM providers (629 million) exceeded the total number of visits to all primary-care physicians (386 million) in 1997. It was estimated that, in 1997, adults made 33 million office visits to professionals for advice regarding the use of herbs and high-dosevitamins. An estimated 15 million adults in 1997 took prescription medica- tions concurrently with herbal remedies or high-dose vitamins or both.These individuals are therefore at risk for potential adverse drug-herb ordrug-supplement interactions. If insurance coverage for CAM therapies increases in the future, current use of CAM services is likely an under-represention of future utili-zation patterns. Despite the dramatic increases in the rates of use and the expendi- tures associated with CAM services, the extent to which patients disclosedtheir use of CAM therapies to their physicians remains low. In both 1990and 1997, less than 40 percent of CAM therapy users disclosed to theirphysicians that they had used such therapies. Estimated expenditures for CAM professional services increased by 45 percent, exclusive of inflation. In 1997 such expenditures were esti-mated to be $21.2 billion. Out-of-pocket expenditures for herbal products and high-dose vi- tamins in 1997 were estimated to be $8.0 billion. Out-of-pocket expenditures for CAM professional services in 1997 were estimated to be $12.2 billion. This exceeded the out-of-pocket expen-ditures for all U.S. hospitalizations. Total out-of-pocket expenditures relating to CAM therapies were conservatively estimated to be $27.0 billion. This is comparable to theprojected out-of-pocket expenditures for all U.S. physician services. The study also found that among the respondents who in the past year had used CAM and seen their medical doctor, 63 to 72 percent did notdisclose to their doctor the fact that they had received at least one type ofCAM therapy.

Fewer respondents (14 percent) thought that their doctor would disapprove of or discourage CAM use, and just 2 per-cent thought that the doctor might not continue as their provider if thedoctor knew that the patient had received some sort of CAM therapy. Therespondents judged CAM therapies to be more helpful than conventionalcare for the treatment of headache and neck and back conditions, but theyconsidered conventional care to be more helpful than CAM therapy fortreatment of hypertension. Adults who use both CAM and conventionalmedicine appear to value both and tend to be less concerned about theirmedical doctors ' disapproval than they are about their doctors ' inability to understand or incorporate CAM therapy use within the context of theirmedical management (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Paramore (1997) analyzed data from a national database composed of survey data for 3,450 individuals. The survey indicated that in 1994 ap-proximately 10 percent of the adult population (25 million individuals) hadseen a professional for at least one of four CAM therapies: chiropractic,PREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 39 relaxation techniques, therapeutic massage, or acupuncture. The majority of those who sought professional care from CAM providers also saw amedical doctor during the reference year. The study also observed thatusers of CAM therapies made almost twice as many visits to conventionalmedical providers as non-CAM users. Astin (1998) conducted a mail survey of 1,035 randomly selected indi- viduals. Forty percent of those responding (response rate 69 percent) re-ported CAM use during the previous year. Another survey reported byDruss and Rosenheck (1999) investigated the association between the useof CAM therapies and the use of conventional care in a different nationalsurvey sample taken from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel survey.They reported that in 1996 an estimated 6.5 percent of the U.S. populationvisited both CAM providers and conventional medical practitioners. Fewerthan 2 percent used only CAM services, 60 percent used only conventionalcare, and 32 percent used neither. These numbers were considerably lowerthan the range reported by Eisenberg et al. (1998). The investigators con-cluded that, from the health services perspective, practitioner-based CAMtherapies appear to serve more as a complement than as an alternative toconventional medical care.Have you used any of the following 40% has used CAM in the past year forms of CAM (17 named) within 16.0% chiropractic the past year? 8.0% lifestyle diet 7.0% exercise7.0% relaxation In the last year, did you see a 6.8% chiropractic professional for one of four 3.1% therapeutic massage therapies? 1.3% relaxation techniques 0.4% acupuncture Have you ever used any of the Used in the last 12 months: following therapies (16 named) 34.0% at least one CAMto treat your principle medical 13.0% relaxation techniques conditions?

Ni et al. (2002)analyzed the data from the 1999 NHIS which included 30,801 respondentsand an oversampling of non-English speakers and those without telephones.A total of 12 types of CAM were asked about in the survey. Ni et al.documented a CAM use prevalence rate of 28.9 percent during the prior 12months. The investigators concluded that on the basis of these data in1999, CAM use was somewhat lower than that in previous surveys. MostCAM therapies were used in conjunction with conventional medical ser-vices, a finding consistent with prior observations. Lastly, the investigatorspointed out that the discrepancies in overall prevalence of CAM use maylargely result from the lack of agreement in the definitions of \"complemen- tary and alternative medicine. \" The lack of consensus regarding a definition as to what is or what is not to be included in the category of complementary and alternative medi-cine has unquestionably complicated efforts to document, in a consistentfashion, the prevalence, patterns, and costs of CAM use by the Americanpublic. Barnes and colleagues (2004) performed the most recent national analy- sis of CAM use using data from the 2002 NHIS. The survey included31,044 respondents, drawn from a nationally representative sample. The2002 survey expanded on the CAM-related questions asked in 1999, in-quiring about 27 types of CAM therapies, the condition being treated, thereasons for choosing a CAM therapy, whether insurance covered the CAMtherapy, the level of satisfaction with the treatment, and whether theindividual 's conventional medical practitioner knew about the patient 's CAM use. As with previous surveys, clearly defining CAM had a largeimpact on the prevalence results. When \"prayer for one 's own health \" was included in the definition, Barnes et al. found that 75 percent of adults hadever used CAM and that 62 percent of adults had used some form of CAMtherapy within the past 12 months. Excluding prayer from the definitiondecreased the rate of CAM use to 36 percent. The 2002 NHIS did not collect data about how much money is spent on CAM therapies, but it did report that 13 percent of CAM users choseCAM because conventional medicine was too expensive. The patterns of CAM use described above are all based on nationally representative random samples of the adult U.S. population. As such, theirresults are more generalizable than data obtained from smaller clinic- andcommunity-based surveys, which typically focus on specific health prob-lems and specific age cohorts (Bair et al., 2002; Davis and Darden, 2003;Lee et al., 2000a), ethnic groups or geographic areas (Cushman et al., 1999;Factor-Litvak et al., 2001; Greendale et Maskarinec et al., 2000;Najm et 2003; Vallerand et al., 2003), and special at-risk populations,PREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 41 such as homeless youth (Breuner et al., 1998). These smaller surveys, along with qualitative studies provide insights into the health-care seeking behav-iors of local populations. USE BY POPULATION SUBGROUPS Women The use of CAM therapies is more common among women (48.9 per- cent) than men (37.8 percent) (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Wootton and Sparber(2001a,b,c) also noted this trend in their review of surveys on CAM use, asdid Barnes et al. (2004) in their survey. The fact that women use CAMtherapies more commonly than men is noteworthy. Women 's greater use of health care services in general has been critically examined in the healthsocial science literature in relation to such variables as social class, longev-ity, patterns of morbidity, symptom reporting, psychosocial distress, andgender-based differences in health care provision (Bertakis et al., 2000;Gijsbers van Wijk et al., 1992; Macintyre et al., 1996; Mustard et al.,1998). Two observations are relevant. First, women tend to be more healthconscious than men leading them to invest more time and resources inpromotive and preventive health (Hibbard and Pope, 1983; Verbrugge andWingard, 1987). Second, women tend to serve as domestic health caremanagers influencing the health care behavior of family members, particu-larly when they are ill and at home (Barnett women 's use of CAM modalities may well serve as an indicator of probable family use of CAM in the future. Education and Income Eisenberg and colleagues (1998) found that CAM use was higher among those who had some college education (50.6 percent) than among thosewith no college education (36.4 percent) and was more common amongpeople with annual incomes above $50,000 (48.1 percent) than amongthose with lower incomes (42.6 percent). Foster et al. (2000), who exam-ined a different aspect of the database of Eisenberg et al. (1998), exploredthe relationship between income and CAM use. They observed that comple-mentary therapy use varied by income quartile (43 percent CAM use amongthose with annual incomes less than $20,000; 37 percent among thoseearning $20,000 to $30,000 per year; 44 percent among those earning$30,000 to $50,000 per year; and 48 percent among those with annualincomes above $50,000). In addition, the average annual out-of-pocketexpenditures increased with income quartile confirming that those with42 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE higher incomes used more CAM therapies overall. Interestingly, although the data indicating that CAM use appears to be highest among those withmore financial resources, the data also show that 43 percent of those in thelowest income group (those with incomes less than $20,000 per year) usedCAM therapies routinely, suggesting that CAM use is prevalent in all socio-demographic segments of society (Eisenberg et al., 1998). In the Astin (1998) survey, level of education was positively correlated with CAM use. Astin reported that 31 percent of survey participants with ahigh school education or less used CAM, and the rate of use increased to 50percent for participants with a graduate degree. Household income was nota predictive factor of use, and as in the analysis of Foster et al. (2000), Astinfound CAM use to be prevalent at multiple socio-demographic levels, rang-ing from 33 percent among those with incomes <$12,500 to 44 percentamong those with incomes >$40,000. Wootton and Sparber (2001) found that CAM users are primarily middle-aged, better educated, and in higher income brackets. However,they report that little is known about the rate of use among the less well todo since only a few small-scale studies of CAM use by low-income groupsexist. Their analysis of these small-scale studies found that 29 percent(n = 199) of patients on Medicaid in a family health center used CAM; 70percent (n = 157) of homeless young people in the Street Clinic youthprogram in Seattle, Washington, reported using CAM; and 56 percent(n = 187) of patients attending a family practice clinic reported usingherbs/supplements. For many types of CAM therapies, Barnes et al. (2004) found that the rate of use increased as the level of education increased. This pattern wasseen for biologically based therapies, alternative medical systems, energytherapies, and manipulative and body-based therapies. The analysis of CAMuse by income revealed an interaction between the type of therapy andincome. Individuals who were poor 1 exhibited a slightly higher prevalence of megavitamin therapy and prayer use than individuals who were not poor(65.5 and 62.6 percent, respectively). However, individuals who were notpoor reported higher rates of use of biologically based therapies (excludingmegavitamin therapy), mind-body therapies (excluding prayer), alternativemedical systems, energy therapies, and manipulative and body-based thera-pies than poor individuals. 1\"Poverty \" was defined by the Census Bureau 's 2001 thresholds. \"Poor\" was defined as an income below the poverty threshold, and \"not poor \" was defined as an income >200 percent of the poverty threshold.PREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 43 Ethnicity and Culture Eisenberg and colleagues (1998) found CAM use to be less common among African Americans (33.1 percent) than among members of otherracial groups (44.5 percent). In Wootton and Sparber 's 2001a review, Dominican patients in an emergency room reported 50 percent use ofCAM (n = 50); 94.6 percent (n = 75) of Chinese immigrants reported self-treatment and the use of home remedies; 62 percent (n = 300) of Navajosvisiting an Indian Health Service hospital reported that they had usednative healers; and 44 percent (n = 213) of Mexican Americans in a conve-nience sample reported that they had used herbal remedies, and 13 percentreported that they had used curanderismo . Mackenzie and colleagues (2003) further examined the prevalence of CAM use among many different ethnic groups in the United States. Theyanalyzed a subset of data from the 1995 National Comparative Survey ofMinority Health Care of The Commonwealth Fund, a national probabilitysample of 3,789 people with an oversampling of ethnic minorities. Thesurvey was conducted by telephone in six languages. The use of five catego-ries of CAM within the last year were queried (herbal medicine, acupunc-ture, chiropractic, traditional healer, and home remedy). Overall, 43.1 per-cent of the respondents reported using one or more of those five CAMmodalities. The use of CAM was equally prevalent among white, African-American/black, Latino, Asian, and Native American populations; but thecharacteristics of the users varied considerably by specific CAM modality.The predictors of CAM use were female gender, being uninsured, andhaving a high school education or above. These factors were consistentwith earlier surveys involving random samples of all U.S. adults. Ni and colleagues (2002) found that overall CAM use was higher for white non-Hispanic individuals (30.8 percent) than for Hispanic (19.9 per-cent) and black non-Hispanic (24.1 percent) individuals. Like the findingsof Mackenzie et al. (2003), the 2002 NHIS (Barnes et al., 2004) foundvarious patterns of use by race, depending on the type of CAM therapy. Useof mind-body therapies including prayer for health reasons was more preva-lent among black adults (68.3 percent) than among white (50.1 percent) orAsian (48.1 percent) adults. However, Asian adults (43.1 percent) weremore likely to use CAM (excluding megavitamin therapy and prayer) thanwhite (35.9 percent) or black (26.2 percent) adults. Finally, white adults(12 percent) were more likely to use manipulative and body-based therapiesthan Asian (7.2 percent) or black (4.4 percent) adults. It may be, however, that surveys of minority cultures underestimate health practices such as the use of home remedies since in many cultures,the consumption of foods (including commonly used herbs and spices) formedicinal purposes is so engrained in everyday folk dietetic practices that it44 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE is not recognized as being out of the ordinary or worth reporting. The same may be true for religious-spiritual practices, which serve multiple purposesand which may be reported only under extraordinary circumstances andnot as routine ways of coping with adversity or ensuring well-being. Thereis often a fine line between what members of a minority culture deemnormative practice and what outsiders classify as CAM practice. In largesurveys with representative samples, there is a need for better, more cultur-ally sensitive questions that will provide more accurate data about CAMuse among minority populations. Age In earlier surveys, people aged 35 to 49 years reported higher rates of CAM use (50.1 percent) than people either older (39.1 percent) or younger(41.8 percent) (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Recently, the 2002 NHIS resultsindicate that CAM use increases with age. Barnes et al. (2004) found that53.5 percent of the individuals in the youngest age bracket (18 to 29 years)reported that they had used some type of CAM 2 and the greatest prevalence of CAM use (70.3 percent) was found among those in the oldest age bracket(85 years and older). Wootton and Sparber 's (2001a) review found that the rate of CAM use among elderly individuals ranged from 33 percent of aconvenience sample of elderly patients with cancer (n = 699) to 84 percentof a convenience sample of elderly rural women. Foster et al. (2000), usingthe data of Eisenberg et al. (1998), measured the prevalence, cost, andpatterns of CAM use by people aged 65 or older. They observed that duringthe previous 12 months 30 percent had used at least one type of CAMtherapy for the treatment of their principal medical conditions. The comple-mentary modalities most commonly used by individuals aged 65 and olderused were chiropractic, herbal remedies and dietary supplements, relax-ation and meditation techniques, and high-dose vitamins. As was the casefor the general population, the majority of older adults who used CAMservices made no mention of this to their physician. Fewer studies have examined the use of CAM by children. Davis and Darden (2003) analyzed a 1996 nationally representative survey of Ameri-can children and reported a prevalence rate of 1.8 percent. Among CAMusers, 76.8 percent were white and 54 percent were female. CAM useincreased with age, with older children (ages 10 to 17 years) accounting for62.6 percent of the use, but the youngest children (ages 0 to 4 years)representing only 21 percent. The investigators noted that the overall esti-mate of CAM use was lower than that reported in previous surveys and 2CAM use included megavitamin therapy and prayer.PREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 45 discussed possible explanations. Like other national surveys, CAM is not defined consistently among surveys. This particular survey asked whether aCAM provider was consulted in the previous year, which does not take intoaccount the use of self-prescribed therapies, such as dietary supplements. TYPES OF ILLNESS Studies of the use of CAM for the treatment of specific illnesses have documented the popularity of CAM for the treatment of health problemsthat lack definitive cures; that have an unpredictable course and prognosis;and that are associated with substantial pain, discomfort, or side effectsfrom prescription drug medicine. For example, back pain/back problemwas the most common condition (16.8 percent) identified in the 2002NHIS (Barnes et al., 2004). CAM use has been identified as particularlycommon among women suffering from the symptoms of menopause (Beal,1998; Cherrington et al., 2003; Kronenberg and Fugh-Berman, 2002) andpregnancy-related illnesses (Tiran, 2002), gynecology problems (von Gruenigen et al., 2001), rheumatology (Rao and Krouse, 1999), attention and hyperactivity problems (Chan et al., 2003) , psychiatric and neurological problems (Sparber and Wootton, 2002), cancer (Adler, 1999; Bernsteinand and Lee 2002; Lee al., 2000b; Lengacher et al.,2002; Patterson et 2002; Richardson Sparber Wilkinson et Zimmerman et al., 1998; Wootton and Sparber, 2001b), asthma(Braganza et al., 2003), and disabilities (Krauss et al., 1998). Still otherstudies have examined the prevalence of patients who use CAM in varioustypes of nonspecialty clinics such as pediatric clinics (Davis and Darden,2003; Madsen et al., 2003; Sawni-Sikand et al., clin- ics (Gordon et al., 1998; Kitai et al., 1998), maternity practices (Hepner etal., 2002), emergency rooms (Gulla and Singer, 2000; Rogers et al., 2001;Weiss et al., 2001), and postsurgery clinics (Norred et al., 2000). Onereason for conducting such studies has been to identify possible CAM-conventional medicine interactions, especially in cases in which it is vital toa patient 's well-being to know of medications that may interfere with such things as blood clotting time when surgery is being performed (Allaireet al., 2000; Hepner et al., 2002) or with other conventional practicesthat have been taken or have been prescribed by CAM practitioners ormidwives. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive but, rather, representa-46 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE tive of the range of studies that have used various sampling techniques and that have been performed with particular U.S. patient populations over thepast decade. These surveys confirm the impression that a significant per-centage of individuals with chronic or life-threatening illnesses are usingCAM at some point during the course of their illness. More difficult to discern are an individual 's reasons for using a CAM modality at a particular point in time over the course of an illness. Onecannot tell from survey data whether those surveyed used a CAM modalityprimarily for curative purposes or primarily for a specific health problem,as a means of reducing the side effects from other types of therapy, or forgeneral health-promoting purposes. Nor can it be determined which type oftherapy (conventional or CAM) was sought first. It is worth noting that formany of the chronic conditions listed above, management of patients ' health care needs includes but extends beyond the management of overt symptomsassociated with the disease. The importance of this observation may beconsidered in light of studies on health care expenditures associated withchronic disease. It has been estimated that more than 45 percent of noninsti-tutionalized Americans have one or more chronic conditions and theirdirect health care costs account for 75 percent of U.S. health care expendi-tures (Hoffman et al., 1996). Using a nationally representative sample of 23,230 U.S. residents, Druss et al. (2001) calculated that half of U.S. health care costs in 1996 wereborne by persons with one or more of five conditions: mood disorders,diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and hypertension. Notably, of that amount,only about one-quarter was spent on treating the conditions themselves; theremainder was spent on treating coexistent illnesses and health care prob-lems. Those researchers pointed out that each condition was associatedwith unique patterns of health service use driving those costs. This findinghighlights the need for a better understanding of what motivates patientswith chronic complaints to seek both CAM and conventional medical ser-vices and the cost implications of combined care. In other words, doesutilization of CAM reduce or increase the costs of health care for peoplewith different types of chronic conditions? FREQUENCY OF USE Wolsko and colleagues (2002), using the database of Eisenberg et al. (1998), evaluated the extent to which high-frequency users of CAM con-tributed to the total number of visits to CAM providers. Notably, theyfound that individuals who saw conventional health care providers morefrequently were also the most apt to use complementary care services.Conservative extrapolation to national estimates suggested that a smallfraction of U.S. adults (8.9 percent) accounted for 20 percent of CAM usersPREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 47 but that they made more than 75 percent of the 629 million visits to CAM providers. These data parallel observations that a large percentage of theannual U.S. health care budget is routinely consumed by a relatively smallpercentage of the U.S. population. CAM services can and should be viewedsimilarly. Notably, however, high-frequency users of biomedicine and high-frequency users of CAM appear to use these modalities for different pur-poses. Additionally, Druss and Rosenheck (1999) point to a differencebetween these two populations of high-frequency users: psychiatric disor-ders are prominent among the high-frequency users of conventional medi-cine, but the researchers found no such correlate among high-frequencyusers of CAM modalities. Wolsko and colleagues (2002) also examined the extent to which insur- ance coverage was independently associated with CAM therapy use. Theyfound that for individuals who sought the services of practitioners whoperformed physical manipulation (e.g., chiropractors and massage thera-pists), full insurance coverage, partial insurance coverage, and the use of thetherapy for wellness were all associated with the high-frequency use of suchproviders. Among the survey respondents using the services of CAM pro-viders, 63 percent of those reporting that they had full insurance coveragemade eight or more visits to a CAM practitioner during the previous year.Only 17 percent of those reporting that they had no insurance coveragemade eight or more visits. For CAM therapies which were not related tophysical manipulation (e.g., relaxation therapy and advice regarding herbssupplements), the only factor associated with high-frequency provider usewas having used the therapy for wellness. Having any insurance coverage, itappears, is associated with higher rates of use of CAM therapy services.Rates of insurance coverage for CAM services varies significantly by state,treatment plan, and CAM modality (Tillman, 2002). The services of chiro-practors are covered by between 41 and 65 percent of health maintenanceorganizations (HMOs), the services of homeopaths are covered by 4 to 11percent of HMOs, acupuncture is covered by 9 to 19 percent of HMOs,and massage therapy is covered by 6 to 10 percent of HMOs (Stanger andCoughlan, 2000). Depending on the therapy, Eisenberg et al. (1998) alsofound various rates of partial and full coverage, with only four modalities(chiropractic, megavitamins, imagery, and biofeedback) receiving some formof coverage more than 50 percent of the time. LONG-TERM TRENDS IN CAM USE What are the long-term trends in CAM use likely to be and how do they differ from the trends experienced earlier in history? Kessler and colleagues(2001) analyzed the same dataset obtained by Eisenberg et al. (1998) intheir 1997 survey, but focused on questions about first-time use of CAM48 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE therapies by all individuals aged 18 and older. They observed that 68 percent of all respondents had used as least one CAM therapy during thecourse of their lives. Lifetime use steadily increased with age across all agecohorts. Specifically, individuals in the pre-baby boom cohort (i.e., olderthan age 58 years at the time of the survey) had a 30 percent incidence ofCAM therapy use by the age of 33; 5 of 10 baby boomers had used one ormore CAM therapies by age 33, and 7 of 10 individuals born after the babyboom reported the use of some type of CAM therapy by age 33. It was alsonoted that prior use of any CAM therapy was an excellent predictor ofcurrent use. Among the respondents who had ever used a CAM therapy,roughly half continued to use a CAM therapy many years later (during theinterval of the survey). These analyses also documented the fact that the rate of use of all but 4 of the 20 most commonly used complementary therapies increased in fre-quency beginning in the 1960s. During the decades of the 1970s, 1980s,and 1990s, the use of particular CAM therapies increased at higher ratesthan the use of others. For instance, the 1970s witnessed large increases inthe rates of use of herbal medicine, imagery, energy healing and biofeed-back, whereas in the 1980s the rates of use of massage therapy and natur-opathy increased most rapidly. Kessler and colleagues (2001) mention that \"from an historical per- spective, data from 1998 may not necessarily represent a consistent trend ofincreased use of CAM therapies, but rather a distinct peak in a long trend ofconstant fluctuation in complementary and alternative medicine use by theAmerican public. \" They refer to previous peaks of CAM use such as survey data from the 1920s and 1930s indicating high rates of use of \"unconven- tional \" therapies and government statistics from 1900 documenting large numbers of registered \"alternative \" practitioners. Kessler et al. conclude that the recent high rates of CAM use may in fact be demonstrating aresurgence of CAM use after a period of diminished use during the 1940sand 50s. Even so, use of CAM therapies in recent years by a large propor-tion of the U.S. population is seen as a result of a historical trend that beganat least 50 years ago. Moreover, this trend suggests a continuing demandfor CAM therapies that will affect health care delivery for the foreseeablefuture. Other factors associated with CAM therapy use that further this hy- pothesis include the observation that CAM therapies are used predomi-nantly for the treatment of chronic disease, which, as mentioned above,accounts for an increasing fraction of the U.S. healthcare burden (Astin,1998). In addition, an estimated one-third of CAM therapy use is attributedto disease prevention and health promotion (Eisenberg et al., 1993, 1998).These patterns parallel trends in U.S. society to promote disease preventionand to encourage health promotion, especially among those in the babyPREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 49 boom generation, 50 percent of whom already use CAM therapies, usually in the absence of a chronic or a disabling disease. As such, CAM use is quitelikely to increase in the coming quarter century as the baby boom genera-tion experiences greater disease burdens. Lastly, the observation that 7 of10 individuals born after the baby boom generation routinely use CAMtherapies by the age of 33 (Kessler et al., 2001) suggests that the U.S. publicincreasingly views CAM therapies as accessible options and \"conventional \" lifestyle choices that can no longer be viewed as entirely \"alternative \" practices. COST-EFFECTIVENESS CAM therapies are typically not centered on high-technology interven- tions and instead include low-cost treatments. This is often offered in sup-port of the idea that CAM may provide more cost-effective treatments thanconventional medicine. However, some CAM interventions involve moretime with a practitioner, which may be costly (White and Ernst, 2000).Despite the claim that CAM is more cost-effective, there is not a large bodyof literature that explores the question of cost. White and Ernst (2000)conducted a review of cost description, cost comparison, cost-effectiveness,and cost-benefit studies. The studies in the articles reviewed tended to taketwo general approaches: evaluation of the cost of a specific therapy andhealth condition and examination of overall effects, such as rates and totalhealth care costs. With a few exceptions, White and Ernst did not find arigorous body of economic analyses for CAM. They offer several explana-tions, including the \"intangible and indirect \" benefits of CAM, such as patient preference, patient empowerment, and quality of life, as well as thecumulative benefits conveyed through lifestyle changes. Since the review of White and Ernst (2000) was published, a few more economic evaluations of CAM have been published. Sobel (2000) reviewedfour examples of mind-body interventions that demonstrated beneficialeffects on health and cost-savings for heart disease, chronic disease, sur-gery, and prematurity among infants. For chronic low back pain, Cherkinet al. (2001) compared the effectiveness of acupuncture, massage, and self-care education. At the 1-year follow-up, patients randomized to receivetherapeutic massage reported fewer symptoms than acupuncture recipients,and massage recipients used fewer medications than the other two groups.Finally, follow-up costs for outpatient HMO back care were lower for themassage group than for the acupuncture or the education group, althoughthe difference was not statistically significant. An important limitation ofthis study was the lack of a no-treatment comparison group. The treatment of chronic headaches with acupuncture was the subject50 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE of a recent randomized clinical trial and cost-effectiveness analysis by Wonderling and colleagues (2004) in the United Kingdom. Compared withusual care, acupuncture increased both quality-adjusted life years 3 and health care costs. However, the investigators noted that the cost increase isless than that of another National Health Service-recommended medicationfor the treatment of migraine headaches. A second randomized controlledtrial paired with an economic analysis, conducted in The Netherlands,examined the treatment of neck pain with physiotherapy, manual therapy,and general practitioner care (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2003). At 26 weeks,manual therapy led to a faster recovery. Additionally, at the 1-year follow-up, the analysis showed that manual therapy (i.e., spinal mobilization) costless and was more effective than physiotherapy (i.e., mainly exercise) orgeneral care (i.e., counseling, education, and medication). It should be em-phasized that few studies of the cost-effectiveness of CAM therapies havebeen undertaken. WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO USE CAM Survey techniques are useful for finding out the personal and demo- graphic characteristics of people who have tried CAM modalities, the pointprevalence rate of people who have used CAM over specified periods oftime (ever, last year, etc.), how much they have spent on these modalities,where they have received therapy (if they saw a CAM practitioner) or ifthey have engaged in self-treatment, and whether they have informed theirconventional medical doctor that they are using CAM therapies or modali-ties (or whether they have informed their CAM practitioner that they arereceiving biomedical treatments). They are far less useful as a means ofproviding information about people 's motivations for using CAM therapies or modalities, given that rationale and rationalization are hard to teaseapart on a survey and given that the reasons for using CAM use changeover time, are complex, and are multidimensional. A wide variety of motivations for using CAM have been reported in the literature dispelling any simple characterization of why the American pub-lic uses CAM therapies and modalities. Table 2-2 identifies many of themotivations for the use of CAM that have been identified in the health,social science, and CAM Kelnerand al., 1993; Mitchell and Cormack, 1998; 3\"Quality-adjusted life years integrate mortality and morbidity to express health status in terms of equivalents of well-years of life \" (Kaplan, 1988).PREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 51 et al., 2002). An important finding noted by Wolsko et al. (2002) was that among the 2,055 study participants, the pursuit of wellness was a major contribu-tor to CAM use. Those who used CAM for wellness purposes frequentedCAM providers more often than those who did not. Other researchers havealso noted that interest in health promotion and disease prevention appearsto be a motivating force driving CAM use (Astin, 1998). Research suggeststhat obtaining \"wellness care \" from conventional and CAM providers is important to CAM users. Druss and Rosenheck (1999) found that adultswho visit both CAM providers and conventional providers are more likelythan individuals who seek care only from conventional providers to reportthat they monitor their blood pressure and cholesterol levels and undertaketimely prostate and breast cancer screenings. Astin and colleagues (2000) surveyed enrollees in a Medicare supple- ment plan offering benefits for selected CAM therapies and found that themost frequently cited reason for CAM use was \"general health improve- ment \" (42 percent), whereas CAM use for \"chronic medical problems \" was cited by only 18 percent of those surveyed. These findings are consistentwith the findings of Eisenberg et al. (1993, 1998), who documented that 58percent of those surveyed used CAM therapies, at least in part, to \"prevent future illness from occurring or to maintain health and vitality, \" whereas only 42 percent of those surveyed used CAM exclusively to treat an existingdisease. The 2002 NHIS asked participants about their reasons for using CAM. For any type of CAM, 54.9 percent believed that CAM therapy combinedwith conventional medical treatments would help, 50.1 percent thoughtthat CAM would be interesting to try and 25.8 percent indicated that CAMuse was suggested by a conventional medical professional. Alternatively,27.7 percent believed that conventional medical treatments would not help,and 13.2 percent believed that conventional medical therapies were tooexpensive (Barnes et al., 2004). Once a patient begins to use CAM therapies, however, how likely is the patient to continue to use them? Cross-sectional surveys carried out aftertime lapses of some years allow investigators to speculate about continueduse for some purpose, be it health promotion, the treatment of periodicillness, or the management of a chronic illness or disability. Kessler et al.(2001) found that 50 percent of all CAM therapy use that had been initi-ated at least 5 years prior to the interview (Eisenberg et al., 1998) persistedat the time of the interview. This suggests that prior use of CAM therapy isa predictor of ongoing or current use for half of all users. The data alsosuggest that the persistent use of CAM therapies and modalities may berelated to general health and may not be reserved only for the treatment of52 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE TABLE 2-2 Reasons Why Different Types of People Use CAM Modalities at Different Points in Their Lives Reasons for Using CAM or User User Characteristic Experimenter open to new experience Try and see, nothing to lose, may just help attitude Those heavily influenced by the Responds to the health claims of CAM commodification of health no differently from the response to other health products;

This is consistent with the findings of Astin (1998) that most CAM therapies are used, at least in part, to preventfuture illness or to maintain health and vitality as part of lifestyle choiceslinked to disease prevention and health promotion. Further investigation into the association between the use of CAM modalities and wellness-related behavior is warranted given national publichealth priorities and the burden of lifestyle-related diseases (DHHS, 2000).What remains unknown is the extent to which different types and levels ofCAM use foster or sustain behavioral changes contributing to positivehealth outcomes. CAM use may be a marker of \"packages \" of lifestyle changes associated with shifts in identity, or it may constitute little morethan an attempt at harm reduction engaged by those who wish to minimizethe negative effects of an unhealthy environment, job, or lifestyle (Nichter,2003). Data on wellness from existing cross-sectional surveys point out theneed for long-term longitudinal cohort studies examining large numbers ofadults who are routinely asked questions about CAM use as well as diet,exercise, smoking, etc. Such studies, reminiscent of the Framingham HeartStudy or the Nurses ' Health Study (both of which are ongoing and which could, conceivably, be expanded to include questions about CAM use) mayoffer the best opportunity to explore patterns of CAM use over time as wellas the role \u2014or lack thereof \u2014of CAM in promoting health, reducing risk, and preventing disease. One hypothesis for why people use CAM is that they are dissatisfied with conventional care. The literature suggests that this is not most user 'sPREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 55 primary reason for CAM use (Astin, 1998; Barnes et al., 2004; Eisenberg et al., 2001). Users of CAM often use CAM modalities simultaneously withconventional medicine when they are ill. They typically (70 percent) useCAM subsequent to or simultaneously with the use of conventional medi-cine, and 79 percent of respondents who saw a medical doctor and usedCAM therapies perceived the combination to be superior to either onealone (Eisenberg et al., 2001). A second hypothesis is that CAM usersmaintain health beliefs different from those of other people, but an answerto this question will require investigation of health perceptions before andafter CAM use to determine whether users sought CAM modalities on thebasis of their health ideology or underwent transformational experiences. Astin (1998) conducted the only national survey on personal factors that predispose individuals to use CAM. He found that higher levels ofeducation, a transformational experience that changed one 's world view, a holistic health philosophy, and interest in alternative lifestyles were deter-minants of CAM use. Other studies have also documented an associationbetween CAM use and a holistic (e.g., New Age) health philosophy(Easthope et al., 2000; Furnham and Forey, 1994; Pawluch et al., 2000;Sharma, 1993). Although embracing such a philosophy is undoubtedly afactor related to sustained CAM use by many people, it is most likely notthe initial motivation for many others to seek care from CAM practitionersor to use CAM-related resources (Kelner and Wellman, 1997). The research summarized in Table 2-2 suggests that people seek CAM modalities for a wide variety of reasons. Some of those attracted to CAMmodalities seek a therapeutic relationship with a practitioner in which theyhave the opportunity to more fully participate in their own health caredecision making (Mitchell and Cormack, 1998). For example, cancer pa-tients vary considerably in their preference for participation in decisionmaking. While some of those who wish to share responsibility for care findpreferred relationships with practitioners of conventional medicine, manyothers do not (Arora, 2003). Many who use CAM as supplementary caredo so as a way of avoiding passivity and coping with feelings of hopeless-ness. It might be more productive to investigate the extent to which theseindividuals are simply trying to marshal all resources at their disposal to-ward the end of securing optimal health care, a concept that is relative andsubject to interpretation in accord with a patient 's needs and expectations. For many people, all forms of health care are options, alternatives to be exploited in an everexpanding health care arena subject to market forces,scientific evolution, and the vagaries of public opinion. Many CAM usersaccess different forms of health care from different places with limited ifany coordination between practitioners or knowledge being shared aboutthe eclectic therapies used or medicines taken. Lack of coordination is farfrom ideal. Research needs to address the multiple factors motivating health56 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE care seeking in the pluralistic health care arena that exists at present and the use of eclectic health care resources by the American public. One problem with general characterizations of why people use CAM is that such representations overlook different motivations for initiating CAMand sustaining CAM use over time. They also generate stereotypes aboutCAM and conventional practitioners that are simplistic and not borne outby the evidence. Figure 2-1 summarizes information from a nationally rep-resentative sample on how dual users of CAM and conventional medicinecompare these two broad types of health care and their interactions withboth types of care providers. Figure 2-1 depicts a very mixed picture of howusers of CAM feel about their practitioners (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Motivations for using CAM change over time and are influenced by many potentially important intervening variables: frustrations with existingtherapies, a desire to try something new, changes in the meaning that oneattributes to one 's ailment, changes in self-identity associated with CAM use, the economics of receiving care, and the feedback that one receivesfrom significant others who form an individual 's therapy management sup- port group. The user types highlighted in Table 2-2 represent a heuristic.Real users of CAM are likely to approximate different ideal types at differ-ent points in their lives as well as to be influenced by multiple motivationsto use CAM at any one time. Sirois and Gick (2002) have recently called for a more sophisticated way of looking at CAM users that does not treat them as a homogeneousgroup with similar beliefs, motivations, and needs and that attends to howtheir behaviors change over time. They conducted one of the few studies toexplore differences in the reasons for using CAM among two groups ofCAM users, defined by the length and frequency of CAM use, and a com-parison group of users of conventional medicine. New or infrequent CAMusers, established CAM users, and users of conventional medicine weredistinguished on the basis of health beliefs and sociodemographic, medical,and personality variables. Different patterns of predictors of CAM use forthe different groups emerged. In general, health-aware behaviors and dis-satisfaction with conventional medicine were the best predictors of overalland initial or infrequent CAM use, while more frequent health-aware be-haviors were associated with continued CAM use. Medical need also influ-enced the choice to use CAM and was the best predictor of committedCAM use, with the established CAM users reporting more health problemsthan the group of new or infrequent CAM users. An openness to newexperiences was associated with CAM use, most notably in the decision toinitially try or explore the use of CAM. In a further analysis of their data,Sirois (2002) found that newer CAM users still relied heavily on conven-tional medical treatments, whereas more experienced CAM users depended570 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0\" You feel as though your alternative medicine provider is a better listener than your conventional medical doctor. \"\" You believe your provider(s) of alternative medicine offer(s) a more understandable and useful explanation of your medical problems than your conventional medical doctor. \"\" You find your alternative medicine provider spends more time with you than does your conventional medical doctor. \"\" You think alternative therapies are superior to conventional therapies.\"*\" You think using both conventional and alternative therapies is better than using either one alone [for your problems].\"* Frequency of Response (%) AGREE DISAGREE NEITHER FIGURE 2.1Users' comparison of CAM and conventional health care.

ACCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT CAM Little research has been carried out to investigate Where the public goes to search for information about CAM modalities What sources of information they commonly find and access The effect of CAM advertising on health care seeking behavior What types of the information are deemed credible, marginal, and spurious How risks and benefits are understood and how such perceptions inform decision making What the public expects their providers to tell them Information about CAM modalities appears to be obtained in three major ways. First, it has widely been reported that information about CAMis often spread by word of mouth within social networks and that referralby lay individuals is common. However, the committee found no study thatinvestigated the impact of one person 's CAM involvement on that person 's immediate family or larger social network. Analysis of CAM use amongthose afflicted with particular health problems and those engaging in pro-motive health activities associated with CAM is needed. The second source of information is the Internet. It is known that a significant percentage of the American public conducts Internet-basedsearches to find information about health problems and potential treat-ments. A recent study estimated that 73 million Americans, or 62 percent ofAmericans with access to the Internet at the time, have used the Internet tosearch for information related to health care (Fox and Rainie, 2002). Ofthese health information seekers, 92 percent reported that the informationthat they obtained during their last Internet search was useful and relevant(Fox et al., 2000), and 68 percent indicated that it had some role in theirhealth care decision making (Fox and Rainie, 2002). It is reasonable toassume that many of those contemplating or already using CAM modalitiesaccess the Internet to find out about these modalities. A few studies have been conducted to determine what a hypothetical health seeker might find on the Internet were he or she to search for com-mon herbal medications. Morris and Avorn (2003) searched the Internetusing the five most commonly used search engines and examined whatsurfaced when they entered the names of the eight most widely used herbalsupplements ( Ginkgo biloba , St. John 's wort, echinacea, ginseng, garlic,PREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 59 saw palmetto, kava kava, and valerian root). The health content of all websites listed on the first page of the search results were analyzed for atotal of 443 sites that met study inclusion criteria. Among the 443 websites,338 (76 percent) were retail sites. Eighty-one percent of these retail websitesmade one or more health claims; of these, 149 (55 percent) claimed to treat,prevent, diagnose, or cure specific diseases. More than one-half (153 of292; 52 percent) of the sites with a health claim omitted the standardfederal disclaimer. Bonakdar (2002) conducted a disease-specific search forherbal drugs for cancer. A majority of sites examined claimed that theyoffered cures for cancer through herbal supplementation with little regardfor federal regulations against doing so, with such claims being more com-mon on sites operated from outside the United States. Ashar and colleagues (2003) conducted a third study that evaluated information contained within Internet sites that advertise and market di-etary supplements containing ephedra. Thirty-two products and advertise-ments were identified and systematically evaluated for deviance from truth-in-advertising standards. Of the 32 websites analyzed, 13 (41 percent) failedto disclose potential adverse effects or contraindications to supplement use.Seventeen (53 percent) did not reveal the recommended dosage of ephedraalkaloids. More importantly, 11 sites (34 percent) contained incorrect ormisleading statements, some of which could directly result in serious harmto consumers. These and other studies (Matthews et al., 2003; Sagaram etal., 2002) illustrate that consumers are commonly misled by vendors ' claims that herbal products can treat, prevent, diagnose, or cure specific diseases,despite regulations prohibiting such statements. Closer monitoring of websites, enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of1994 (DSHEA) and Federal Trade Commission regulations, and the cre-ation of a user-friendly authoritative website or criteria for evaluating exist-ing websites on CAM modalities are much needed. A third common source of information about CAM-related modalities is health food stores. A handful of surrogate patient studies have beenconducted in which a researcher poses as a prospective client and asks foradvice about what type of herbal medicine he or she (or a family member)should take for a specified ailment. In one study conducted by Mills et al.(2003), eight data gatherers asked employees of all retail health food storesin a major Canadian city what they recommended for a patient with breastcancer. The data gatherers inquired about product safety, potential druginteractions, cost, and efficacy. Employees at 34 stores were queried, and atotal of 33 different products were recommended. Twenty-three employees(68 percent) did not ask whether the patient took prescription medications,15 employees (44 percent) recommended visiting some type of health careprofessional, and only 3 employees (8.8 percent) discussed the potentialadverse effects of the products.60 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE In another study, Glisson et al. (2003) investigated what products health food store employees recommended for the treatment of depression andhow they explained the benefits and risks. Twelve health food stores in theUnited States were selected for the study. An investigator approached anemployee in each store and asked what he or she recommended for depres-sion plus five additional questions regarding product use. All 12 healthfood store employees recommended a St. John 's wort supplement for the treatment of depression. The employees made numerous comments aboutSt. John 's wort and its use for treatment of depression that were unsafe and inaccurate. Notably, that study and another study of shopkeeper recom-mendations for medications for children with Crohn 's disease (Calder et al., 2000) found that health food store employees tend to refer to a commonresource when making recommendations. If this is a widespread practice,the availability of public access to a website recognized by health food storeemployees as authoritative might enhance the therapeutic advice given andminimize the potential for dangerous errors to be made when they offerinformation, especially if the customer was asked to indicate other medica-tions taken at the time. HOW THE AMERICAN PUBLIC USES CAM MODALITIES Although reliable data exist on the percentage of people who have used a CAM modality in the last year and how many times the modality wasused in general, far less is known about the reasons for CAM use at varioustimes. Existing surveys also provide little information about what propor-tions of CAM use are Self-initiated: \"I go to a provider and ask for X.\" Provider initiated: \"I go to a provider and she recommends or administers X.\" Provider administered: \"She does X [massage, acupuncture, chiro- practic] to me. \" Self-administered: \"I read how to do it or someone shows me and then I do it myself in a fashion I find comfortable; I self-regulate X [herbs, self hypnosis, yoga, etc.]. \" Little is known about how individual patients actually use CAM mo- dalities while they are under the care of a CAM practitioner or engaging inself-treatment. The committee was not able to find a single scientific studyto date on the rates of compliance or adherence to CAM therapies orsupplements purchased over the counter. This stands in stark contrast to arather robust literature on adherence in conventional medicine (DiMatteoet al., 2002; Donovan and Blake, 1992; Vermeire et al., 2001), a search forPREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 61 which on the PubMed website conducted in December 2003 yielded more than 50,000 citations. Further, we have no information about whether or the extent to which use of a CAM therapy may interfere with compliance in the use of conven-tional therapies. Having no information about the extent to which patientsusing CAM adhere to guidelines or directions for treatment produces amajor gap in our knowledge. We do not know if patients are using productsas directed or even for the purpose recommended. Such information isimportant, not because we want to assure that patients \"follow orders, \" but rather to assure that patients are using products and therapies safelyand effectively. Even if a therapy is efficacious, it may have little or no effectif it is taken or used incorrectly. Indeed, medicines and other CAM prod-ucts and procedures may be the source of iatrogenic health problems if theyare used incorrectly. It has been routinely observed that a significant pro-portion of those who take conventional medicine are noncomplaint for ahost of reasons. Nonadherence to treatment guidelines may be just as com-mon in the case of CAM. Indeed, patients who believe that herbal medi-cines are harmless may be more willing to self-regulate their medication inunsupervised ways. Studies of adherence to dietary supplements pose a special challenge. Because of government regulations (DSHEA), supplement labels are notallowed to make claims about the treatment for named illnesses, althoughthey are commonly used for this purpose. Instructions on packages aretherefore written to address complaints according to \"structure and func- tion\" guidelines (see Chapter 9). At issue is whether users are following the printed instructions or are using these \"medicines \" for other purposes. On the other hand, are they seeking information on how to use supplementsfrom other sources? On the basis of what criteria can compliance be ascer-tained? A lack of data on compliance is a major oversight in current CAMresearch. Use of CAM in Supervised, Unsupervised, and Eclectic Ways Unlike many conventional approaches to health care (e.g., prescription medications, surgical procedures, chemotherapy, and radiation), some CAMtherapies are provided by licensed practitioners (e.g., acupuncturists, chiro-practors, and massage therapists); others are provided by practitioners orare used by individuals without professional supervision (e.g., meditationand relaxation techniques, dietary supplementation, and dietary modifica-tion) and some forms are used without professional supervision altogether.As reported by Eisenberg et al. (1993), in 1990 nearly half (47 percent) ofrespondents who used one or more CAM therapies for their principal medi-cal conditions did so without any professional supervision, that is, without62 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE either visiting a CAM practitioner or discussing their CAM therapy with their medical doctor. It is also known that individuals who use CAM therapies tend to do so rather eclectically and in complex ways. Wolsko et al. (2002) reported thatamong individuals who used one or more CAM therapies in 1998, 46percent used one therapy, 20 percent used two therapies, 13 percent usedthree therapies, 7 percent used four therapies, 5 percent used five therapies,3 percent used six therapies, and 5.5 percent used seven or more therapies.Of the respondents who used CAM therapies during the prior 12 months,an estimated 48 percent used only self-care-centered CAM modalities,whereas 52 percent had seen a CAM provider. Among those who soughtservices of a professional CAM provider, 33 percent saw one type of CAMprovider, 11 percent saw two types of CAM providers, and 8 percent sawthree or more different types of CAM providers. These findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials to assess the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of CAM therapy use bythe adult population. Although it is still important to evaluate individualtherapies for individual conditions, a research portfolio that is limited tothis approach may not adequately simulate CAM therapy use by the adultpopulation. It may therefore be important methodologically to design somestudies that offer patients access to multiple CAM therapies across multipleCAM professional groups, as this would be closer to real-life experience. It is also interesting to reflect on the sequence, in which adults use CAM therapies in the context of their overall health care management.Eisenberg et al. (1993, 1998) documented that the overwhelming majorityof CAM users also sought conventional medical care for their principalmedical conditions. In a separate analysis, Eisenberg et al. (2001) exploredthe sequence in which individuals seek CAM therapy and found that 70percent of respondents typically sought the services of a CAM professionalconcurrently with or after their visit to a medical doctor. Less than 15percent reported that they had seen a CAM therapy provider before anevaluation of their medical concern by a medical doctor. As such, futureresearch may need to incorporate options for concurrent and concomitantconventional and CAM therapies for individuals to see whether one isbetter than the other or, alternatively, whether the two together (as usuallyoccurs in common practice) provide perceived or real improvements inclinical outcomes or cost-effectiveness, or both. Knowledge of the basis for decision making by the U.S. public regard- ing when and how they access complementary therapies either throughprofessional contact with licensed practitioners or some form of self-care islacking. This represents a relatively unchartered line of inquiry that also hasimplications for future studies in this field.PREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 63 CHARACTERISTICS OF CAM THERAPIES PROVIDED BY LICENSED ACUPUNCTURISTS, CHIROPRACTORS, MASSAGE THERAPISTS, AND NATUROPATHS Although much of the information regarding the prevalence and the patterns of CAM use comes from surveys of patients, studies of CAMpractitioners aimed at documenting the types of patients whom they seeand the types of therapeutic options that they offer have also been con-ducted. Cherkin et al. (2002a,b) surveyed random samples of licensed acu-puncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and naturopathic physiciansand collected data on the patients who visited those providers. Specifically,they collected data on 20 consecutive visits to a random sample of licensedCAM therapists in four states (Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, andWashington) and compared the data with data on conventional physicianvisits from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The data re-ported came from at least 99 practitioners in each professional group andwere collected for more than 1,800 ambulatory visits. More than 80 per-cent of the visits to CAM providers were by young and middle-aged adults,and roughly two-thirds were by women. Children made 10 percent of thevisits to naturopathic physicians but only 1 to 4 percent of all visits to allother CAM providers. At least two-thirds of the visits resulted from self-referrals, and only 4 to 12 percent of the visits were a result of referrals byconventional physicians. Chiropractors and massage therapists primarilysaw patients with musculoskeletal problems (e.g., patients with back, neck,and shoulder symptoms), whereas acupuncturists and naturopathic physi-cians saw a broader range of conditions (including fatigue, mental healthissues, and headaches). Visits to acupuncturists and massage therapistslasted about 60 minutes, whereas visits to naturopathic physicians lasted 40minutes, those to chiropractors lasted less than 20 minutes, and a routinevisit with a conventional physician lasted less than 10 minutes. Most visitsto chiropractors and naturopathic physicians but less than one-third ofvisits to acupuncturists and massage therapists were covered by insurance. The investigators commented on the observation that CAM providers typically did not discuss with the conventional doctors the care that theywere providing to patients who were concurrently seeking care from con-ventional doctors. This finding, they argue, in conjunction with the factthat patients rarely discussed their CAM care with their conventional phy-sicians raises concerns about the coordination and safety of concurrentcare. A lack of coordination and safety issues are of particular concernwhen care is provided by acupuncturists and naturopathic physicians, whomight prescribe herbs that interact with medication prescribed by conven-tional physicians and vice versa. The investigators noted that although the overlap in the types of prob-64 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE lems addressed by the four CAM professions is considerable, each profes- sion has unique aspects. Chiropractors and massage therapists see thenarrowest range of medical problems. However, chiropractors and mas-sage therapists were the most likely to provide care not related to illness(e.g., care for wellness and prevention). Care for conditions other thanillness in massage patients, which represented almost one in five visits, wasfocused on relaxation and stress reduction. Massage therapists also tend tosee a substantial number of patients for self-reported anxiety or depres-sion, some of whom might also want help relaxing and coping with stress.Another distinctive aspect of chiropractic care is the relatively large rolethat it plays in caring for acute conditions: about 40 percent of chiroprac-tic visits are for acute conditions, whereas roughly 20 percent of visits toother CAM professionals are for acute conditions. As noted above, acu-puncturists and naturopathic physicians see a broader range of conditionsthan chiropractors and massage therapists do and often provide care forsuch problems as anxiety, depression, fatigue, allergies, skin rashes, andmenopausal symptoms. The investigators commented that the most notable differences be- tween the practices of conventional physicians (i.e., medical doctors anddoctors of osteopathy) compared with those of CAM providers was therelatively large fraction of visits to the former for routine physical examina-tions, screening, and diagnostic tests and for symptoms associated withrespiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS As can be seen from the information presented in this chapter, an estimated 30 to 62 percent of adults in the United States use CAM. A lackof consensus on the definition of CAM has led to inconsistencies among thereports of various surveys on CAM prevalence and patterns of use. Totalout-of-pocket expenditures for CAM therapies were conservatively esti-mated to be $27.0 billion in 1997. This is comparable to the projected out-of-pocket expenditures for all U.S. physician services (Eisenberg et al.,1998). The majority of CAM use is not reimbursed by insurance at present;however, data indicate that prevalence rates are likely to increase as third-party reimbursements for CAM benefits become increasingly available(Eisenberg et al., 1998; Wolsko et al., 2002). High-frequency users of CAMtend to be high-frequency users of health care in general and account forapproximately 80 percent of the total expenditures on CAM. Many appearto use CAM for wellness and not just the treatment of disease (Wolsko etal., 2002). Women tend to use CAM more than men, and educated indi-viduals tend to use CAM more than poorly educated individuals (Eisenberget al., 1998; Wootton and Sparber, 2001a). However, CAM use is commonPREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 65 among people in all ethnic groups (Barnes et al., 2004; Eisenberg et al., 1998; Mackenzie et al., 2003; Ni et al., 2002). Although Eisenberg et al. (1993) and Wolsko et al. (2002) did find that a significant percentage of CAM use is unsupervised and engaged in as self-care, existing surveys reveal little about what percentage of CAM use is self-initiated (\"I go to a provider and ask for X\"), provider initiated (\"I go to aprovider, and she recommends or administers X\"), provider administered (\"She does X to me [massage, acupuncture, chiropractic]), or self-adminis- tered (\"I read how to do it or someone shows me, and then I do it myself ina fashion I find comfortable; I self-regulate herbs, etc.).\" Furthermore, fewdata are available on how the American public makes decisions aboutaccessing CAM therapies. Finally, although there is an extensive literatureon adherence to conventional treatment, there are virtually no data on ratesof adherence to CAM treatment or self-treatment with CAM. This informa-tion is crucial to assessments of the real-world effectiveness and safety ofCAM use. A majority of patients who use CAM do not disclose such use to their physicians. Nondisclosure raises important safety issues, for example, thepotential interactions of medications with herbs used as part of a CAMtherapy. In addition, a majority of adults who use CAM therapies use morethan one CAM modality and do so in combination with conventional medi-cal care (Wolsko et al., 2002). Most adults who use both conventional andCAM therapies tend to value both for different purposes (Druss andRosenheck, 1999; Eisenberg et al., 2001). Additionally, given the high ratesof use of both CAM and conventional medicine by those with chronicconditions, there is a need for a better understanding of what motivatespatients with such conditions to seek both CAM and conventional medicalservices and the cost implications of combined care. The motivations for using CAM are numerous and are poorly captured by large-scale surveys; however, a major contributor appears to be thepursuit of wellness (Astin, 1998; Kessler et al., 2001; Wolsko et al., 2002).The extent to which CAM use is a trigger for positive behavioral change isunknown, however, and constitutes an important research issue because ofthe benefit of positive behavioral change to the public's health and its use asa means to address the escalating costs of health care. Longitudinal cohortstudies can clarify people's trajectories of CAM use and those factors thatinfluence upward and downward rates of use. Research designs that enableexamination of patterns of CAM use need to be developed, as the patternsof CAM use are affected by external variables and influence other patternsof behavior important for health (e.g., diet, exercise, and substance use).Studies similar in structure to the Framingham Heart Study or the Nurses'Health Study (both of which are ongoing and which could be expanded toinclude questions about CAM) may offer the best opportunity to explore66 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE the patterns of CAM use over time and the role of CAM (or lack thereof) in promoting health, reducing risk, and preventing disease. There is also little research on how the public obtains information about CAM modalities; what types of information are deemed credible,marginal, and spurious; how the public understands the information interms of risks and benefits and how such perceptions inform decision mak-ing; and what the public expects providers to tell them. The few smallstudies that do exist illustrate that considerable misinformation is dispersedby vendors and on the Internet (Ashar et al., 2003; Bonakdar, 2002; Glissonet al., 2003; Matthews al., 2003; Mills et al., 2003; Morris and Avorn,2003). It is important to understand more about how the public is accessinginformation and making decisions about CAM use to move toward in-formed decision making about such therapies. Furthermore, closer moni-toring of websites, enforcement of DSHEA and Federal Trade Commissionregulations, and the creation of a user-friendly authoritative website onCAM modalities are needed. As a means to address the lack of information discussed above, the committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other public or private agencies sponsor quantitative and qualitative research toexamine The social and cultural dimensions of illness experiences, health care-seeking processes and preferences, and practitioner-patientinteraction; How often users of CAM, including patients and providers, adhere to treatment instructions and guidelines; The effects of CAM on wellness and disease prevention; How the American public accesses and evaluates information about CAM modalities; and Adverse events associated with CAM therapies and interactions between CAM and conventional treatments. Periodic surveys, especially in-depth instruments, would allow assess- ment of aspects of CAM prevalence, cost, and patterns of use that wouldnot otherwise be captured by sentinel surveillance sites or ongoing, feder-ally funded surveys. As discussed throughout this chapter we have littleinformation about many aspects of CAM use. Surveys could, for example,provide much needed information about out-of-pocket costs and insuredcoverage for individual therapies; about the ingestion of individual pre-scription drugs, over-the-counter preparations, herbs, and supplements; thefrequency of disclosure to one's doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or CAM pro-vider about use of CAM therapies and the reasons for nondisclosure; andcompliance issues including whether or to what extent use of CAM inter-PREVALENCE, COST, AND PATTERNS OF CAM USE 67 feres with compliance with conventional treatments. Surveys could explore in depth the motivations for using CAM and investigate perceptions aboutvarious CAM therapies (and therapists) as compared with conventionaltherapies or therapists, stratified by disease, complaint, or CAM modality.Surveys are needed to provide information about how people obtain infor-mation about CAM; to investigate the impact of one person 's CAM in- volvement on that person 's immediate family or larger social network; and the impact of direct advertising to the public or the influence of CAMtherapists and retailers of CAM products. Further, the committee recommends that the National Library of Medi- cine and other federal agencies develop criteria to assess the quality andreliability of information about CAM. When implementing the above recommendation regarding information about CAM, available criteria for assessment of health information in gen-eral should be examined and the applicability (or lack thereof) of existingcriteria to CAM should be evaluated.

This chapter provides a context for thecommittee's recommendations about research on complementary and alter-native medicine (CAM) that appear in Chapters 4 and 5. A brief account ofthe development of present approaches to evidence-driven clinical and pub-lic policy (which includes practice guidelines and coverage policy) is pre-sented. This is followed by a description of the basic ideas of clinical re-search design, including a taxonomy of study design and a taxonomy ofoutcome measurements. An account of some features of contemporary dataanalysis follows. The chapter concludes with an overview of the applicabil-ity of contemporary clinical research methods to some CAM therapies. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH As noted in Chapter 1, over the past twenty years practitioners of conventional medicine have made a marked shift from a reliance on experi-ence (directly observed or as recorded by others in medical journals) to areliance on more rigorous research to evaluate the effectiveness of treat-ments. For example, the concept of formal evaluation of therapies throughrandomized controlled trials is certainly not new (Kaptchuk and Kerr, 2004)but has regularly been applied in Western medicine only since World War II(Byar, 1980; Cochrane, 1972). Some notable exceptions to reliance on experience exist, however. In the middle of the nineteenth century, Florence Nightingale pioneered theAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 75 application of epidemiological and statistical methods to the study of hospi- tal deaths, and her discoveries of a plausible causal relationship betweenprocesses of care and outcomes led to challenges to thoughts about mecha-nisms of disease prevalent at the time, changes in clinical practice, andimprovements in mortality rates. In the early twentieth century, ErnestAmory Codman, a Boston surgeon, argued strongly for the formal study ofsurgical outcomes in an effort to understand which surgeons, hospitals, andsurgical procedures produced good versus bad outcomes (Neuhauser, 2002).This effort did not take root and grow \u2014in fact, it provoked significant hostility among Codman 's colleagues \u2014but it raised the question of the need for formal analysis of treatment outcomes that was picked up againmore than 50 years later. The need for formal evidence of effectiveness for common medical and surgical interventions was recognized much more broadly beginning in the1970s. Passage of Medicare and Medicaid legislation, together with appar-ent advances in medical and surgical care, contributed to a surge in healthcare spending. Policy makers and payers asked increasingly pointed ques-tions about the \"value \" of health care, questions that required more funda- mental questions about the effectiveness of interventions to be answered. Even more disquieting questions emerged from a body of work that described striking variations in the rates of common surgical proceduressuch as surgery for benign prostate disease, hysterectomy, and tonsillec-tomy, among seemingly similar geographic regions. This work began in thelate 1960s in northern New England, where isolated hospital market areascould easily be defined (Wennberg and Gittelsohn, 1982). International differences in the rates of medical procedures were ob- served; and when the variations within countries were adjusted for the overall rate of variation among countries, a consistent pattern was detected; a high degree of variation was a marker for a high degree of discretion, anda high degree of discretion was often explained by professional uncertaintyabout effectiveness (McPherson et al., 1982). At the time, few of the proce-dures in question had been subjected to randomized controlled clinicaltrials or other credible clinical studies. Subsequently, variations in the ratesof medical admission, physician visits, and diagnostic tests that could notbe explained by clinical variables were also found. Taken together, thesefindings raised new questions about the science base of clinical practice. Ifdecisions were based on science, how could it be that treatment dependedmore on where one lived than what was wrong or what one cared about?Policy makers wondered if high rates meant overuse and economic wasteand if low rates meant underuse and deprivation. \"Which rate was right? \" became the pressing policy question and the answer required a new invest-ment in clinical research to better define the outcomes of common interven-tions for common conditions. Thus, the practice variation phenomenon76 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE provided the motivation and the rationale for the development of \"out- comes research. \" The goal of outcomes research was to determine what was known and what was not known about common interventions, thereby setting researchagendas for common conditions. Existing evidence was systematically re-viewed by using techniques for combining data from different studies previ-ously described in the social sciences. Claims data linked to Social SecurityAdministration mortality and other administrative data were used to gleanoutcomes information to fill the gaps in knowledge that existed at the time.Patient surveys were conducted to capture patients ' subjective responses to treatments and outcomes. Variations in these responses highlighted theimportance of patients ' preferences as a source of warranted variation in clinical decisions. Decision models (a model is a representation of reality)were constructed to test the relative sensitivities of decisions to key prob-abilities of good or bad outcomes and to patient preferences. Decisionsupport tools were developed; and trials were designed to help patients anddoctors choose among treatment options, including randomization in atrial when a well-informed patient was at equipoise, that is, finding eachtreatment equally acceptable. Other investigators used consensus methods to develop appropriate- ness criteria that were then applied to the medical records of patients whohad undergone procedures with high rates of variation by geographic re-gion. It was common for procedures for 30 percent or more of patients ' indications to be deemed inappropriate. The proportions of proceduresdeemed inappropriate was essentially the same in high- and low-volumesettings, so the low-volume providers were not simply doing a better job ofselecting only appropriate cases. This work was extended with a focus on guideline development. Pro- fessional organizations such as the American College of Physicians insti-tuted rigorous guideline development processes, increasing recognition ofthe severe limitations of the evidence base for the treatment of commonconditions. Evidence of Effectiveness for Prescription Drugs The limited evidence base for surgery and other procedures for the common conditions targeted by outcomes research contrasted sharply withthe richer body of evidence for medical therapies. This difference can bestbe understood in the context of the regulation of medications that began in1906 with the Pure Food and Drug Act, which made misrepresentation ofingredients illegal and which recognized the standardized drug formulaeregistered in a national formulary or pharmacopoeia. The 1906 act wassilent on drug safety and efficacy.APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 77 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 extended safe- guards by introducing the distinction between prescription and over-the-counter drugs and requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to prove drugsafety information before the drug could be released for use. This was adirect response to the elixir sulfanilamide tragedy, in which 107 people,most of them children, died when a new sulfa preparation was distributedwithout testing of the preparation for safety. In 1951, the Durham-Humphrey Amendment (U.S. Statutes at Large, 1951) made it clear that the classification of drugs as prescription was up tothe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), not manufacturers. In its initialform, the amendment authorized FDA to test drugs for efficacy as well assafety. However, the efficacy requirement was eventually removed beforepassage of the amendment. The next significant change in legislation fol-lowed the thalidomide disaster in Europe, which was narrowly averted inthe United States and which prompted passage of the Kefauver-HarrisAmendment (U.S. Statutes at Large, 1962) in 1962. All clinical testingprocedures had to be approved by FDA and had to demonstrate efficacy aswell as safety. The pharmaceutical industry resisted the efficacy require-ment, especially the retroactive evaluation of drugs. However, in 1970, inthe court case Upjohn Co. v. Finch (422 F.2d 944, 955 [6th Cir. 1970]) , the Court of Appeals ruled that commercial success alone did not constitutesubstantial evidence for efficacy in the case of the Upjohn drug Panalba.Evidence of efficacy as well as of safety had become an enforceable stan-dard for prescription drugs. Over the ensuing decades, the pharmaceuticalindustry and clinical research organizations (CROs 1) rapidly built the ca- pacity to conduct those clinical trials necessary to meet the standards set byFDA. More Recent Developments: Evidence-Based Medicine As the need for evidence became more evident and funding for clinical research became more available, many academic settings emphasized devel-opment and use of methods for gathering clinical evidence. The multi-disciplinary collaborations that formed with federally funded \"patient out- comes research teams \" matured as methodological expertise in clinical epidemiology, decision theory, and other domains of quantitative and quali-tative research was honed. The \"clinimetrics \" work of Alvan Feinstein at Yale attracted more attention. David Sackett and colleagues in Canada and 1CROs provide a wide range of research and development services. CROs assist pharma- ceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies to produce new medicines and new treatments (www.acrohealth.org).78 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE later England defined clinical epidemiology as the \"basic science for clini- cians. \" Courses were devised to teach students and physicians how to critically appraise the medical literature. Fellowship and clinical scholarprograms turned out clinical scientists with the skills necessary to generateand accurately interpret evidence. The Canadian Task Force on the PeriodicPhysical Examination and later the U.S. Preventive Services Task Forcedeveloped ratings for \"levels of evidence, \" which are described in detail later in this chapter. The Cochrane Collaboration was formed in Oxford,England, to systematically examine evidence for the full breadth of medicalpractice and quickly attracted an extensive international following. Jour-nals with the titles Evidence-Based Medicine and Evidence-Based Health Care appeared. By the mid-1990s, the concept of formal, scientific evidence of treatment effectiveness had arrived, at least in some circles. The goal of evidence-based medicine is to ensure that, to the extent possible, individual clinical decisions and broader health policy decisionsabout tests and treatments be based on the published results of rigorousstudies of efficacy and effectiveness. Because not all treatments have beensubjected to formal study and because some treatments cannot be studiedwithout investment in massive clinical trials, it will not be possible to baseall treatment decisions on published evidence. Nevertheless, the concept ofevidence-based medicine asks that decisions be based on published scien-tific evidence when it is available and that investments be made to gatherevidence in as many areas of medical care as possible. In conventional medicine, there is now a general acceptance of the need to carefully study the effectiveness of tests and treatments, even those thathave already become frequently used. Just in the past 3 years, prominentstudies have challenged the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantationand high-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer (Farquhar et al., 2003),arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee (Moseley et al., 2002),and the use of estrogen replacement therapy during menopause (Rossouwet al., 2002). There are clearly some treatments for which evidence of effectiveness is immediate and compelling. It may be unnecessary or even unethical toconduct formal effectiveness trials in a variety of situations, for example,when a treatment results in a combination of a clear reversal or eliminationof a disease process, has a short latency of noticeable effect, is nearlyuniversally effective in all patients treated, and eliminates clinical symp-toms. The use of penicillin in the mid-1940s, surgery for appendicitis, andresection of localized cancers all stand as examples of this sort of undis-puted effectiveness. Even in these examples, there may be value in conduct-ing long-term surveillance studies to detect rare or late complications orside effects, and it may be appropriate to conduct formal cost-effectivenessor cost-benefit studies.APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 79 At the other end of the spectrum are those interventions that have modest effects, if any at all. It is these interventions that require studies withrigorous design and of rigorous execution to determine whether an effectdoes indeed exist and to estimate its size. The next section examines a variety of research methods available for use in conducting clinical effectiveness research. BASIC FEATURES OF CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH A Taxonomy of Clinical Research Methods Many factors can influence the outcome of treatment. These include the treatment itself, characteristics of the patient (such as age, gender, andcomorbid conditions), other treatments, access to care, adherence to treat-ment plans, socioeconomic status and education, and the skill of the practi-tioner. In treatment effectiveness research, the goal is to evaluate the contri-bution of one of these factors, treatment, to determine whether treatmentmakes a difference. Doing so can be difficult if other factors are at play, asthey often are. The goal of study designs is usually to make it possible toassess the contribution of the treatment after the other influences on out-come are taken into account. In a study comparing two clinical interventions, the goal is to be sure that any difference observed is due to the differences in the two interven-tions rather than some other factor. The \"some other factor \" is a \"con- founder, \" because it confounds one 's efforts to draw the conclusion that differences between the interventions are responsible for the differences inoutcomes. Random Assignment to Treatment or Control The best way to be sure that one can draw a strong conclusion from a difference in outcomes is to assign subjects randomly to receive one inter-vention or the other. If the randomization is successful and the number ofpatients is large enough, the two study populations will be essentially iden-tical except for the different interventions. If one conducts the study so that,except for the intervention, the study populations are also identical at theend of the study, the researchers can make a very strong inference that thecause of the differences in outcomes is the difference in the interventions.Randomization is powerful because it ensures that the two populations aresimilar in every respect except for the intervention to which the researchersrandomly assigned the patients. This claim means that if the study groupsare large enough and the randomization was successful, the frequencies of80 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE all known factors (e.g., age, gender, and comorbid conditions) are similar in both groups; in addition, and perhaps more importantly, the frequency ofany unknown or unmeasured factor will be the same in both groups. Ran- domized trials stand at the top of the hierarchy of evidence because theymake it possible to infer a cause-and-effect relationship between an inter-vention and an outcome. Because the study groups are identical except forthe intervention, any effect on outcomes must be due to the intervention. Observational Studies Other methods for studying the effects of two interventions rely on data derived from the observation of care. In contrast to a randomized trial,no one intervenes in an observational study. Instead, researchers use infor-mation about the patients to try to make inferences about the relationshipof clinical factors (including treatment) to clinical outcomes. Sometimes,researchers collect the information systematically (a prospective study);other times, the data represent patient care as it happened in the past(retrospective study). In either case, the crucial distinguishing feature of anobservational study is that receipt of the intervention depends on clinicalcircumstances and preferences rather than deliberate assignment, as in arandomized clinical trial. These circumstances that influence choice of treat-ment may also influence the outcomes. Differences in outcomes may there-fore be due to the intervention or other circumstances, or a combination of both. Observational studies have many advantages. They are much less costly than randomized trials, they can have huge study populations, and theresults are more likely to represent practice (Benson and Hartz, 2000).However, the circumstances that influence the choice of treatment oftenconfound the interpretation of differences in outcomes. The frequencies of potential confounders may differ between those who receive the interven-tion and those who do not. To evaluate differences in outcomes indepen-dently of the influence of possible confounders, researchers perform multi-variable regression techniques on the data. The variables used in thestatistical model are either the several candidate predictor variables (thetreatment itself and other potential confounders, such as demographic char-acteristics, clinical characteristics of the patient, comorbid conditions, andsocioeconomic factors) or the dependent variable (the outcome that themodel is trying to predict). These techniques effectively adjust the frequen-cies of the confounders measured so that they occur at the same rate in boththe treatment and the no-treatment groups. If the treatment is still a statis-tically significant predictor of an outcome, researchers can infer an associa-tion between the outcome and the treatment. However, they cannot inferthat the treatment causes the outcome because the statistical techniques canAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 81 only adjust for differences in the confounders that the researchers mea- sured. Unmeasured confounders are thus the bane of researchers who con-duct observational studies. Therefore, the possibility that a confounding variable is responsible for observed differences means that one must express conclusions in terms ofassociation rather than causation. Even then, researchers must be cautiousin their conclusions because it is possible that the apparent associationbetween two variables is actually the result of a third variable (the con-founder) that is affecting the two variables at the same time so that theychange in concert. In observational studies, the researchers must guardagainst concluding that the change in one variable is the consequence of thechange in the other variable (cause and effect). Types of Observational Studies Observational studies come in several forms: cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and cross-sectionaland longitudinal studies. Each of these is described below. Cohort Studies. A cohort study (in the context of treatment effective- ness research) is the formal collection and analysis of data on treatmentsand outcomes for a defined set of patients with similar clinical characteris-tics. For example, a researcher might study pain and disability levels asoutcomes in a cohort of patients older than 70 years of age who receivedlumbar fusion surgery for severe sciatica. The distinguishing feature ofcohort studies is that researchers gather data on treatment and possibleconfounders at one point in time and measure outcomes at a later point intime. Cohort studies are a relatively powerful form of study design becauseresearchers can often statistically adjust the final outcomes (e.g., levels ofpain) for differences in the outcome variable at the beginning of the study(pain levels before surgery) and because they can measure the outcomevariable at many points in time (e.g., from monthly pain reports for up to 2years after surgery). The assembly of a cohort is the first step. It may take place in the present as a deliberate, planned activity in which the researchers gatherdata on the present state of the participants (prospective cohort), or it mayrely upon data gathered in the past (retrospective cohort). In either case, theinvestigators use specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to define a groupof people with many similarities. Even though members of the cohort aresimilar in terms of the inclusion criteria (in the example cited above, allpatients will be older than age 70 years, all will have had fusion surgery,and all will have had severe sciatica before surgery), they will inevitablydiffer in many other predictors of outcome. For example, some members ofthe spine surgery cohort may be 70 years old and others may be 85 yearsold. Some may be overweight and others may be thin. Some will be engaged82 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE in regularly physical activity, and others will be sedentary. Some will have a spouse or caregiver available to help with work at home; others will be ontheir own. All of these factors, and countless others, may have influences ontreatment outcomes. Researchers try to identify and record as many ofthese factors as possible, but inevitably some potentially important factorsare not measured. Outcome measurement is the second major step. The researchers mea- sure outcomes at a future time relative to the date of cohort assembly. Witha prospective cohort, measurement of outcomes occurs in the future atspecific time points relative to the date of treatment. With a retrospectivecohort, the outcomes may have occurred in the past relative to the date oftreatment and may have to be abstracted from existing data systems or maystill occur in the future if members of the cohort are still alive and availablefor follow-up. Case-Control Studies. The study population in a case-control study in the domain of treatment effectiveness consists of the cases (those with thetarget outcome, such as complete pain relief) and the controls (those with-out the target outcome, for example, those with continued pain). Case-control studies are especially well-suited to studies of rare events, becausecases (those experiencing the event) are oversampled relative to the con-trols. Case-control studies are typically retrospective, in that the researchersassemble the study population after the measurable outcome events haveoccurred. If adequate numbers of patients are available, researchers choosethe controls by matching each control patient (or several control patients)to one case patient for variables such as age, sex, and date of entry into thepopulation from which the researchers identify cases and controls. The nextstep is to measure rates of exposure to a treatment (e.g., a surgical proce-dure) for the cases and the controls. The ratio of the rates of exposure to theintervention for those who experience the outcome (cases) and those whodo not experience it (controls) is mathematically equivalent to the ratio ofthe outcomes in those exposed to the intervention to the rate in those notexposed to it. Thus, the outcome of a case-control study is a rate ratio or anodds ratio of the target condition frequency in exposed patients versus thatin unexposed patients. Researchers may perform regression analysis tech-niques to adjust the cases and controls for differences in potential con-founders. The Achilles heel of a case-control study is confounders, and theresearchers ' greatest challenge is assembling the control group to avoid confounders. One way to accomplish this task is to choose cases and con-trols from a cohort that the researchers assembled using the same inclusionand exclusion criteria (a so-called nested case-control study). Case Series. A case series is simply a serial collection of patients withAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 83 some defining characteristic. A typical case series is a group of patients who have a rare diagnosis or who have undergone a new surgical procedure. Inthe context of treatment effectiveness research, a case series would be aconsecutive set of patients who received a particular treatment. Case seriesdo not have controls, so that it is very difficult to make any inferences aboutwhether an intervention (a treatment or surgical procedure) had any effect.An exception would have been the first group of patients with pneumoniawho received penicillin and experienced rates of survival that were unprec-edented in the era before penicillin. In surgical research, it is reasonablycommon to publish results of case series studies and to compare the out-comes to those for other published case series for patients with the sameunderlying condition. These \"historical controls \" provide a basis for com- parison of outcomes for the new treatment, but it is even more difficult todraw inferences in a case series study than in either a prospective or aretrospective cohort study because the patients in the comparison groupwere treated at a different place and at a different time, so there are con-founders related to place and time, in addition to the confounders in thecohort study related to the patients ' clinical and personal characteristics. Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Studies. Cross-sectional studies mea- sure the relationship between variables at a single point in time. Cross-sectional studies are a relatively weak study design for the testing of hy-potheses about treatment-outcome relationships because they rely upon asingle measurement of each variable. A survey is a typical cross-sectionalstudy design. Longitudinal studies measure the relationship between vari-ables at two or more points in time. In effectiveness studies, longitudinalstudies would typically involve the measurement of outcomes at severalpoints after treatment. They are a relatively powerful method for the test-ing of hypotheses because repeating a measurement many times (or evenonce) for an individual reduces statistical variation and narrows confi-dence intervals. Clinical Outcomes: A Taxonomy Treatment outcomes can be objective or subjective. Objective outcomes are visible or measurable to people other than the patient, and subjectiveoutcomes can be felt or reported only by the patient. One of the majorcontributions of the outcomes management movement in the late 1980sand early 1990s was to raise the status of subjective measures as validscientific endpoints in clinical trials and other forms of research studies.Advances in the technology of subjective measurement made that changepossible, so that it is now common to find a mix of subjective and objectiveendpoints in many clinical trials.84 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Subjective Outcomes Subjective outcomes include those symptoms and other aspects of a patient 's experience that are not directly observable by others, but that represent the goals of treatment. Pain, sensations of nausea or dizziness,functional status, ability to perform activities of daily living, and experienceof moods or emotional states are examples of subjective outcomes forwhich well-developed and widely used measures exist (Bowling, 1997;Frank-Stromborg and Olsen, 1997; McDowell and Newell, 1996). Becausethere is no direct way to validate a patient 's report of pain level or mood state, the development of valid measures requires careful attention to issuesof reliability (i.e., whether measures taken at two adjacent points in timeyield the same result or whether two closely related versions of the samescale yield the same result) and convergent validity (i.e., whether the resultsof two presumably related, but different, measures actually yield similarresults). Because patients ' responses to single questions or item formats may be affected by idiosyncrasies of wording and interpretation, it is commonfor measures of subjective outcomes to be based on multi-item scales withdifferent wordings and response formats. Patient reports may also be sensi-tive to context or contrast effects (for example, a relatively modest \"abso- lute\" level of pain may feel uncomfortable if it is new but may feel very minor if it has been preceded by a long period of excruciating, severe pain). The subjective domains for which well-established measures exist cover many of the endpoints of CAM treatments. Existing measures can be andhave been used in studies of the effectiveness of treatments involving CAM.Some subjective domains are more unique to specific CAM modalities (e.g.,feelings of \"centeredness \" or \"wholeness \") and some additional measure- ment work may be required for these modalities; but in principle, virtuallyany subjective experience can be captured either as present or absent or aspresent as a matter of degree. Because subjective experiences cannot be independently validated, and because they can be significantly affected by context, contrast, and expecta-tion effects, it is particularly important to try to build in features of thestudy design that minimize these kinds of biases. \"Blinding \" the patient to the specific treatment that he or she has received, for example, is a way tominimize the effects of expectations on reports of subjective outcomes.Careful selection of patients who are all similar in terms of the level of painor disability at the time of treatment is a way to minimize contrast effects.Having the outcome assessment done by a person other than the treatingclinician is a way to minimize the biasing effects from the desire of a patientto please the clinician.APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 85 Objective Outcomes Objective outcomes include those things that can be felt, seen, heard, or measured in some way by someone other than the patient. Status as alive ordead, weight, blood pressure, tumor size, white blood cell counts, and levelsof blood sugar all represent examples of objective measures used regularlyin treatment effectiveness studies. In conventional medicine, the vast rangeof tests possible in the domains of laboratory tests, radiologic and nuclearimaging, physical examination, electrical recording (electrocardiograms,electroencephalograms, and electromyograms) are all potential means ofobtaining objective outcome measures for specific treatments. Even though the data for objective outcomes can often be stored and made available for repeat testing by other observers (e.g., two independentradiologists reading the same X-ray image), there is still some potential forbias, particularly if the person providing a treatment or studying its effectsis the person performing a test or interpreting the results of a test. Manyobjective tests still involve some judgment or interpretation on the part ofthe person performing or interpreting the test, so it is important to designeffectiveness studies in ways that minimize any biasing effects of thosejudgments or interpretations. The most common way to minimize bias is tomake sure that the person reading an X-ray image, taking and recording ablood pressure, or interpreting an electroencephalogramm is not someonewith a vested interest in the results of a study and to try, whenever possible,to blind the person doing the test to any knowledge of the study treatmentthat the patient has received. Doing these two things minimizes the oppor-tunity for any systematic bias either for or against a particular treatmentbeing studied. To the extent that treatments involving CAM are designed to influence objective endpoints like survival, blood pressure, tumor size, or the align-ment and spacing of vertebrae, standard measures of these endpoints, withappropriate blinding and other controls for bias, should be suitable fortreatment effectiveness research in CAM. CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYSIS In the last 10 to 15 years, a consensus has emerged about the types of scientific evidence required to establish the efficacy or the effectiveness of atreatment. Doctors and patients adopt health interventions, such as a CAMtherapy, because someone will pay the cost (such as an insurance companyor Medicare) and because the benefits of the intervention sufficiently out-weigh its harms. These benefits and harms are the outcomes of the use of the intervention. The outcomes movement or the evidence-based medicinemovement in health care is simply the application of the principle that86 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE societal and individual acceptance of a health care intervention should depend on the balance of its benefits, harms, and costs. The measurementof those benefits and harms, the balance of harms and benefits, and howthat balance compares with the balance of harms and benefits of an estab-lished treatment are at the heart of most clinical research. This sectiondiscusses some core principles in comparisons and evaluations of healthcare interventions. Many possible solutions or interventions exist for every human com- plaint and every affliction. Some interventions gain general acceptance andbecome standard treatment. Some of these have strong scientific evidence tosupport their use. That is, investigators have tested formal hypotheses aboutthe interventions according to established principles and have found thatthey are clearly superior. Others have little or no scientific evidence tosupport their use but have become accepted as effective because of theirlong-term use. For practicing clinicians, clinical research often addresses thequestion asked by many patients, \"This treatment has worked for me in the past, so why should I switch to another, less established treatment? \" The way to answer this question is a head-to-head comparison of the twotreatments. In designing a study to this end and analyzing the results, anumber of considerations can be important. This section describes some ofthese considerations, with particular emphasis on how they apply to theproblem of predicting the response to an intervention. Predicting the Response to an Intervention The data set from a randomized study of two treatments will contain many different variables. Among them is a measure of outcome (e.g., bloodpressure at the end of the study); this variable would be the dependentvariable in a multivariable model (the goal of the model would be to predictthe end-of-study blood pressure). Another variable would be treatmentassignment (Drug A or Drug B); treatment assignment would be a predictorvariable (or an independent variable). Other predictor variables might in-clude age, sex, ethnicity, pretreatment blood pressure, and dietary salt in-take. One form of a multivariable model would include all of the predictorvariables and might show that several predictor variables were significantpredictors of the end-of-study blood pressure. One of them would be DrugA and another might be salt intake. In a multivariable regression model,these two would be independent predictors of outcome. This result wouldnot prove that salt intake was a mediator of the response to Drug A, in thesense that Drug A had a greater effect in the presence of a low-salt dietversus high-salt diet. However, the model could be set up in a different way,with so-called interaction terms reflecting the extent to which the effects ofDrug A and salt intake vary as the levels of the other variables vary. If theAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 87 regression coefficient for this interaction term was significantly different from 0, a researcher could say that the interaction between Drug A and saltintake was a predictor of end-of-study blood pressure. In other words, theeffect of Drug A on blood pressure was not the same for all levels of saltintake, and the effect of salt intake on blood pressure differed as a functionof Drug A 's presence or absence. The search for predictors of response would involve a search for significant interaction terms between the inter-vention and the predictor variables. Stability of Predictive Models A key element of a predictive model is its stability (its ability to give the same result if the study was repeated with a new sample of patients). One ofthe ways to predict the stability of a model is to count the number ofoutcome events. If the number of outcome events is small relative to thenumber of predictor variables in the model (a ratio of at least 10 outcomeevents per predictor variable is the minimum), the model is likely to beunstable. Thus, a model for the prediction of mortality after a surgicalprocedure would likely be unstable if the study recorded 15 deaths and thepredictive model tested 8 variables. For this model to be stable, at least 80deaths should have occurred. The reason that a model 's stability depends on the ratio of the number of outcome events to the number of predictorvariables is that small samples are likely to differ from the parent popula-tion to a greater degree than large samples would (the law of small num-bers). One needs substantial numbers of people who experience the out-come, because statistical models for the identification of which potentialpredictors are good predictors rely upon differences in the frequencies ofthe potential predictors of outcome in those who experience the outcomeand those who do not. Distinguishing Between Intermediate and Distal Outcomes It is important for researchers to decide whether to be satisfied with measuring intermediate outcomes (outcomes that predict death or long-term disability but that are not death or long-term disability themselves) asa result of an intervention or whether to measure the effects of the interven-tion on the death and disability rates of those diseases directly (distal out-comes). The treatment of hypertension is an informative example. One cancompare two antihypertensive drugs by their effects on blood pressure; orone can compare their effects by determining the rates of strokes, conges-tive heart failure, or myocardial infarction between the two groups ofpatients taking the two drugs. Blood pressure is an intermediate outcome,of interest mostly because it predicts outcomes that frighten patients, such88 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE as stroke rates. It is much easier and much less costly to measure blood pressure than it is to measure stroke rates, which are typically small andwhich require many patient-years of monitoring for accurate measurement.Once several studies show, however, that lower blood pressure predictsfewer strokes, the decision to pay for a new antihypertensive drug mightwell rest on its effect on blood pressure, with the implicit assumption thatthe lower blood pressures brought about by treatment with the new drugrelative to those achieved with standard therapy imply that the patients willexperience fewer strokes. Therefore, although distal outcomes mean moreto patients, it may not be necessary to measure them to determine whethera new drug is equal to or better than the standard therapy. The usefulnessof intermediate outcomes in clinical research rests on the bedrock of ascientifically proven connection between the intermediate outcome and thedistal outcome. It involves the assumption that the effect of a drug on bloodpressure is the only determinant of stroke rates. A drug that affected bloodpressure and blood clotting might have a greater effect on stroke rates thanits effect on blood pressure would predict. Standard Outcome Instruments Versus Customized Instruments The rationale for standardizing measures of outcome rests upon the value placed on being able to compare the effects of different interventions.Compartmentalization of health care policy is shortsighted in the long run.For example, Medicare could be concerned about whether to pay for leftventricular assist devices for damaged hearts. If resources are limited, Medi-care should consider alternative uses of the money expended on left ven-tricular devices. If decision makers ask, \"What must we give up in order to pay for X?\" they need a method that they can use to compare the interven- tions for one disease with the interventions for another disease. The growth of standardized outcome measurements is a response to the need to compare the effects of treating diseases that have different out-comes. How does one compare a treatment for diabetes with a treatmentfor back pain? One uses some measure that both diseases affect, such asability to function in daily life (the SF-36 questionnaire or activities of dailyliving). Instruments such as the SF-36 have been used in so many studiesthat scores serve as a way to compare one study population with another.Many disease-specific instruments are also available. Cost-Effectiveness Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important tool for evaluating health care interventions. According to Garber et al. (1997), cost-effectiveness is\"a method designed to assess the comparative impact of expenditures onAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 89 different health outcomes. \" The importance of cost-effectiveness is its salience to setting policies in a setting in which resources are constrainedand people must make choices that involve trading off costs againsteffectiveness. The salient word in describing cost-effectiveness analysis is \"compara- tive.\" The cost-effectiveness of one intervention is always in relation to the cost-effectiveness of something else, even if the alternative is doing nothing.The cost-effectiveness of Intervention A compared with Intervention B is Cost-effectiveness = (cost A - costB)/(QALYA - QALYB) where effectiveness is measured in clinical units and where QALY repre- sents a quality-adjusted life year. A QALY is a year living in a specific stateof health relative to the most desirable health state, usually perfect health.The relationship between a desirable health state and a less desirable one isa number, called a utility , which expresses the ratio of the patient 's prefer- ence for a specific health state compared with that for perfect health. Thus,if the patient says a year with heart failure is equivalent to 80 percent of ayear spent in perfect health, the utility for heart failure is 0.8. Thus, a yearspent by one person living with heart failure counts as \"0.8 QALY \" and a year spent in perfect health counts as \"1.0 QALY. \" In large populations of people, one can calculate the total number of QALYs that the populationexperiences over a period of time by adding the QALY values accumulatedby each individual in the population over the time period being considered. When one expresses effectiveness in QALYs, it is possible to compare several different interventions directly (e.g., the treatment of hypertensionand screening for lung cancer). This advantage is very important for healthcare planning, in which those who provide or pay for health care assemblea package of health care interventions, because one can choose interven-tions on the basis of cost-effectiveness and obtain a package of serviceswhose components have values \u2014expressed as the health benefits obtained for the money expended \u2014that are consistent with one another. The analyst could express cost-effectiveness differently (e.g., the cost per patient death postponed or the cost per case of lung cancer detected).These methods are easier, but their use means that the power to compareinterventions for two entirely different health conditions is given up. Esti-mation of the effect of an intervention on life expectancy, especially whenlife expectancy is adjusted for quality of life, requires a great deal morework, but most cost-effectiveness analyses calculate the cost per QALY. In a typical cost-effectiveness analysis, the analyst uses a mathematical model to represent the alternative actions (e.g., a treatment, a clinical test,or observation) and their health consequences. The analyst represents theuncertainty of future events (e.g., death or survival after surgery) as a90 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE probability ranging from 0 to 1, and the outcome of various sets of events as a health state (e.g., death or survival with heart failure). The value of agiven health state at a point in time is expressed on a 0-1 scale as a \"utility, \" and the cumulative values of health states over a fixed period of time areexpressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (time spent in a givenhealth state times the value placed on life in the health state). Measurement of Preferences The QALY is a key element of cost-effectiveness analysis because it expresses length of life in a common unit: healthy years. By using a com-mon unit, one can compare the desirabilities of two different health states.To compare two outcome states quantitatively, one must characterize eachone by a number that reflects the desirability of the outcome state. Thisnumber is the utility of the health state, usually expressed on a scale from 0to 1. Several methods that can be used to elicit a person 's utility for a health state exist. In many cost-effectiveness analyses, the researchers adopt autility obtained from large population-based surveys (Torrance, 1986,1987). The first method, the standard reference gamble method, is the mosttheoretically sound method but is also the most difficult for a patient to do.The second method, the time trade-off method, in which the patient isasked how many years in a particular health state are equivalent to thepatient 's life expectancy in perfect health is easier. With this method a patient is asked, \"How many of your 20 years of expected life in your current health state would you give up to have perfect health for the rest ofyour life? \" The third method is the easiest but is the least sound theoreti- cally: \"Point to a place on a scale from 0 to 10 that characterizes your feeling about a health state. \" Do Outcomes Differ? Statistical Analysis Study populations are necessarily samples of the universe of people who are eligible for a study. If the study population is small, the outcomesare more likely to differ by chance from the outcomes that would occur inthe universe from which the sample was drawn. Because the results fromany one sample can be atypical, scientists use the concept of the 95 percentconfidence interval, which is the range of outcomes that would occur in 95of 100 samples from the universe. One can calculate the 95 percent confi-dence interval for the difference between two outcomes. If the 95 percentconfidence interval for the difference includes 0 (no difference), the resultsof the study that gave rise to the difference are consistent with no differ-ence. Statistical tests estimate the probability that a difference in outcomesAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 91 is consistent with chance, usually expressed as the \"p value. \" Outcome studies increasingly report the confidence interval of the absolute differencein outcomes related to two interventions. This method provides a graphicmeasure of the uncertainty in a conclusion. If the confidence interval of thedifference includes 0 or a value that is very close to 0, the difference is notstatistically significant or is of borderline statistical significance, respec-tively. If the lower limit of the confidence interval of the difference is farfrom 0, one can be sure that the difference itself is unlikely to be the productof a chance variation in the samples drawn from the same universe. Confidence intervals enter into the interpretation of predictive models designed to identify clinical predictors of a response to a treatment, such asan element of a package of CAM interventions for a clinical problem. Thecoefficient of an interaction term has a confidence interval. If it includes 0,the interaction term is not a statistically significant predictor of the depen-dent variable (e.g., Drug A, salt intake, and end-of-study blood pressure, asin the earlier example). Measurement Error Measurement error adds uncertainty. The inclusion of a measurement error widens the 95 percent confidence interval. Failure to take into ac-count measurement error will lead one to overestimate precision and drawincorrect conclusions about differences in outcomes. Effectiveness Versus Efficacy Studies Efficacy Studies Efficacy studies mean, by common agreement, that the comparison of two technologies has taken place under strictly controlled conditions de-signed to show a difference if a difference is truly present. Typically, anefficacy study will exclude patients who are likely to die of diseases otherthan the target disease for the technology under study to maximize theinformation value of each death in characterizing the two technologies. Thestudy population of an efficacy study is typically narrowly defined (andtherefore relatively small), which means that the patients are very similar toone another and, therefore, that the results may not apply to a widerpopulation. All measurements take place under optimum conditions, andthe doctors interpreting the test results undergo special training so that theygive the same interpretation, for example, to the same computed tomogra-phy scan, eliminating one source of measurement error. Typically, efficacystudies precede effectiveness studies, and the results are used as a \"proof of92 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE principle. \" After proof of principle, other studies may explore the size of the effect in different study populations, at different clinical sites, and underdifferent conditions of practice. These are effectiveness studies. Effectiveness Studies Effectiveness studies evaluate the technology under real-world condi- tions of actual medical practice. The study population resembles that whichone would see in day-to-day clinical practice, which means that any resultsare likely to apply to real-world clinical practice. Effectiveness studies havea greater chance of measurement error if the researchers have taken fewprecautions to standardize the measurements. Although measurement errorreduces the precision of effectiveness studies, study populations are typi-cally large, which increases the statistical precision. Noninferiority and Superiority Trials Some researchers want to prove that their product is better than the standard product. If the new product is very effective, relatively small studypopulations may suffice to prove that the product is superior to the stan-dard product. Often, however, researchers are content to show that theirproduct is equivalent to the standard product. A typical situation is a minorchemical variation to a standard drug. The minor variation means that thepatent on the standard drug does not apply, and the company making thenew product can market it, as long as it is as good as the standard product.Thus, some studies are designed to prove noninferiority (the product ishighly likely to be as good as the standard product). The designer of thetrial tries to estimate the number of patients required to show that the twoproducts do not result in clinically important differences in outcomes. Onemeans to this end is to include enough subjects to be sure that the upperlimit of the 95 percent confidence interval of the difference in outcomes (thelargest difference that is reasonably possible) is slightly smaller than theminimum clinically important difference in outcomes. This technique al-most guarantees that if the two products are truly equivalent, any differenceactually observed between them in a particular study will be less than thesmallest difference that clinicians would find meaningful. For all intents,the two interventions have equivalent effects. Co-Morbidity and Cointerventions as Confounders Suppose one is investigating the relationship between eating a particu- lar brand of breakfast cereal and subsequent myocardial infarction. Thegreater the intake of the cereal is, the greater the incidence of myocardialAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 93 infarction is. Is eating the cereal associated with myocardial infarction? Now, suppose that cereal eaters and noneaters also differ in the prevalenceof diabetes, with more cases of diabetes occurring in the cereal-eating popu-lation. The presence of diabetes is confounding the relationship betweencereal eating and myocardial infarction. Diabetes is thus a \"co-morbid condition ,\" a form of confounder. Medications can also confound a relationship. Suppose that one studies the effects of two blood pressure medications on heart failure. Since highblood pressure is a cause of heart failure, the study will be stronger if theblood pressure in the two study groups is the same. So, the researchersallow the doctors caring for the patients to use medications in addition tothe study medications to get a patient 's blood pressure to a target level. The other blood pressure medications are \"cointerventions .\" Cointerventions can be confounders if they affect the outcome state, which is heart failure inthis example. If the researchers do not adjust for differences in the cointer-vention medications, which may vary throughout the study, they may forman incorrect conclusion about the relationship of the study medication toheart failure. That is, what appears to be an effect of the study medicationmay be an effect of the cointervention. Single-Center Versus Multicenter Studies Studies that take place in many different clinical sites are increasingly the norm for the testing of major hypotheses about treatments for disease.One reason is sample size. More sites mean more patients, which meansgreater statistical precision and the ability to make strong statistical infer-ences about relatively small (and even clinically unimportant) differences(of course, one may lose statistical precision if the clustering of outcomesoccurs, but a good study design will allow a larger sample size so thatclustering does not reduce the statistical power of a study). The use of morestudy sites means greater variability in the patients and in clinical care andless risk that the differences between two interventions are due to idiosyn-crasies of practice at a single site rather than the intervention itself. The useof more study sites also means that more investigators are talking amongthemselves and finding ways to strengthen the study that a single investiga-tor might miss. A study at more sites also means greater costs, which oftenmake a study infeasible without a corporate sponsor. Alternatively, thegreater costs may mean less thorough data collection and a greater risk thatthe findings from the study will not be interpretable at its conclusion.Despite the costs, multicenter studies are the norm for the testing of impor-tant hypotheses. Relatively few studies of CAM interventions have beenperformed at multiple sites, so this form of research is an untapped oppor-tunity for CAM researchers.94 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Clustering of Outcomes Conventional statistical methods assume that the outcomes for indi- vidual patients are independent of one another, so that each patient con-tributes new additional information about the relationship of an outcometo the two interventions. When the care given by different providers (eitherinstitutions or doctors) results in different outcomes, outcomes are said tobe \"clustered. \" When a study takes place in several different institutions, which is common practice, it is possible that care provided at each of theinstitutions differs, so that knowledge of what institution is providing thecare allows one to predict the outcomes for the patients. Under thesecircumstances, the outcome for each study patient is not independent ofthose for other patients at that institution, and the assumptions of conven-tional statistical methods do not hold. The assumption of independencewhen outcomes are related means that measures of variability, such as the95 percent confidence interval, appear to be more precise than they reallyare. The true 95 percent confidence interval is wider than it appears to befrom the findings of the study, which means that an apparent true differ-ence may be consistent with random variation between the study patientswho receive the intervention and those who do not. The use of an appro-priate statistical design can account for the effects of clustering, so that thestatistical power of the study and the widths of resulting confidence inter-vals are accurately known. Widening of the 95 percent confidence intervalafter this statistical adjustment is made means that clustering of outcomesis present. Clustering of outcomes makes it more difficult to conclude thata difference between two interventions is due to the interventions ratherthan to chance variation. Clustering of outcomes is especially important in studies in which the deployment of an intervention may vary from practitioner to practitioneror from study site to study site. CAM experts commonly cite the special roleof the practitioner as a characteristic of CAM interventions, so it is impor-tant to know when outcomes vary in this way. If adjustment for clusteringwidens the confidence interval, the clustering of outcomes by provider or bysite may be occurring. If some providers or sites are doing better (or worse),researchers have an opportunity to discover what makes certain providersor sites more effective. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE Hierarchies of Evidence The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (1996) and groups organized to develop treatment guidelines have adopted a concept of \"levels of evi- dence \" or a \"hierarchy of evidence \" that they use to rate the strength of theAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 95 body of published data on a specific test or treatment. The Task Force 's approach to rating evidence appears in Table 3-1. Note that it does not usea hierarchy of study designs ranging from the most powerful (randomizedclinical trials) to the weakest (case series). Rather, it uses generic character-istics of a study and of a group of studies. In effect, the term \"well de- signed \" reflects a hierarchy of study designs, but a hierarchy is not an explicit part of the Task Force 's evidence hierarchy. The principal product of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is recommendations for using preventive interventions in office-based clinicalpractice. The Task Force has a hierarchy of rating of the strengths ofrecommendations, which it has refined over the two decades of its exist-ence. The hierarchy of the strengths of recommendations is important be-cause practitioners, health care organizations, and payers pay attention tothe Task Force 's recommendations. An explicit hierarchy of recommenda- tions with definitions that are tied to the strength of evidence makes theTask Force accountable for the strength of its recommendations. A systemof accountability reduces the chance that the Task Force will make anarbitrary recommendation. The hierarchy of strengths of recommendationsappears in Table 3-2.TABLE 3-1 The Evidence Rating System of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Overall rating Good Fair Poor Definition of \"good \" Consistent results Well designed, well conducted Representative populations Directly assesses effects on health outcomes Definition of \"fair\" Evidence adequate to determine effects on health outcomes but limited by \u2014Number, quality, or consistency of studies \u2014Generalizability to routine practice \u2014Indirect character of the effect on health outcomes Definition of \"poor \" Evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes because \u2014Limited number of studies \u2014Limited power of studies (a wide 95 percent confidence interval that leads to inconclusive results) \u2014Important flaws in study design or conduct \u2014Gaps in the chain of evidence \u2014Lack of information on health outcomes96 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Another hierarchy of evidence, from the National Health Service Cen- tre for Evidence-Based Medicine, appears in Table 3-3. In contrast to theU.S. Preventive Services Task Force hierarchy, this hierarchy depends onthe study design, the number of studies in the body of evidence, and theconsistency of study results. In this hierarchy, the combined results of sev-eral randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) receive the greatest weightin evaluating treatment effectiveness. The results of a single, well-designedRCT is given the next greatest weight. The combined results of observa-tional studies or other non-RCT study designs comes next, followed by caseseries or anecdotal reports, and professional judgment or consensus. A recent IOM report (2001) proposed a slightly different approach to levels of evidence for research when the question considered is one oftreatment effectiveness rather than efficacy. First, that report describesusing an \"effectiveness RCT. \" Such a study would have the following characteristics: light patient exclusion criteria; conducted in a range of treatment settings; treatment provided by the kinds of providers who would provide treatment in non-study settings; no elaborate data collection (e.g., extra lab test or imaging studies); analysis done on \"intention to treat \" basis; and random assignment with one or more control groups. Further, that report takes the position that when evaluating treatment effectiveness, \"the results of a single well-designed outcomes study shouldTABLE 3-2 Strength of Recommendation and Strength of Evidence, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force A Strongly recommend Good evidence; benefits substantially outweigh harms B Recommend At least fair evidence; benefits outweigh harms C U.S. Preventive Services Task Force makes no recommendation Fair to good evidence; benefits and harms closely balanced D Recommend against routine use Ineffective or harms outweigh potential benefits E Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against Lack of evidence on clinical outcomes Poor quality of existing studies Good quality studies with conflicting results Confidence interval includes clinically important benefitsAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 97 TABLE 3-3 Example of a Hierarchy of Evidence from the National Health Service Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, 2002 An A-level recommendation for therapy Level 1a evidence \u2014Systematic review of many RCTs (with homogeneity) Level 1b evidence \u2014A single RCT with narrow confidence intervals Level 1c evidence \u2014Case series of a disease from which all patients died before the new treatment; now some survive \u2014Case series of a disease from which many patients died before the new treatment; now all survive A B-level recommendation for therapy Level 2a evidence \u2014Systematic review of many cohort studies (with homogeneity) Level 2b evidence \u2014A single-cohort study Includes randomized clinical trial with >20 percent drop-outs Level 2c evidence \u2014Ecological studies (performed with a preexisting dataset) Level 3a evidence \u2014Systematic review of many case-control studies (with homogeneity) Level 3b evidence \u2014A single case-control study A C-level recommendation for therapy Level 4 evidence \u2014Case series \u2014Poor-quality cohort and case-control studies A D-level recommendation for therapy Level 5 evidence \u2014Expert opinion without an explicit critical appraisal of the evidence \u2014Expert opinion based on Physiology Bench research \"First principles \" SOURCE: Adapted from Phillips et al.

In this report about CAM, the committee has chosen not to recommend one particular hierarchy; however, it does emphasize the following points:98 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE In general an RCT is the preferred study design if the issue is estab- lishing treatment efficacy. More studies are better than fewer studies, therefore a meta-analysis of multiple good RCTs is better than one good RCT. Other study designs can provide evidence of efficacy or effectiveness. Meta-analysis of multiple non-RCT studies is better than one non- RCT study. Meta-analysis of multiple non-RCT studies may or may not bebetter than one good RCT; it depends on the details of the studies and thespecific question being asked. If the question is treatment effectiveness, then some features of the typical RCT (stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria; treatment given in high-quality, high-volume detailed, frequent patient follow-up; etc.)create problems in generalizing findings to routine practice settings. Other study designs, including observational studies or \"effective- ness RCTs, \" may provide evidence that is at least equally compelling as that provided by an \"efficacy RCT. \" Effect size is another consideration that must be taken into account along with features of study design when one weighs the strength of evi-dence for a particular therapy. Treatments with clear, dramatic, positiveeffects in small or less well-controlled studies may be deemed \"efficacious \" sooner than treatments with more modest effects.TABLE 3-4 Hierarchy of Evidence Level Emphasis on Efficacy Emphasis on Effectiveness I Systematic Review (e.g., meta- Systematic Review (e.g., meta- analysis of Several Well-Controlled analysis) of Several Well-Designed Randomized Trials \u2014consistent results Outcome or results II Single Well-Controlled Randomized Single Well-Designed Outcomes Trial Study or \"Effectiveness RCT \" III Consistent Findings from Multiple Cohort, Case-Control, or Observational Studies IV Single Cohort, Case-Control, or Observational Study V Uncontrolled Experiment, Unsystematic Observation, Expert Opinion, or Consensus Judgments SOURCE: IOM, 2001.APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 99 APPLYING CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH METHODS TO CAM The remainder of this chapter discusses the context in which research- ers will apply these established research methods, including the idea thatCAM users may present particular needs for research, that CAM interven-tions may pose particular problems in applying research methods that haveworked well for conventional medicine, and that such interventions mayalso expose some of the weaknesses of applying contemporary researchpractices to conventional medicine. Decision Makers and Sources of Evidence Lewith and colleagues (2001) have described the different decisions that various participants in health care make about treatments and howthey use different kinds of information to make those decisions. Patients,providers, insurers, government policy makers, and others typically requiredifferent types of evidence and different amounts of certainty to decide foror against a particular treatment or treatment modality. The committeerecognized that a discussion of evidence of CAM treatment effectivenessmust be set in the context of the differences among users of informationabout CAM in terms of the decisions that they make, the information thatthey need to make those decisions, and the way(s) in which they thinkabout treatment effectiveness. Researchers Researchers are typically interested in understanding cause-and-effect relationships between underlying mechanisms of illness, treatments designedto alter those mechanisms, and patient outcomes. Researchers trained inWestern cultures and scientific traditions generally think in terms of linearcause-and-effect and try to identify the simplest possible causal models (i.e.,the fewest explanatory variables and the simplest relationships among thosevariables) that account for the observed associations (Nisbett, 2003). Scien-tists from other cultures, however, may be more likely to think in terms ofmore complex \"system \" models that involve multiple factors and multiple levels of relationships and highly interactive and iterative, rather than lin-ear, relationships (Nisbett, 2003). The results of a given study are taken as evidence of cause-and-effect relationships to the extent that certain criteria are met. These criteria typi-cally include Features of the study design that allow strong inferences to be made about cause-and-effect relationships:100 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE \u2014a well-defined population to whom the conclusions apply; \u2014a well-defined, sufficiently large, and representative sample drawn population; \u2014a well-defined and controlled treatment(s) administration; \u2014a concurrent control or comparison group(s), when possible, that receives either no treatment or some different form or dose of the studytreatment; \u2014well-defined study endpoints (objectively defined and measured outcome variables); and \u2014statistical analysis to assess the likelihood that the findings are produced by chance. Plausible biological mechanisms, that is, the ability to fit the ob- served relationships into some larger body of theory and evidence on howthe body works. Consistency of findings from study to study. A single study is rarely definitive, although some large, well-designed clinical trials may produceevidence that is treated by the scientific community as definitive. Confi-dence in the existence of cause-and-effect relationships grows with theability to see them in multiple studies over time. Confidence diminisheswhen results vary from study to study. Dose-response relationships. In most biological processes, the intro- duction of a larger amount of a substance produces a larger subsequenteffect. There is almost always some upper limit at which no further effect isfound or some different or counterbalancing biological process begins totake over. For the most part, however, within a reasonable range of doses,more \"cause \" produces more \"effect. \" Clear dose-response relationships typically increase the confidence in the underlying causal relationships be-tween the treatment and the outcome. Teachers Training New Practitioners Medical school, nursing school, and allied health school faculty require evidence of treatment effectiveness to determine how to train students. Thestandards of evidence for specific treatments are not necessarily the same asthose used by researchers, but they are similar. They include The criteria for researchers listed above. Faculty have the responsi- bility to stay current with the published literature and generally to apply thesame criteria to published studies that researchers apply. Personal experience. In addition, however, clinical faculty draw heavily on their own experiences in determining which treatments are effec-tive and which ones are not. This may be particularly true in the context ofAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 101 clinical rotations and residency training, in which much teaching is done on the basis of an apprenticeship model in a specific clinical environment. Inthis setting, both faculty and students have a chance to observe, directly andtogether, the effectiveness of specific treatments. The extent to which the treatment in question is a \"standard of practice \" in the medical community or is moving toward that standing. Students entering a profession become part of a professional community,and part of their learning involves knowing what the standards and typicalpractices of that community are. There is often a gap in time between thepublication of scientific evidence of the effectiveness of a new treatment andthe widespread adoption of that treatment by most or all members of aprofessional community, along with some appropriate caution and skepti-cism about new findings that seem to run counter to daily experience.Teachers train students in what the members of the professional commu-nity typically do on a daily basis as well as what the published literature says that they could or should do. Practicing Clinicians Clinicians treating patients have a somewhat more complex set of information requirements about treatment effectiveness, because they mustknow not only what has worked or what should have been effective in theabstract but also what they are actually able to do in the context of theirown training and skills, their own practice settings, and their own sets ofpatients. Their requirements for information on treatment effectivenessinclude All of the preceding criteria, although many active clinicians will not have the same amount of time as their researcher or faculty colleagues do tomonitor developments in the published literature. Consistency of a new practice with other aspects of current practice. A psychotherapist may accept the published evidence about the effective-ness of a specific herb for the treatment of depression but may be unwillingto incorporate the use of the herb into his or her own practice because of aprofessional commitment to therapies based on a different theory and con-ceptual model of mental illness. The availability of essential equipment, trained staff, supplies, and anything else necessary to provide a treatment safely and effectively. Manytreatments require specialized equipment, training, or support staff that arenot readily available to all clinicians. Difficulty in learning new skills (e.g., for new surgical procedures). The acceptability of a new treatment to patients and others in the community. Health care is usually a two-way human interaction; and po-102 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE tentially effective treatments will not be used if they conflict with the be- liefs, cultural values, or expectations of large numbers of patients in apractice. Opinions of professional peers. In an environment in which it is impossible to keep up with all new advances in treatment, the opinions andpractices of respected colleagues are a kind of evidence of treatment effec-tiveness that is often dominant. Reimbursement policies affecting a new treatment. Even when all other criteria have been met, a new treatment may not be adopted if theprovision of it will not be adequately reimbursed. The extent to which the patient population is similar to those stud- ied in clinical trials or other studies of treatment effectiveness. There arealways variations in published studies of treatment effectiveness, and clini-cians may legitimately believe that what works for many or most patientswill not necessarily work for their own patients, particularly if they sharesome clinically relevant characteristic (Park, 2002). Employers or Purchasers and Insurers Those who pay for health care through insurance care about effective- ness, but also about cost-effectiveness, since they have at least some respon-sibility to use the dollars available for insurance to produce the bestpossible health benefit for covered employees. Evidence of treatment effec-tiveness relevant to employers and insurers, then, includes The scientific evidence listed above for researchers. The preferences, expectations, and experiences of employees and their families. Employers are not insuring passive and uninformed people.Employees who have positive experiences with specific therapies will askfor such therapies to be covered by insurance plans and may use coveragefor those therapies as the basis for choosing one plan over another at openenrollment or even changing jobs. Published cost-effectiveness studies (when available). Employers and insurers may legitimately refuse to cover treatments that are effective butthat are so costly that their inclusion prevents the coverage of less costlytreatments that provide more health benefit to larger numbers of people. Internal cost-effectiveness analyses (for some larger employers). Large companies with many thousands of employees may be able to usetheir own databases to study relationships between treatments and workattendance, productivity, or the costs of illness. This information maybe more compelling than information in published studies because there isno question about the generalizability of the findings to that employer 's population.APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 103 Patients and Consumers Individual patients generally do not have direct access to peer-reviewed journals, and most patients do not have the technical background to inter-pret the results of published treatment-effectiveness studies. This informa-tion tends to be filtered through someone else before it reaches the indi-vidual patient. In addition, patients (particularly those with chronicconditions) have their own experiences to draw on and can judge treatmenteffectiveness by the extent to which their own symptoms or functionalstatus improve with treatment. Information on treatment effectiveness forindividual patients, then, comes mainly from Information provided by a clinician(s) in one-on-one treatment encounters, Word of mouth from friends and relatives, The lay press or media, Direct-to-consumer advertising, Internet, Direct personal experience (particularly for patients with chronic conditions), and Communications from illness advocacy groups. The Application of Contemporary Clinical Research Methods to CAM: Some Cautions Although the concept of levels of evidence has generally been accepted and widely used in many domains of conventional medicine, some questionits applicability to CAM therapies or to individual treatment decisions forspecific patients. These questions particularly relate to the use of RCTs asthe \"gold standard \" of evidence. Given the broad array of modalities that are included within the definition of CAM, it may be that some CAMtherapies are more amenable to evaluation than others. Questions aboutthe applicability of clinical research methods to CAM are described anddiscussed below. Emphasis on Efficacy Rather Than Effectiveness As noted above, the distinction between efficacy and effectiveness re- fers to the extent to which a treatment has a measurable positive effect inhighly controlled clinical trial contexts (efficacy) versus whether the treat-ment has a measurable positive effect in routine daily clinical practice withunselected clinicians and patients (effectiveness). Efficacy refers to what atreatment can do under ideal circumstances; effectiveness refers to what a104 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE treatment does do in routine daily use. Because the highest level of evidence in most evidence hierarchies is the combined results of several RCTs, theresulting recommendations will inevitably be based on evidence of efficacyrather than evidence of effectiveness. Difficult to Apply to Therapies for Which RCTs Are Difficult, Expensive, or Unethical It may be impossible to organize RCTs in situations in which the effects to be observed occur rarely, take many years to develop, or are relativelysubtle. It is also difficult to conduct RCTs in situations in which the treat-ment is already in wide use and is generally accepted as effective. It mayalso be difficult or impossible to randomize patients to CAM modalities orspecific therapies that inherently depend on patients ' belief, faith, or confi- dence in or relationship with a particular modality or provider. (See thediscussion of \"preference trials \" in Chapter 4 for one way to address this problem.) Hard to Apply to Treatments That Become Popular and Widely Used Very Quickly Study participants may not accept random assignment to a placebo or some other type of control groups if the general public believes that thetreatment being studied is widely effective. Likewise, institutional reviewboards may not be willing to approve randomization to a placebo or an-other control group if the professional community believes that the therapybeing studied is widely effective. In addition to the problem of organizingRCTs for widely used treatments, there may also be a problem with allother study designs that involve some form of control condition that in-volves administration of a possibly ineffective treatment. Relatively Long Delay from First Development of a Treatment to Assembly of Large Body of Evidence The FDA has requirements for research on new drugs before they can be prescribed, but there are no similar requirements for surgical proceduresand most CAM modalities. In both cases, there may be a long time lag(several years, in some instances) between the development and the first useof a treatment and the assembly of a body of scientific evidence of effective-ness. For drugs, this lag is invisible to most of the general public, and someevidence from RCTs must have been assembled before a drug is allowed onthe market. For other treatments, however, the time required to organize anRCT or collect the results of other types of studies means that a large bodyAPPROACHES TO EVIDENCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS 105 of anecdotal experience will have been developed before more formal scien- tific evidence appears. For many CAM therapies based on traditional cul-tural beliefs, this time lag may be measured in hundreds of years. Emphasis on What's Best for Largest Number Rather Than Search for What's Best for Unique, Individual Patients A treatment is judged effective in an RCT if it is better than a placebo or an alternative form of treatment. \"Better \" means that the average out- come for the experimental group is superior to that for a control group, asdetermined by statistical tests that relate the difference in average outcomesto the variation in outcomes in the two groups. Unless the differencesbetween the experimental group and the control group are dramatic, how-ever, there are usually some patients in the experimental group who doworse than some patients in the control group (Park, 2002). What is best,then, for the \"typical \" or \"average \" patient is not necessarily best for every patient. This approach to identifying effective treatments is fundamentallydifferent from the approach that emphasizes individual tailoring of treat-ments found in CAM modalities like homeopathy or traditional Chinesemedicine. The desire to have objective, well-defined study endpoints in RCTs can lead to a focus on health outcomes like mortality, tumor shrinkage, orchange in a measurable physiological parameter like temperature or bloodpressure. An exclusive focus on objective endpoints can lead researchers tomiss or ignore other effects in the realm of subjective symptoms (e.g., pain,fatigue, and cognitive function) and general well-being. For many CAMtherapies, the treatment goals include feelings of well-being and mastery ofthe illness (Jonas and Linde, 2002); these will not be captured in studieswith more objectively defined primary endpoints. Wellness Versus Treatment Effectiveness as a Research Objective Recent national surveys (see Chapter 2; Astin, 1998; Astin et al., 2000) have highlighted the fact that many CAM \"treatments \" are not used to treat a specific current problem or disease but, rather, are used to eitherprevent disease or to promote a more general state of health and well-being.RCTs may still be used to assess the effects of CAM on general health orwell-being, but such RCTs may be even more difficult to conduct thanRCTs of the effectiveness of treatments for specific diseases. RCTs in thedomain of disease prevention or wellness enhancement may require muchlonger time lines (e.g., 10 to 20 years or more), very large sample sizesbecause of the relatively low incidence of specific medical problems beingprevented, or even larger sample sizes because of the potential of loss to106 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE follow-up or switching of treatment arms over the course of the study (i.e., patients randomized to the presumed active treatment quit taking or doingit, and patients randomized to the control arm begin to take or do the activetreatment on their own). Some outcome variables may be hard to defineand measure (e.g., \"I just feel better \"), and effect sizes may be small, again adding to the sample size required for a trial to have a reasonable chance ofdetecting an effect if it is truly present. Finally, patients will inevitably bedoing several things that contribute to wellness (or lack of it) over amultiyear study period, and it will be difficult to isolate the effects of aCAM therapy or modality from the effects of a larger package of lifestylefactors.

Sci Am 246(4):120 -134.1084 Need for Innovative Designs in Research on CAM and Conventional Medicine CHARACTERISTICS OF CAM TREATMENTS AND MODALITIES Standard randomized controlled trials (RCTs); which consist of two or three study arms, large numbers of patients in each study arm, one specific,standard treatment or dose of treatment per study arm, and 1 or 2 years offollow-up may be ill-suited to answer questions about the long-term effectsof complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies on diseaseprevention and wellness. Several characteristics of CAM treatments andmodalities are also difficult to incorporate into treatment effectiveness stud-ies with shorter time lines as well as studies with more clearly definedsymptom relief or disease state endpoints. These characteristics are notunique to CAM and are further discussed below. CAM modalities frequently use \"bundles\" of therapies rather than just one therapy in isolation. Survey data show that patients who use one CAM modality frequently use other CAM modalities at the same time and useCAM modalities along with conventional medicine treatments for the samecondition (Eisenberg et al., 1993, 1998; Wolsko et al., 2002). Although itmay be possible to enroll patients in a study that restricts their treatments toone at a time, it is difficult, scientifically questionable, and possibly evenunethical to restrict for study purposes treatments that would naturallyaccompany the specific therapy or modality being studied. For example, itmay be difficult to conduct an RCT of a specific massage therapy techniqueif a large fraction of patients who receive this treatment in routine practicewould also receive various combinations of herbal therapies, aromatherapy,stretching and exercise recommendations, and relaxation therapies.NEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 109 It is often difficult to define the thing to be studied. Patients receiving homeopathy might also be accurately described as receiving a particulartype, class, or school of homeopathic treatment; treatment from a particu-lar type of provider or individual provider; and treatment with a particularmaterial or combination of materials. Research could conceivably be doneto establish the effectiveness of any of these things, from the most general tothe most specific. The level of analysis that would be most informative forclinicians, individual patients, or health policy makers is not obvious. Thisproblem is occasionally encountered in conventional medicine but less com-monly than in CAM, as questions about effectiveness typically pertain tovery precisely defined therapies rather than to whole disciplines or schoolsof thought (e.g., medicine, surgery, or radiation therapy). As a matter ofconvenience, one may speak of a study comparing surgical and medicaltreatments for low back pain, but a study would typically define the treat-ments in each domain quite specifically and not presume to be evaluatingall possible treatments that might be offered under those broad labels. InCAM, however, there is a greater tendency to pose research questionsabout the effectiveness of whole modalities or schools of thought; for ex-ample, does chiropractic work for back or neck pain, and does acupuncturework for headache? In CAM, treatments are individualized for each patient, and treatments may be individualized for each patient at each treatment (Park, 2002) One reason that research questions may be posed about whole CAM modalitiesat a time is that in some CAM modalities (e.g., traditional Chinese medi-cine) there is no such thing as a \"standard \" treatment or dose. Individual- ization of therapy to a unique combination of patient characteristics is acore concept of the modality. The only common characterstics to be stud-ied across multiple patients and generalized from a study sample to a largeruniverse of patients are the modality and the general approach taken by thepractitioner. Everything else can and will vary from patient to patient, atleast in principle. Some treatments are presumed to depend on the unique characteristics of the healer and on features of the healer-patient relationship. In some of the energy or touch therapies, for example, qi gong, the effectiveness of thetreatment is presumed to be inherently bound up in a skill or an ability ofthe healer that may be viewed as a gift and therefore not easily measurableor generalizable (Krieger, 1998). This is not a completely foreign conceptto research in conventional medicine; studies of surgical procedures typi-cally take the skill or experience of the surgeon into account in some way;and studies of psychotherapy may take into account some measure of theskill, empathy level, or experience of the therapist. It is a complicatingfactor for research in any study in which the talents of service providersincluding conventional medicine vary and can be very problematic if the110 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE skill or talent of the healer cannot be quantified in the same way that experience (e.g., number of patients treated) can. The problem is morecomplicated yet when treatment effectiveness is presumed to depend on aparticular relationship, rapport, or bond between the patient and the healer.Unless that relationship or rapport can be defined and assessed at the startof a research trial, there is a risk that a poor outcome will be used asevidence that the necessary relationship did not exist and a good outcomewill be used as evidence that it did. For many CAM therapies, there is a need to pay explicit attention to placebo or expectation effects. In most studies in conventional medicine that include a placebo control arm, the goal of the study is to show that thetreatment in question is superior to the placebo. The underlying assump-tion is that a placebo effect is not real biologically and that the treatmentbeing studied can be deemed to have an effect only if the outcomes thatresult from the treatment are significantly better than those from the pla-cebo. In many CAM modalities (and in some conventional medicine mo-dalities as well), however, the placebo effect is an inherent part of themechanism of treatment efficacy. That is, the benefit obtained by the pa-tient is at least partially due to his or her own sense of hope, positiveexpectation, and activation of self-healing processes. One cannot design astudy to eliminate these processes as explanations for outcomes, since theyare, by definition within the CAM modality, not a source of noise orconfounding but part of the essence of the treatment itself. In evaluations of CAM therapies, end points may be difficult to mea- sure in a standardized way. The techniques used to measure subjective experiences like pain, fatigue, the ability to perform daily activities, andmood state have experienced significant advances in the past 20 years(IOM, 1999). CAM treatments intended to produce benefits in these areasshould be evaluable by using existing, standardized measures with strongscientific foundations. Other potential outcomes of CAM treatments, however, are not as well defined or measurable. Feelings of general well-being, energy balance, har-mony, or centeredness may be harder to measure in a reliable way, andperhaps hard to interpret outside the worldview or belief system of a spe-cific CAM modality. Patients receiving an energy-based CAM therapy, forexample, may very well understand questions about energy balance, andreliable and valid measures may be developed in the context of that therapy.The questions may not make as much sense to patients and the measuresmay not work as well, however, for patients receiving other treatmentmodalities. It will therefore be difficult to compare scores on such a mea-sure across groups in comparative studies of the energy balance therapy andother CAM or non-CAM therapies. The same problem could hold in re-verse, in that quantitative measures of pain intensity, for example, may notNEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 111 make sense and may not have acceptable psychometric properties for pa- tients receiving CAM modalities that do not take a quantitative approachto sensations like pain. In both CAM and conventional medicine, there are treatments that have some defined boundaries or ranges of acceptable options, as embodiedin a training manual, but the healer or provider may have immense room touse variations and his or her own judgment in individual interactions withspecific patients. Many psychotherapies, for example, have a general frame- work and some well-defined features or boundaries, but the specific wordsused or issues raised at any point in time in a therapy session may differ.These decisions are up to the therapist and are based on a combination offormal training, experience, instinct, and immediate feedback from thepatient. It is extremely difficult to study the effectiveness of a specificutterance or even sequence of microlevel interactions between the therapistand the patient, but it may be possible to study the effectiveness of anindividual therapist or the approach to therapy taken as a whole. Similarly,in some CAM modalities, it will not be possible to study the effectiveness ofa specific maneuver performed in the context of a 30-minute hands-oninteraction with a patient (e.g., massage), but it may be possible to evaluatethe effectiveness of the approach taken as a whole in comparison with thatof some alternative approach to the same problem. INNOVATIVE STUDY DESIGNS TO ASSESS TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF CAM 1 Addressing the special challenges mentioned above for research in CAM will require a broadening of thinking about the types of study designs thatcan produce valid evidence of treatment effectiveness. RCTs and system-atic reviews of multiple RCTs will still stand as the \"gold standard \" of evidence when the key questions have to do with treatment efficacy andwhen the treatment is amenable to the narrow definition, standardization,and the use of strict controls typical of RCTs. (See Chapter 5 for a discus-sion of such trials.) When RCTs cannot be done, however, or when theresults of RCTs may not be generalizable to the real world of CAM prac-tice, it will be necessary to use other study designs. Some of these optionsare described in the following sections. 1This section is largely based on work by Naihua Duan, Joel Braslow, Alison Hamilton Brown, Ted J. Kaptchuk, and Louise E. Tallen in a commissioned paper prepared for the committee 's use.112 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE N-of-1 Trials For some CAM therapies for some patients, it may be possible to organize a series of off-on administrations of a specific therapy. For example,baseline pulmonary function can be tested in patients receiving a homeopathictherapy for hay fever or asthma; and then the therapy can be administeredfor a period of time, stopped for a period of time and replaced by a placebo,re-administered for a period of time, and so on. Unless the clinician and thepatient are both active participants in the essential therapeutic process,both would be blinded as to whether an active treatment or a placebo wasgiven. This may be feasible with many homeopathic or herbal treatments,but it may not be possible with manual manipulation or aromatherapy.The sequence of off and on may also be randomized within and acrosspatients. Treatments for stable, chronic conditions are best suited to this sort of study, as treatment effectiveness can be determined by the extent to whicha defined outcome (seasonal allergies or asthma, in this example) varieswith administration of the treatment under study. Inferences are cleanestwhen a short latency exists between treatment administration and effectand when the treatment has little or no long-lasting effect. When theseconditions hold, an N-of-1 trial (a trial with a single subject) can provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of the treatment for that patient. Mul-tiple N-of-1 trials of the same treatment with pooling of the results for adequate numbers of patients can provide the same kind of evidence ofeffectiveness that would be available through traditional RCTs, assumingthat the patients were representative of some larger population to whomthe results could be generalized. This approach would be particularly well-suited to CAM therapies that are highly individualized. Each N-of-1 trial, if successful, would provide evidence of the effectiveness of a specific treat-ment in that one patient; multiple successful trials would provide evidenceof the effectiveness of the general concept or manual methods. Preference RCTs In most RCTs, patients who agree to participate in the trial also agree to accept randomization to study arms, that is, to active treatment or aplacebo treatment. They receive the treatment to which they are random-ized, regardless of any preferences that they may have. This kind of studymay be difficult to carry out when treatments are already in widespreaduse, are generally presumed to be effective, or just seem that they should beeither more effective or less risky. In these situations a \"preference RCT \" is appropriate and may also allow the effects of patient preferences on out-comes to be tested empirically.NEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 113 In a preference RCT (Brewin and Bradley, 1989; McPherson and Britton, 1999; Elbourne, 2000), a pool of eligible patients isfirst asked to indicate whether they have a preference among the treatmentsbeing compared. Those who have a preference are given that treatment.Those expressing no preference are randomized to a treatment arm as in atraditional RCT. If the pool of patients is sufficiently large, the designallows three sets of comparisons to be made among the treatments: (1) theeffectiveness of different treatments among the randomized patients (whichis the same as that in a traditional RCT); (2) the effectiveness of differenttreatments in those who chose those treatments; and (3) the effectiveness ofa specific treatment in those randomized to it compared with the effective-ness in those who chose it. This analysis provides a stronger base fromwhich to make inferences about the effects of treatments in routine dailypractice, when patients typically receive a particular treatment on the basisof their preferences. Wennberg and colleagues (1993) describe a pilot preference RCT in the atricle, Outcomes Research, PORTs, and Health Care Reform. The cur-rently funded NIH Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT), whichis in the final stages of recruiting, is another example of this design. This type of study design may be useful for the study of many CAM modalities for which therapies are widely presumed by practitioners andthe lay public to be safe and effective and patients may have existing prefer-ences either for or against a specific therapy. Observational and Cohort Studies Observational and cohort studies involve the identification of patients who are eligible for study and who may receive a specified treatment butwho may not choose the therapy received as part of the study. Problemswith the inferences about effectiveness that can be drawn from observa-tional studies are well known, but in some instances data from these studiesmay be the only or the best data available. One of the most well-knownand recent examples of this comes from the Women 's Health Initiative (WHI). In response to observational data that hormone supplements mayimprove a woman 's health peri- and postmenopause, WHI prospectively evaluated the benefits and risks to women of taking hormones during meno-pause and concluded that the overall health risks exceeded the benefits(Rossouw et al., 2002). The problems with causal inferences in studies with these designs mainly have to do with the possibility that unmeasured patient characteristics, notbalanced by random assignment to treatment, may be the true cause of anyeffects observed (Little and Rubin, 2000). Methods that can be used tocontrol for measured characteristics (e.g., analysis of covariance, linear114 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE regression, and stratification analysis) have been available for many years, but methods that can be used to control for unmeasured characteristics arerelatively newer. It is now possible to control for baseline patient charac-teristics (measured and unmeasured) in better ways by use of analyses likeinstrumental variable analysis (Hogan and Lancaster, 2004; Newgard etal., 2004; and Schembri, 2004; Mealli et al., 2004). A detaileddiscussion of these analytic methods is beyond the charge of this committee,but both methods allow valid causal inferences about treatment effective-ness to be drawn from observational studies. Case-Control Studies Other study designs discussed in this chapter are prospective, that is, they identify a pool of eligible patients before treatment is given, and thepatients are then monitored through the period of treatment with a series ofstructured and scheduled measurement instruments. For some questionsabout CAM treatment effectiveness, however, it may not be possible tomount a reasonable prospective study (for example, if there is no practicalway of identifying patients with a defined health problem or identifying andrecruiting patients before treatment begins). On the other hand, it may beuseful to try to obtain evidence of effectiveness by evaluating data for largenumbers of patients who have received the treatment in the past. A case-control study is one example of a study that starts with outcomes andworks backwards. A case-control study involves the identification of people with good or bad health outcomes (e.g., those with a serious illness and those without anillness, those who died of an illness and those who were cured, or those whohad relief of chronic pain, and those who did not), and then the assessmentof a large number of variables, including the treatments received, to identifythe factors correlated with a good or a bad outcome. The case-control design has a long history in epidemiology and public health; in many instances it is the only effective way of conducting a firstinquiry into a presumed cause-effect relationship. The case-control designhas important limitations: no matter how detailed and thorough the datacollection may be, it is still possible that unknown or unmeasured variablesmay be the true cause of the differences in outcomes observed and that therelationships observed in the study are not truly causal (Gordis, 1996).Despite its limitations, a case-control study may be an effective way tobegin a line of inquiry about treatment effectiveness in CAM, as long as theinquiry continues by use of studies with stronger prospective designs toconfirm any presumed causal relationships determined from the findings ofthe case-control study.NEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 115 Studies of Bundles or Combinations of Therapies As mentioned above, it is uncommon for CAM treatments to be given alone, in the sense of either CAM monotherapy or CAM as a strict alterna-tive to traditional medicine. Instead, most patients use a mix of CAM andconventional therapies simultaneously. Studying the effectiveness of onepart of a complex mix of treatments is difficult, unless it is possible in thecontext of a complex study design to vary one part of a package of thera-pies while the rest of the package is held constant. In most instances, it willbe difficult or impossible to isolate the effects of one part of a complextreatment package, but it may be possible to study the effectiveness of thebundle as a whole by using essentially any of the designs described in thissection. This will not be fully satisfying to most scientists trained in West-ern reductionist traditions, but such studies may be adequate to help pa-tients make informed decisions about treatment approaches or for healthpolicymakers or insurance companies to make decisions about coverageand payment. Some study designs and analytic methods, however, are better suited than others to unraveling the effects of specific parts of a complex treat-ment package. Observational studies with very large sample sizes can evalu-ate multiple instances of a large number of specific treatment combina-tions. They also allow the observation of many complex interactionsbetween patient characteristics and treatment features. The choice of ana-lytic method depends on the presumed underlying mathematics of the com-bined effects of vectors of patient, provider, treatment, and environmentalfactors. If these relationships are presumed to be basically linear and addi-tive, then well-known multiple linear regression or logistic regression mod-els can be used to achieve at least a first approximation to the causalrelationships in question. A class of methods known as recursive partition-ing may be appropriate if the relationships are presumed to be multiplica-tive or interactive, i.e., the effects of one variable depend on the presence, orvalue, of one or more other variables, a very likely assumption in manyCAM studies in which the interactions among patient characteristics andtreatments are presumed to be crucial. Again, a detailed discussion of thisis beyond the scope of this report, but well-developed statistical methods,specifically designed to identify the interactive effects of large numbers ofcausal factors acting simultaneously on a defined outcome variable areavailable. Studies of \"Manualized\" Therapies Many CAM therapies involve the application of general concepts, theo- ries, or methods but allow for considerable variation in the selection of a116 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE specific intervention for a single patient at a single point in time, for ex- ample acupuncture and herbal medicine. In most instances this variation isan inherent part of the underlying philosophy of the CAM modality, as itallows the treatment to be tailored to the characteristics of the patient, hisor her symptoms, the practitioner, and the time and place of treatment. Itis not error or unwanted treatment variability; on the contrary, it may bepart of the essence of the CAM approach to be evaluated. The standardization of treatment characteristic of most clinical research in conventional medicine is therefore inappropriate for studies of these\"manualized \" therapies that make up part of CAM. By definition and theory, these treatments cannot be standardized in the same way in whichdrug treatments are standardized by substance, dose, and route and timingof administration. There is precedent for effectiveness research in this do-main, however, most notably in psychotherapy (Wampold et al., 1997). Inpsychotherapy effectiveness research, a model, theory, or general approachis defined and standardized; but the specific utterances by the therapist andthe content of interactions between therapist and patient vary. Effectiveness studies can be conducted on those aspects of the manualized therapies that can be defined and standardized: one generalapproach versus another approach, one school of thought versus anotherschool of thought, or one intensity or duration of treatment versus an-other. These studies would be examples of what Tunis et al. (2003) call\"practical clinical trials. \" With some CAM modalities, it may be possible to study the effectiveness of an approach, the school or the intensity oftreatment, and the use of a no-treatment or a placebo control as the com-parison group. When effectiveness has already been shown relative to theresults for the no-treatment controls, studies can be designed to comparemore specific features of the general approach or modality. The designs used for these kinds of studies are not necessarily any different from those used for effectiveness studies in conventional medi-cine. RCTs, as well as studies with less well-controlled prospective orretrospective designs, may be possible. Statistical methods, outcome mea-sures, sample sizes, and the scope of the conclusions that are drawn mayalso be essentially the same, because the essence of a typical study would bethe comparison of an average outcome and variability in outcomes acrosstwo or more groups defined by differences in treatment approaches. It will not be possible, however, to draw conclusions about any of the specific aspects of treatment that vary without constraint, nor will it bepossible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of an individual pro-vider or therapist unless well-controlled N-of-1 study designs are used in which the individual therapist is the intervention being studied.NEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 117 Placebo or Expectation Effects Many CAM modalities include patients ' hopes, expectations, emo- tional states, energies, and other self-healing processes as part of their core\"mechanisms of action. \" Studies of effectiveness of these modalities and therapies cannot consider these factors to be extraneous confounders thatare separate from the mechanism(s) of action being tested, as would typi-cally be the case in effectiveness research in conventional medicine. If the core research question in a CAM effectiveness study involves the identification of a mechanism of action apart from or in addition to non-specific placebo or expectation effects, then a traditional two-arm studycomparing a particular treatment to placebo control would be appropriate.Studies of herbal remedies with inert substances in the control condition orstudies of acupuncture with sham-treated controls (Biella et al., 2001) wouldbe examples of this kind of study design. The only CAM therapies ormodalities for which this design would not be appropriate would be thosethat do not claim any mechanism of action other than the patients ' own expectations or self-healing processes. It is also possible to design studies that specifically manipulate the nonspecific placebo or expectation effects to determine whether variationof the \"dose\" of this variable can influence outcomes. For example, Pollo et al. (2001) conducted a study of how different expectations can producedifferent analgesic effects. Three groups of patients were treated withbuprenorphine, given on request for 3 consecutive days, plus a basal intra-venous infusion of saline solution; however each group was given differentinformation about the basal infusions. Group A was told nothing; Group Bwas told that the infusion was either a powerful painkiller or a placebo; and Group C was told that it was a powerful painkiller. The results are shownin Table 4-1. The investigators concluded that \"different verbal instructions about certain and uncertain expectations of analgesia produce different placeboanalgesic effects, which in turn, trigger a dramatic change of behaviorleading to a significant reduction of opioid intake \" (Pollo et al., 2001). Given that expectation or placebo effects are generally presumed to TABLE 4-1 Effect of Expectation on Analgesic Effects Mean Dose (mg) of Group Buprenorphine Administered A 1.15 \u00b1 1.14 B 0.91 \u00b1 0.11 C 0.76 \u00b1 0.15118 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE work in a positive direction, it is difficult to imagine an ethically defensible study design in which expectations were specifically manipulated in nega-tive directions (i.e., telling patients that a treatment does not work). Ac-crual to such a study or the willingness of patients to accept random assign-ment to a study arm described in that way would presumably bechallenging. The ethical and practical limits to manipulation of expecta-tion effects is probably the absence of expectation. Even this limit will bedifficult to reach in many studies of CAM effectiveness if the modalities ortherapies are widely believed to be effective in the general population. Even for CAM modalities whose mechanisms of action are largely or exclusively patient expectations or self-healing processes, it may be possibleto design studies that compare the relative abilities of two or more modali-ties to activate those processes and produce measurable health benefits.For example, an ongoing study of patients with irritable bowel syndromefunded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medi-cine is exploring whether placebo effects (via a sham acupuncture treat-ment) can be enhanced through variations in patient-provider contexts. Attribute-Treatment Interaction Analyses Attribute-treatment interaction analyses is not a study per se but is a way of analyzing data from studies with other designs. A likely result ofeffectiveness studies in both CAM and conventional medicine, almost re-gardless of study design, is variability in outcomes among patients within astudy and among different studies. This variability leads to questions aboutreasons for the variability, which can often be expressed by analysis of thesubgroups in which the treatments are relatively more or less effective.These analyses are referred to as \"attribute-treatment interaction analyses \" (Caspi and Bell, 2004a,b). Because most effectiveness trials are designed with sufficient power to detect differences at the level of the sample as a whole, most subgroupanalyses are exploratory in nature, with the conclusions subject to confir-mation in more definitive studies conducted later. A variety of statisticalmethods are available to perform these analyses (for example, see the ear-lier discussion of recursive partitioning methods); these methods would notbe fundamentally different in studies of the effectiveness of CAM than instudies of the effectivenes of conventional medicine. The variables used toclassify patients would probably be different, however, since diagnostic andother clinical labels identifying meaningful categories of patients would bedifferent between CAM modalities and conventional medicine and amongCAM modalities.NEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 119 Qualitative Methods Qualitative methods are not an alternative design to address effective- ness questions but are a way to make better decisions about measurement,sampling, recruitment, and other aspects of a study design. Questionsabout treatment effectiveness in CAM and in conventional medicine aretypically quantitative in nature and involve assessments of more or less ofsome defined outcome characteristics among patients treated in one wayversus another. Evidence for treatment effectiveness in both CAM andconventional medicine therefore typically comes from quantitative studiesthat use the designs and methods discussed above. Qualitative research (ethnographic studies, focus groups, and in-depth interviews) cannot generally provide direct evidence of treatment effective-ness because of the relatively small sample sizes, the retrospective versus theprospective nature of participant recruitment and sampling, the absence ofrandom assignment of patients to treatment conditions, and the use ofopen-ended versus categorical or close-ended data collection formats. Qualitative research can, however, provide extremely valuable infor- mation to help interpret the results of effectiveness studies or to designthose studies in the best possible way. Qualitative methods can be used to understand the types of patients who use a particular CAM modal- ity, their reasons for using that modality (including perceived effectiveness),and the circumstances or conditions of use; understand other treatments that those patients may be using in addition to the specific modality being studied; understand patients ' and practitioners ' definitions of and criteria for treatment effectiveness; identify factors that may predict better or worse effectiveness (e.g., different levels of patient expectations and better or worse therapist-patientinteractions); and understand patients ' and providers ' models of health and illness and how those models influence CAM use and assessment of treatmenteffectiveness. USE OF BOTH TRADITIONAL AND INNOVATIVE STUDY DESIGNS TO CREATE A RICH BODY OF KNOWLEDGE The committee does not wish to recommend a single study design that is inevitably superior to others or to recommend that studies of treatmenteffectiveness in CAM always be conducted in a specific way. Alternativestudy designs have combinations of strengths and weaknesses; the richestinformation source will be the combined results of studies with several120 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE different designs if the strengths of one complement the weaknesses of another. Classic RCTs, for example, will provide strong evidence of cause-and-effect relationships in carefully controlled circumstances, but ideally,the results would be complemented by the results of outcomes or effective-ness studies if the fundamental questions have to do with treatment effec-tiveness in real-world practice settings (IOM, 1999; Jonas and Linde, 2002). The use of a variety of study designs to produce a rich, complementary body of evidence for specific treatments or modalities is a desirable ap-proach, but in practice, only limited amounts of money and time are avail-able for effectiveness studies. Study sponsors may have to choose betweentraditional and innovative study designs, at least at any one point in time, iftrials are expensive and budgets are limited. In those circumstances, trade-offs need to be examined in the context of the question(s) being addressed. If the fundamental question is one ofsafety, then a surveillance design capable of picking up rare but seriousevents is indicated. If the therapy is relatively new and unknown and thekey questions have to do with efficacy, then a traditional RCT designwould fit. If efficacy is accepted but the questions to be addressed have todo with effectiveness across a range of providers and settings, then a largeoutcomes study aimed at identifying determinants of good and pooroutcomes may be indicated. If the key questions have to do with cost-effectiveness, then a more tightly focused outcomes study (i.e., one withfewer patients, providers, or treatment sites) that includes explicit collec-tion of cost data will be required. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BASIC RESEARCH AND CLINICAL RESEARCH For many treatments, the results of RCTs or other types of clinical studies are the culmination of a much larger sequence of basic researchstudies that grow out of, contribute to, and increase the understanding offundamental biological mechanisms of illness. Clinical trials of newer thera-pies for peptic ulcer, for example, were built on years of basic research onthe roles of bacteria and acids in the generation of ulcers. Clinical trials ofstatins for the treatment of cardiovascular disease were based on years ofbasic research on the role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease, andstudies of new treatments based on reducing inflammation in coronaryarteries will follow basic research on the role of inflammatory processes inthe progress from coronary artery disease to acute myocardial infarction. A crucial synergy exists between basic and clinical research. Basic re- search seeks to expand knowledge and understanding of the biologicalmechanisms of illness and treatment. Much of clinical research builds onthe results of basic research to determine whether treatments based on newNEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 121 concepts of illness and treatment can produce measurable benefits in de- fined groups of patients. Findings from clinical research may reinforce theinsights gained from basic research or may reveal surprising results thatlead to new questions or hypotheses to be tested in laboratory studies.Federal funding agencies (primarily NIH) support a balance of basic andclinical research studies, recognizing that the synergy between the two iscrucial to advancing the fundamental science base of medicine. For NIH asa whole, one-third of the funding committed to research is spent on clinicalresearch; for the NIH National Center for Complementary and AlternativeMedicine \"the ratio of clinical to basic research funding over time was 4:1 in FY 2000, 3:1 in FY 2001, 2002, 2.5:1 in FY 2003, and willlikely fall a little further in 2004 \" (NCCAM, 2004). A future strategy for funding CAM research will have to address ques- tions about an appropriate balance between basic and clinical research andrelated questions about the available infrastructures for both types of stud-ies. For example, Should reviewers of proposals for clinical studies in CAM require that there be a foundation of basic research on the underlying mechanismsfor the therapy being studied? If so, what must that foundation include?How extensive should it be? Should there be evidence of new insights orbreakthroughs, or would it be sufficient for there to be a widely acceptedtheory (within the relevant provider community) about underlying mecha-nisms of treatment action? Should special requests for proposals be issued for studies of the basic biological mechanisms of specific CAM therapies? If so, for whichtherapies and which mechanisms should they be issued? Should there be anemphasis on therapies or modalities for which there is significant disagree-ment about their basic mechanisms in the relevant CAM provider commu-nity, or should there be an emphasis on therapies or modalities in whichthere is general consensus among CAM providers but significant skepticismor lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms among traditional bio-logical scientists? If support is given to basic research in CAM, would it be required that the results of the studies have some direct relevance to either current ornew CAM treatments, or should support be provided to \"knowledge for its own sake \"? As a condition for funding a body of clinical research on a specific CAM modality, should NIH require some minimum level of ongoing re-lated basic research to expand knowledge of the underlying mechanisms?Or are there CAM modalities for which it would be acknowledged thatsuch basic studies are either unnecessary or impossible to conduct but thatclinical studies would be useful nonetheless? In other words, in most clini-122 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE cal studies there is an implicit understanding that a failure of the experi- mental treatment to produce the expected effect will call into question theassumptions made about the underlying mechanisms and will require theinvestigators to go back to the drawing board. This may not be the case forsome CAM modalities. If there is an absence or shortage of existing infrastructure (facilities, trained investigators, or a supportive academic environment) for basic re-search on an important CAM modality, should the funding strategy empha-size infrastructure development before specific research projects? CONCEPTUAL MODELS TO GUIDE RESEARCH Federal agencies supporting research on the effectiveness of CAM thera- pies may adopt one or more of a variety of conceptual models to guide theirdecision making about a research agenda and then on the subsequent taskof translating research findings into practice guidelines or public policydecisions. The following sections describe several of the possible conceptualmodels. Basic Science Excellence In the basic science excellence model, the highest priority is given to projects that may provide significant breakthroughs in or enhancements ofunderstanding of fundamental biological mechanisms. The concept can beextended to funding decisions about clinical research, in which a consciouschoice would be made to fund studies that shed light on underlying mecha-nisms in preference to those that address only more limited efficacy oreffectiveness questions. Quality of Evidence In the quality of evidence model, a well-designed study is more impor- tant than the ability of a study to shed new light on basic biologicalprocesses or mechanisms of treatments. The most important criteria usedto make funding decisions are sample size, blinding of study participants,the use of clean methods of data collection and sophisticated methods ofdata analysis, statistical power, and the clarity of the inferences. An el-egant, clean, powerful study addressing a relatively mundane questionwould be preferred over a less well-designed study addressing a moreintriguing question.NEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 123 Cost-Effectiveness Cost-effectiveness could actually refer to two different conceptual mod- els. On the one hand, cost-effectiveness could refer to a property of thetreatment or CAM modality in question. One could preferentially studyCAM modalities with known or expected relatively good cost-effective-ness. Or, one could design studies to assess the cost-effectiveness of amodality or a specific therapy and require that clinical studies include acost-effectiveness component to be funded. On the other hand, the termcould refer to a property of the studies being proposed. A relatively explicitcalculation of study cost versus the value of the information to be gainedwould be done, and only those studies with the best balance would befunded, regardless of other considerations. Consumer Preference Consumer preference also has two potential meanings. First, one could design a funding strategy based on the current or potential popularity ofCAM modalities or specific treatments. Studies of the most popular orwidely used therapies would receive funding preference, under the assump-tion that it would be more important to gain knowledge of treatmentefficacy or effectiveness in those areas than elsewhere. Second, one couldpreferentially fund studies in which patient preferences would be specifi-cally included. Funding agencies might solicit proposals for preferenceRCTs so that the results of the studies would perhaps be more generalizableto daily clinical practice, in which patient preferences and expectations arepart of the milieu that affects treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS This chapter has explored the characteristics of CAM treatments and modalities that make it difficult to apply the traditional RCTs or treatment-effectiveness studies used in conventional medicine. These characteristicsinclude the use of multiple therapies (both CAM and conventional medi-cine) at the same time, individualization of therapies, the importance of thetherapist to the outcome, placebo or expectation effects, the different out-comes valued, and manual treatments. The chapter has also discussed studydesigns that might be used to address some of these characteristics includ-ing N-of-1 trials, preference RCTs, observational and cohort studies, case- control studies, studies of bundles or combinations of therapies, andattribute-treatment interaction analyses. Qualitative research can also helpto increase understanding of such things as the types of patients who use124 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE particular CAM therapies, their motivations for the use of such therapies, and how they understand health and illness. The committee believes that it is desirable to use a variety of study designs in the conduct of research of CAM therapies. Given the limitedamount of funding available for clinical studies of CAM therapies, deci-sions about what to evaluate should be made on the basis of one or more ofthe following criteria. Clearly, no intervention will meet all criteria and a therapy should not be excluded from consideration because it does notmeet any one particular criterion, for example, biological plausibility. How-ever, the absence of such a mechanism inevitably will raise the level ofskepticism about the potential effectiveness of a treatment (whether con-ventional or CAM) and will increase both the basic research needed tojustify funding for clinical studies and the level of evidence from clinicalstudies needed to consider a treatment as \"established. \" A biologically plausible mechanism exists for the intervention but it is recognized that the science base on which plausibility is judged is a workin progress. Research could plausibly lead to the discovery of biological mecha- nisms of disease or treatment effect. The condition is highly prevalent (e.g., diabetes mellitus). The condition causes a heavy burden of suffering. The potential benefit is great. Some evidence that the intervention is effective already exists. Some evidence that there are safety concerns exists. The research design is feasible and research will likely yield an un- ambiguous result. The target condition or the intervention is important enough to have been detected by existing population surveillance mechanisms. Should CAM be held to the same standards of evidence as conventional medicine? Regardless of the specific choices made about study design,whether it be traditional or innovative, a question that the committee ad-dressed was whether CAM therapies should be held to the same standardsof evidence as medications, surgical procedures, or other therapies used inconventional medicine. By the \"same standards of evidence, \" the commit- tee means that an insurance company would require \"A-level evidence \" (that is, evidence derived from consistent findings from multiple RCTs), forexample, to include specific herbal therapies in a pharmacy benefit or for-mulary if they required A-level evidence for coverage of prescription drugs. Research on treatment effectiveness is research about cause-effect rela- tionships between the provision of particular treatments and defined pa-NEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 125 tient outcomes. That is, the hypothesis being tested in effectiveness re- search is that Treatment A produces Health Benefit Y. Although CAM and conventional medicine may differ in terms of the nature of the treatmentsprovided and the presumed mechanisms by which treatments produce ben-eficial effects, there is no fundamental diference in the basic nature of eitherthe cause-effect relationships being tested or the major domains of patientoutcomes being studied. Therefore, The committee recommends that the same principles and standards of evidence of treatment effectiveness apply to all treatments, whethercurrently labeled as conventional medicine or CAM. Implementing thisrecommendation requires that investigators use and develop as neces-sary common methods, measures, and standards for the generation andinterpretation of evidence necessary for making decisions about the useof CAM and conventional therapies. Currently, CAM and conventional medicine are viewed as two separate sources of ideas to investigate for possible inclusion of therapies in theevidence-based interventions for comprehensive care. The fact that theseare viewed separately implies that different principles and standards ofevidence are applied. The committee believes that whether the source of anidea is CAM or whether it is conventional medicine, the same principlesand standards of evidence should apply. There are unproven ideas of allkinds, both conventional and CAM, which should be studied using a vari-ety of methods. The results of these studies then move the therapies fromunproven ideas to evidence-based practice or comprehensive care. Chapter 3 of this report discusses three different hierarchies of evi- dence. Hierarchies of evidence are helpful in making judgments about abody of evidence and address the public 's need for advice about how to identify better quality studies. Not all CAM modalities are easily amenableto evaluation, however, and the committee noted, that there are severalconsiderations involved in applying levels-of-evidence concepts. Theseinclude The importance of carefully defining the treatment or modality be- ing studied. A given study may be designed to provide evidence on, for example, the effectiveness of a specific batch of an herbal product, a formu-lation of that product that is unique to a specific manufacturer but presum-ably consistent over time, an herb in general (e.g., St. John 's wort), or the whole concept of herbal medicine. In RCTs in conventional medicine, thetreatment or modality being studied is typically very narrowly defined, forexample, a specific dose, timing of administration, and route of administra-126 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE tion of a specific compound. The application of this concept to some CAM modalities in which treatments are tailored may lead to a host of \"N-of-1\" RCTs. The significance of characteristics of the provider as well as the treatment. Controlled trials of surgical procedures have been done less frequently than studies of medications because it is much more difficult tostandardize the process of surgery. Surgery depends to some degree on theskills and training of the surgeon and the specific environment and supportteam available to the surgeon. A surgical procedure in the hands of a highlyskilled, experienced surgeon is different from the same procedure in thehands of an inexperienced and unskilled surgeon (Hu et al., 2003). Formany CAM modalities, it is similarly difficult to separate the effectivenessof the treatment from the effectiveness of the person providing the treat-ment. Indeed, the idea of conceptual separation of treatment and providerwould seem foreign for those modalities. The designs of studies of CAMmodalities that involve the active participation of a \"healer \" must incorpo- rate the characteristics of that person as well as the characteristics of thetreatment being applied by that person. Different underlying theoretical and diagnostic systems. Concepts of levels of evidence and evidence-based medicine in conventional medi-cine rely on a generally accepted diagnostic classification system that isembodied in formal diagnostic systems like the International Classificationof Diseases-Version 10 (ICD-10) and the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual-Version IV (DSM-IV). It will be somewhat challenging to applysimilar study designs, measures of clinical endpoints, and standards ofevidence to therapies that use different diagnostic systems and therefore toidentify different sets of patients as the group to whom the study resultsapply. It will be even more challenging to apply these concepts to anyCAM modalities that emphasize the uniqueness of each individual patientand that patient 's complex of symptoms and to avoid diagnostic classifica- tions entirely. Endpoints like feelings of emotional or spiritual well-being that are difficult to measure. The most important dependent variables in many CAM modalities will be hard to define in objective terms and may varyfrom patient to patient (Jonas and Linde, 2002). A study of whether acu-puncture is effective for patients with cancer may not be able to focus onmortality or shrinkage of tumors but, instead may have to focus on ques-tions of whether the patients feel relief of pain and other symptoms andwhether they feel more in control of their illness and are better able tomanage the cancer along with their other daily tasks. Difficult or impossible to conduct double-blind trials with some modalities. The concept of blinding in which the patients and the treating clinicians participating in clinical trials do not know what treatment theNEED FOR INNOVATIVE DESIGNS IN RESEARCH 127 patient is receiving is an important way to minimize expectation effects and biases on the part of both the patient and the clinician. For most CAMmodalities, however, blinding is very difficult or impossible. A CAM research portfolio with a variety of types of studies will pro- vide a great deal of knowledge about the use of CAM therapies by theAmerican public. The next chapter discusses what is known about efficaciesof some CAM therapies, identifies existing gaps, and proposes a frameworkthat can be used to conduct research on CAM.

This chapter discusses theevidence that forms the basis for such decision making and the methods ofevaluation, as well as the available resources providing access to the resultsof existing research on CAM interventions. In CAM as well as in conventional medicine, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), when possible, are the preferable study design for assessingefficacy. RCTs use random allocation to create comparable groups, afterwhich an intervention is introduced. This intervention consists of treatmentfor the test group and a placebo, no treatment, or another active treatmentfor the control group. Once the outcome is recorded, any observable differ-ences between the treatment and control group should be attributable tothe intervention because the groups were initially comparable before theintervention was introduced. A systematic review uses explicit, systematic methods to review existing research, particularly the effectiveness of health care interventions, as evalu-ated by RCTs. Some systematic reviews may include meta-analyses, whichprovide an overview of the results of similar studies by the use of statisticalmethods to evaluate the data from many studies. Systematic reviews arewidely considered the best method for gathering and synthesizing evidenceas well as for determining gaps that exist in current research. Althoughbasic science research and evaluation of cost-effectiveness are also impor-tant aspects of research on CAM therapies and modalities, the focus of the130 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE following sections is the evaluation of the clinical efficacies of therapies by RCTs and systematic reviews. SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE Two main sources of information about published RCTs and system- atic reviews are The Cochrane Library and MEDLINE. Critical reviews of reviews and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evi-dence Reports summarize the information by using rigorous and objectivemethods. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Statements incor-porate evidence from RCTs and systematic reviews together with the judg-ments of a panel of nonadvocate, nongovernmental experts, to reach adecision about the efficacy and safety of a particular treatment. MEDLINE MEDLINE, a product of the National Library of Medicine, is an exten- sive bibliographic database covering all areas of clinical medicine and bio-medical research. The bibliographic citations and abstracts indexed inMEDLINE are from more than 4,600 biomedical journals published world-wide, and the database includes information on all randomized trials inMEDLINE-indexed journals, regardless of the methodological quality orclinical relevance. MEDLINE is accessible online and is free of charge to thepublic, and most of its 12 million citations are available in English, at leastas abstracts. The database includes studies published since 1966, the yearthat MEDLINE began, and is updated on a regular basis (National Libraryof Medicine, 2002). In recent years, relevant indexing terms have been introduced on MEDLINE to facilitate queries on trials and systematic reviews related toCAM. MEDLINE introduced the publication type \"randomized controlledtrial\" for specific RCTs in 1991 and the subject subset \"systematic review\"in 2001. The subject subset \"CAM\" was introduced in 2001 and includesall records identified through the execution of a complex, highly sensitivesearch strategy designed to identify all records in the MEDLINE databaserelated to CAM. The introduction of these terms allows interested individu-als to make simple queries of MEDLINE to estimate changes in the evi-dence base for CAM from the results of RCTs and systematic reviews overtime. Figure 5-1 charts the tremendous growth in the number of RCTs overthe past 20 years, and Figure 5-2 shows that the rate of increase of reviewsand meta-analyses is even greater. These increases parallel general trends ofgrowth in trials and meta-analyses over the past twenty years (Lee et al.,2001). Despite these developments, however, limitations of MEDLINE per-sist: not all studies in MEDLINE are indexed with the appropriate termsSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 131 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 20020200400600800100012001400Number of RCTs Year FIGURE 5-1 Number of CAM RCTs indexed on MEDLINE, 1982 to 2002.

The Cochrane Library The Cochrane Library , unique both for its scope and for its method- ological standards, is supported through the work of the Cochrane Col-laboration (Dickersin and Manheimer, 1998), an international organiza-tion of more than 9,000 contributors (mostly volunteers) from more than80 countries (Allen and Clarke, 2003). The Cochrane ComplementaryMedicine Field, based at the University of Maryland Center for IntegrativeMedicine, coordinates all of the CAM-related activities of the CochraneCollaboration, including the development of a database with informationon more than 7,000 controlled trials of CAM therapies and modalities, andfacilitates the preparation of CAM reviews and the promotion of thesereviews, especially among the members of the CAM community. Members of the Cochrane Collaboration prepare up-to-date, reliable summaries or systematic reviews of every kind of health care therapy.Cochrane reviews, which are intended to answer questions about healthcare and to guide providers in practical decision making about treatment,are published quarterly in The Cochrane Library. Although reviews of journal articles are current only as of their date of publication, the elec-tronic format of The Cochrane Library allows the reviews to be updated easily and periodically to account for new evidence. In addition, Cochranereviews have shown greater methodological rigor than systematic reviewsand meta-analyses published in paper-based journals (Jadad et al., 1998,2000). The use of rigorous methods is also ensured by the requirement thatthe protocols used for a review be prepared before a review is conductedand by an extensive system of peer review. Because the information in The Cochrane Library is prescreened to a certain extent and includes only studies evaluating health care therapies, itis of generally higher quality and greater relevance to patient care than theinformation available on MEDLINE. The Cochrane Database of SystematicReviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials comprisethe major databases of the Cochrane Collaboration. If no review is avail-able on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, one can check The Cochrane Library's Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (a database of reviews collected by the Cochrane Collaboration but not pre-pared according to the strict standards of Cochrane reviews) or the appli-cable trials registered with the Cochrane Central Register of ControlledTrials. The Cochrane database of CAM-related clinical trials is an immensely valuable resource because it covers many of the controlled trials that wouldSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 133 not be included on MEDLINE. Vickers (1998) analyzed the Cochrane reg- ister for studies related to CAM and found that 19 percent of the citationswere not indexed on MEDLINE. The trials included in the register werederived from 965 different journals; 84 percent of the trials were publishedin conventional medical journals. The numbers of trials per therapy varieda great deal: although Vickers found 554 trials of acupuncture and 804 ofherbal medicine, he retrieved only 47 trials of aromatherapy. The numberof trials per condition also varied, with 501 trials of cardiovascular disease,386 trials of musculoskeletal disorders, and 293 trials of surgery-relatedsymptoms, but only 11 trials of fatigue disorders. The objective of theregister is to include all large multicenter trials, such as those recentlypublished showing that St. John 's wort and echinacea are ineffective for the treatment of major depression and the common cold, respectively (Hyperi-cum Depression Trial Study Group, 2002; Taylor et al., 2003). Also in-cluded are smaller RCTs, such as pilot studies of acupuncture conducted inChina. The ultimate aim of developing the Cochrane CAM register is toprovide a comprehensive source of trials of CAM therapies and modalities,thus reducing the need for systematic reviewers and others to search mul-tiple sources. At present The Cochrane Library contains 145 CAM-related system- atic and an additional 340 non-Cochrane CAM-related systematic reviews(see Table 5-1 for a sampling of therapies covered by Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews). These reviews cover many areas of CAM, with particu-lar strength in the fields of acupuncture and herbal medicine, reflecting notonly the large number of trials in these fields, but also the great interest ofclinicians, policy makers, and consumers in these areas. There are some disparities between evidence from Cochrane reviews and evidence from clinical practice. For example, although relaxation tech-niques (e.g., meditation) are the most commonly used CAM therapy amongthe U.S. general population (Eisenberg et al., 1998) and the fourth mostcommonly used therapy in hospital-based CAM or wellness centers (HealthForum, 2003), few Cochrane reviews have evaluated such therapies. On theother hand, although herbal therapy and treatment with other dietarysupplements are not widely offered in U.S. hospitals, they are the mostreviewed and are among the therapies that are the most commonly used bythe U.S. public (Eisenberg et al., 1998). The international structure of the Cochrane Collaboration plays a criti- cal role in the identification of CAM trials and the preparation of reviews ofCAM treatments and modalities because the therapies considered CAM inthe United States are often the traditional medicines used by the popula-tions of other countries. Through the work of the 14 Cochrane Centersworldwide, journals published around the world are hand searched to iden-tify RCTs on conventional medicine therapies and CAM therapies and134 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE TABLE 5-1 Number of Cochrane and Non-Cochrane Reviews, by Therapy, March 2004 Cochrane Non-Cochrane Therapy Reviews Reviews Acupuncture 10 69 Alexander technique 1 0 Art therapy 1 1Biofeedback 2 26 Chiropractic 2 33 Dietary supplements (nonherbal) 71 46Electromagnetic therapy 3 11 Herbal therapy 23 79 Homeopathy 4 34Laser therapy 4 4 Massage therapy 4 18 Prayer 1 2Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation 7 11 Therapeutic touch 1 3 Yoga 2 4Other 27 91 NOTE: Some reviews cover multiple therapies and are therefore counted multiple times.

The Chinese Cochrane Centre, for example, has identified an estimated 10,000trials of traditional Chinese medicine through their hand searches (Tangand Wong, 1998); moreover, dozens of reviews of traditional Chinese medi-cine are under way. Cochrane Review Evidence for CAM 1 All Cochrane reviews, be they of CAM or conventional medicine thera- pies, apply the same standards, that is, therapies within both categories are 1The committee did not include information about the general direction of effect for the AHRQ reports because the individual reports covered too wide a range of conditions (e.g., S- Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe) for Depression, Osteoarthritis, and Liver Disease) and thera- pies (e.g., Mind-Body Interventions for Gastrointestinal Conditions). Cochrane reviews, incontrast, typically evaluate a specific therapy for a specific condition. Concise summaries of the findings of each of the AHRQ Technology Reports are presented on the AHRQ website or http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcindex.htm#complementary.STATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 135 evaluated according to the strength of evidence from RCTs. To evaluate the evidence for CAM from Cochrane reviews, all reviews of CAM-relatedtherapies were selected from The Cochrane Library and assigned catego- ries, as described below. As a means of applying an objective, reproducible,and operational eligibility criterion, the committee considered Cochranereviews to be related to CAM only if the therapies reviewed were listed astherapies in the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medi-cine (NCCAM)-National Library of Medicine CAM on PubMed, a data-base of abstracts and articles on CAM-related therapies. The database canbe accessed by use of a multipage search strategy designed to identify allstudies listed on PubMed that should be indexed in the PubMed CAMsubset. The results from all eligible Cochrane reviews of CAM therapieswere assigned to one of the following six categories by two trained method-ologists: positive effect, possibly positive effect, two active treatments areequal, insufficient or inconclusive evidence of an effect, no effect, or harm-ful effect. When the two raters differed on their classification of the treat-ment described in a review, a third rater trained in RCT and systematicreview methodologies assigned the final classification. This rating systemwas used in a previous study to assess the evidence base for conventionalmedicine according to the information found in Cochrane reviews (Ezzo etal., 2001). The agreement of the classification assignment between the initial two raters was 83 percent. For the 17 percent of reviews for which the initialraters assigned different classification codes, the third rater agreed with oneof the initial two raters ' codes in all cases. The largest number of treatments described in the reviews were classified as insufficient evidence of an effect(n = 82; 56.6 percent), followed by positive effect ( n = 36; 24.8 percent) and possibly positive effect ( n = 18; 12.4 percent). Only one review described a treatment that was classified as harmful (Caraballoso et al., 2003) (seeTable 5-2). The reviews describing treatments classified as having positiveeffects are listed in Table 5-3. Although this exercise suggests that there isstrong evidence for the effectiveness of some CAM therapies, much moreresearch is required, as demonstrated by the large proportion of reviews oftreatments classified as insufficient evidence of an effect. The fact that onlyone of the treatments in the Cochrane reviews fell into the harmful effectcategory suggests that clinical trials of CAM therapies have posed little riskto the participants. Some interesting findings emerge when the results of the evaluation of Cochrane reviews of CAM therapies are compared with the results of theearlier study (Ezzo et al., 2001) evaluating Cochrane reviews of conven-tional therapies: insufficient evidence of an effect was determined for alarger proportion of CAM therapies (56.6 percent for CAM versus 21.3136 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE TABLE 5-2 Conclusion Categories, Definitions, and Proportions Classified by Readers for Cochrane CAM Reviews Readers ' Consensual Conclusion Rating for Included Category Definition Reviews ( n = 145) (%) Positive effect Treatment is more beneficial/effective 36 (24.8) than control for the primary outcome.

In making comparisons betweenthe two studies, however, it is important to keep in mind that the studieswere conducted at different times and thus included different sets ofCochrane reviews. The study of Ezzo et al. (2001) included only thosereviews published in The Cochrane Library at the time of its first issue in 1998, whereas the analysis of CAM described above included reviews pub-lished in the 2004 issue of the database, which is now much more compre-hensive and better developed.STATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 137 TABLE 5-3 Cochrane CAM Reviewsa with Positive Effects Limitation/ Study Therapy IndicationbCommentc Atallah AN et al., Calcium Preventing 1, 4 2004 hypertensive disorders andrelated problems in pregnancy Beckles WN Omega-3 fatty Cystic fibrosis 1, 2 et al., 2004 acids (from fish oil) Brosseau L et al., Transcutaneous Rheumatoid 1 2004 electrical nerve arthritis stimulation in the hand (TENS) D'Souza RM and Vitamin A Measles 4 D'Souza R, 2004 Darlow B and Selenium Short-term 4 Austin N, 2004 morbidity in preterm neonates Darlow BA and Vitamin A Preventing 1, 4 Graham PJ, 2004 morbidity and mortality in verylow-birthweight infants Douglas RM et al., Vitamin C Preventing and 1 (does not prevent 2004 treating the colds; only common cold reduces duration of symptoms) Evans JR, 2004 Antioxidant Age-related 4, 5 vitamin and macular mineral degeneration supplements Farmer A et al., 2004 Fish oil Type 2 diabetes 3, 5 mellitus Furlan AD et al., 2004 Massage Low back pain 2, 6 Herxheimer A and Melatonin Preventing and 5 Petrie KJ, 2004 treating jet lag continued138 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Homik J et al., 2004 Calcium and Corticosteroid- \u2014 vitamin D induced osteoporosis Howlett A and Inositol Respiratory \u2014 Ohlsson A, 2004 distress syndrome in preterm infants Hulme J et al., 2004 Electromagnetic Osteoarthritis \u2014 fields Jepson RG et al., Cranberries Preventing urinary 1 2004 tract infections Linde K and St. John 's wort Depression 2 Mulrow CD, 2004 Little CV and Herbal therapy Osteoarthritis \u2014(only one herb Parsons T, 2004 found effective) Lumley J et al., 2004 Periconceptual Preventing 4 supplementation neural tube defects with folate Folate Biochemical 3, 4 supplementation parameters andin pregnancy pregnancy outcome Mahomed K, 2004 Iron and folate Biochemical 3, 4 supplementation parameters and in pregnancy pregnancy outcome Mahomed K, 2004 Iron Biochemical 3, 4 supplementation parameters and in pregnancy pregnancy outcome Melchart D et al., 2004 Acupuncture Headache \u2014 Melchart D et al., 2004 Echinacea Preventing and 1 treating the common cold Ortiz Z et al., 2004 Folic acid and Reducing side 1 folinic acid effects in patients receiving methotrexateTABLE 5-3 Continued Limitation/ Study Therapy IndicationbCommentcSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 139 TABLE 5-3 Continued Limitation/ Study Therapy IndicationbCommentc Osiri M et al., 2004 TENS Knee osteoarthritis 1 Pittler MH and Horse chestnut Chronic venous \u2014 Ernst E, 2004 insufficiency Pittler MH and Kava Anxiety 5 Ernst E, 2004 Proctor ML et al., 2004 TENS and Primary 1 acupuncture dysmenorrhoea Shea B et al., 2004 Calcium Bone loss \u2014 Taylor MJ et al., 2004 Folate Depression 4 Towheed TE et al., Glucosamine Osteoarthritis 1, 2 2004 Wilson ML and Herbal and Primary and \u2014 Murphy PA, 2004 dietary therapies secondary dysmenorrhoea Wilt T et al., 2004 African prune Benign prostatic 1, 2 hyperplasia Wilt T et al., 2004 Beta-sitosterols Benign prostatic 2 hyperplasia Wilt T et al., 2004 Saw palmetto Benign prostatic 2 hyperplasia Wilt T et al., 2004 Cernilton Benign prostatic 1, 2, 6 hyperplasia aOur application of the list of terms used in the CAM on PubMed search strategy in defining our eligibility criteria for CAM-related resulted in the inclusion in our sample of some Cochrane reviews that many would not consider to be CAM-related. It is notoriously difficult to make the determination of whether or not a therapy should be considered CAM-related, and this decision must often be made in the context of the therapy 's application (e.g., for nutrients, whether it is used as a supplement or to address a deficiency); the setting in which the therapy is used (e.g., hospital, self-care); the current state of the evidence for thetherapy (e.g., a therapy such as folic acid for neural tube defects has strong supportive evi- dence which has resulted in its integrated into the health care system); and the point of historical time at which the evaluation of the therapy as CAM or not CAM is made. OurCAM eligibility criteria, while initially deemed the most objective and reproducible approach continued140 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Ongoing Trials An often cited limitation of the systematic review is that it is generally restricted to published RCTs; if the published RCTs are not representative of all RCTs undertaken (i.e., both published and unpublished RCTs), thereview may be unreliable (Manheimer and Anderson, 2002). Although vari-ous groups have tried to identify, organize, and disseminate information onunpublished and ongoing RCTs, much work remains to be done. Oneattempt to bridge the information gap is the website Current Controlled Trials (http://www. controlled-trials.com), an international resource pro-viding metadata about registers of controlled trials in a searchable data-base. Government agencies also compile registers: the NCCAM websitecontains a list of NCCAM-funded clinical trials, whereas ClinicalTrials.gov provides access to a database of thousands of clinical studies beingsponsored by NIH, other federal agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry.However, none of these resources is comprehensive at this time; only acomprehensive register of all ongoing CAM trials would allow researchersto know which CAM-related RCTs have been conducted, regardless ofwhether results are available.for selecting CAM reviews, does not take into account the indication for which the therapy is used and has resulted in our including multiple reviews that are not CAM (e.g., vitamin A formeasles) and excluding other reviews that are CAM (e.g., speleotherapy for the treatment of asthma), but the therapy reviewed is not a term in the CAM on PubMed search strategy. Because indexing reports always involves some degree of subjectivity (especially when index-ing on a difficult-to-pin-down term such as CAM) and because the CAM on PubMed search strategy still requires improvements in the recall and precision of its terms, a second review, by an authority in the field, of reviews that were possibly inappropriately included or ex-cluded based on the strict application of the CAM on PubMed search strategy terms, may be necessary. bIndication is for the treatment of the condition unless specifically listed as prevention c1= Optimal dosage, preparation, or method of administration needs further investigation 2= Long-term effectiveness data lacking 3= Effects only demonstrated on blood marker surrogate outcome measures 4= Results may only apply to populations with low intake of nutrient 5= May be possible adverse effects in some people, according to either the review data or other research 6= These reviews found positive effects in comparison to both active and inactive controls; for all others, positive effects were in comparison with inactive controls Sufficiently powered, well-designed RCTs of adequate duration may be necessary to con- firm the positive conclusions of these Cochrane teviews.TABLE 5-3 Continued Limitation/ Study Therapy IndicationbCommentcSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 141 Summarizing the Reviews In recent years, many systematic reviews of CAM therapies have been conducted and efforts are under way to synthesize and summarize as com-prehensively as possible the evidence available from these reviews. Systematic Reviews of Reviews One way in which data are synthesized is through systematic reviews of reviews, which provide an overview of a therapy 's effectiveness across all conditions. It is important to note that those preparing the summary mustbe aware of and acknowledge or adjust for the fact that some studies mayappear in more than one review of a given topic. Reviews of reviews use comprehensive searches, strict inclusion crite- ria, and data extraction with pretested forms. These reviews of reviewssummarize the basic information from individual reviews, including condi-tions, interventions, methodological features, and results, as well as presentthe number of studies reviewed and the reviewers ' own conclusions (Linde et al., 2001a,c,d). AHRQ Evidence Reports AHRQ, the leading federal agency concerned with research on health care quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and safety, prepares evidence reportsand technology assessments that provide information on the clinical effica-cies of medical interventions on the basis of systematic reviews and, whenappropriate, meta-analyses. Many AHRQ evidence reports relate to CAMinterventions (Table 5-4). NIH Consensus Statement An NIH consensus statement is prepared by a panel of experts who review key questions and data about various therapies before an audiencethat comprises other experts in various medical fields. The panel, workingwith this audience of experts, addresses a predefined question and reachesconclusions on the basis of both the scientific data presented to the paneland data from the relevant literature gathered from MEDLINE. In 1997,NIH produced a consensus statement on acupuncture and concluded that,despite equivocal results in many studies, acupuncture is clearly effectivefor postoperative dental care and the prevention of nausea and vomiting inadults after surgery and chemotherapy and is possibly effective for manyother conditions (National Institutes of Health, 1998). Nevertheless, poorstudy designs, inadequate sample sizes, and other problems invalidated the142 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE TABLE 5-4 CAM Evidence Reports and Technology Assessmentsa of the U.S. Agency for Health Care Research and Qualityb (as of January 2004) Year of Title Publication Acupuncture for fibromyalgia 2003 Acupuncture for osteoarthritis 2003Antioxidant supplements, prevention and treatment of cancer 2003 Antioxidant supplements, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease 2003 Ayurvedic interventions for diabetes mellitus: A systematic review 2001 Ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic performance enhancement: Clinical efficacy of and side effects 2003 Garlic: Effects on cardiovascular risks and disease, protective effects against cancer, and clinical adverse effects 2000 Milk thistle: Effects on liver disease and cirrhosis and clinical adverse effects 2000 Mind-body interventions for gastrointestinal conditions 2001 S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe) for depression, osteoarthritis, 2002 and liver disease aEvidence Reports and Technology Assessments are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, together with rigorous qualitative, and as appropriate, quantitative methods ofsynthesizing data from multiple studies. bFull versions of these reports, as well as brief summaries, are available through the AHRQ website (www.ahrq.gov). results of many studies, as did problems with the inclusion of appropriate controls. The NIH consensus statement recommended further research, asfuture studies will probably discover additional therapeutic uses for acu-puncture. Although systematic reviews are not themselves meant to function as recommendations or guidelines, they should ideally form the basis for guide-line creation. Governments and medical institutions may adopt variousmethods of summarizing reviews and translating the findings from thosereviews into recommendations for use by clinicians (Grol and Grimshaw,2003; Shekelle et al., 2001; Shiffman et al., 2003; Silagy et al., 2001). Suchorganizations must also evaluate the economic costs of CAM therapies, asSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 143 well as their efficacies, when deciding whether or not to offer them to patients (Friedman et al., 1995; Lorig et al., 1999). A recent systematicreview of economic analyses of CAM therapies showed that, for the mostpart, \"there is a paucity of rigorous studies that could provide conclusive evidence of differences in costs and outcomes between CAM therapies andorthodox medicine \" (White and Ernst, 2000). Evaluating Study Quality Importance of Quality As the discussion above makes clear, a substantial base of information comprising the results of RCTs and systematic reviews evaluating the effec-tiveness of CAM therapies now exists. The quality of these studies varieshowever, and the lower-quality RCTs have exaggerated CAM treatmenteffects (Juni et al., 2001; Schulz et al., 1995). Thus, the evaluation of studyquality is of utmost importance to determine the validity of study results.Quality evaluations, already well under way in conventional medicine, areimportant to ensure the validity and quality of the research and shouldtherefore become standard practice in CAM as well. To address this impor-tant issue, researchers have begun devising methods for the optimal con-duct of RCTs of CAM therapies, as well as for evaluation of the quality ofthe research already conducted. Important Components of Quality Because quality varies across studies and it was found in RCTs of conventional medicine therapies that lower-quality RCTs have exaggeratedtreatment effects (Juni et al., 2001; Schulz et al., 1995), it is important toestablish standards for evaluation. Study quality can be evaluated by vari-ous strategies, but any instrument used to evaluate quality must take intoaccount randomization, blinding, dropouts, and allocation concealment.For example, the Jadad Scale (Jadad et al., 1996) evaluates the quality ofreporting by asking a variety of questions: Was the study described asrandomized? Was the study described as double-blind? Was there a descrip-tion of the study participants who withdrew and dropped out? These ques-tions help to ascertain whether the conduct and reporting of the trial areadequate. It is also important that RCTs have a sample size large enough todetermine the effectiveness of the intervention. Systematic reviews are evalu-ated on the basis of whether they undertake a comprehensive literaturesearch with unambiguous inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies, aswell as on the basis of whether they use explicit and transparent methods toevaluate and summarize study data.144 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Methodological Quality of CAM-Related RCTs The research conducted thus far tends to show not only that RCTs of CAM have significant shortcomings and omissions both in the methodol-ogy and in the reporting but also that the quality of CAM-related RCTs isinconsistent (Linde et al., 2001b). For example, larger trials included onMEDLINE and published in English are, in general, of higher quality thanthose harder-to-find trials not published in English (Egger et al., 2003;Linde et al., 2001a,c,d). Most trials of homeopathy, herbal medicine, andacupuncture had major problems with their reporting and the study meth-odology, such as the documentation of allocation concealment, dropouts,and withdrawals. These shortcomings also varied by intervention (Linde etal., 2001b). Efforts to Improve Quality Many efforts are under way to improve the quality of trials and system- atic reviews, including the establishment of CONSORT, QUOROM, andSTRICTA (Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials ofAcupunture) guidelines. The CONSORT statement helps to improve thequality of RCTs by providing a checklist and flow diagram against whichthe trial procedures can be measured, as well as by standardizing the waysin which the findings from such trials are reported. The CONSORT check-list includes 22 items that should be included in reports describing RCTs,and its accompanying flowchart outlines how patients move through thetrial process. The CONSORT statement is published in several languagesand has received the endorsement of several prominent medical journals,including The Lancet , Annals of Internal Medicine , and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) . As of 2002, CONSORT was being used by about 500 journals, most leading editorial groups, and many grant-ing agencies (Moher, 2002). Wider dissemination of the CONSORT guide-lines within the CAM community (Moher, 2002) should improve the qual-ity of reports of CAM-related RCTs in the future. A related document, theQUOROM statement, provides specific guidelines for the reporting of meta-analyses of RCTs, as well as a checklist and flow diagram to promotestandardization and the inclusion of critical components. The CONSORTand QUOROM checklists and diagrams are available at http://www. con-sort-statement.org. Similarly, STRICTA provides a set of guidelines based on the CON- SORT statement and is meant to serve as an acupuncture-oriented supple-ment to the CONSORT guidelines. An international group of acupuncturepractitioners and researchers established STRICTA guideliness to promoteaccurate and adequate reporting of acupuncture trials; editors of severalSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 145 journals have also contributed to the drafting of these guidelines. Partici- pating journals publish the STRICTA guidelines and ask their prospectiveauthors to adhere to the standards (MacPherson et al., 2001). Although CAM therapies are often criticized for being used despite a lack of evidence, hundreds of systematic reviews have, in fact, evaluatedspecific CAM therapies; of these, some have been well conducted and haveshown that the CAM therapy offers a clear benefit. Much more research isrequired however to demonstrate clearly whether other commonly usedtherapies are effective. Unfortunately, funding for CAM trials and system-atic reviews is limited and generally must come from public resources.Private industry rarely funds research on CAM because the ability to patentnatural products or CAM therapies is low. The evidence base for conven-tional medicine is also not complete, and as discussed above with respect tothe study of Ezzo et al. (2001), systematic reviews demonstrate that only22.5 percent of conventional medicine interventions have a clearly positiveeffect. Comparisons of quality of systematic reviews of CAM and conven-tional medicine therapies have shown that they share similar weaknesses(Moher et al., 2002). One of the most important omissions in systematicreviews was a lack of consistent reporting about the methods used to evalu-ate and assess the quality of the primary studies reviewed (Moher et al.,2002). Twenty years ago very few RCTs of CAM therapies had been con- ducted, and the systematic review methodology was in its infancy. In thepast twenty years, however, remarkable progress has been made in terms ofthe number of trials of CAM therapies conducted, improvements in trialquality, the development of systematic review methods for evaluating suchtrials, and the development of the infrastructure of the Cochrane Collabo-ration to support such rigorous evaluations. Although much work remainsto be done, a great deal has been accomplished in a short time, fromimprovements to the indexing terms used and the creation of databases tothe establishment of reporting guidelines and quality measurements. As a result of these efforts, true evidence-based CAM is becoming a reality. With continued financial and institutional support, the success ofthis enterprise will continue into the future. Efforts to provide evidence-based CAM would be greatly facilitated by a system(s) that could be used toidentify, within each agency of the federal government, completed andongoing research on CAM therapies. Such a system would enable investiga-tors to more quickly and accurately review what is known about variousareas of CAM. The clinical trial registry sponsored by NIH and the Foodand Drug Administration provides useful information on clinical trials;however, other research activities on CAM are not included in this registry.Therefore, the committee recommends that the federal government develop systems that can be used to identify CAM research and expenditures at the146 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion, the Health Resources Service Administration, Medicare, Medicaid,the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Defense, theU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other federal agencies asappropriate. The following section describes some of the gaps in evidence for CAM therapies and explores options that can be used to fill those gaps. GAPS IN EVIDENCE The scientific evidence that is developing in CAM research, reviewed earlier in this chapter, is primarily based on findings from clinical researchon CAM treatments. This clinical research, which is itself still in a nascentphase and which is sometimes flawed, represents just one facet of theresearch that is needed. There are very large gaps in basic research on theunderlying mechanisms through which CAM treatments affect outcomes,clinical research that compares CAM interventions with the interventionsused in conventional medicine, and cost-effectiveness and health care utili-zation studies. Furthermore, as discussed in Chapter 4, advances in CAMare dependent on the ability to address complex methodological challengescreated by the unique characteristics of CAM therapies. Clinical Research Although most research on CAM is clinical, there is a paucity of clinical research in which CAM interventions are compared with each other or withconventional medicine interventions. As discussed in Chapter 4, one of theobstacles to comparing CAM treatments with conventional medicine treat-ments is that CAM treatments often consider outcomes that are not ordi-narily considered by conventional medicine research, such as \"being cen- tered \" or \"connectedness to the CAM provider or family members. \" Conversely, conventional medicine studies often consider outcomes such asfunctional status and disease-specific outcomes that may not be used instudies of CAM therapies. Each type of medicine \u2014conventional medicine and CAM \u2014should make efforts to include the outcomes of the other type to facilitate valid comparisons between CAM and conventional medicinetreatments. For example, measures of mood, quality of life, and preferencesfor outcome states that are used in clinical studies of conventional medicinetherapies could be included in studies of CAM therapies. Measures of theoutcomes that are often of interest to CAM patients and providers need tobe developed that can then be used in conventional medicine research aswell as CAM research. Collaboration between CAM researchers and socialSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 147 and behavioral scientists skilled in measurement development could be fruitful in this regard. Basic Science A great opportunity for scientific discovery in the basic science of CAM treatments is at hand. Of the basic research that has been done, botanicalshave probably received the greatest amount of attention, in the form ofstudies of individual botanicals, botanical-drug interactions, and the identi-fication of new drugs. NCCAM, like other institutes, centers, and offices ofNIH, is giving a high priority to studies to determine the active ingredients,dosing, pharmacology, stability, and bioavailability of CAM therapies(NCCAM, 2004). Some of the formative research in this area has producedfindings on the lack of identification of isoflavonone Isoflavonone formononetin is believed to be important in the reduction of menopausalvasomotor symptoms, and the findings of research of black cohosh given tomenopausal women indicate that estrogen activity is due to compoundsother Bcl-2 phosphoryla- tion in tumor cell lines (Rafi et al., 2002), and pharmacokinetic studies ofpurified soy isoflavones show that high doses are rapidly eliminated byhealthy males resulting in minimal toxicity (Busby et al., 2002). These areonly a handful of the high-quality investigations on the basic science ofmedicinal plants that have been reported, while many others have beencompleted or are ongoing. The area of mind-body medicine also offers exciting opportunities for basic research. Advances in technology enable research, for example, onthe effects of mind-body techniques such as the effects of meditation on thebrain, the endocrine system, and the immune system. New imaging tech-niques make it possible to study the phenomenon of acupuncture analgesiaand placebo effects. For example, ter Riet et al. (1998) conducted a sys-tematic review of six studies on the mechanism of placebo analgesia inhumans and concluded that the studies provide evidence that a placeboanalgesia effect exists. Pollo et al. (2001) examined whether expectationsabout treatment influence analgesic effects. They found that \"different verbal instructions about certain and uncertain expectations of analgesiaproduce different placebo analgesic effects, which in turn trigger a dra-matic change of behavior leading to a significant reduction of opioid in-take\". These are but a few of many examples of areas of inquiry that hold great promise for understanding basic mechanisms of action relevant tothe practice of CAM.148 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Cost-Effectiveness Studies Although a number of clinical studies are examining the efficacies of CAM treatments, very little research has tracked the costs associated withthe treatment outcomes. Research on the cost-effectiveness of CAM thera-pies is hindered by a lack of consistency of treatments, a lack of standard-ized coding, and defects in clinical trials (pertinent to both conventionalmedicine and CAM treatment trials). These defects include the fact that theclinical trials are underpowered, a lack of an adequate description of sub-ject recruitment, the use of suboptimal controls, and the use of single-centertrials, which threatens generalizability and power. Cross-Disciplinary Research Research on CAM treatments benefits from the contributions of more than one discipline. In addition to providers who have specialized knowl-edge of CAM treatments and methodologists who can address the chal-lenges inherent in CAM research design, CAM research can benefit by theinclusion of scientists with backgrounds in fields such as psychology, soci-ology, anthropology, economics, genetics, pharmacology, neuroscience,health services research, and health policy. These individuas can address themultiplicity of factors that influence those who use CAM treatments andthe outcomes of those treatments. Engaging experts from multiple fields in the investigation of CAM therapies provides an excellent opportunity to conduct transdisciplinaryresearch. \"Transdisciplinary research involves broadly constituted teams of researchers that work across disciplines in the development of the re-search questions to be addressed \" (IOM, 2003b). Transdiciplinary research on CAM therapies could involve teams composed of a rheuma-tologist, immunologist, neuroscientist, epidemiologist, biostatistician, tra-ditional Chinese medicine practitioner, and physician who is trained inconventional medicine and CAM and is investigating chronic pain disor-ders such as osteoarthritis. Research Investigators Established scientists are drawn to a new field by interesting questions, especially when such questions can be approached by using the scientists ' knowledge and skills and by the availability of resources. Relatively fewestablished scientists are engaged in CAM research, however, and certainareas of CAM are ripe for research. Mind-body medicine provides a goodexample. Mind-body medicine concerns the effects of the brain onbiophysiological processes and clinical outcomes. Clinical researchers andSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 149 basic scientists who share interest in these questions have traditionally pursued their interests separately and have published their findings in dif-ferent journals. However, the public 's growing interest in practices such as meditation as a way of reducing the risk for and recovery from illness ismotivating a more clinical orientation by basic scientists and a more basicscience orientation by clinical researchers. Advances in the cognitive and affective neurosciences and technical advances in imaging techniques are fueling the convergence of clinical sci-ence and basic science. A study by Davidson et al. (2003) provides a goodexample of this convergence. These investigators conducted an RCT of theeffects of a meditation-based clinical training program on brain and im-mune function. At the conclusion of the training, subjects in both groupswere vaccinated with influenza vaccine. Meditators showed a significantincrease in left-sided anterior activation compared with that for thenonmeditators, and they also had a significant increase in antibody titerscompared with the titers in the nonmeditators. Scientists in other areas should be made aware of the exciting questions about CAM that remain to be answered. Such interest can be fanned in avariety of ways, including conferences focused on particular CAM modali-ties that invite science-oriented CAM practitioners and scientists from otherareas to participate. Invitations to scientists to apply their knowledge andskill to CAM research questions will be more attractive if they includecertain kinds of collaborations. Both basic research and clinical research inCAM involve subject matter that is likely to be beyond the conventionalscientist 's knowledge base and scientists new to CAM will often need to be partnered with individuals who are expert in the focal CAM modality.Furthermore, investigation of a number of CAM modalities, such as tradi-tional Chinese medicine, by conventional scientific techniques is scientifi-cally problematic and requires the collaboration of methodologists who cancreate appropriate and effective research designs (see Chapter 4). The development of a workforce to conduct research on CAM will proceed more rapidly if critical masses of investigators can be created invarious locations. Furthermore, CAM research should thrive in an interdis-ciplinary environment. Centers that bring together scientists from diversedisciplines can help create these interdisciplinary groups of scientists fo-cused on particular aspects of CAM. The cross-collaborations and synergythat characterize a strong center will contribute to the more rapid growth ofa cadre of scientists who will be able to advance the research in CAM. As discussed in Chapter 1, one of the goals of the Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine is to \"help transform medicine and health care through rigorous scientific studies \" (see Appendix B for a list of cen- ters). One such center at the University of Maryland has grown out of apartnership of funding from private foundations with university support150 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE and resources. This combination allowed the start of pilot research projects that could generate preliminary data that were used to make successfulapplications to NIH for grants for CAM research including a center grant.The University of Maryland model (which started in 1991) has relied on acollaborative team approach whereby clinicians experienced in CAM mo-dalities work with specialists in rheumatology and pain (the particularfocus of the center) as well as seasoned methodologists and statisticians todesign trials that are sensitive to the unique practice of the CAM modalitywhile meeting the highest methodological standards. The center grant fund-ing has been crucial in establishing various infrastructural cores. For ex-ample, the first core, the database and evaluation core, locates the existingliterature in the field, synthesizes the data, and conducts systematic reviewsto aid in formulating appropriate research hypotheses and designing appro-priate studies. Until recently this task was greatly hindered by the fact thatCAM journals were not listed in MEDLINE, and literature search strategiessuch as those that use keywords were inadequate. However, this situationhas changed, and many of the difficulties have improved. A second core of the Maryland center is administrative and provides oversight and management for all stages of the research process. A statisti-cal, epidemiological, and data management core, the third core, providesconsultation on all aspects of study design, data collection, and statisticalanalysis. Studies funded by the center grant have completed the Phase IIlevel of development, which has led to large, fully developed Phase IIIclinical trials, in addition to allowing transitional research from basic sci-ence studies through clinical trials. Furthermore, a program of developmentand feasibility studies and a training and education program have built onthe concept of a collaborative model, encouraging innovative lines of inves-tigation and the nurturing of new investigators in the field. These programshave allowed the center to bring together experienced investigators from abroad range of medical disciplines to work with the center team on pilotresearch studies, and it has also mentored junior faculty and postdoctoralfellows as they develop lines of inquiry and embark on independent careersin the field. The field of CAM also needs a cadre of new junior researchers. Models of training programs in basic and clinical research for conventional medi-cine can be found in major U.S. health sciences campuses. The challenge isto induce such programs to include training in clinical research for CAM.One approach is to build upon existing research training programs byadding specific CAM content for the trainees in CAM. This could be donethrough postdoctoral training programs that are designed for basic andclinical research in conventional medicine. This is an efficient way to de-velop CAM researchers during the period when not enough CAM re-searchers are available to serve as faculty for a complete program. ASTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 151 second approach is to provide supplemental grants to existing grants that will fund a junior researcher to conduct CAM research and benefit frommentoring by the principal investigator of the existing grant. NIH has usedthis approach to help increase the numbers of researchers from under-represented minorities. A third approach is to award individual careerdevelopment grants that allow the junior researcher of CAM to be trainedby established researchers from around the country. A fourth approach isto provide intensive workshops at a central location followed by mentoringand technical support for the participants when they return to their homeinstitutions. All the approaches described above involve programs for people with conventional M.D. or Ph.D. training. Chapter 8 discusses the training ofCAM practitioners to conduct research. The next section explores a frame-work for research and the translation of validated therapies into practice. A RESEARCH FRAMEWORK During its deliberations and analyses, the committee concluded that research on CAM is inextricably linked to the practice of CAM therapiesfor many reasons, an important one of which is that CAM therapies arealready in widespread use today and it is reasonable to attempt to evaluatethe outcomes of that use. Another is that in the practice setting one canfocus on research that answers questions about how therapies function inthe real world where patients vary, often have multiple problems, and areusing multiple therapies. Such a focus not only generates research thataddresses real-world practice issues but also facilitates the adoption ofpractice changes on the basis of those research results (Green and Dovey,2001; Nutting et al., 1999). Therefore, the committee believes that it isequally important both to continue to conduct research aimed at determin-ing efficacy and uncovering mechanisms of action and to engage in research aimed at investigating what is occurring in practice. Furthermore, the gath-ering and analysis of accurate information about CAM (and conventionalmedicine) practices and their use are crucial to measuring and understand-ing outcomes of care. Chapter 2 of this report discussed what is known about the use of CAM by the American public. That chapter also described how little infor-mation is available about CAM use by specific populations; how the American public gathers and evaluates information and makes decisions about accessing CAM therapies; what motivates patients to use CAM; adherence to CAM treatment or self-treatment with CAM;152 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE outcomes, including adverse events, of single CAM therapies, mul- tiple CAM therapies, and CAM therapies in combination with conven-tional therapies; and the extent to which CAM use is a trigger for positive behavioral change. This chapter discusses what is known about the efficacy and effective- ness of CAM therapies and the need for additional basic science, cost-effectiveness, and cross-disciplinary research in CAM. To address thesegaps, the committee has developed the research model illustrated in Figure5-3. Four major components of this model are national surveys (both peri-odic and longitudinal surveys), a sentinel surveillance system, practice-basedresearch networks (PBRNs), and CAM research centers. National Surveys The first component of the research model illustrated in Figure 5-3 is a set of interactive surveys. Data from these surveys are needed to captureCAM use by the American public in a timely manner for several distinct,but interrelated purposes. First, there is a need for periodic (e.g., every 5years), large, comprehensive surveys assessing the prevalence, patterns, per-ceptions, and costs of CAM therapy use by a representative national surveyof adults living in the United States. This will provide data on nationaltrends on CAM use that will enable comparisons over time by class ofpatient, e.g., by ethnicity, gender, area of the country, insurance status, andthe general rate of use of CAM. In designing such surveys, oversampling ofvarious ethnic minority populations is necessary to ensure the collection ofhigh-quality data that document the differences in the patterns of CAM useby both preference and level of access to all types of health care servicesamong minority (and majority) populations. Second, questions related to CAM should be included on annual and semiannual federally funded surveys focusing on the health care of theAmerican public. The recently completed study by the National Center forHealth Statistics is an excellent example of the type of survey needed (Barneset al., 2004). It is also important to establish a set of common questions thatcan be rotated (because of time constraints) to enable the more frequenttracking of a core set of key variables (e.g., prevalence of CAM use, majordisease categories treated by CAM, average numbers of visits by CAMusers, and out-of-pocket expenditures). Third, questions related to CAM should be included on ongoing, longi- tudinal, cohort studies to enable documentation of the patterns of CAM useover time and their relationship (or lack thereof) to health outcomes. Lon-gitudinal cohort studies have produced data that result in major benefits to153Annual surveys add relevant questions Longitudinal survey :Periodic Nationally Representative Survey: Practice-Based Research Network HMOCAM Practitioner Private Practitioner Specialty Clinic pool subjects for effectiveness trials, interventions, etc.CAM research centerFacilitates participatory research, coordinates researchBuilds capacityInforms Informs Adds questions to existing surveys about CAM use over time and behavioral changeChanges in trends every 3 to 5 years Methods development, consensus between participants on design and measuresAnnual surveys Teaching hospital Identifies emerging patterns of CAM: conventional medicine useSentinel Surveillance Network MembersSpecial surveys to establish prevalence of particular practice Disseminate findings in communities of practice Create research norm in communityMembers of CAM and Conventional MedicineMembers of CAM and Conventional Medicine- FIGURE 5-3A model for CAM research and translation.154 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE the public 's health. For example, data from the Multiple Risk Factor Inter- vention Trial and the Framingham Heart Study revealed the importance ofpreventing \"development of unfavorable levels of blood cholesterol and blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and unfavorable body weight \" as crucial to preventing clinical coronary heart disease (Greenland et al.,2003). The ideal situation would be the inclusion of CAM-related questions in such studies as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES) study, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, theFramingham Heart Study, or the Nurses ' Health Study. This would enable investigators to examine the impact of CAM use over time on the health ofindividuals as well as the members of a particular cohort. Finally, surveys that are explicitly intended to capture the real and the perceived adverse events associated with CAM use should be established.The results of such surveys could be used to identify high-priority researchtopics. The information produced by the types of surveys described above is crucial to understanding the use of CAM therapies in the United States andprioritization of the CAM-related research portfolio. These surveys form akey component of the model illustrated in Figure 5-3. Although they areextremely valuable, large national surveys are unable to monitor emergentpatterns of CAM use, the specifics of CAM use, and particular combina-tions of CAM use for particular purposes. Other types of data need to becollected to explore such things as how CAM use is associated with behav-ioral change or is related to risk and health-protective or health-promotivebehaviors. Another key component of that model, the sentinel surveillancesystem, plays an important role in answering these types of questions byproviding timely information about treatment trends that demand researchand is described below. Sentinel Surveillance System Surveillance is defined as \"ongoing systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data and the distribution to those who need to know \" (Thacker and Berkelman, 1988). Surveillance has many uses when it is welldesigned and implemented and can be used to obtain quantitative estimates of the magnitude of a health problem; portray the natural history of disease; detect epidemics; document the distribution and spread of a health event; facilitate epidemiological and laboratory research;STATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 155 test a hypothesis; evaluate control and prevention measures; monitor changes in the prevalence of infectious agents; monitor isolation activities; monitor behavioral change-associated risk or prevention of illness; monitor public receptiveness to marketing and public health messages \u2014i.e., information; detect changes in health care practices; and plan (Thacker, 1992). Groseclose and colleagues (2000) classify surveillance systems as either passive or active . Passive surveillance reporting systems can provide incom- plete information because they depend on the voluntary reporting of data.Active surveillance systems, on the other hand, solicit data from selected sites for specific purposes, for example, the use of particular antibiotics fora condition like otitis media. A sentinel surveillance system can be either active or passive and is composed of selected sites that report informationthat may be generalizable to the population as a whole (Birkhead andMaylahn, 2000). Sentinel sites (both CAM and conventional medicine)might include practitioners, hospitals, specialty clinics, clinics that servespecific population subgroups, health maintenance organizations, and teach-ing hospitals that have agreed to report information. Member sites mightserve either a common population defined by a particular set of healthproblems or a particular population (by age, ethnicity, location, etc.). The value of sentinel surveillance systems can be seen in the public health system, in which they \"have been particularly helpful in monitoring specific infections or designated classes of infections \" (IOM, 2003a). The Emerging Infections Program, a surveillance system collaboration amongthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state public health depart-ments, and other public health partners, conducts surveillance for unex-plained deaths and severe illnesses to \"identify diseases and infectious agents, known and unknown, that can lead to severe illness or death \" (IOM, 2003a). For CAM, a sentinel surveillance system is important to monitoring changes in the American public 's use of CAM alone or in combination with conventional medicine, thereby highlighting high-priority areas for practice-based research. The third major component of the model described in Figure 5-3 is practice-based research networks. The following discussion describes thevalue and importance of such networks both to effectiveness research andto the translation of validated therapies into practice.156 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Practice-Based Research Networks Nutting (1996) writes, \"In the primary care setting, patients present with multiple problems: some are diseases, others are illnesses that maybecome diseases, and many are neither, yet all are important and can mea-surably decrease function and quality of life. \" Although, Nutting was refer- ring to conventional primary care, the description also holds for patientswho seek CAM therapies or both CAM and conventional. He also de-scribes the need to determine practice-relevant research questions, to de-velop research that draws on the strengths and experiences of practitioners,and to ensure that rigorous and multiple research methods are used forstudy, concluding that PBRNs are best able to incorporate these and othernecessary elements. Nutting is not alone in his belief that PBRNs are vital toeffective primary care. Other individuals and organizations also support thedevelopment of PBRNs to increase the research and evidence base in pri-mary care (Fenton et al., 2001; Genel and Dobs, 2003; Green and Dovey,2001; IOM, 1996; Lindbloom et al., 2004). PBRNs are defined as \"a group of ambulatory practices devoted princi- pally to the primary care of patients, affiliated with each other (and oftenwith an academic or professional organization) in order to investigate ques-tions related to community-based practice \" (AHRQ, 2001). The 1996 IOM report Primary Care: America 's Health in a New Era , states, \"The commit- tee sees practice-based research networks as a significant underpinning forstudies in primary care, noting not only their attractiveness conceptuallybut the growing recognition of their value \" (IOM, 1996). That report recommend that \"the Department of Health and Human Services provide adequate and stable financial support to practice-based primary care re-search networks. \" According to Thomas et al. (2001), PBRNs emerged in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. Several regional networks were begun in the UnitedStates during the 1970s with the first national network established in 1981(Lindbloom et al., 2004). The Federation of Practice Based Networks, es-tablished in 1997, advocates and builds capacity for practice-based re-search and works to facilitate communication and collaboration amongnetworks (FPBRN, 2004). Thomas and colleagues (2001) suggest that PBRNs are virtual organi- zations that to succeed need to specify membership criteria, accountability,and authority; address issues of governance; and evaluate activities. Theyhave identified three network leadership types. In the first type, \"practitio- ners develop their own ideas and the network is led by a peer group, \" thus facilitating participation because the direction is provided by the practitio-ners involved. The second type uses a top-down approach with \"strong institutional links and research projects led by experts. \" This approachSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 157 fosters rapid research of high quality. The third type of network is referred to as \"whole systems, \" in which the leadership is multidisciplinary. Net- work participants form coalitions including both research experts and nov-ices. According to Thomas et al. (2001), the whole systems approach isgood for producing cultural change because different enthusiasts in differ-ent parts of the health care system become involved. Griffiths and colleagues (2000) describe different network organiza- tional styles in the following manner: . . . some have a hierarchical organisation with a strong centre, often at a university, leading satellite units or network members; others are less hier-archical with coordination and cooperation between satellite units and members as well as with the centre. Despite differences in design and organization, Nutting et al. (1999) describe four central characteristics of all PBRNs: 1. PBRNs capture health care events that reflect the selection and ob- server bias that characterize primary care in community-based patient popu-lations. 2. PBRNs provide access to the practice experience and care provided by full-time primary care clinicians. 3. PBRNs focus their activities on practice-relevant research questions, apply appropriate multimethod research designs, and generally avoid thetendency to permit research methods to define the question. 4. Networks strive for the systematic involvement of network clinicians in defining the research questions, participating in the study design, andinterpreting study results. PBRNs conduct studies that use both qualitative and quantitative meth- ods ranging from observational studies to RCTs. For example, using obser-vational data from The Direct Observation of Primary Care Study, Stangeet al. (1998) found \"that family physicians target preventive services to- ward patients most in need of them and use illness visits as opportunitiesfor prevention \"; a randomized control trial by Fleming et al. \"provided the first direct evidence that brief physician intervention was effective in reduc-ing alcohol use and utilization of health care services \" (Nutting et al., 1999). Some networks focus on providing epidemiological data; others areconcerned with the process of care (Griffiths et al., 2000). A PBRN can provide information on the content and the practice pat- terns offered in various types of clinical settings, offer flexibility in collect-ing and analyzing data from a variety of perspectives (e.g., the practitionerand the patient), provide the opportunity to ask and answer practice-relevant questions, and study CAM treatments in the manner in which they158 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE are practiced. Once a PBRN is in place, the additional costs of mounting specific studies can be fairly low, and the level of preparedness engenderedby its structure can allow the timely generation of research findings (Zarinet al., 1997). An additional benefit of PBRNs, especially in the area ofCAM, which has historically lacked a research infrastructure, is their po-tential to provide places of learning, provide training in research, and,through direct involvement of practitioners with science, promote a climateof inquiry that both questions and increases the evidence underlying aparticular practice. Furthermore, according to Genel and Dobs (2003), PBRNs can facili- tate the translation of research findings into practice. They assert thatPBRNs address two of the greatest difficulties in translating findings intopractice: the lack of communication between academic and practicing phy-sicians and the failure to address practitioner needs in research. Genel andDobs assert that practitioners must be trained in clinical research and that,as their familiarity with that research grows, they will be enthusiastic aboutthe research effort and will be more likely to implement the research resultsin their own practices. CAM Research Centers The fourth major component of the research model proposed here is a CAM Research Center. Currently, NCCAM funds specialized research cen-ters, each of which focuses on research in one particular area (see AppendixF for a list of these centers). For example, the center at the Oregon HealthSciences University focuses on CAM research in neurological disorders; thecenter at Columbia University investigates CAM use in aging; the center atthe University of California at Los Angeles fosters research evaluating safetyand efficacy of botanical dietary supplements; and the center at the Univer-sity of Illinois at Chicago is studying botanical dietary supplements forwomen 's health. The CAM research centers envisioned in the committee 's research framework differ from these specialized research centers in important ways.First, they are not restricted to one central focus. Rather they would facili-tate the activities of the research networks across many topic areas. Thecenters in Figure 5-3 would propose (or seek input from the network for)specific research questions and protocols. They would help coordinate thedesign and implementation of these investigations; coordinate refinementof protocols and priorities over time; and supervise the analyses of datagenerated from these studies. Unlike NCCAM centers as currently struc-tured and funded, these new centers require a much broader spectrum ofexpertise from both the conventional and CAM research and clinical com-munities because they would not be focused on one modality or one clinicalSTATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 159 problem. These centers must have the capacity to work with the networks to identify important questions and to design studies that are hypothesisgenerating and hypothesis testing. The proposed centers coordinate data collection and analysis \u2014bring- ing in information gleaned through longitudinal and periodic studies aswell as data collected by the surveillance sites \u2014and provide research and other training to network and surveillance participants as needed. In someinstances, it is likely that they will serve in the more traditional role of acoordinating site for multisite observational or controlled trials, but this isnot the main or sole purpose of their creation. The committee believes strongly that the center team should be trans- disciplinary, at a minimum composed of methodologists, social and behav-ioral scientists, and experienced integrative medicine practitioners. As thenetwork evolves it is anticipated that individuals from other disciplineswould join the coordinating team. This team should be committed to aparticipatory research process and the cannons of conducting good science. These four major components, national surveys, a sentinel surveillance system, practice-based research networks, and CAM research centers, formthe core of the research, reporting, and translation model developed by thecommittee and illustrated in Figure 5-3. A Model for CAM Research and Surveillance In the model for CAM research and surveillance shown in Figure 5-3 the left-hand hub represents the sentinel surveillance function. Sentinel sur-veillance sites would be responsible for the systematic collection and report-ing of data on common and emerging patterns of CAM use as well as theuse of both CAM and conventional medicine. Such information could beused to identify treatment trends that demand research. A sentinel surveil-lance approach to the collection of data on the use of CAM would comple-ment the periodic population-based survey approach because data wouldbe collected in an ongoing fashion in contexts subject to real-world contin-gencies and for a variety of different populations. The sentinel surveillancesystems formed in different parts of the country would also provide datathat allow the monitoring and analysis of regional and national trends inCAM use. Another advantage of sentinel surveillance systems relates to the trans- lation of research results into practice. That is, such systems allow the real-time monitoring of the impact of the information about various CAMtreatments disseminated to the public and practitioners by asking suchquestions as How does information influence practice? and How doestreatment affect behaviorial change? The information collected by the sen-tinel sites could then be reported to the CAM research center (center of160 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Figure 5-3), where it would be reviewed to determine whether emerging patterns that would be useful to study may exist. The right-hand hub of Figure 5-3 is the PBRN. Network participants would be recruited from many disciplines and would include both CAMand conventional medicine practitioners. It is anticipated that this networkwill conduct practice-based participatory research. Practitioners involved inthe PBRN will learn research study designs through their preparation forand participation in network search activities. Additionally, these practi-tioners will be in a position to guide the development of new instrumentsand outcome measures of relevance to the community. In the model illustrated in Figure 5-3, the CAM research center would work with the PBRN to develop a consensus on how best to test theeffectiveness and safety of treatments and bundles of behavior associatedwith treatment approaches. Together, the center and the network would Select target conditions to be evaluated Develop a protocol designed to capture \u2014Health care practices engaged in by patients as self-care \u2014Health care administered or prescribed by practitioners \u2014Interactions between self-care and practitioner care and between conventional medical care and CAM care\u2014Notable lifestyle changes that may effect health status, e.g., inter- actions between medication use and special diets the populationhas adopted\u2014Exposure of the population to marketing and public health messages Identify sites attending to patients (by both CAM and conventional medicine) with the targeted conditions Organize the data collection on the basis of an agreed-upon sam- pling procedure Develop an effectiveness study or intervention activity linked to the surveillance data It is the committee 's belief that the model for research and translation illustrated and described above would provide a coordinated mechanismdirected at answering the myriad questions about CAM use, such as Who isusing CAM and why are they doing so? and Are CAM therapies safe,effective, and cost-effective? The committee strongly urges NIH and otherpublic agencies to provide the support necessary to develop and implementsuch a model.STATE OF EMERGING EVIDENCE ON CAM 161 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Both Chapter 2 and this chapter have presented information on what is known about CAM and where the gaps in knowledge exist. Chapter 2presented the committee 's recommendations on ways to address the gaps in knowledge discussed in that chapter. These gaps in knowledge are reviewedbelow: The information available about the motivations for CAM use indi- cates that pursuit of wellness is a major impetus; however, the extent towhich CAM use is a trigger for positive behavioral change is unknown andconstitutes an important research issue. Existing surveys provide little information about how the use of CAM therapies is initiated; that is, are they self-initiated, provider initiated,provider administered, or self-administered? There are virtually no data on adherence to CAM treatment or self- treatment with CAM. This information is crucial to assessments of the real-world effectiveness and safety of CAM therapies and their use. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify people 's trajectories of CAM use and those factors that influence upward and downward slopes inuse. There is little research on how the public obtains information about CAM therapies: what types of information are deemed credible, marginal,and spurious; how does the public understand the information in terms ofrisks and benefits; how do such perceptions inform decision making; andwhat do members of the public expect their providers to tell them? This chapter has discussed the emerging evidence about CAM thera- pies, including sources of information (MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library);summarized the systematic reviews that have been conducted; examinedthe need for high-quality studies; and explored the gaps in evidence. Thegaps discussed include the paucity of clinical research in which CAMinterventions are compared with each other and with conventional medi-cine therapies, the need for expanded basic research to include areas otherthan botanicals, the lack of cost-effectiveness research, the need for cross-disciplinary and transdisciplinary research, and the importance of drawingestablished scientists to the field of CAM research. The committee hasproposed a research framework to address these gaps as well as conductthe kinds of research recommended in Chapter 2. This framework includesa sentinel surveillance system, PBRNs, and CAM research centers that canincorporate information from national surveys (both periodic and longitu-dinal) and facilitate the work of the PBRNs.162 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE The committee believes that a research model such as the one described in this chapter, if it is adequately funded and implemented, will help pro-vide additional understanding of the vast and varied field of CAM. As partof the following recommendation, the committee specifies the need foroversampling of racial and ethnic minorities in surveys. Many racial andethnic minorities constitute a comparatively small proportion of the totalU.S. population or are concentrated in a small number of geographic areas.In both situations, the number of individuals in a specific racial or ethnicgroup who will be selected in a nationwide random sample is typically toosmall to provide the basis for statistically reliable estimates for that popula-tion. Therefore, the only way to obtain meaningful results for such minoritygroups and to allow comparisons with the majority non-Hispanic whitepopulation is to oversample these groups, that is, to select the sample in afashion that ensures that the proportion of individuals from these minoritygroups in the sample is larger than their proportion in the overall U.S.population. The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other public agencies provide the support necessary to develop and implement a sentinel surveillance system, practice- based research networks, and CAM research centers to facilitate the workof the networks; include CAM-relevant questions in federally funded health care surveys (e.g., the National Health Interview Survey) and in ongoing longi-tudinal cohort studies (e.g., the Nurses' Health Study and the FraminghamHeart Study); and implement periodic comprehensive, representative, national sur- veys to assess the changes in the prevalence, patterns, perceptions, and costsof therapy use (both CAM and conventional medicine), with oversamplingof ethnic minorities.

The exploration of the \"scientific, policy, andpractice questions that arise from the significant and increasing use ofcomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies by the Americanpublic\" and \"the translation of validated therapies into conventional prac-tice\" require that the ethics of medicine be probed in two domains. The firstis the individual provision of personal health services; the second is theprofession's social advocacy for public health. The statement of task alsoaddresses the development of \"models and frameworks\" that would beappropriate for the translation of CAM therapies. Ethical models and frame-works for human subjects research as they apply to CAM are an essentialpart of this development. VALUE COMMITMENTS THAT INFORM THIS CHAPTER To accomplish its task, the committee addressed the ethical questions in CAM research, practice, and policy. Yet, even undertaking this taskrequired that some ethical assumptions be made. The committee believesthat five major ethical commitments must be embraced. These deserve ex-plicit acknowledgment because they serve as presuppositions or premises ofthis chapter. The first three are more familiar and will be discussed briefly.The last two receive more expansive treatment because they are less famil-iar and because they are central to a fair and comprehensive understandingof CAM therapies.ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 169 1. A social commitment to public welfare. In terms of medical thera- pies, a commitment to public welfare is the obligation to generate andprovide to health care practitioners, policy makers, and the public access tothe best information available on the efficacy of CAM therapies. This is aduty of beneficence (Beauchamp and Childress, 1994; Churchill, 1995). 2. A commitment to protect patients and the public generally from hazardous medical practices and to inform practitioners, policy makers,and the public of select therapeutic modalities that are potentially injuriousor deleterious to health. This commitment is closely related to the first oneand is often expressed in the bioethics literature as a duty of nonmaleficence,and by physicians as primum non nocere \u2014first, do no harm, which com- prises the Hippocratic Oath from the sixth century B.C.E. (Beauchamp andChildress, 1994). As will be discussed in this chapter, nonmaleficence inapproaching CAM therapies by individual practitioners includes respectingdivergent cultural beliefs; creating an emotionally safe environment for thediscussion of CAM; and appreciating how CAM may fit into a patient 's larger social, familial, or spiritual life (Adams et al., 2002; Cohen, 2003).Nonmaleficence in policy decisions includes such things as devising appro-priate research strategies and labeling and advertising policies that protectthe public. 3. A respect for patient autonomy (or in social terms, a commitment to consumer choice in health care). Autonomy expresses the interest in allow-ing and actively enabling individuals to make knowing and voluntarychoices in health care, in accord with their own values. Such choices cannotbe made without the provision of information regarding benefits and risksthat are implied in the first two commitments, so in this way respect for theautonomy of patients (and choice for consumers) is possible only whenindividuals and social agencies exercise beneficence and nonmaleficencewhen they are in the position to do so (Beauchamp and Childress, 1994). 4. Recognition of medical pluralism (Callahan, 2002; Kaptchuk and Eisenberg, 2001). Serious consideration of the safety, efficacy, and poten-tial integration of CAM therapies into conventional medicine meansacknowledgement of multiple valid modes of healing and a pluralistic foun-dation for health care. Many CAM practices (such as chiropractic, acu-puncture, naturopathy, and homeopathy) are rooted, at least in part, informs of evidence and logic other than those used in biomedical sciences,often with long traditions and theoretical systems of interpretation diver-gent from those used in biomedicine. Investigation of CAM practices entailsa moral commitment of openness to diverse interpretations of health andhealing, a commitment to finding innovative ways of obtaining evidence,and an expansion of the knowledge base relevant and appropriate to medi-cal practice. This commitment to openness also includes reconsideration of170 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE the meaning and the relevance of ethical norms that guide various research and clinical activities, as discussed below. The recognition of medical pluralism is one way to honor social plural- ism, that is, the broad differences in preferences and values expressedthrough the public 's prevalent use of CAM modalities. From a societal perspective, the effort to investigate CAM practices sensitively and analyti-cally means acknowledging that social norms and expectations for medi-cine have always been in transition, such as an increased focus on dealingwith illness experiences, the importance of holistic, healing interactionswith clinicians and providers, and wellness and health promotion as goals(Ritvo et al., 1999; Truant and McKenzie, 1999). A focus on organ func-tion, biological markers, and disease-related variables is restrictive and isno longer an adequate reflection of the social values of patients or thepublic 's expectations for effective health care (Glik, 2000; Jonas, 1998; Mike, 1999; Thorne at al., 2002). Importantly, recent studies suggest thatsome conventional physicians no longer conceive of their practices as lim-ited by their biomedical training and that some practitioners are discussing,referring to or practicing some of the more prominent forms of CAM andbelieve them to be useful or efficacious (Astin, 1998). Yet, care must be taken not to assume compatibility where none exists. Medical pluralism should be distinguished from the cooptation of CAMtherapies by conventional medical practices (Kaptchuk and Eisenberg,2001). Although some conventional medical practices may seek and achievea genuine integration with various CAM therapies, the hazard of integra-tion is that certain CAM therapies may be delivered within the context of aconventional medical practice in ways that dissociate CAM modalities fromthe epistemological framework that guides the tailoring of the CAM prac-tice. If this occurs, the healing process is likely to be less effective or evenineffective, undermining both the CAM therapy and the conventional bio-medical practice. This is especially the case when the impact or changeintended by the CAM therapy relies on a notion of efficacy that is notreadily measurable by current scientific means. A commitment to medical pluralism also has major implications for how research is conducted. Howard Brody puts the problem succinctly:\"Therapies that might be highly effective within the proper cultural and belief context might prove to be totally ineffective within the foreign envi-ronment required for and created by the conduct of an RCT [randomizedcontrolled trial] \" (Brody, 2002). Thus, medical pluralism requires a com- mitment to finding innovative ways to assess efficacy, in accord with itsmultiple meanings and the diverse contexts in which it may occur. In sum, the practice of medical pluralism will mean moving beyond any medicocentric claims for the ultimate ability of biomedicine to incorporateETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 171 all CAM therapies that are of use while discarding the rest. This will require suspending any categorical disbelief in CAM therapies, at least long enoughto consider the evidence for safety and efficacy dispassionately (and some-times innovatively) and in their appropriate contexts rather than only withinthe framework of conventional medicine practice or the usual scientificnorms. Thus, the committee suggests that the proper attitude is one ofskepticism about any claim that conventional biomedical research and prac-tice exhaustively account for the human experiences of health and healing,combined with diligent efforts to discern the significance, safety, and effi-cacy of CAM therapies. 5. The first four ethical commitments (to personal and public benefi- cence, to protection, to patient autonomy and consumer choice, and tomedical pluralism in the service of these aims) provide the general frame-work for this chapter and inform the committee 's selection of areas that require more extensive exploration. In explicitly stating these commitments,the committee also implies a fifth commitment, namely , public accountabil- ity, both for this report and its findings and for the health care system in the United States. Were medical research and health care a private matter paidfor by private funds and with few social consequences, such public account-ability would not be required. Yet, health care, as well as the medicalresearch that supports it, is a public trust that is largely funded with com-mon resources and that has broad societal consequences. Accountability tothe public for prudent and fair assessment and use of medical and healthcare resources is a necessary component of this report. The committee recognizes the complexity of a commitment to public accountability for CAM therapies. For example, many consumers accessCAM therapies outside the context of primary or other medical care; payfor such therapies out of pocket; do not consult with their physicians re-garding such care; and use CAM therapies for relaxation, wellness, spiritualawareness, or reasons other than biomedical disease management (Eisenberget al., 1993, 1998). Similarly, many CAM therapies are offered as part of ahealing process that involves meaning and is attentive to the illness experi-ence and perceptions of risk and vulnerability. Many CAM providers re-gard their therapeutic regimens to be other than and outside systems ofconventional medical care, reimbursement, or even licensure, and are con-cerned with healing as distinct from curing (Young, 1982; Eisenberg et al.,2002). The question of whether licensure, reimbursement, and inclusionwithin hospital-based, integrative models of care would be a socially de-sired good or an undesirable compromise (or even a dilution of healingtraditions) becomes especially significant when one considers that prayer,meditation, and other forms of spiritual healing exist within the rubric ofCAM therapies. For many CAM providers offering services in these do-172 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE mains (and their patients), the significance of a given therapeutic interven- tion may be less about efficacy on the physiological level and more aboutemotional health, coping, psychological growth, transformation, and self-actualization (Maslow, 1968). Likewise, therapeutic efficacy may involvesuch arguably vague but no less powerful spiritual themes as reconciliationwith the divine or other formulations of \"at-one-ment \" and wholeness, or simply, perhaps, a renewed or more expanded sense of self (Astin andAstin, 2002). Stated in these terms, providers offering (and clients availingthemselves of) some of these therapies may focus less on the kind of physi-ological results validated by evidence in medicine and public health andmore on intangible, yet nonetheless compelling, personal benefits. Suchservices may have less kinship with technologically oriented, biomedicalinterventions and greater kinship with therapies at the borderland of psy-chological and spiritual care that are offered in professions such as pastoralcounseling and hospice. Stated slightly differently, by virtue of their overtly psychological or spiritual aspirations, some of these therapies may have less to do with outerresults and may have more to do with a kind of \"inner revolution. \" For example, Robert Thurman links inner spiritual evolution and outer socialchange through Tibetan Buddhist psychological and religious teachings(Thurman, 1998). In the Western traditions, philosophers and religiousthinkers as diverse as Plato and Mary Baker Eddy have ascribed to linkagesbetween health and various ritual practices, beliefs, or ways of thinking.Thus, although physicians or public health professionals may speak interms of morbidity, mortality, and risk factors, other kinds of clinicians andtherapists may think in terms of healing the shadow self and increasing thecapacity for intimacy and mature love (Fromm-Reichmann, 1960) or thegrowth of (and care for) the soul (Ingerman, 1991). Some physicians wouldeven link these two domains (Ornish, 1998). In other words, public ac-countability, like medical pluralism, must include some consideration of thevast array of perspectives that constitute the national (and even interna-tional) heritage of healing traditions. In this light, some CAM providers would prefer that their healing traditions remain outside conventional systems of care and reimbursementand beyond the reach of efforts at integration (Cohen, 1998; Eisenberg etal., 1998). The complexity and persistence of such issues are evident notonly in the domain of licensure and credentialing but also in the domain ofherbal products. Questions have arisen, for example, who can own the knowledge of indigenous herbal traditions; who should own such knowl- edge; and under what conditions (or even whether at all) may such knowl-edge be transferred, developed, commercialized, or maintained as private(or in some traditions, sacred, and thereby beyond public dissemination)?ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 173 Such questions also touch on the nature of scientific evidence and whether methodologies appropriate to these issues of accountability can be designed. An additional complicating factor in public accountability is that com- panies that have successfully marketed a CAM product may have not onlyphilosophical reservations but also little or no financial incentive to havetheir product tested in independent settings. Perhaps only those companiesthat strongly believe in their products and that are willing to risk therevealing of evidence contrary to their convictions about their products(and those of loyal practitioners and customers) would willingly participatein research on their products. An additional financial disincentive is thedifficulty in securing a patent on many of these products. Yet, insofar asthese products are part of health care practices and are labeled or used assuch by the American public, the manner is which they are regulated shouldaccount for all five of the ethical commitments outlined here, includingaccountability. Accountability thus includes a sensitivity to the complex needs and desires of multiple constituents within the public sector (e.g., licensed clini-cians and other healers, patients, professional organizations, regulatoryboards, and other government authorities) and at the same time a recogni-tion of the heterogeneity of communities and interests within each set ofconstituents (e.g., multiple regulatory boards with overlapping or intersect-ing authorities; multiple professional groups with competing theories, defi-nitions of practice, lineages of tradition, and legislative goals; multiplepatient and consumer protection groups, each balancing the paternalism-autonomy dilemma in different ways; and multiple stakeholders within thefederal government and state governments). Accountability also includes asensitivity to the blurring of boundaries that increasingly occurs not onlybetween the legally authorized scope of practice for different professions(for example, the overlap between professions such as chiropractic, physi-cal therapy, and massage therapy) (Cohen, 1998) but also between emerg-ing (or frontier) practices in medicine, the mental health professions, CAMprofessions that use bioenergetic or biofield approaches to therapy (NIH,1995; Jonas and Chez, 2003), and various forms of spiritual care (Cohen,2003). For example, hypnosis and guided imagery are related therapies thatmay cross the chasm between the physical and the metaphysical realms, asboth can be used for different purposes by surgeons, dentists, and massagetherapists, as well as in clinics for smoking cessation and weight loss and inhospice. Moreover, therapeutic goals can range from pain reduction andaccelerated healing to the kind of growth envisioned in fields such astranspersonal psychology (Rosen, 1982). Sensitivity to all the complexitiesdescribed above will be evident in the committee 's approach, the ethical commitments highlighted, and the recommendations.174 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE VALUE JUDGMENTS IN DEFINING CAM Value judgments are implicit in the term CAM itself. Just deciding what should be categorized as a CAM therapy \u2014as distinct from a religious ritual or a cultural practice \u2014from among the dozens of alternative practices is a decision with important value implications. The reasons for defining mo-dalities as \"CAM therapies \" are not only scientific but also political, social, and conceptual (Jonas, 2002). These include a lack of a generally acceptedexplanatory model; the fact that the origin of the practice (e.g., acupunc-ture) is outside of the dominant system; the amount of data or the type ofdata is considered insufficient or otherwise inadequate (e.g., herbalism andmegavitamin therapy); the use of the practice is marginalized in that it is notwidely available within conventional hospitals (e.g., chiropractic); the teach-ing of the practice is marginalized in that it is not generally taught withinmedical, nursing, or graduate schools of the dominant institutions (e.g.,nutritional therapy); the amount of research funding, infrastructure, andcapacity for investigating the practice is low (e.g., massage); reimbursementfor the practice is not provided by insurance companies and third-partypayers; the practice is not readily used for feasibility, acceptability, or otherreasons (e.g., clinical ecology and complex lifestyle programs); the practiceis not regulated or licensed in most states (e.g., naturopathy); and an aspectof the therapy is marginalized, even though it is studied under other namesor subdivisions (e.g., antineoplastons and shark cartilage). In brief, whensomething is labeled \"CAM \": and when \"CAM therapies \" are sorted and differentiated, it is important to recognize the diverse social and politicalvalue judgments at work. These value judgments are sometimes embeddedin the scientific, medical, and educational rationales for health taxonomies.Attending to these implicit value components will reduce the likelihood ofmiscategorization and misunderstanding. The following sections address three sets of ethical issues in CAM research and practice: ethical issues in CAM research; ethical issues in theintegration of CAM therapies into conventional practice; and related legaland regulatory issues. Some of the conclusions from this chapter are in-cluded in the recommendations of other chapters of the report. An addi-tional aim of this chapter is to raise questions and flag areas that practitio-ners, researchers, and policy makers believe will need to be considered ingreater depth. ETHICAL ISSUES IN CAM RESEARCH Over the past 60 years the major sources for guidance on the ethics of research with human subjects in the United States have been the NurembergCode (1946), the Declaration of Helsinki (1964, revised in 1996), the Inter-ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 175 national Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Sub- jects (1982, revised in 1993), the Belmont Report of the National Commis-sion for the Protection of Human Subjects in Biomedical and BehavioralResearch (1979), and the federal Common Rule, (U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services, 45 CFR 46, 1991). Emanuel and colleagues (2000)have proposed a consolidation and synthesis of the diverse principles andnorms in these various codes and statements into seven requirements which,if satisfied, \"make clinical research ethical. \" Their synthesis provides a useful beginning point for considering the ethical challenges raised by CAMresearch. Social or Scientific Value The value of a research project is the extent to which it holds the promise of improving health or increasing knowledge important to health,when it is judged on either social or scientific grounds. Social or scientificvalue must be considered because resources available for research are scarceand should be expended wisely. It is also ethically imperative that subjectsenrolled in clinical trials not be placed at risk except in the search forsocially or scientifically important results. The placement of subjects at riskfor an insignificant outcome is exploitation. Here the challenge for CAMresearch will be to select for investigation those therapies that have thegreatest social or scientific significance. Yet, CAM therapies do not consti-tute a consistent or unified set of practices but constitute a wide-ranging setof highly variable practices, valued in different ways by the constituenciesthat deliver and receive them. This is a difference in degree, but not in kind,from the decisions that policy makers and researchers already face, forexample, when they are faced with decisions about whether to fund moreresearch on hypertension, cancer, or depression. Such decisions, however,may be more complex when CAM therapies are considered, precisely be-cause there may be no common standard for adjudicating the relative valueof various CAM therapies, except perhaps by recourse to conventionalbiomedical definitions and rankings of health and disease. Yet exclusiverecourse to conventional definitions and rankings would challenge the com-mitment to pluralism. Thus, even in the selection of which CAM remediesto investigate, there is the need for negotiation about the relative social andscientific values of therapies. There is also a risk, common to many areas ofmedical research, that the commercial interest of providers and manufac-turers will dominate over public interests and health needs (Hilts, 2003).Ensuring that social and scientific values prevail over commercial ones willbe an ongoing ethical task.176 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Scientific Validity Validity results when scientific principles and methods are used to produce reliable outcomes. Ethically, the same considerations that endorsesocial or scientific value also underwrite scientific validity. Research that isunderpowered, that does not have a testable hypothesis, or that cannototherwise achieve its purpose is a waste of resources and constitutes theexploitation of human subjects, who are placed at risk for no beneficialpurpose. For CAM research, it is important to ask about the range ofscientific validity that is appropriate and what should count as a validatedtherapy. Because it entails social values, this is as much an ethical as anepistemological question. For example, should a \"validated therapy \" mean one that can be adequately explained in terms of the conventional biomedi-cal model or, more simply, one that can be shown to provide benefit, evenin the absence of a scientific explanation of its mechanism of action? Ethi-cally, this presents a value-based choice between a more conventional scien-tific understanding of a validated CAM therapy and a more pragmaticstance that may not be consistent with current research standards for con-ventional medicine. In a parallel but slightly different context, regulationssuch as disciplinary provisions in medical licensing statues that divide theworld of CAM therapies into such categories as \"validated, \" \"invalidated, \" and \"nonvalidated \" and do so partly in terms of theoretical \"plausibility \" should also be examined for both epistemological and ethical assumptions. Fair Subject Selection The ethical principle at play in fair subject selection is justice. Putting justice to work in clinical research means selecting subjects so that there isan equitable distribution of benefits and burdens. This means attending tothe relative vulnerability of subjects for certain kinds of high-risk research,making sure that there is equity in subject selection along the lines of racial-ethnic socioeconomic status, gender, and other factors. More generally, fairsubject selection means that those who bear the risks of research should beamong those who reap the benefits and that those populations who enjoythe fruits of research should also share in the risks. There is no simpleformula for how to achieve fair subject selection, but there are federalrequirements both for protecting certain categories of vulnerable popula-tions (e.g., pregnant women, children, and prisoners) and for includingwomen and children unless they are inappropriate to the study. If CAMtherapies generally were used predominantly by indigent populations or bycertain ethnic or racial minorities, justice would require, other things beingequal, that the subject populations be drawn from these groups and thatthese groups be among the first to receive whatever benefits were availableETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 177 from any newly validated therapies. The United States has yet to enact policies that ensure justice in the distribution of the fruits of research, evenfor conventional medical research. The stipulation of such goals for CAMwould be a good precedent, although awaiting the adoption of such stan-dards of justice will require major policy changes and the absence of suchstandards should not delay research on CAM. Favorable Risk-Benefit Ratios The ethical norm of risk-benefit contains several principles, some of which were discussed above. These include the obligation to minimizerisks to subjects during the trial (nonmaleficence), to enhance potentialbenefits (beneficence), and to ensure that the benefits to subjects or society,or both, are worth the risks incurred (proportionality and nonexploitation).For many CAM practices the absence of standardization among practitio-ners, combined with imprecise measures of outcomes, could make the risk-benefit ratio more difficult to assess when subjects are enrolled in a trialand thereby make the informed-consent process more vague and fragile.For example, many CAM therapies emphasize a concept of wellness that ismore holistic and inclusive than typical outcomes research. Whether andhow to include this more imprecise aspect of health into a clinical trial is aquestion of both epistemology and ethics, that is, both the research meth-odology and the ends that are valued and sought through research. Informed Consent Considered by many as the heart of research ethics, informed consent expresses the obligation of researchers to inform potential subjects of thepurpose of research, its risks and benefits, along with the alternatives, in amanner that ensures that the participants understand these elements ofresearch and can act freely to enroll or decline. Informed consent is one ofthe chief ways of promoting subject autonomy, or self-determination, whichis the right of free choice based on one 's own values. Some of those desig- nated as vulnerable in the federal Common Code are categorized as suchprecisely because of their diminished capacity to give consent. More gener-ally, it is now well recognized that subjects who are ill and who participatein research in a clinical setting, often with their regular doctors acting asresearchers, are likewise in a vulnerable position with regard to informedconsent (Appelbaum et al., 1987; U.S. Advisory Committee on HumanRadiation Experiments, 1996). Here the issue is not subjects ' mental ca- pacities, but their expectations, with the subjects often attributing moretherapeutic potential to a research project than the evidence or the trialdesign warrants. This has been termed the \"therapeutic misconception, \"178 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE and it is a known hazard for both subjects and investigators, and perhaps also for others in the research process, such as sponsors and institutionalreview boards (IRBs) (Dresser, 2002; Henderson and King, 2003; Miller,2000). It may be an especially vexing issue for trials involving CAM thera-pies, especially those CAM therapies that rely on the expectancy of patientsor on close practitioner-patient relationships for a substantial part of theirefficacy. In other words, working to correct the therapeutic misconception in clinical trials of CAM therapies may undermine precisely those elements ofbelief and expectancy on which some CAM therapies rely. Therefore, careshould be taken to design protocols that can take account of this compo-nent of expectancy (without vitiating it). In this regard CAM therapiesdiffer only in degree, and not in kind, from research with conventionalremedies. Investigators and sponsors should be vigilant about expectancyfactors in themselves, as well as in subjects and in the informed consentprocess as CAM therapies are tested. Independent Review Independent review means a review of the research design, subject population, risk-benefit ratio, and so forth, by persons with expertise inthese facets of research and not affiliated with the trial in question. The aimhere is to minimize conflicts of interests, ensure objectivity, and enhancepublic accountability. Independent review of CAM trials may pose chal-lenges in terms of finding reviewers who are knowledgeable about themodalities under investigation and about research procedures and yet whoare sufficiently disinterested about the outcomes. Respect for Potential and Enrolled Subjects This last, catchall category of respect incorporates several requirements: (1) permitting subject withdrawal from the research; (2) protecting subjectprivacy through confidentiality; (3) informing subjects of changes in risksand benefits during the trial; (4) making the research results available to thesubjects of that research; and (5) generally, maintaining the welfare of thesubjects throughout the trial. Here CAM therapies pose a potential issue ofexpertise in research oversight. Typically, IRBs consist of individuals withknowledge and expertise in conventional medicine modalities and research.Thus, it will be necessary to identify and recruit reviewers who have knowl-edge of CAM therapies and who are well versed in both the standardprotocols and any innovative features involved in CAM protocols. Beyond these more particular areas for ethical inquiry, it is important to acknowledge the powerful role of social perceptions and values in shap-ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 179 ing biomedical research policy. These perceptions and values will likely be at play in CAM research as well and may perhaps be at play in morepronounced ways. In the 1970s, when ethical guidelines and federal regula-tions governing clinical research were first codified, research was generallyconceived of as a risky undertaking from which subjects needed protection.The late 1980s and early 1990s marked a major shift in public and scientificattitudes toward research \"from protection to access \" (Churchill et al., 1998; Mastroianni and Kahn, 2001). AIDS activism played a major role inthis transition; eagerness to participate in clinical trials is now a commonoccurrence, even for Phase I research, in which the chances for benefit areremote or nonexistent (Daugherty et al., 1995, 2000). Some practitioners,patients, and policy makers regard all clinical research to be presumptivelybeneficial, so that being denied access to a trial is considered discrimination(King, 1995). In this climate, there is a need to consider carefully a balancethat will \"reconcile public safety with public demand \" (Thorne et al., 2002). When public demand is fueled by commercial and entrepreneurial interests,as has been the case in gene therapy research, the task of achieving balancecan be difficult (Churchill et al., 1998; Orkin and Motulsky, 1995; Ross etal., 1996). This is an ongoing challenge for all medical research, but it is aparticularly important one for CAM research, especially research on thoseCAM modalities in which public assumptions about efficacy are prevalentand for which commercial forces are strong. In summary CAM therapies should be rigorously evaluated for reasons of both public safety and health promotion. The ethical principles thatguide conventional biomedical research should also be applied to CAMresearch (Miller et al., 2004). Yet, careful attention will be required todiscern the applicability of these principles; and some of the key terms, suchas \"informed consent, \" \"equipoise, \" and \"risk-benefit \" will sometimes have interpretations in CAM research different from those in research conductedby conventional medical protocols. ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE INTEGRATION OF CAM THERAPIES INTO CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL PRACTICE Although the major sources for modern research ethics have all been created within the past 60 years, some of the chief ethical precepts forconventional clinical practice enjoy a 2,500-year history. All Western ethi-cal traditions for medical practice trace their origins to the HippocraticOath (sixth century B.C.E.), and many graduates of U.S. medical schoolsstill mark their commencement with a recitation of some version of thisoath. More recent ethical guidelines for medical practice can be found inMaimonides ' Daily Prayer for a Physician (1793), the American Medical Associations ' first Code of Ethics (1847) and its more recent Principles180 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (2001), and the Declaration of Geneva (1948). In addition, most of the recognized specialty organizations of U.S. conventional medicine haveadopted their own codes, principles, or guidelines to address ethical issuesgermane to their work. It is clear from even a cursory look that the official, written codes of CAM practitioners indicate a parallel set of commitments and many similarprinciples and virtues. For example, the Code of Ethics of the American Chiropractic Association includes duties of confidentiality, privacy, andloyalty; obligations not to neglect or abandon the patient; duties of honestyand competency; and the use of modalities that are in the patient 's best interest and not in conflict with applicable statutory or administrative rules(ACA, 1996). Duties of confidentiality, nonabandonment, and compe-tency are also reflected in ethical codes and manuals for physicians (Ameri-can College of Physicians, 1998). Similarly, the Model Code of Ethics of the Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Commission requires, among other things, that practitioners becompetent, maintain patient confidences and records, not abandon pa-tients, provide a clear treatment plan, charge fees that are not excessive,inform the patient regarding contraindications, maintain appropriate thera-peutic boundaries, and refrain from false or misleading advertising (NAFTAAcupuncture and Oriental Medicine Commission, 1997). Likewise, theNaturopathic Code of Ethics of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians includes nonmaleficence among its guiding principles to \"pro- vide the most effective health care available with the least risk to his/herpatients at all times \" and requires that naturopathic physicians maintain competence and honesty (AANP, 1990). These common aims regarding patient care and practitioner duties should provide some initial common ground for the negotiations aboutwhen and how practicioners can collaborate or integrate forms of carewhile respecting the pluralism necessary to sustain what is valuable anddistinctive within each system of care. Nevertheless, the effort to integrate CAM therapies into conventional medicine practice can present the physician with a variety of ethical chal-lenges. Given the prevalence of CAM use by the general public it is clearthat many patients seen in conventional medical clinics are also seeingCAM providers or using CAM therapies. This presents the conventionalmedicine practitioner not only with opportunities of defining physician-patient relationships in new ways and with expanded understandings of\"health \" and \"care\" but also with some new responsibilities and some potential hazards regarding patient safety and adherence to physician rec-ommendations. For example, it is now important that conventional medi-cine practitioners ask about a patient 's use of CAM when the patient 's history is taken. Such history taking must be done in a safe environment inETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 181 which the patient can freely discuss the CAM therapies that he or she has received or is receiving without fear of punitive judgment or the withdrawalof conventional medical care. A moral correlate to this elicitation is thephysician 's obligation to be well informed about the CAM modalities most frequently used by patients, an obligation of candor about the physician 's level of knowledge of the CAM modalities in question, and, following fromthat, an obligation to make patients aware of whatever safety and efficacyinformation is available (Eisenberg, 1997; Sugarman and Burk, 1998). Ernstand Cohen (2001) discuss this as the duty \"to tell patients about the degree of uncertainty associated with the efficacy and safety of the treatment, aswell as the availability and risk-benefit ratio of other treatment options. \" However, this is further complicated by the conventional medicine practi-tioners ' limited exposure to CAM modalities, lack of knowledge about CAM, minimal or nonexistent educational tools, and limited access toresources, as well as the current practice demands on conventional medi-cine practitioners. In these interactions, ethics will require a balancing ofprinciples and commitments. Any decision to forgo conventional medicaltreatment should be accompanied by careful monitoring of the patient bythe conventional practitioner (Cohen and Eisenberg, 2002; Ernst andCohen, 2001). Adams and colleagues (2002) presented a helpful delineation of options for the physician in recommending, tolerating, or in some cases, activelyproscribing CAM therapies to patients on the basis of an individualizedrisk-benefit assessment. The ethical analysis suggested for the clinical con-sideration of the use of a CAM therapy involves weighing the severity andthe acuteness of illness; the curability of the illness by conventional forms ofmedical treatment; the degree of invasiveness, associated toxicities, and sideeffects of the conventional medical treatment; the availability and quality ofevidence of the utility and safety of the CAM treatment; the level of under-standing of the risks and the benefits of the CAM treatment, combined withthe patient 's knowledge and voluntary acceptance of those risks; and the patient 's persistence of intention to use the CAM therapies. Evaluation of all these factors can be very helpful in analyzing particular cases and inevi-tably involves a scaling and balancing of the ethical norms discussed above.The implications for physician action based on their \"risk framework \" can be summarized as follows: If evidence [concerning the CAM therapy] supports both safety and effica- cy, the physician should recommend the therapy but continue to monitorthe patient conventionally. If evidence supports safety but is inconclusive about efficacy, the treatment should be cautiously tolerated and moni- tored for effectiveness. If evidence supports efficacy but is inconclusiveabout safety, the therapy could still be tolerated and monitored for safety. Finally, therapies for which evidence indicates either serious risk or ineffi-182 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE cacy obviously should be avoided and patients actively discouraged from pursuing such a course of treatment. (Adams et al., 2002) These recommendations are sound, but they raise further questions about how they can be carried out. Many CAM therapies have not beensystematically researched, and the information available may be limitedand not within the practicing physician 's fund of knowledge. Medical edu- cation for students and residents as well as for physicians in private practicewill need to be addressed and revised so that physicians can fulfill these newobligations for their patient populations. Realistically, this will take signifi-cant effort, time, and resources, as well as a commitment to ensure thatCAM modalities can be effectively discussed with and framed appropriatelyfor patients, as Adams and colleagues have outlined. Some argue that there is enough agreement in basic aims between conventional medicine and CAM to permit CAM practices to be embraced,so long as the therapies that they offer are safe and effective. For example,Sugarman and Burk (1998) compared the health-related goals of a standardlist of conventional medicine and CAM practices and found commonalityin terms of prevention, relief of pain and suffering, care for those whocannot be cured, and general promotion and maintenance of health(Bratman, 1997; Callahan, 1996; Sugarman and Burk, 1998). Yet beyondthese formal commonalities are deeper questions about the methods andmeans by which these health-related goals are reached. Moreover, the ex-panding use of CAM practitioners and therapies implies a sense of thelimits of conventional medicine and conventional medical practice in ac-complishing its desired health goals, even if the conventional therapies arenot perceived as inadequate by the public. Callahan (1996) poses the ques-tion this way: \"What is lacking in conventional medicine that they [pa- tients] seek? \" Put more pointedly, \"Why do so many people in the U.S. pay out-of-pocket to see CAM practitioners and use CAM remedies? \" At least a partial answer has been identified by Astin, who concluded that CAMproviders seem to have norms and styles of interaction with patients thatare more congruent with patients \"values, beliefs, and philosophical orien- tations toward health and life. \" The reasons for the widespread and grow- ing use of CAM therapies are many, but for Astin, one reason, arguably, isthe public 's desire for a kind of health service and a kind of patient-provider interaction that is sometimes not available through the services offered byconventional medicine. Further research comparing conventional medicineand CAM practitioners on biopsychosocial dimensions in the delivery ofhealth services would be useful both for medical research and medicalpractice. Although it seems likely that conventional medicine can be enhanced through the study of CAM practices, it is neither possible nor desirable forETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 183 conventional medicine to adopt all salutary features of high-quality CAM care. On some occasions, and for some individuals, CAM practices areindeed distinctive and truly complementary to conventional medicine, es-pecially when the CAM practitioner and patient share a cultural heritageor a spiritual tradition. In these cases, most physicians will possess neitherthe skills nor the inclination to learn and incorporate CAM practices, andindeed, integration into a single practice norm should not be the aim.However, it is also possible, and perhaps even desirable, for patients-consumers that some proven CAM practices be incorporated into conven-tional medicine, for example, acupuncture for chemotherapy-induced nau-sea. To do so would be in keeping with commitments to beneficence,nonmaleficence, and respect for patient autonomy, as well as the bestcaring traditions of all health professionals. Yet, as noted earlier, integra-tion also runs the risk of co-optation. It is also possible that referral to anacupuncture practitioner be made to offer these patients this service with-out integrating acupuncture into the conventional medical practice. Inte-gration is not always desirable, and even when it is desirable, may not befeasible. The meaning and aim of \"integration \" requires a careful defini- tion, clarity around the value assumptions that it entails, and negotiationabout the epistemic and political assumptions that it carries, in addition toits more immediate patient care goals. RELATED LEGAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES Ethical concerns in clinical care, whether they involve conventional or CAM therapies, frequently overlap with legal considerations. For example,the obligation to provide adequate informed consent has both ethical andlegal dimensions and, whether involving biomedical or CAM therapies,requires disclosure of all information material to a treatment decision (Ernstand Cohen, 2001). This includes the probability that the patient will benefitfrom the procedure, the probability that the patient will encounter risksassociated with this procedure, and the alternative options that are feasibleand available as well as their risks and benefits (Ernst and Cohen, 2001).Thus, if a reasonable physician (or a reasonable patient, depending on thestate) finds that a program that incorporates yoga, meditation, and lifestylechanges for the prevention and treatment of cardiac disease is material to atreatment decision (or that Gingko biloba improves dementia because of circulation problems or possibly Alzheimer 's disease [Kleinjen and Knipschild, 1992; LeBars et al., 1997]), then the clinician is ethically andlegally required to discuss the risks and benefits of the program (or dietarysupplement) (Cohen, 2000; Ernst and Cohen, 2001). This requirement is inkeeping with the contemporary shift toward shared decision making be-tween patient and clinician, in which patient preferences are actively con-184 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE sidered and valued. This is resonant with a baseline commitment to patient autonomy. Attending to patient preferences is not only morally laudatory,because it is part of honoring patient self-determination, but also mayincrease adherence and, by that means, efficacy as well. Questions will inevitably arise about just how much evidence about a CAM therapy is needed before it becomes a part of the treatment optionsroutinely mentioned or offered to patients. It can be argued that it is unethi-cal to offer any CAM therapy until evidence from an RCT is complete. Thestronger argument is that judgments about how much evidence is enoughmust be referenced to a diversity of factors, including the efficacies ofconventional medical therapies; the hazards of the CAM modalities in ques-tion, if any; the extent to which these CAM modalities are preferred bypatients; and the overall quality of whatever evidence exists. It should notbe forgotten that RCTs of many conventional medical therapies that areroutinely recommended and widely used have not been conducted. Posingthe RCT as the sole test and necessary barrier for acceptance of a CAMtherapy is questionable and may not be applicable with respect to certainCAM modalities. Requiring RCTs may undermine the commitment to medi-cal pluralism. As noted above, Adams and colleagues (2002) offer a helpful frame- work for addressing the therapeutic relationship in the absence of signifi-cant evidence, when there is no standard efficacious treatment or whenconventional therapy has failed, and when the patient 's intention to use a CAM therapy is strong and persistent. When the implications of this frame-work are spelled out and the patient makes an informed, autonomouschoice in favor a CAM therapy, it may, indeed, be unethical for the physi-cian to withhold either treatment or an appropriate referral (Adams et al.,2002; Cohen, 2003). The rationale is that, as a general rule, \"the personal beliefs and choices of other persons should be respected if they pose nothreat to other parties \" (Adams et al., 2002). If a patient with a precancer- ous condition, for example, seeks to pursue such therapies as meditation,colonics, yoga, and reiki rather than surgery for a limited time while con-tinuing monitoring by a physician, it is ethically compelling for the physi-cian to honor the patient 's core values and internal sense of integrity while compassionately discussing the physician 's perspective (Adams et al., 2002). The physician who cannot in good conscience support this choice candocument informed refusal of care and needs to consider the caring com-mitment that is part of the ongoing relationship with the patient (Adams etal., 2002). Such a physician may feel that it is medically incorrect, given hisor her training and experience, to elect to support the patient 's preference for CAM; and even though the physician is compassionate, he or she maybe unable to administer or support care effectively. The ethical obligationof nonabandonment requires that if the physician opts to withdraw fromETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 185 care, referral to a more like-minded physician who can continue to monitor the patient is warranted (Adams et al., 2002). Although physicians should be clear about the ethical duty of nonabandonment, they should also \"take the initiative to proactively steer the patient away from treatments that are known to be dangerous or havebeen associated with clinically significant adverse interactions with othersupplements or medications \" (Adams et al., 2002). Moreover, when there is no evidence either for or against a given CAM therapy, physicians \"can choose to tolerate and monitor or actively discourage use of CAM treat-ments \" (Adams et al., 2002; Cohen and Eisenberg, 2002). In so doing, physicians should consider such factors as the severity and acuteness of theillness; the manageability or curability of the illness by conventional formsof treatment; the degree of invasiveness, associated toxicities, and side ef-fects of the conventional treatment; the availability and quality of evidenceof the utility and safety of the desired CAM treatment; the level of under-standing of the risks and benefits of the CAM treatment combined with thepatient 's knowledge and voluntary acceptance of those risks; and the patient 's persistence of intention to use CAM therapies (Adams et al., 2002). By following this procedure, clinicians can formulate a plan that is \"clini- cally sound, ethically appropriate, and targeted to the unique circumstancesof individual patients \" even in the absence of scientific evidence (Adams et al., 2002). The ensuing discussions between physicians and patients notonly are the \"heart of informed consent, \" but also are \"often the beginning rather than the ending \" of the conversation (Adams et al., 2002). The best approach should take into consideration the unique circumstances of theindividual patient. While some tension between medical pluralism and anevidence-based approach is likely inevitable and probably productive, thecommittee suggests that some of this tension can be resolved by CAMresearch and that the concept of evidence-based medicine will need to bemodified to accommodate the multiple approaches inherent within a plu-ralistic understanding of health care. Finally, when a clinician decides whether to offer, recommend, discour- age, or accept a patient 's use of CAM therapies or refer patients to CAM providers, ethical obligations and legal duties (or at least liability consider-ations) may diverge (Cohen, 2003). For instance, it may be legal, but per-haps not ethical, for a physician with minimum training in acupuncture toprovide the patient such treatment (Cohen, 2003). Conversely, it may beethically compelling, but legally risky, to have an unbiased discussion witha terminally ill patient who is suffering from an incurable brain tumor yetwho is ineligible for available clinical trials and who is interested in trying atreatment not accepted as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Admin-istration (Cohen, 2003; U.S. House of Representatives, 1996; United States v. Rutherford , 1979). In this situation the physician may face a conflict of186 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE values or at least a worldview divergent from that of the patient, who may not share with the physician an understanding of the role and the value ofscientific evidence (or the lack thereof) with the same intensity. Any colli-sion of values requires sensitivity to the patient 's expression of interests that goes well beyond the legalistic requirements of informed consent, as well asattention to the malleable but important fabric of the therapeutic encoun-ter. In this respect, the ethical commitment to medical pluralism should beconsidered as the physician wrestles with conversations involving patientdecision making. Similarly, a physician may ethically support a patient 's stated desire to try yoga, colonics, or reiki for a limited period rather than surgery, yet theclinician might be concerned about potential liability if he or she accepts thepatient 's choice (Adams et al., 2002). Alternatively, the clinician may be sensitive to the potential for unwarranted professional discipline, based onthe use of therapies not generally accepted within the profession (Cohen,1998). Likewise, a hospital administrator may wish to limit potential liabil-ity exposure by introducing only those CAM therapies that have beendemonstrated to be safe and effective to the satisfaction of a hospital com-mittee, the Food and Drug Administration, or a medical specialty group;yet ethically, denying patients access to a larger range of therapies couldconceivably contravene interests in beneficence (e.g., by depriving patientsof potential therapeutic benefit), justice (e.g., by ensuring access to thera-pies), and autonomy (e.g., respecting the patient 's interest in therapies and choice of treatment). As well, once a therapy becomes generally medicallyaccepted, failure to provide adequate informed consent can result in poten-tial malpractice liability (Ernst and Cohen, 2001; Moore v. Baker , 1993). On a broader level, legal and ethical issues often arise, and sometimes conflict, with CAM therapies because the decision facing a clinician (orinstitution) may engender a conflict between medical paternalism (the de-sire to protect patients from foolish or ill-informed, although voluntary,decisions) and patient autonomy (Cohen 1998, 2003). As suggested, theconflict between paternalism and autonomy can be accentuated by thepatient 's selection of therapies that may, at the moment of choice, lack general medical acceptance or a sufficiently recognized evidentiary base(Cohen, 2003a). Whether strong paternalism \u2014which would violate a patient 's informed, voluntary, and autonomous choice \u2014is justified depends on a number of factors, including the possibility that the projected benefitsof the paternalistic action will outweigh its risks to the patient and thepossibility that the least autonomy-restrictive alternative that will securethe benefits and reduce the risks is selected (Beauchamp and Childress,1994; Cohen, 1995, 1998). Yet, the exercise of strong paternalism shouldbe a rare event (even if it is not so rare in practice), and patient autonomy(for competent adults) is the presumptive norm for all medical care. This isETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 187 because achieving genuine patient autonomy always involves information giving, discussion with the patient, and other enabling actions. Preciselybecause it involves dialogue on perspectives other than those of the pro-vider, including interpreting the facts and probing the meaning of choices,autonomy for patients normally implies the best standard for medical deci-sion making. The challenge for practitioners in achieving and honoringsuch autonomy may well be greater when patients are considering CAMtherapies than when they are considering conventional medical therapies.Practitioners not only may have less information about CAM modalities,but they also may be uncomfortable in the discussion of CAM therapies,since information on CAM is often couched in more analogical and meta-phorical language than the mechanistic cause-and-effect imagery typical ofthe remedies offered by conventional medicine. Regulatory structures increasingly acknowledge the need for weighing and balancing of differing standards. For example, Model Guidelines for the Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Medical Practice , promulgated by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB, 2002),explicitly allow for \"a wide latitude in physicians ' exercise of their profes- sional judgment, \" recognize that \"patients have a right to seek any kind of care for their health problems, \" and aim to create rules that are \"clinically responsible and ethically appropriate. \" Although the model guidelines as a whole may or may not balance or even explicitly address the five ethicalcommitments enumerated earlier, the quoted language at least establishes agreater balance between physician and patient preferences than has histori-cally been supposed. Similarly states are considering whether revisions totheir own medical disciplinary provisions require amendment to more ap-propriately balance one or more of the ethical commitments outlined earlierin this chapter. A number of legal rules also attempt to balance these competing inter- ests and values and to protect patients by combating fraud and enhancingquality assurance while offering access to therapies and honoring medicalpluralism in creating models of integrative care. Complex combinations ofsuch rules may govern decisions by clinicians and health care institutionsthat seek to integrate CAM therapies into conventional medical settings(Cohen, 1998). In addition to informed consent, these rules include licen-sure and scope of practice, malpractice liability, professional discipline,food and drug law, health care fraud, and rules pertaining to third-partyreimbursement (Cohen, 1998) and to spirituality in clinical settings (Cohen,2003). These rules often work to elaborate and complement the five princi-pal ethical commitments discussed at the beginning of this chapter: benefi-cence, nonmaleficence, protection and enablement of autonomy, medicalpluralism, and public accountability. A brief discussion of these rules maybe helpful, as they frequently dovetail with clinical decisions to recommend,188 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE tolerate or accept, or discourage patient use of CAM therapies and visits to CAM providers (Cohen and Eisenberg, 2002). First, licensure is a matter of state law, since states have the power to license (or decline to license) any class of health care providers. This isbecause the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that thepowers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution, norprohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to thepeople, and this reserved power includes regulation of health care licensure.In each state, the medical licensing statute (or medical practice act) prohib-its the unlicensed practice of medicine, whereas other statutes license alliedhealth professionals, such as nurses, physical therapists, and optometrists,and CAM providers such as chiropractors (Cohen, 1998; Eisenberg et al.,2002). Licensure varies by state and profession, and ranges from mandatory licensure to title licensure and registration of the providers with a stateagency (Cohen, 1998). Many CAM-related professional organizations aredeveloping national standards for examination and licensure and legallyauthorized scopes of practice boundaries, ethics, and clinical practice(Eisenberg et al., 2002). Encouraging the continuing development and en-hancement of such standards can help facilitate \"collaboration and referral; offer more authoritative, consistent, and generalizable clinical and financialresearch; minimize access to unqualified CAM providers; help . . .hospital credentialing and . . . risk management \" (Eisenberg et al., 2002). Yet, \"greater homogeneity may undermine the diversity of education, train- ing, and skill, which historically have characterized many CAM profes-sions, \" resulting in \"excessive standardization, rigid scope of practice boundaries, excessive utilization standards . . . and fee schedules, increasesin patient volume, decreases in individualization of services, a decrease intime spent per patient, and a perceived decrease in satisfaction by bothpatients and CAM practitioners \" (Eisenberg et al., 2002). In any event, policies involving licensure, scope of practice and credentialing, and theirrelation to malpractice liability and risk management must be addressedcreatively if health care institutions are to respond to patient interest inCAM therapies in ways that provide therapeutic benefit yet that satisfyliability concerns (Cohen and Ruggie, 2004). Malpractice liability and professional discipline are intertwined, as a claim of negligence against a clinician could trigger civil liability throughthe former mechanism and the loss of licensure or some other sanctionthrough the latter. In Schneider v. Revici the patient sued Dr. Revici for malpractice using a nutritional protocol to treat cancer. Dr. Revici offereda successful defense against the charge on the basis of the fact that thepatient had signed an assumption of risk form (Cohen and Eisenberg, 2002).The caveat to this is that not all states accept assumption of risk as aETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 189 defense, and its application can vary depending on the facts of the case. Likewise, a health care institution can be liable in malpractice cases fordirect negligence (such as negligent credentialing or negligent failure tosupervise a provider) or vicarious negligence (e.g., liability for the act of anemployee or agent) (Cohen, 2000). Medical malpractice (negligence),whether it involves biomedical or CAM therapies, is generally defined asunskillful practice that fails to conform to a standard of care in the profes-sion and that results in patient injury. CAM providers, like physicians andallied health care providers, can also be sued for negligence. The application of liability (or discipline) becomes problematic if a conventional-medicine clinician 's inclusion of CAM therapies is itself con- sidered a deviation from prevailing and acceptable standards of care, as thiscould result in a conclusion of negligence, without necessarily finding evi-dence of wrongful conduct that caused patient injury (Cohen, 1999a,b,2000). In Charell v. Gonzales the patient sued Dr. Gonzales for substituting a nutritional protocol for cancer care. The jury found Dr. Gonzales notonly negligent but also reckless; however, the patient had implied consentto the protocol and, therefore, was deemed 49 percent responsible; liabilitywas thus reduced accordingly (Cohen and Eisenberg, 2002). Once researchestablishes that a specific CAM therapy is within biomedical standards ofcare (e.g., the determination by a National Institutes of Health ConsensusPanel that acupuncture is effective for the relief of nausea following chemo-therapy [National Institutes of Health, 1997]), failure to recommend (orrefer a patient for) such a therapy potentially could be considered malprac-tice (or could lead to professional discipline) if it results in patient injury(Cohen, 1998). In the case of Moore v. Baker (1993), a patient who re- ceived cardiac bypass surgery sued for malpractice, alleging inadequateinformed consent because of the physician 's failure to disclose the possibil- ity of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) chelation therapy as a lessinvasive alternative. The 11th Circuit Court held that if EDTA chelationtherapy were generally accepted within the medical community, the patientmight have an actionable claim. As part of malpractice law, a nonphysician (whether he or she is an allied health care or CAM provider) has a legal (and ethical) duty to referthe patient to a medical doctor if the patient 's condition exceeds the provider 's training, skill, and competence or is not responding to the non- medical treatment (Cohen, 1998). Similarly, the provider who makes agrossly exaggerated claim that induces reliance on a particular therapypotentially could be liable for fraud or misrepresentation (Cohen, 1998).Such legal rules frequently correspond with ethical provisions in the codesof some CAM professions and help protect patients against overzealous oroverreaching practitioners (Cohen, 1998, 2000). It may be helpful for phy-sicians to remember that CAM providers have a legal and ethical duty to190 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE refer a patient for conventional medical care when the patient 's condition requires such referral. Regarding referrals to CAM providers, the general legal rule is that physicians are not liable merely for referring the patient to another pro-vider \u2014whether that provider is a conventional medical or CAM practitio- ner\u2014who turns out to be negligent. On the other hand, physician liability for \"joint treatment \" of the patient with a CAM provider, one notable exception to the general legal rule, may expand as integrative care results ingreater coordination between biomedical and CAM providers (Cohen andEisenberg, 2002) and the level of \"claims consciousness \" by patients of CAM providers increases (Studdert et al., 1998). Although such liabilityconsiderations continue to be unsettled, they should not necessarily pre-clude clinically sensible referrals, based on an awareness of what CAMproviders can and cannot offer the patient, and a shared conversationregarding the objectives (and limits) of any one form of care (Cohen andEisenberg, 2002). Such conversations, indeed, can help further a more plu-ralistic vision of health care, while offering the physician sufficient informa-tion to help navigate unwarranted liability concerns. Although cliniciansand institutions can continue to be guided by considerations of safety andefficacy (Cohen and Eisenberg, 2002), as well as relevant ethical consider-ations (Adams et al., 2002), legal rules and institutions may continue togrow in their understanding of integrative health care practices as the fieldemerges. Another emerging area, food and drug law , is complex and exists at the state as well as federal level. It also impacts the balance between paternal-ism and autonomy interest, as well the ethical commitment to medicalpluralism. For example, Congress, in enacting the Dietary SupplementHealth and Education Act (DSHEA), observed that the federal government\"should not take any actions to impose unreasonable regulatory barriers limiting or slowing the flow of safe products and accurate information toconsumers \" (DSHEA, 1994). The DSHEA has received extensive criticism within the medical community for leaving consumers without sufficientlyaccurate disclosure to make informed decisions regarding herbal products.A secondary criticism has been that the DSHEA allows patients to purchasemedicinal substances without prior proof of safety or efficacy. Such criti-cisms are warranted and have led to calls for increased vigilance \u2014and regulation \u2014to help ensure product safety. At the same time, however, the DSHEA expressly articulates a public policy tilt by the Congress, in the domain of dietary supplements, toward consumer autonomy and awayfrom government regulation. Future regulation concerning dietary supple-ments should account for all the ethical commitments articulated earlier,balancing the interests of competing stakeholders and better accounting forETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CAM 191 public safety, while enhancing the disclosure necessary to facilitate in- formed, autonomous choices. Health care fraud , another important area of legal concern, also is embedded in both federal and a variety of state statutes (such as consumerfraud laws), both civil and criminal, and common-law rules (such as theproscription against misrepresentation). Legally, fraud requires deceptionas well as the intent to deceive (Cohen, 1995). The concern for fraudpervades regulation of CAM therapies and, indeed, was part of the earlyrationale for physician licensure (Cohen, 2003). Yet, because the label of\"fraud \" often has been concluded rather than proven by law and evidence, Congress (in legislative history) has clarified in at least one context \u2014 submission of claims for reimbursement by federal and other funds \u2014that the practice of CAM therapies \"itself would not constitute fraud \" (Report, 1996). Of course, if a practitioner engages in conduct that exploits patientsor unjustifiably diverts them from necessary conventional care, such con-duct may lead to malpractice liability, professional discipline, or otherlegal action, even if not necessarily actionable or fraud. Third-party reim- bursement also implicates legal rules, as notions of \"medical necessity \" and what constitutes \"experimental treatments \" may change as integrative health care unfolds (Cohen, 1998). Finally, the use of spirituality in clinical settings, whether through biomedical or CAM therapies, also implicatesliability and other legal as well as ethical considerations (Cohen, 2003)and requires sensitivity, professionalism, and care to ensure that patientsare offered opportunities to draw on spiritual support without being undulycoerced thereby (Koenig, 2002; Cohen, 2003). Once again, considerationsof spirituality in clinical settings should be guided by considerations ofnonmaleficence, beneficence, autonomy, pluralism, and accountability. Notably, in reviewing the complex interaction of preeminent ethical commitments and relevant legal rules, the existing legal and regulatoryframework emerged from late-nineteenth century rivalries between the\"regular \" physicians and their economic and ideological competitors (mainly, chiropractors and homeopaths) in the provision of Rothstein, 1972; Shryock, 1982). These sectarian rivalries shaped a regulatoryenvironment in which CAM providers often struggled for legal acceptance,and in which CAM providers, and physicians utilizing CAM therapies,found varying levels of regulatory oversight and tolerance (Cohen, 1998). Amore balanced perspective must incorporate notions of medical pluralism(Kaptchuk and Eisenberg, 2001) in a way that assures more unbiased con-sideration of other medical traditions and enables more complete represen-tation by consumers and the various professional groups. In sum, to theextent that the medical, social, political, and public health environments are192 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE changing, legal and regulatory structures also are changing and may further evolve (Cohen, 2000; Callahan, 2002; Cohen, 2003). The sectarian rivalries that have shaped the regulatory and legal envi- ronment have also been at play in the formation of conventional medicine 's ethical precepts. Medicine is and has always been permeated with the cul-ture and values of its time and place, and hence is constantly shaping andbeing shaped by the larger social, cultural, and political forces of its era.The history of medical ethics over the past 2,500 years is vivid testimony tothe ways this has occurred. The prevalence and persistence of CAM thera-pies is another juncture in this evolution. Without rejecting what has beenof great value and service in the past, it is important that ethical norms arebrought under critical scrutiny and evolve, along with medicine 's expand- ing knowledge base and the larger social aims and meanings of medicalpractice.

Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.1967 Integration of CAM and Conventional Medicine A distinct trend toward the integration of complementary and alterna- tive medicine (CAM) therapies with the practice of conventional medicineis occuring. Hospitals are offering CAM therapies, health maintenanceorganizations (HMOs) are covering such therapies, a growing number ofphysicians use CAM therapies in their practices, insurance coverage forCAM therapies is increasing, and integrative medicine centers and clinicsare being established, many with close ties to medical schools and teachinghospitals. How does a new therapy move from the idea stage to the practicestage? What is the extent of integration of CAM and conventional medi-cine? Why is such integration occurring? What approaches are being usedto offer integrated services? This chapter explores these and other questionsrelated to the integration of CAM and conventional medicine. FROM IDEA TO PRACTICE Ideally , conventional medical tests and treatments go through a series of scientific challenges that, if met, allow the test or the treatment to be-come part of conventional medical practice. However, there are and therealways will be exceptions. As noted in Chapter 4, some new practices offerdramatic and evident benefits that may justifiably hasten their acceptance.Sometimes, enthusiasm for the intervention, founded on the plausibility ofthe benefits and the absence of satisfactory alternatives, speeds acceptance,despite a dearth of evidence (e.g., screening for and treatment of prostatecancer). Because the emphasis on evidence-based decision making is relativelyINTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 197 new, many current conventional medical practices did not follow what is now considered to be the normative pathway of translation because theybecame accepted practice before this pathway was fully established. Manypractices that are widely accepted, however, continue to undergo scrutiny,and their indications often change as research identifies those patients whobenefit the most from them. An example is coronary bypass surgery whichbecame accepted treatment before undergoing controlled clinical trials. Theevident effectiveness of coronary bypass surgery in reducing symptoms ofstable angina fostered great enthusiasm for the procedure, with many clini-cians assuming that its effectiveness would be similar in reducing the risksof heart attack and death because of coronary disease. When bypass sur-gery was already well established, a number of RCTs showed that it im-proved the life expectancies of patients with severe coronary artery diseasebut had little effect on patients with mild disease. In addition, it had noeffect on heart attack rates. Similarly, patients with acute coronary syn-dromes that threatened to evolve into myocardial infarction received percu-taneous coronary interventions long before RCTs showed that this strategywas superior (by a small margin) to thrombolysis with drugs. In this idea pathway, the acceptance of new interventions in clinical practice depends on a cycle (Figure 7-1) that begins with a creative ideaderived from either an advance in science or a clinical observation. Thatcreative insight is the basis for hypotheses about treatment effectiveness.Hypotheses are tested through a series of evaluation steps before they areaccepted, first by early adopters and then more widely. As acceptancegrows, a number of forces shape the level of integration of the interventioninto clinical practice. These forces may include difficulty in acquiring tech-nical skills, the supply of practitioners or the capacity to deliver the inter-vention, and coverage decisions made by health plans and other payers.Patient demand for services also affects acceptance and integration. Patientdemand is influenced by evidence of effectiveness, but it is also influenced /K49/K64/K65/K61 /K48/K79/K70/K6F/K74/K68/K65/K73/K69/K73 /K47/K65/K6E/K65/K72/K61/K74/K69/K6F/K6E to practice.198 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE by individual experience with the treatment and the presence or absence of satisfactory alternatives. After its acceptance, ongoing questioning of thevalue of an intervention relative to those of other new and establishedinterventions is necessary to refine clinical practice and generate new cre-ative ideas that lead to further clinical advances. The number of steps or challenges has increased over the past several decades. The process will evolve further, and as the nation looks forward toa health care system in which conventional practice and CAM coexist inclose harmony, these processes will apply to new tests and treatments fromboth the traditions of practice. Several factors are noteworthy, however.First, the series of steps represents a logical progression; however, the pro-cess is not uniformly followed in conventional medicine. Second, mostexisting CAM therapies already exist in practice; that is, patients are usingthese therapies. This means that the cycle must begin at the integration stepso that studies can be carried out to evaluate the therapies already in use.Third, new measures and methods must be developed to adequately reflectpatients' experiences with CAM as well as the outcomes most relevant tocurrent users. For therapies that are not well supported by empirical evi-dence, studies addressing general questions of treatment effectiveness maybe most appropriate. For therapies that are well supported, studies thataddress the underlying mechanisms of action, that identify subgroups ofpatients in whom the treatment works more or less well, or that test modi-fications to a general approach to treatment may be appropriate. Thesesteps are not linear; a therapy may be involved in activities at several stepssimultaneously, and adoption into practice does not terminate the process.Indeed, the evaluation process continues as new information about a therapyis generated. Given these caveats, a more in-depth exploration of the con-ceptual model for translation from idea to practice is provided below. Hypothesis Generation As noted in Figure 7-1, the first step in the translation process is the generation of an idea. All accepted clinical practices were once just a goodidea. The creative insight may have come from a practitioner, a researcher,or even a patient. It may have been derived from an advance in science orfrom recognition of an unmet clinical need. In any case, once a good ideahas become a new treatment, it must be tested. Evaluation Once ideas have been generated, they must pass through several stages of evaluation. First, it is necessary to decide which interventions shouldhave priority for evaluation and which types of research designs are bestINTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 199 for those evaluations. In effect, research committees at drug companies and National Institutes of Health study sections perform this function bydeciding which proposals shall receive funding. The committee suggeststhat the following criteria (also discussed in Chapter 4) be used whenCAM interventions are considered for testing. Clearly, no intervention willmeet all criteria, and a therapy should not be excluded from consideration because it does not meet any one particular criterion, for example, biologi-cal plausibility. A biologically plausible mechanism exists for the intervention, with recognition that the science base on which plausibility is judged is a work inprogress. Research could plausibly lead to the discovery of biological mecha- nisms of disease or treatment effect. The condition is highly prevalent (e.g., diabetes mellitus). The condition causes a heavy burden of suffering. The potential benefit is great. Some evidence already exists that the intervention is effective. Some evidence that there are safety concerns exists. The research design is feasible and likely to yield an unambiguous result. The target condition or the intervention is important enough to have been detected by existing population surveillance mechanisms. Next in the evaluation part of the cycle is the conduct of preliminary studies to establish feasibility. One example of this process is the Phase Iand Phase II trials required by the Food and Drug Administration for newdrugs. These studies evaluate whether the intervention does what it claimsto and characterizes adverse effects. If the intervention meets the challenges imposed by the Phase I and II trials, it becomes a candidate for adoption as a medical practice and movesto the next challenge: clinical trials to test its effects with larger numbers ofpatients. Acceptance Several things happen during the acceptance phase of the translation cycle. Once research results are available, dissemination begins. Research-ers publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals and make presentationsat scientific meetings. This step requires a careful peer-review process andcompetent researchers to evaluate the evidence and recommend the findingsfor publication or presentation. The articles may be published in CAM-related journals (e.g., Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine )200 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE and journals that focus on conventional medicine (e.g., Annals of Internal Medicine and New England Journal of Medicine ). Various professional organizations hold scientific sessions at which the investigators present theresearch results. After much clinical testing, the accumulating body of evidence provides a basis for strong conclusions about efficacy and effectiveness. At thispoint, experts on evidence evaluation perform systematic reviews and meta-analyses to estimate the size of the effect of the intervention. These researchsyntheses form the basis of the next steps. Many syntheses of research onCAM appear, for example, in the Cochrane Collaboration reviews, dis-cussed in Chapter 5. During the acceptance portion of the cycle, professional organizations and clinical practices also create guidelines to best practices. The AmericanCollege of Physicians and Kaiser-Permanente are among the organizationsthat develop guidelines that describe a professional consensus, and these arenearly always based on syntheses of the evidence about best practices. Payers then decide on coverage policy. Coverage policy is important to the adoption of new tests and treatments, although many patients pay outof pocket for CAM services that payers do not cover. Evaluations may beconducted by an internal group or through a contract with an outsideagency. Although the coverage decision is science based (which means thatit draws on the findings presented in published studies), it may also benegotiated by providers and major purchasers. Integration Once an intervention becomes available for general clinical use, it be- comes subject to a process that encourages the adoption of knowledge-based therapies. Factors influencing the adoption of the intervention in-clude use by influential practitioners in the community, ease of use, drugcompany and device manufacturer sales representatives, advertisements inmedical journals, advertisements on television and in other media, presen-tations and booths at professional meetings, and continuing educationevents. A more ill-defined process leads to the discarding of technologiesthat had become established before testing but that fell short of their initialpromise when they were subjected to careful clinical testing. Clinical organizations, often at the behest of payers, develop processes to encourage practitioners to follow best practices. Payers and other organi-zations create incentives for clinical practitioners to follow best practicesand hold them accountable. Once a therapy has been accepted into prac-tice, the cycle does not terminate. As new information is accumulatedthrough practice and additional research, the therapy may be reevaluated. This conceptual model of how new ideas for interventions move intoINTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 201 practice also applies to the integration of CAM and conventional medical therapies, in which many CAM therapies that are new to conventionalmedicine are being accepted by conventional medical practicioners or inte-grated into conventional practices. Osteopathic medicine is an example of adiscipline that developed separately from conventional medicine, movedthrough the stages of translation from idea to practice, and is fully acceptedas an effective treatment modality. Whorton (2002) describes how AndrewTaylor Still, a frontier physician, founded osteopathy. Still 's point of depar- ture for his new system was his view of the body as a machine which shouldfunction well if it were mechanically sound. His system was designed toimprove health by treating the patient as a whole through improving thecirculation and correcting abnormal mechanics. He condemned the preva-lent use of drugs by medical practitioners. In 1892 the first osteopathic school was opened (the American School of Osteopathy), offering training in manipulation as well as classroominstruction in anatomy. Despite resistance by conventional medicine, in1896 Vermont became the first state to license osteopaths. By the 1920sforty states licensed osteopaths to practice, although it was not until 1973that osteopathy was licensed in all states. Some in the osteopathic community argue that osteopathy grew out of a separate tradition, that it has maintained its distinctiveness, and that itshould not be considered congruent with conventional medicine. Thosewho maintain that osteopathy remains a distinct system cite two mainreasons: a holistic approach with a focus on preventive care and the \"use of osteopathic manipulation as part of the overall therapeutic approach \" (Howell, 1999). Others believe that the similarities of osteopathic medicinewith conventional medicine greatly outweigh any differences. \"Overall, osteopathic medical schools have come to resemble allopathic medicalschools in most respects; some students even share classes \" (Howell, 1999). Whether or not osteopathy remains a unique approach to medicine, it has come to be recognized as an effective approach to treatment. The next section explores trends in the integration of CAM and con- ventional medicine. GROWING INTEGRATION OF CAM In 1998, the American Hospital Association began collecting in its annual survey information about hospitals that offer CAM services andfound that only 6 percent of hospitals reported that they offered such CAMservices. By 2001, the number of hospitals offering CAM therapies hadmore than doubled to 15 percent \"indicating a steadily growing interest by hospitals to enter into this arena \" (Ananth, 2002). HMOs are also increas- ingly interested in offering CAM therapies. In 1997, Landmark Healthcare,202 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Inc., commissioned a survey of HMO use of CAM therapies. One hundred fourteen HMOs were surveyed between November 1998 and January 1999,which was 25 percent of all HMOs in existence at the time of the survey.The results showed that two-thirds of HMOs (67 percent) offered at leastone form of alternative care, the most common being chiropractic (65percent) and acupuncture (31 percent) (Landmark Healthcare, Inc., 1999). Cancer treatment centers also frequently use CAM therapies. Three such programs are briefly described here. The Memorial Sloan-KetteringCancer Center has developed an Integrative Medicine Service that offersinpatients music therapy, massage therapies and reflexology, and mind-body therapies. Outpatient services include \"massage, acupuncture, reflex- ology, meditation, self-hypnosis and other mind-body therapies, music andsound therapies, and counseling in nutrition and herb-drug issues, as wellas classes in yoga, tai chi, chair aerobics, the Alexander technique, Pilatesmat, etc. \" (Cassileth, 2002). The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center supports an integrative medicine program that incorporates research, education, and aclinical program. That facility, called \"Place . . . \" opened in 1998. \"Place . . . of wellness offers more than 75 complementary therapy program opportunities, free of charge, to help with the non-medical issuesof living with cancer. It is a bridge between standard medical care andspiritual healing that we call complementary and integrative medicine \" (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 2004). Therapies include mind-bodyapproaches such as guided imagery and progressive relaxation; physicaltherapies such as yoga, tai chi, massage, and acupuncture; and nutritionalsupport. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has established the Zakim Center for Integrated Therapies. The center defines integrated therapies as \"individual treatments that are used in addition to (or as a complement to) traditionalcancer treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation \" (Dana-Farber Can- cer Institute, 2004). Therapies include massage therapy, acupuncture, andnutritional guidance. The center 's website states, \"When patients integrate these therapies into their medical and surgical care, they are creating a morecomprehensive treatment plan and helping their own bodies to regain healthand vitality \" (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 2004). In addition, a nonprofit organization of health professionals, the Soci- ety for Integrative Oncology (SIO), was created in 2003 to provide \"a convenient forum for presentation, discussion, and peer review of evidence-based research and treatment modalities in the discipline known as integra-tive medicine \" in cancer care. (SIO, 2004).INTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 203 Use of CAM by Conventional Practitioners Several efforts have been made to examine the extent to which CAM services are being incorporated into physicians ' practices. Berman and col- leagues (1995) surveyed physicians ' attitudes toward CAM and found a high interest in such services. Furthermore, they found that some therapieswere already being used by the responding physicians. Of the 180 respon-dents, more than 90 percent considered legitimate medical practices toinclude diet and exercise, behavioral medicine, biofeedback, and counselingor psychotherapy. In addition 50 percent believed that acupuncture, mas-sage therapy, and hypnotherapy were legitimate medical practices. Blumberget al. (1995) surveyed primary care internists and board-certified familyphysicians and found that of the 572 respondents, more than half would\"encourage patients who raise the possibility \" of using CAM. Furthermore, 57 percent indicated they would refer their patients for treatment. Gordon and colleagues (1998) surveyed adult primary-care physicians and obstetrics-gynecology physicians and nurse practitioners from a largenorthern California HMO. During the 12 months before the survey, \"90 percent of adult primary care physicians and obstetrics-gynecology clini-cians recommended at least one alternative therapy. \" Table 7-1 provides the percentages by type of therapy. Another survey by Berman and colleagues (1998) found that almost 20 percent of the physicians had used in their practice 9 of the therapies listedin Table 7-2 and that one-third or more were open to using 17 of them.Table 7-2 displays the percentage of physicians who have incorporatedvarious CAM modalities or who would do so. A review of the literature by Astin et al. (1998) found that \"large numbers of physicians are either referring to or practicing some of the moreprominent and well-known forms of CAM and that many physicians be-lieve that these therapies are useful or efficacious. \" Analysis across surveys revealed that the rates of physician referral were 43 percent for acupunc-ture, 40 percent for chiropractic, and 21 percent for massage, with abouthalf of the physicians indicating belief in the efficacies of these therapies.For homeopathy and herbal approaches, 26 and 23 percent of physicians,respectively, believed in the efficaces of these therapies. In recognition of the growing use of CAM therapies by individual conventional medical practitioners, the Federation of State Medical Boardsof the United States developed Model Guidelines for the Use of Comple- mentary and Alternative Therapies in Medical Practice . The guidelines fo- cus on \"encouraging the medical community to adopt consistent standards, ensuring the public health and safety by facilitating the proper and effectiveuse of both conventional and CAM treatments, while educating physicians204 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE TABLE 7-1 Alternative Therapies Being Used or Recommended by Adult Primary-Care and Obstetrics-Gynecology Clinicians for Patient Care Percentage of Adult Percentage of Obstetrics- Primary-Care Clinicians Gynecology Clinicians Alternative Therapy (n = 624) (n = 157) Manipulation therapies 72.9 68.1 Chiropractic 33.6 37.6Osteopathy 5.1 5.7 Acupuncture 57.2 42.7 Acupressure 30.9 30.6Massage therapy 44.6 Body work 7.5 12.1 Ingested therapies a29.5 54.1 Herbal or botanical 8.8 29.3 medicine Homeopathic medicine 2.7 9.5Special diet 18.3 28.0 Megadoses of vitamins, etc. 8.3 21.7 Mind-body therapies 74.8 70.7 Meditation, mindfulness 48.9 45.8 Relaxation techniques 67.6 63.7 Guided imagery, 16.7 22.9 visualization Biofeedback 31.9 22.9 Hypnosis, self-hypnosis 11.5 14.0 Movement therapies 27.7 26.1 Yoga 19.5 22.9 Tai chi, chi gong 17.9 10.2 Supportive therapies 84.9 80.2 Religious healing or prayer 13.6 12.7 12-step program, support 58.0 48.4 group Psychological counseling 78.7 77.1 aMany of the clinicians who indicated that they used or recommended a special diet de- scribed the type only as \"low fat \" or \"low sodium. \" Thus, the prevalence reported for this modality is likely inflated by providers who recommended more conventional diets for pa-tients with heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension. Excluding special diet, the pro- portions of clinicians who reported that they recommended ingested therapies are 16.3 per- cent for adult primary-care physicians and 42.0 percent for obstetrics-gynecology clinicians.

Nurses also use CAM therapies in their practices. Sparber (2001) pre- sented the results of an investigation of State Boards of Nursing (BONs)positions on nurses ' practice of CAM therapies and found that 47 percent205 TABLE 7-2 Percentage of Physicians Who Have Used or Who Would Use CAM Practices, by Specialty (n = 783)Total SampleInternal Family and Practice Have Used Would Use Total Pediatrics Medicine General Practice Diet, exercise 92.3 6.5 98.8 98.9 99.1 21.3 37.5 18.9 38.7 45.9Acupuncture 11.7 48.7 60.4 47.7 68.9 60.7Acupressure 10.1 36.5 46.6 30.1 44.6 56.6Herbal medicine 8.2 34.3 42.5 34.2 43.6 46.1Homeopathic medicine5.9 27.9 33.8 26.3 29.4 41.2 Art therapy 5.0 39.5 44.5 44.6 42.8 44.5Electromagnetic applications3.8 20.6 24.4 18.2 21.9 27.2 Native 29.8 32.6 26.4 33.9 34.9 Traditional Oriental medicine2.4 33.5 35.9 29.4 38.1 37.6 SOURCE: Adapted from Berman et al. (1998).206 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE of the BONs permitted nurses to practice a range of CAM therapies and an additional 13 percent were in the process of discussing whether to allownurses to perform such therapies. The Minnesota Board of Nursing hasdeveloped a statement of accountability with several specific points on theuse of CAM in nursing. The document states, \"[N]urses who employ inte- grative therapies in their nursing practice to meeting nursing and patientgoals developed through the nursing process are held to the same account-ability for reasonable skill and safety as they are with the implementation ofconventional treatment modalities \"(Minnesota Board of Nursing, 2003). The Gillette Nursing Summit, held in May 2002, was convened to \"identify common concerns and a set of core recommendations that would enablenurses to provide leadership in this emerging field \" of integrated health and healing (Kreitzer and Disch, 2003) and resulted in the development ofrecommendations related to integrated health care in the areas of research,education, clinical care, and policy. Tracy et al. (2003) evaluated nurses ' attitudes toward CAM use in critical care and found that nurses are open tothe use of CAM therapies, with many already incorporating CAM therapiesinto their own practices. Kreitzer et al. (2002) questioned medicine, nurs-ing, and pharmacy faculty and students at the University of Minnesota andfound that \"more than half of the medical and nursing faculty either would personally provide or refer a CAM practitioner for acupuncture, bio-feedback, chiropractic, hypnosis or guided imagery, massage, and medi-tation .... Pharmacy faculty were less likely to provide CAM therapies or refer [a patient] to a CAM practitioner, though more than 50 percentwould do so for herbal medicine and nutritional supplements and morethan 40 percent for acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, or prayer or spiri-tual healing. \" Reimbursement for CAM Services Coverage of CAM services is an important issue for the integration of conventional medicine and CAM. In 1999 a study examining insurancecoverage of CAM services was conducted in New York, New Jersey, andConnecticut. \"Virtually all of the insurance carriers in the survey cover chiropractic services in some form, \" almost 40 percent (17 of 43) cover acupuncture, and 37 percent (16 of 43) cover massage therapy (Cleary-Guida et al., 2001). Weeks (1999) found that although the extent of CAMintegration into benefit designs in early 1999 was \"extremely limited, \" most national plans either had a CAM product or a CAM strategy team.The different coverage options identified by Weeks appear in Table 7-3. Weeks (2001) concluded in another article that \"The dominant trend during 1998 to 2000 . . . was a conservative move to offer CAM throughdiscounted, value-added affinity programs. When plans actually cover CAMINTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 207 TABLE 7-3 CAM Coverage Offered by Some Insurance Policies Insurance plans offer different levels or types of coverage for CAM services: Offer CAM, but only subsequent to a state mandate, and therefore without any internal, proactive process Include direct access to numerous CAM services, but only for workers ' compensation claims Have CAM services, but in only one or two of perhaps two dozen distinct insurance or HMO \"products \" that it offers to purchasers Promote a CAM program, but only to its group purchasers and not to individualsAdminister an insurance policy for a self-insured company that has some CAM coverage, but the plan does not offer the coverage Allow conventional medical providers to offer certain CAM therapies but not cover those services when they are provided by members of distinct CAM professions Have an offering for which the purchaser must pay more (rider) and that is outsourced to a CAM network but has little to no internal expertise in CAM Create a program that allows members to access CAM services on a discounted basis but not as a covered benefit Cover a certain provider category, such as chiropractor, for only very limited conditions, such as low back pain SOURCE: Weeks (1999). services, most do so as an added benefit contracted by employers or groups through insurance riders with services provided at an added cost andthrough credentialed networks of practitioners. \" In this context, it is note- worthy that Wolsko et al. (2002) found that the extent of insurance cover-age for CAM providers and the use of CAM therapies for wellness arestrong correlates of the frequent use of CAM providers. Furthermore, about8.9 percent of the U.S. population was responsible for more than 75 percentof the visits to CAM providers. It should be noted that not all CAM practitioners are convinced that insurance coverage is positive for the future practice of complementary andalternative medicine. Cleary-Guida et al. (2001) cautioned that \"the conse- quences of including CAM services in health insurance plans are unknownand require careful consideration. \" One concern is whether the quality of and levels of reimbursement for CAM services will deteriorate once they arecovered by health insurance and subjected to the limitations imposed bycarriers or the restrictions of managed care organizations. Other practi-tioners believe that CAM \"will never fulfill its promise if it cannot be delivered via direct pay insurance \" (Clohesy Consulting, 2003). Between these extremes are those who believe that it is possible to maintain thedesire of integrative medicine for a system of relationship-based care yetalso for CAM services to qualify for insurance reimbursement.208 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE The data presented above indicate that hospitals, managed care organi- zations, and conventional practitioners have incorporated some CAM thera-pies into the provision of health care services. The next section discusseswhat is known about the reasons for integration of CAM and conventionalmedicine. WHY IS INTEGRATION OCCURRING? The reasons why individuals choose to use CAM therapies were ex- plored in Chapter 2. Although few studies have focused on why health careinstitutions and practioners are incorporating CAM therapies, this sectionexamines the available evidence about why institutions and practitioners(both conventional medicine and CAM) are moving toward integrated care. The American Hospital Association survey of hospitals found that 49 percent of respondents indicated that patient demand was the primarymotivation for offering CAM services, whereas another 24 percent statedthat offering these services reflected their organizational mission. Surveyrespondents stated other motivators for offering CAM: clinical effective-ness (45 percent), attracting new patients (41 percent), and differentiationfrom competitors (36 percent). Major obstacles to implementing successfulCAM programs included physician resistance (63 percent), budgetary con-straints (52 percent), lack of internal expertise (39 percent), andcredentialing of providers (33 percent). The survey also found that theprincipal form of payment for hospital-based CAM services is patient self-pay (76 percent) (Ananth, 2002). In the Landmark Healthcare, Inc. (1999) survey of HMOs, the respon- dents indicated that their reasons for offering alternative care were market,employer, or consumer demand (71 percent); the effectiveness of the thera-pies (29 percent); or state mandates or legal requirements (29 percent). Themost important factors that HMOs take into account when they evaluateCAM providers are quality of care, the credentials and qualifications of theproviders, and price competitiveness (Landmark Healthcare, Inc., 1999). As part of a literature review and survey designed to determine which insurers had special policies for CAM coverage and which hospitals wereoffering CAM, Pelletier et al. (1997) determined that \"consumer demand for CAM is motivating more insurers and hospitals to assess the benefits ofincorporating CAM. \" Follow-up studies in 1998 and 1999 produced simi- lar results. Weeks (1999) examined the forces shaping CAM coverage, theextent of coverage offered by insurers and health care plans, and models forinclusion or coverage and found that key motivators for CAM inclusion are\"mission, marketplace, mandates, and medicine. \" Few studies have specifically focused on why physicians are increas- ingly interested in and positive about CAM. Some evidence, indicates, how-INTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 209 ever, that physicians want to know more about CAM to better \"keep up with their patients ' growing interest in and use of CAM \" (Ruggie, 2004). Corbin Winslow and Shapiro (2002) found that 84 percent of physiciansthought that they needed to learn more about CAM. The strongest reasonfor this was so that they could better communicate with their patients aboutthe use of CAM. In addition, physician recommendation of CAM (48 per-cent) was most strongly associated with physician CAM self-use, with phy-sicians who used one or more CAM therapies being seven times more likelyto recommend CAM to their patients. Sikand and Laken (1998) found that sex, ethnicity, practice type, and location of medical training have a significant effect on pediatricians ' atti- tudes toward CAM therapies. Female physicians were found to have morefavorable attitudes toward CAM than male physicians, and white physi-cians where found to have more favorable attitudes than physicians ofcolor. Graduates of U.S. medical schools also had more favorable attitudestoward CAM than their foreign-born or -trained physicians. Blumberg etal. (1995) found that physician involvement in CAM was likely to be higheramong younger or female physicians, physicians practicing in the westernUnited States, and family practitioners than among the internists surveyed. Some hypothesize that conventional medical practitioners are incorpo- rating CAM because of frustrations with the constraints of practice, such asa lack of time necessary for a meaningful patient-practitioner interaction ora loss of autonomy in practice (Snyderman and Weil, 2002). Others suggestthat some practitioners, frustrated with a lack of interventions to reduce theeffects of chronic conditions (reported to be the leading cause of illness,disability, and death [IOM, 2001]), may be turning to CAM therapies thatemphasize prevention and wellness. Few would argue against the notion that health care practitioners de- sire to provide the best care for their patients. Some restrict the definition of\"best care \" to those therapies found in conventional medicine; however, the growing body of evidence demonstrating that some CAM therapies aresafe and effective is likely to be a factor contributing to the increased use ofCAM by both health care practitioners and health care institutions. Suchincorporation is often referred to as integrative medicine . The next section explores the emerging approach to health care frequently called integrative medicine. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Integrative medicine is described as more than just the sum of conven- tional medicine plus CAM. Maizes et al. (2002) defines integrative medi- cine as \"healing-oriented medicine that reemphasizes the relationship be- tween patient and physician, and integrates the best of complementary and210 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE alternative medicine with the best of conventional medicine. \" Berndtson (1998) defines the term somewhat similarly, placing emphasis on use ofevidence. He writes \"integrative medicine refers to a clinical approach that combines the strengths of conventional and alternative medicine with a biastoward options that are considered safe, and which, upon review of theavailable evidence, offer a reasonable expectation of benefit to the patient. \" According to Snyderman and Weil (2002), integrative medicine is a movement, driven by consumers, which is attracting the attention of aca-demic health centers. They write that the focus of integrative medicine is onhealth and healing and agree with Maizes that the patient-physician rela-tionship is key. They further state, \"integrative medicine focuses on preven- tive maintenance of health by paying attention to all relative components oflifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and emotional well-being. It insists on patients being active participants in their health care aswell as on physicians viewing patients as whole persons \u2014minds, commu- nity members, and spiritual beings, as well as physical bodies. Finally, itasks physicians to serve as guides, role models, and mentors, as well asdispensers of therapeutic aids. \" Hess (2002) views integration as a process that involves a spectrum of options. In his view, at one end of the spectrum (strong integration), pa-tients, under the care of a qualified health professional, are allowed toreplace conventional therapies with other options. \"At the 'weak ' end of the integration spectrum, choices are mostly adjuvant to conventional thera-peutic packages. . . . The difference corresponds roughly to the tradeoff inmedical ethics between autonomy and paternalism. \" Integrative medicine may also be a response to the growing recognition of health professionals that many factors contribute to the health of indi-viduals and the public. Why some people are healthy and others are not hasto do \"not only with disease and illness, but also with who we are, where we live and work, and the social and economic policies of our government \" (IOM, 2003b). This statement reflects the evolution in thinking about healthand its determinants that has occurred over the past 50 years. Until aboutthe middle of the twentieth century, health was measured using negativeindicators, e.g., mortality and disease rates. Populations with higher mor-tality rates were considered less healthy than those with lower rates. Suchrates continue to be broad indicators of the health of a society. Efforts to redefine health in the 1950s, however, were spurred by the World Health Organization view of health as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well being, and not merely the absence of disease orinfirmity \" (WHO, 1948). This broadened view of what constitutes health led to a rethinking about the determinants of health and how to measurethose determinants. According to Bausell and Berman, Engel argued thatthe context in which the patient operates must be taken into account, thatINTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 211 is, a biological, sociological, and psychological model of health should be used (Bausell and Berman, 2002). Lalonde (1974) described a frameworkof determinants that included environment, lifestyle, human biology, medi-cal care, and health care organization. Evans and Stoddart (1994) devel-oped a more complex model that distinguished among disease, health,functioning, and well-being, arguing that both behavioral and biologicalresponses to the social and physical environments should be included in theunderstanding of what contributes to health or the lack thereof. A 1999Institute of Medicine (IOM) report described a model of determinants thatshowed how individual characteristics and environmental characteristicsinfluence health-related quality of life. Two recent IOM reports (2003a,b) encourage the use of an ecological model of health, that is, a model of health that emphasizes the linkages andrelationships among multiple factors (or determinants) affecting health (Fig-ure 7-2). \"An ecological model assumes that health and well being are affected by interaction among multiple determinants including biology, behavior, and the environment \" (IOM, 2003b). The report also states that \"an ecological approach to health is one in which multiple strategies are developed to impact determinants of health relevant to the desired healthoutcomes. \" This ecological approach has some similarities to what CAM practitioners refer to as a holistic approach to care. According to Tauber (2002, p.185), holism was first defined in 1926 by Jan Smuts in a publication called Evolution and Holism . As applied to medicine, holism \"refers not only to the relational character of medical description and therapy but to the scope of the medical gaze. \" Ruggie (2004) reports that in the 1970s the word holistic referred to health care practices based on the interconnectedness of mind and body. Bausell andBerman (2002), reporting on a study by Barrett et al. (2000), describeholism as representing \"a belief in the importance of basing treatment upon people as whole individuals, of taking a multidimensional view of illness,and of trying to get to the heart of the problem rather than simply treatingsymptoms. \" The key point in all these definitions is similar to the idea of the ecologi- cal approach, that is, multiple factors influence the health of an individual,and health care practitioners should consider each of these factors in at-tempting to understand and improve health. As discussed earlier in this chapter, the level of integration of conven- tional and CAM therapies is growing. That growth generates the need fortools or frameworks to make decisions about which therapies should beprovided or recommended, about which CAM providers to whom conven-tional medical providers might refer patients, and the organizational struc-ture to be used for the delivery of integrated care. The committee believesthat the overarching rubric that should be used to guide the development of212 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Living and working conditions may include: Psychosocial factors Employment status and occupational factors Socioeconomic status (income, education,occupation) The natural and builtc environments Public health services Health care services Over the life spana b FIGURE 7-2 A guide to thinking about the determinants of population health. NOTE: The dotted lines between the different levels of the model denote interac- tion effects between and among the various levels of health determinants (Worth-man, 1999). aSocial conditions include, but are not limited to, economic inequality, urbanization, mobility, cultural values, attitudes, and policies related to discrimina- tion and intolerance on the basis or race, gender, and other differences. bOther conditions at the national level might include major sociopolitical shifts, such as recession, war, and governmental collapse. cThe built environment includes trans- portation, water and sanitation, housing, and other dimensions of urban planning. SOURCE: The Future of the Public's Health (IOM, 2003a). these tools should be the goal of providing comprehensive care that is safe and effective, that is collaborative and interdisciplinary, and that respectsand joins effective interventions from all sources. Chapters 3, 4, and 5addressed issues of efficacy and effectiveness and provided a framework fordecision making that states that the same principles of evidence and stan-dards of treatment effectiveness should apply to all treatments, whetherINTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 213 they are currently labeled as conventional medicine or CAM. The next section presents a conceptual model for deciding when to translate newtherapies (CAM or conventional medicine) into practice. ADVISING PATIENTS The committee believes that any framework for decision making should encourage patients and practitioners to engage in shared decision makingabout treatment. One of the 10 rules outlined in the IOM report Crossing the Quality Chasm (2001) is that the patient should be viewed as the source of control. The report states, \"Patients should be given the necessary infor- mation and the opportunity to exercise the degree of control they chooseover health care decisions that affect them. The health system should beable to accommodate differences in patient preferences and encourageshared decision making. \" Such statements can be applied to the desire for shared decision making about CAM therapies as well as those of conven-tional medicine. Eisenberg (1997) recommends a nine-step strategy for advising patients: 1. Ask the patient to identify the principal symptom. 2. Suggest that the patient keep a symptom diary.3. Discuss the patient 's preferences and expectations. 4. Review issues of safety and efficacy.5. Identify a suitable licensed provider.6. Provide the patient with key questions to ask the provider during the initial consultation. 7. Schedule a follow-up visit (or telephone call) to review the treatment plan. 8. Follow up to review the response to treatment.9. Provide documentation. The fourth step of the process proposed by Eisenberg is a review of the safety and efficacy of the treatment under discussion. At this step Cohenand Eisenberg (2002) propose that practitioners may wish to guide theirrecommendations for treatment for both conventional and CAM therapiesby evaluating whether the medical evidence: supports both safety and efficacy (option A); supports safety, but evidence regarding efficacy is inconclusive (option B); supports efficacy, but evidence regarding safety is inconclusive (option C); or indicates either serious risk or inefficacy (option D).214 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Thus, within the framework suggested in Chapter 6 of this report, if the medical evidence supports both safety and efficacy (option A), liability isunlikely and clinicians should recommend the therapy; if the medical evi-dence indicates either serious risk or inefficacy (option D), liability is prob-able and clinicians should avoid and actively discourage the patient fromusing the therapy. If the medical evidence supports safety, but evidenceregarding efficacy is inconclusive (option B), or if the medical evidencesupports efficacy but evidence regarding safety is inconclusive (option C),then clinicians should caution the patient. If the patient chooses to try thetherapy despite the cautionary advice the practitioner should continue tomonitor both the efficacy and the safety of the therapy. Figure 7-3 portraysthe options graphically. If patients demand and expect to use therapies for which sufficient evidence to justify the practitioner 's recommendation is lacking, then, de- pending on the medical evidence, the practitioner should caution the pa-tient and monitor efficacy (option B), caution the patient and monitorsafety (option C), or encourage the patient to avoid the therapy (option D).In general, if patients choose to make their own decisions, against theirconventional practitioner 's advice, the practitioner should document this in the patient 's medical record. From a liability perspective, the more acute and severe the condition is or the more curable the condition is by conven-tional medical therapies, the more important it is to monitor and the therapeutic posture. SOURCE: Adapted from Cohen and Eisenberg (2002).INTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 215 sary, treat the patient by conventional medical practices (Adams et al., 2002; Cohen and Eisenberg, 2002). The information presented above provides a framework for clinicians. The guidelines developed by the Federation of State Medical Boards alsooffer information for clinicians to consider (see Appendix E). Conventionalmedical practitioners should also take into account ethical considerations,as discussed in Chapter 6 when they are advising patients whether to pursueCAM therapies. Because research regarding both conventional and CAM therapies is ongoing and the medical evidence can change rapidly, the clinician shouldcommunicate regularly with the patient regarding any new developments.If, for example, it turns out that high-dose antioxidants negatively interactwith chemotherapy, then this information may change the decision to con-tinue the use of high-dose antioxidants during chemotherapy or may changereliance on them as part of a CAM regimen for a period instead of chemo-therapy (Cohen and Rosenthal, in press). If a decision is made to include a therapy provided by another practitio- ner, the focus of decision making then shifts to identifying practitionerswith acceptable expertise. When a patient is referred to a CAM provider, itis important for the conventional medical practitioners to inquire about theprovider 's training, practice experience, scope of practice, and history of malpractice litigation or professional discipline. Health care institutions arealso faced with challenges as they move to consider providing both CAMand conventional medical care. The next section explores issues related tothe provision of CAM therapies in health care institutions. HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS Health care institutions face a number of potential operational barriers to the provision of integrative medicine, including issues of financialsustainability and the development of appropriate clinical models for theprovision of medical care by teams comprising various conventional medi-cal and CAM providers. Kreitzer (2001) explored a process for strategicplanning and decision making about the inclusion of CAM in existinghealth care settings. Steps in the planning process include 1. defining who is responsible for gathering information, generating recommendations, and making decisions; 2. identifying and clarifying mandates, both formal (e.g., charters, articles of incorporation and legislation) and informal (tradition orexpectations); 3. clarifying the mission and values of the health care system;216 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 4. assessing the external environment for opportunities and challenges (i.e., political climate, economic and social trends, and potential client popu-lation); and 5. assessing the internal environment (e.g., people resources and their skills, provider perceptions, and level of interest). The outcomes from these five steps provide the information necessary for the development of a strategic plan that addresses such issues as whetherCAM will be implemented in a systemwide effort or incrementally andwhether CAM services will be organized around a core or a center withinthe system or dispersed throughout the system. Once strategies are devel-oped, all actions and decisions necessary to implement the strategies can beidentified (Kreitzer, 2001). In developing approaches that include both CAM and conventional medical therapies, health care institutions may take advantage of existinghealth care institution policies and guidelines to address liability concerns,implement risk management practices, and otherwise find ways to appro-priately include CAM therapies and providers in existing systems of care.For example, a major area of focus involves credentialing of CAM provid-ers. Such credentialing has parallels to existing hospital mechanisms forcredentialing and offering clinical privileges to conventional medical pro-viders; yet credentialing of CAM providers must also incorporate informa-tion regarding the standards of education and training, competence, andscopes of practice required by licensing laws in a given state and establishedby various CAM professional organizations (Eisenberg et al., 2002). Ina(2001) provides guidance for the institutional credentialing process, recom-mending that source documents should include a comprehensive provider application and contract; professional license or certification requirements; records indicating satisfactory completion of specialty training; required professional insurance standards; required years of experience; peer review of the practitioner 's application and all related documents; practitioner capabilities for data reporting and profiling; and a thorough on-site review of provider offices, records, and operations. The process of credentialing can be undertaken by the institution itself or through contract with an outside consultant or vendor. According to Ina(2001), 50 percent of organizations surveyed in the report of LandmarkINTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 217 Healthcare, Inc. (1999) contracted with an outside vendor to credential CAM practitioners. The development of appropriate clinical models to implement care that includes both CAM and conventional medical therapies is an additionalchallenge for this emerging field of integrative medicine. The next sectionexplores various approaches. APPROACHES TO INTEGRATION There are several approaches to the integration of CAM and conven- tional medicine. As Rolfe and Hohenstein (2001) state, \"In arrangements with less integration, practitioners are in business for themselves, and merelylease space in an integrative medical center \" but have little interaction with one another. In another model, hospitals might hire alternative practitio-ners as staff to deliver specific services for which the hospital collects dollar-for-dollar revenue on the basis of services delivered (Sol and Faass, 2001).Models with high levels of integration include those that use amultidisciplinary team approach to care. Some models have physician over-sight of all practitioners, whereas others use a more collaborative approachor team structure that may have a physician as the director for the center. Donald Novey, in his presentation to the IOM committee at its meeting in September 2003, discussed four existing program models: the consultantmodel, the primary-care model, the fitness center model, and the virtualcenter model. The c onsultant model , which is also known as the specialty model, is one in which patients are referred to CAM providers for particu-lar therapies. This model is noncompetitive; physicians feel confident refer-ring patients to the CAM consultants because patients will return to thephysician for their primary care. However, revenue is dependent on theprovision of CAM services, and therefore, a high volume of CAM servicesmust be maintained. The primary-care model is a blend of conventional primary medical care (usually internal medicine or family practice) with nontraditional(CAM) medical care housed in the same setting. The advantage of thismodel is that revenues are generated from both the CAM practice and theprimary-care medical practice. However, because it is not clear whether thepractice is mainstream or alternative, difficulties may arise with referrals.There is also competition with other primary-care practices. The fitness center model is one in which integrative medicine services are located within a fitness center. Such a system has high visibility and attracts a populationthat focuses on wellness. It is also a system that can be used to promote themerchandising of particular items, if desired. The virtual model offers ser- vices in various sectors of a facility or health care system that are coordi-nated by a director of CAM services.218 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE In 1998, The Integrator 's Clinic Benchmarks Study surveyed 29 clinics offering integrative medical care. That study identified four distinct catego-ries of clinic models for integrative medicine. In the complementary health services model, services are usually limited to education, massage, body work, and some energy therapies, such as therapeutic touch. The CAM- centric services model provides the services of licensed CAM providers, such as acupuncturists and chiropractors, and has a limited involvement ofmedical doctors. In the integrative, CAM-centric service delivery model the leader is usually a medical doctor or a doctor of osteopathy (DO) who notonly acts as the team leader for those providing services but also providesreassurance to the physicians who practice more conventional medicine.Most services are provided by nonmedical, non-DO practitioners. Themodel in which most care is provided by integrative medical physicianswho have skills in one or more CAM modalities is the integrative medical doctor/DO-centric service delivery model. The following are general find- ings that held true across all models: To break even, large clinics (those with more than 6,000 square feet of clinic space) need a core of integrative medical doctor and DO providers. Chiropractors are a significant patient draw. Thorough integration requires the involvement of a medical doctor or DO champion. Ongoing subsidies are needed if only CAM services are offered. A report prepared for the Philanthropic Collaborative for Integrative Medicine (Clohesy Consulting, 2003) found that the most important cata-lysts for establishing a program integrating CAM and conventional carewere a leadership-level champion, faculty members or practitioners who are committed to the program and who have had positive personal experiences with CAM, a visionary philanthropist or other source of capital, and consumer demand. The Clohesy Consulting (2003) report described five models for inte- grative medicine clinics. In the first model multiple practitioners are inte-grated into a staff team. Services are provided under one roof, and the teamcollaborates in the planning and provision of care. A major challenge ispaying for staff time spent in collaborative meetings and conferences. Fur-thermore, patient costs are high because of the high cost of the practitioner-patient interface, the expense of integrated medical records needed, andtechnology may be too high for start-up efforts.INTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 219 A second model, which is similar to conventional medicine, includes a patient care team, as discussed above for the first model described byClohesy Consulting, but it also adds a network of providers from thecommunity to collaborate on patient care. Quality control may be moredifficult because not all patient care services are provided by the patientcare team. It is sometimes difficult to maintain the outside network ofcredentialed practitioners; turf issues may affect overall care; and the needfor shared technology and record keeping may be problematic. The third model discussed in the report by Clohesy Consulting is one in which the patient is the integrator of care, which is provided through acenter or a community network. Although this model reduces the collabo-rative costs among practitioners, there is a loss of continuity of care. Fur-thermore, the patient may not be well enough informed to make appropri-ate decisions about his or her care and may become frustrated withattempting to coordinate his or her health care services. In the concierge or advocate model, the fourth model, one designated person integrates care for both the patient and practitioners. This is lesscostly than team coordination but the patient may feel limited by using thenetwork of the selected advocate, and there are currently no standards forhow the role of the advocate should be performed. The final model is the patient oriented delivery system (PODS) model. In this model, patients meet together with one practitioner in a groupsetting. Although patients learn from one another by this approach and thecost of educational or consultative care is reduced, the model works best forthose problems that benefit from a group process rather than problems thatrequire one-on-one treatment. Most integrative medical centers are structured for self-pay and all face sustainability challenges (Clohesy Consulting, 2003). For example, becausemost are small, they do not generate sufficient revenue to hire more practi-tioners. However, to attract more patients and, therefore, have higher in-comes, they first need to hire more practitioners. Another problem relatesto reimbursement for services. For centers that do accept direct insurancepayment, because insurers do not reimburse for the full costs of integrativemedicine consultations and therapies, the more patients these centers see,the more money they lose. Centers that bring in research grants are able to use the overhead from these grants to balance income and expenditures. For many centers inacademic settings, however, the overhead income must be given to theuniversity, which returns a smaller portion of the collected dollars to thecenter, thereby making it more difficult for the center to make up budgetdeficits. Potential solutions to the financial difficulties of integrative medi-cal centers have been identified:220 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE philanthropy, devising products or services to earn income1 (e.g., charging for community education, and creating a retail operation to sell related prod-ucts such as an herbal pharmacy), and cost-containment strategies (e.g., minimizing full-time staff and us- ing consultants, hiring CAM practitioners with an existing clientele, so thattheir work is profitable as quickly as possible, and conceptualizing thecenter as a \"mall, \" with each practitioner renting space as an individual businessperson). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Health care that integrates CAM therapies with conventional medicine has been termed \"integrative medicine \" by many (Berndtson, 1998; Hess, 2002; Maizes et al., 2002; Snyderman and Weil, 2002). The committeebelieves that whatever term is used, the goal should be the provision ofcomprehensive care that is safe and effective, care that is collaborative andinterdisciplinary, and care that respects and joins effective interventionsfrom all sources. Furthermore, the committee believes that this comprehen-sive approach should be based on the 10 rules outlined in the IOM reportCrossing the Quality Chasm (2001): 1. Care based on continuous healing relationships 2. Customization based on patient needs and values3. Patient as the source of control4. Shared knowledge and the free flow of information5. Evidence-based decision making6. Safety as a system property7. Need for transparency8. Anticipation of needs9. Continuous decrease in waste 10. Cooperation among clinicians A comprehensive system uses the best scientific evidence available re- garding benefits and harm, recognizes the importance of compassion andcaring, encourages patients to share in decision making about therapeuticoptions, and promotes choices in care that can include CAM therapieswhere appropriate. Such comprehensive care is evidence based and requiresthat decisions be made on the basis of the results of scientific inquiry (seeChapter 3 for a discussion of the use of evidence in decision making). 1Some activities may be in conflict with legal, ethical, and professional guidelines.INTEGRATION OF CAM AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE 221 Scientific inquiry into little understood or unproven ideas, no matter what the source of the ideas, can lead to new information that in turn canlead to improvements in health care for the public. The committee believesthat a therapy should be chosen on the basis of what is known about itssafety and effectiveness, not on whether it is a conventional therapy orCAM. There is more to be gained by abandoning decision making on thebasis of the source of ideas and instead, embracing the idea of knowledge-based therapies. When the effectiveness of CAM and conventional medical treatments is studied, it is unlikely that the results will show that all treatments in onemodality are effective and that all treatments in the other are ineffective. Itis more likely that the treatments offered by both major modalities will beshown to be effective. Studies currently show that patients frequently usemore than one modality of medical care (as opposed to choosing one overthe other), and that pattern will probably continue and may even expand asevidence of treatment effectiveness accumulates. Therefore, it will be im-portant to understand how CAM and conventional medical treatments(and providers) interact with each other and to study models of how CAMand conventional medical treatments can be provided in integrated andcoordinated ways. Unfortunately, little information is available about the outcomes and the effectiveness of various models of integration. What are patient out-comes? How do these outcomes compare with those for patients with simi-lar conditions treated in conventional medical care facilities? What are thecosts of such treatments, and how do the costs compare with those ofconventional approaches to the provision of medical care? These and manyother questions must be answered to provide practitioners (of both conven-tional medicine and CAM) and policy makers with the information neces-sary to make decisions about the future of integrative medical practice.There is an urgent need for health systems research efforts that focus onidentifying the elements of various models of integrative medicine, the out-comes of care delivered through these models, and whether these modelsare cost-effective compared with the cost of care obtained in conventionalmedical practice settings. Therefore, the committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other public and private agencies sponsor research to compare the outcomes and costs of combinations of CAM and conventional medical treatments and models that deliver such care models of care delivery involving CAM practitioners alone, both CAM and conventional medical practitioners, and conventional medicalpractitioners alone. Outcome measures should include reproducibility,safety, cost-effectiveness, and research capacity.222 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE The committee believes that research aimed at answering questions about outcomes of care are crucial to ensuring that health care profession-als are providing evidence-based comprehensive care that encourages afocus on healing, recognizes the importance of compassion and caring,emphasizes the centrality of relationship-based care, encourages patients toshare in decision making about therapeutic options, and promotes choicesin care that can include CAM therapies where appropriate. To address health problems in both the population and the individual in the United States, the committee believes that it is important that privateand public purchasers, other governmental entities, health care organiza-tions, clinicians, and patients work together to implement a comprehensiveframework for care. This framework should include both conventionalmedical and CAM approaches to health promotion, disease prevention,and the treatment of illness that have been shown to be safe and effective.To the extent that evidence indicates that models of health care that inte-grate CAM and conventional therapies (e.g., integrative medicine clinics)offer patients benefits, more research on these benefits would be useful.Therefore, the committee recommends that the Secretary of the U.S. De- partment of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the U.S.Department of Veterans Affairs support research on integrated medicalcare delivery, as well as the development of a research infrastructure withinsuch organizations and clinical training programs to expand the number ofproviders able to work in integrated care. The committee does not expect that the level of scientific certainty about the effectiveness of delivery models that will be achieved will be thesame as that achieved for treatments. This is because, as those involved inhealth systems research are well aware, many local variations and circum-stances affect the effectiveness of the delivery models. The next chapter discusses educational programs and the educational needs of both conventional medicine and CAM practitioners. REFERENCES Adams KE, Cohen MH, Eisenberg D, Jonsen AR. 2002.

Pp. 47 -104.2268 Educational Programs in CAM CAM IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION Along with the growth in the integration of CAM and conventional medicine in health care institutions and individual practices, the number ofhealth professional education programs that are teaching CAM is alsogrowing. Park (2002) writes, \"The exploration of complementary and al-ternative medicine topics in the medical school curriculum helps to eluci-date the complex and uncertain nature of medical practice, sharpens skillsfor clinical decision-making, increases cultural sensitivity, and provides ideasfor future research.\" In 1995 the Alternative Medicine Interest Group of the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine surveyed U.S. medical school departments offamily medicine and all family medicine residency programs to determinethe extent to which CAM was being taught in medical schools. The resultsshowed that in 1995 CAM was taught in 34 percent of U.S. medical schoolsand 28 percent of family practice residency programs. The number of medi-cal schools offering courses on CAM-related topics rose from 45 of 125schools in the 1996-1997 academic year to 75 schools in 1998 (Wetzel etal., 2003) and 98 medical schools in the 2002-2003 academic year(Barzansky and Etzel, 2003). To gather information about the specific topics being taught and the objectives behind the instruction, Brokaw et al. (2002) surveyed 123 CAMcourse directors at 74 U.S. medical schools. They found that the mosttypical course was an elective and that most of the courses (78.1 percent)EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 227 were taught by CAM practitioners or by those who prescribe CAM therapies. Burman (2003), in a survey of family nurse practitioner program direc- tors, found that 98.5 percent of the 141 respondents reported that theirprograms included CAM-related content and that most of these (80.3 per-cent) integrated the CAM content into existing courses. A survey of 627medical school, school of nursing, and college of pharmacy faculty andstudents at the University of Minnesota found that 88 percent of the facultyrespondents and 84 percent of the students believed that CAM should beincluded in their schools ' curricula (Kreitzer et al., 2002). Biofeedback, massage, and meditation were the therapies most likely to be used by thefaculty from all schools. A study of schools of pharmacy conducted by Dutta et al. (2003) found that 73 percent (46 out of 64 respondents) of schools were offering instruc-tion in CAM, although courses on CAM were not yet mandated by theschools. The most frequently taught content area was herbals (45 schools).Table 8-1 shows the number of schools teaching various modalities. TheNational Association of Boards of Pharmacy, in a memorandum to allpharmacy school deans, stated that herbal products and nutraceuticalswould be included in the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examina-tion (NAPLEX).

(2003).228 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE These data indicate that much CAM-related education is being taught in the schools of the conventional health professions; however, the specificsof that training and a good understanding of the total extent of the trainingin CAM remain unknown. Why Teach CAM? At present, integrative medicine is largely market-driven and spans the spectrum from evidence-based practices that benefit patients and carrylittle risk to outright quackery, sometimes with significant risk. Without involvement on the part of our profession, we leave patients uninformed and without medical guidance. (Gaudet and Snyderman, 2002) The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality (IOM, 2003) proposed the following vision for health professional education: \"All health professionals should be educated to deliver patient-centered care as members of an interdisciplinary team, em-phasizing evidence-based practice, quality improvement approaches andinformatics. \" To meet the challenges facing health professional education, the IOM report (2003) proposed a set of core competencies that all health cliniciansshould possess. The first of these is the ability to provide patient-centeredcare. To provide patient-centered care, the report states, health profession-als must share power and responsibility with caregivers; communicate withpatients in a shared and fully open manner; take into account patients ' individuality, emotional needs, values, and life issues; implement strategiesfor reaching those who do not present for care on their own, includinghealth care strategies that support the broader community; and enhanceprevention and health promotion. Although that IOM report was referringto conventional medicine, the same competencies apply to CAM. Given that CAM is widely used by the U.S. population, health care professionals need to be informed about CAM and knowledgeable enoughto discuss the CAM therapies that the patient is using or thinking of usingto more effectively communicate with their patients. Consistent with thisview, a report of the American Association of Medical Colleges emphasizedthe importance of physicians being \"sufficiently knowledgeable about both traditional and non-traditional modes of care to provide intelligent guid-ance to their patients \" (AAMC, 1998). Gaudet (1998) maintains that to achieve the best medicine possible, physicians need to know both the CAMpractices that have the potential to harm or be ineffective and knowledge ofwhich CAM practices that, \"when critically and intelligently integrated into health care, could be of benefit to patients. \" An article by Marcus (2001), in which the author took issue with someEDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 229 of the criticisms of conventional medical education (e.g., that physicians ignore mind-body interactions and disease prevention), concludes that medi-cal students should receive evidence-based education about CAM, stating, Without additional education about alternative medicine, physicians can- not obtain accurate information from patients about their use of alterna-tive modalities, or provide information and guidance. . . . physicians must assist patients in making informed choices about health care, and they should be receptive to discussing alternative medicine with patients whorequest information. Physicians should be especially sensitive to the needs of patients with intractable medical conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, and degenerative neurologic diseases, who seek relief and hope inalternative therapies. As mentioned above, the IOM report on health professions education (IOM, 2003) described taking \"into account patients ' individuality, emo- tional needs, values, and life issues \" as one aspect of patient-centered care. To meet this goal, both conventional health care professionals and CAMpractitioners need to learn about the CAM therapies that are in use amongthe many cultures and ethnic groups that make up the U.S. population.Konefal (2002) writes that \"understanding the cultural and political as well as the medical relevance of CAM modalities will allow the physician torespond more appropriately to his or her individual patients. \" Although much of the preceding discussion relates to physicians, it can be appliedequally to several health professions, including nursing, pharmacy, anddentistry. Disch and Kreitzer (2003) suggest that because CAM is used promi- nently in health care, \"education of nursing staff about the therapies and their indications for use is essential. \" Park (2002) presents four additional arguments for teaching CAM in conventional health professions education: 1. Medical schools are defining the mission of health care in progres- sively broader terms that are conceptually similar to those embraced by theintegrative medicine movement. (See Chapter 7 for a discussion of an eco-logical approach to health.) 2. Clinical decision making requires the ability to deal with uncer- tainty, and the same skills are needed to assess all therapies whether theyare identified as conventional medicine or CAM. 3. There is growing societal interest in diversity, and training in CAM increases cultural competence. 4. As the boundaries of the medical sciences grow and more knowledge is accrued, the exploration of therapies currently identified as CAM willhelp direct productive biomedical, psychological, and sociomedical researchagendas.230 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Few today would argue against the fact that health professionals must be knowledgeable about CAM in order to best serve the interests of theirpatients. The difficulty comes in attempting to decide what should be taughtand how to fit such teachings into already crowded health professionaleducational curricula. The next section explores ideas about what shouldbe taught about CAM to conventional medical practitioners. Deciding What to Teach The incorporation of CAM training into the curriculum of health pro- fessional education is not consistent, nor do guidelines exist on what con-tent might be appropriate in such education. Grollman (2001) asserts thateducation about CAM should be evidence based and should not includeteaching of unproven therapies. Even though evidence of effectiveness ex-ists for some CAM therapies (see Chapter 5), most CAM therapies haveonly fairly recently been subjected to Western methods of scientific inquiry.As discussed elsewhere in this report, however, it is also the case that theeffectiveness of many conventional medical therapies taught in medicalschool have also not been validated through randomized controlled trials(RCTs). Ezzo et al. (2001) found that only 40 percent of conventionalmedicine that had been tested by RCTs had positive or possibly positiveeffects. Chapter 3 discusses the kinds of evidence that various decision makers use to make decisions. Researchers, for example, rely most heavily onstudies with strong research designs, plausible biological mechanisms, theconsistency of findings from study to study, and dose-response relation-ships. Although individuals who train new conventional practitioners re-quire evidence of treatment effectiveness to decide how to train students,they also draw heavily on their own experience in deciding which treat-ments are effective and which ones are not. This is consistent with therecommendations in the IOM report on health professions education (IOM,2003). That report took the position that education should \"integrate best research with clinical expertise and patient values for optimum care, andparticipate in learning and research activities to the extent feasible. \" There- fore, if the decision about what to teach is not based solely on the results ofRCTs, on what other basis might one decide what should be taught aboutCAM? The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (2002) recommended, \"The education and training of CAM and conventional practitioners should be designed to ensure publicsafety, improve health, and increase the availability of qualified and knowl-edgeable CAM and conventional practitioners and enhance the collabora-tion among them. \"EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 231 Berman (2001) writes that \"great heterogeneity exists in the content, format, and requirements of complementary and alternative therapy coursesfor medical students and physicians in training \" and recommends that a consensus be developed about the essentials of a core curriculum. Ezzo etal. (2002) discussed their concerns about the lack of an evidence-basedperspective in courses taught about CAM and suggested that The Cochrane Library would be an excellent tool for addressing this concern. Wetzel et al. (1998) made a number of suggestions for how CAM should be taught inhealth professional schools. These include the need to 1. focus on critical thinking and critical reading of the literature; 2. identify thematic content and express the chosen topics in clear, concise learning objectives; 3. include an experiential component;4. promote a willingness to communicate professionally with CAM clinicians; and 5. teach students to talk with patients about alternative therapies. Konefal (2002) writes that education in CAM should include the rea- sons why patients use CAM, issues of efficacy, the limits of science-basedapproaches, legal and ethical considerations, and the role of spirituality inhealth and healing. Frenkel and Arye (2001) suggest that a CAM curricu-lum should include sufficient information about CAM therapies to preparephysicians to \"help patients understand the overwhelming amount of infor- mation (and misinformation) about CAM. . . . \" Brokaw et al. (2002) suggest that teaching of CAM should 1. emphasize a critical evaluation of the scientific literature, 2. enlist the involvement of basic science departments, and3. avoid advocacy of unproven therapies. Kligler and colleagues (2000) reported on a set of guidelines for the inclusion of CAM in family practice residencies developed by the Society ofTeachers of Family Medicine Group on Alternative Medicine. The guide-lines include understanding and respect for different health beliefs andchoices, the underlying theory of different CAM modalities indications andpotential adverse effects of these treatments, and evidence of the efficacyand the cost-effectiveness of the therapies. The Education Working Group of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine has developed a set of curriculum guide-lines in integrative medicine for use by medical schools. The guidelinesdelineate competencies in knowledge, attitudes, skills, and values232 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE in keeping with the recent trend in all of medical education to reaffirm and re-emphasize the humanistic values at the core of medicine \u2014training in integrative medicine should incorporate philosophical perspectives inaddition to knowledge base and therapeutic skill in order to clearly under- score the relevance of human experience and interactions in health and medicine. (Kligler et al., 2004) The authors of the consortium guidelines emphasize that each school must develop its own specific content of courses needed to achieve compe-tency in these areas, and they urge the development of innovative educa-tional approaches that go beyond the teaching of scientific facts. Theseapproaches include experiential approaches to facilitate an understanding of CAM, education of medical students in self-care and reflection, and faculty development programs to produce educators who both have knowledge and skills in integrative medicine and recognize the importanceof self-care and reflection in medical education and practice. There is also no firm agreement about how CAM-related education should be included in nursing schools. Barbato Gaydos (2001) recommendsthat any plan to include CAM in curricula \"should begin with identification of the educational purposes for that inclusion. \" Cuellar et al. (2003) believe that the objectives for an educational program for nurses and other healthcare providers should include improvements in assessment skills so thatthey are able to identify CAM use in patients; legal and ethical consider-ations; and an examination of personal biases and beliefs about CAM.Parkman (2002) recommends that the goals of training registered nursesshould include assessment of the use of CAM, including risk factors associated with misuse; identification of patient and family understanding of the therapies that a patient is using or planning to use; identification of patient and family teaching needs related to CAM therapies; and documentation of achievement of the goals listed above. Reed and colleagues (2000) assert that prelicensure students must learn about the concepts behind CAM therapies as well as develop the ability toelicit and evaluate patients ' use of these therapies. Richardson (2001) believes that a major challenge in designing educational programs willbe to develop practitioners who are both well prepared and confident inEDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 233 their own practices but also open to other perspectives and therapeutic approaches. In exploring what to teach about CAM in conventional medical educa- tion, the committee is sensitive to the concern expressed by some CAMpractitoners that education about CAM should include respect for the lengthand rigor of training required for CAM professions. The committee is notsuggesting that knowledge about CAM provided in the context of conven-tional medical education is the equivalent of education necessary to becomea licensed CAM professional. An individual who takes one course duringconventional training about massage, for example, does not have the exper-tise of a licensed massage therapist. As can be seen from the preceding discussion, there is no consensus on what should be taught about CAM to conventional medical practitioners.Common elements appear to include critical thinking and assessment, withthe inclusion of an experiential component. The following section discussesapproaches to education on CAM taken by different conventional healthprofessions schools. Approaches to Curriculum Development Health professional schools have taken a variety of approaches to pro- viding education about CAM therapies. Milan et al. (1998) described ageneral internal medicine residency program that was implemented at RhodeIsland Hospital and Brown University School of Medicine. The programincludes didactic sessions in acupuncture, chiropractic, and massage therapyand an elective clinical experience. The overall popularity and use of themodality, as well as access to interested and qualified practitioners, werethe most important factors in determining which CAM therapies were in-cluded. The criteria used to select the CAM practitioners who participatedin the program included \"the degree of experience and licensure in their particular field, communication style, clinical practice arrangements (bothin terms of practice layout and patient population), and openness to tradi-tional medical practices. \" The University of Arizona has developed the Program in Integrative Medicine which includes an associate fellowship program, required coursesand electives in the College of Medicine, a continuing education program,and a research program. Breda and Schulze (1998) describe a capstonecourse for registered nurses in which students select a CAM therapy, expe-rience it, provide a report that includes its physiological and scientific bases,and discuss how it might be incorporated into nursing practice. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded 15 CAMeducation projects at U.S. medical and nursing schools (Table 8-2). The aim234 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE of these projects is to design new educational approaches to the incorpora- tion of information about CAM into the curricula of medical, dental, nurs-ing, and allied health professional schools as well as in residency trainingprograms and continuing education courses. The program developed by the University of Minnesota involves cur- riculum development projects in the medical and nursing schools as well asthe College of Pharmacy. One of the first efforts in all three health profes-TABLE 8-2 CAM Curriculum Development Projects Funded by NCCAM Project Title Institution Educational Initiative in CAM Georgetown University Integrative Medicine Curriculum for University of California at San Francisco Health Professionals American Medical Student Association American Medical Student Association CAM Education Initiative Foundation Center for Pediatric Integrative Children 's Hospital in Boston Medical Education Integrating CAM into Health University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Professions Education CAM Curriculum Project University of Minnesota, Twin CitiesCAM Education Program for Nursing Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke 's Medical Center, Chicago Evidence-Based Curriculum in University of Texas Medical Branch, Alternative Therapies Galveston Integrating CAM into a Family Medicine Maine Medical Center, Portland Residency Program Interdisciplinary CAM Curriculum Model University of Kentucky, LexingtonThe Tufts Program in Tufts University Evidence-Based CAM Integrative Curriculum for Medicine University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Allied Health CAM Curriculum at the University University of Washington, Seattle of Washington Oregon CAM Course Oregon Health and Science University, Portland Integrating CAM: Nursing Emphasis University of Washington, Seattle SOURCE: NCCAM (2004).EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 235 sional schools was to develop core competencies. Additionally, faculty and students were surveyed for their attitudes about CAM. Several changeswere made in the medical school curriculum, including the addition ofseven 2-hour sessions in one course related to designing integrated systemsof care, traditional chinese medicine, manual therapies, and spirituality.Another course includes information on interviewing and assessing CAMtherapies; a pharmacology course includes information on botanical thera-pies; self-care is included in a required surgery clerkship; and the 3-weekclinical elective in integrative medicine was expanded. The curriculum designed for the School of Nursing of the University of Minnesota addresses both undergraduate and graduate education. A broadspectrum of information about CAM has been systematically integratedinto many courses, and there has been an emphasis on faculty develop-ment. Students completing the programs are required to be able to encour-age patients to speak openly about their CAM use, to assess the safetyand efficacy of selected CAM therapies, and to advise patients from anevidence-based perspective. The College of Pharmacy teaches its studentsabout herbal medicine and nutritional supplements through both didacticlectures in required courses and an integrative care rotation in which stu-dents participate in natural products compounding. The university hasalso developed online CAM modules on several topics (e.g., introductionto complementary therapies and healing practices; spirituality and health;and culture, faith traditions, and healing) and offers a graduate minor incomplementary therapies and healing practices in which students canchoose from more than 35 courses. The Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke 's Medical Center program is designed to integrate CAM therapies into the undergraduate and graduate curriculaof the Rush University College of Nursing and to provide continuing educa-tion in CAM for both faculty and practicing nurses. Five competencies forundergraduate education in CAM were identified: 1. Incorporate the assessment of patient use of CAM practices into standard history and physical examinations. 2. Describe the indications and safety issues for selected CAM therapies.3. Demonstrate knowledge of the research or evidence base that sup- ports the safety and efficacy of selected CAM therapies. 4. Apply knowledge of the safety, efficacy, and appropriateness of CAM therapies to patient care management. 5. Acquire a knowledge for working in a collaborative manner with CAM practitioners. This program has also developed four basic required modules consid- ered essential for all master 's students. These modules are CAM Overview,236 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CAM Assessment, Ethics and Clinical Decision Making, and CAM Prac- tices and Qualifications of CAM Practitioners. An advanced pharmacologycourse also offers essential CAM-related content and five case-based mod-ules have been developed to teach about CAM therapies for depression, lowback pain, treatment of culture-specific illnesses, the management of pedi-atric asthma, and the management of stress and anxiety. The Tufts Program in Evidence-Based Medicine plans to teach about several areas of CAM, including nutrition and pain, palliative, and support-ive care. In addition, through its affiliation with the New England School ofAcupuncture, it will also teach about East Asian Medicine. Several changes were incorporated into the University of Michigan Medical School curriculum to teach medical students about CAM. Con-ventional and CAM practitioners participate in an 8-hour CAM CourseUnit for first-year students that focuses on patterns of CAM use, identify-ing key issues for CAM researchers and practitioners, and classifying CAMmodalities. The school also has a required course on alternative approachesto the treatment of musculoskeletal pain, as well as a course that offers anintroduction to macronutrients and nutritional assessment and a mind-body theory and practice course. Fourth-year students are offered a 4-week clinical elective in CAM, and they may also enroll in a course ad-dressing the scientific basis of CAM that meets the school 's science in clinics requirement. The Oregon Health and Science University is part of a CAM consor- tium that has designed the Oregon CAM Course, the mission of which is todevelop CAM literacy and cognitive flexibility in conventional health pro-fessional students. The other members of the Consortium are the OregonCollege of Oriental Medicine, National College of Naturopathic Medicine,and the Western States Chiropractic College. First-year students receive anintroduction to education in CAM professions, as well as education inmind-body training, ethics, drug-herb interactions, how to assess the CAMliterature, and simulated patients. Electives are offered in integrative medi-cine, healer 's art, and mind-body skills. The University of Washington School of Medicine and Bastyr Univer- sity (a leading school for naturopathic medicine in Seattle, Washington) arecooperating to develop and integrate CAM training into the medical school.They began by identifying what they believed to be essential CAM contentfor all medical students and also designed cases to use for clinical teachingand assessments. Furthermore, they have implemented CAM content intoseveral courses including 1. Introduction to Clinical Medicine I and II 2. Problem-Based Learning3. Medicine Health and SocietyEDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 237 4. Systems of Human Behavior I and II 5. Pharmacology I and II6. Urinary System7. Nutrition8. Microbiology9. Anatomy 10. Reproduction11. Endocrine Although the preceding discussion has briefly described a few of the approaches being taken to teach CAM what is actually included in a CAMprogram depends on the goals and objectives of the individual educationalinstitutions. The committee believes that it is important that the schools ofhealth professions include information about CAM in their required cur-ricula so that health care practitioners will be able to inquire about theirpatients ' use of CAM in a way that is nonjudgmental and that allows health care practitioners to advise their patients about the use or avoidance ofCAM therapies on the basis of the available evidence. The next section addresses two of the more important educational issues for CAM practitioners. EDUCATING CAM PRACTITIONERS Much has been written about the inclusion of information about CAM in health professions education. Concomitant examination of education formany of the education programs for CAM practice areas is also important.Within and across CAM modalities there is tremendous variability in edu-cation and training of practitioners. Licensing requirements vary from stateto state, but state statutes require a specified level of education for thelicensed CAM professions (chiropractic, naturopathy, massage therapy,homeopathic medicine, acupuncture, and oriental medicine). For example,chiropractors (who are licensed in all states) must graduate from an accred-ited chiropractic college, pass national board examinations, and completestate licensing board examinations (Chapman-Smith, 2001). Naturopathicphysicians are licensed in 13 states plus the District of Columbia, PuertoRico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Individuals must \"have 4 years of naturo- pathic medical school, which includes course work in basic science, patho-physiology, treatment, and 2 years of clinical experience in an outpatientsetting \" (Stretch, 2001). Passing the Naturopathic Physician Licensing Ex- aminations enables those who have completed the required education toobtain a license. However, in the states in which naturopathy is not li-censed, there is no required training for those who choose to call themselvesnaturopaths.238 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia license massage thera- pists, and the majority require passage of the National Certification Examand graduation from an accredited program of 500 hours or more. TheCommission of Massage Therapy Accreditation (COMTA) has establishedcompetencies for massage educational programs, although the majority oftraining programs are not yet COMTA accredited. However, \"training, and licensure vary greatly from region to region, and there is currently aminimum of professional standardization \" (Chrisman, 2001). In the states that lack licensure requirements, there are no educational requirements. In5 states, licenses in homeopathy can be obtained by individuals with anMD, acupuncture is regulated in 33 states, and the Doctor of OrientalMedicine license is available in 3 states. In states with licensure require-ments, certain requirements and standards must be met to obtain a license,although these requirements may vary greatly. In states that do not licensethese professions and, for the many CAM modalities that are not licensed atall, there are no educational requirements and, therefore, no standardizedtraining for those in practice. Such a situation presents a major challenge tothose interested in implementing new programs of education for CAMpractitioners. The committee, in responding to its charge to identify major scientific, policy, and practice issues related to CAM research and the translation ofvalidated therapies into conventional practice, points out that the state ofeducation and training for many CAM practices is a major issue. Address-ing this issue in depth is beyond the charge of this committee; however,there are two areas where the committee focused its attention that arewithin its charge. First, it is often stated that CAM practitioners offer apatient-centered approach to care. As can be seen from the discussionsthroughout this report, the committee heartily supports the concept ofpatient-centered care and has endorsed the recommendations presented inCrossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001) that health practitioners should engage in such care. Although a great deal of research has evaluated pa-tient interactions with conventional medical providers, little research thathas examined practitioner-patient interaction or the delivery of patient-centered care has been conducted for most CAM therapies, including thefive therapies in which practitioners are licensed. Nor does the committeehave information that the various educational programs for CAM practi-tioners teach a patient-centered approach to care. Given this lack of infor-mation, we cannot say with certainty that CAM practitioners know howto provide such care or, if they do know how, whether they actually do so.Therefore, the committee wishes to emphasize that CAM practitionersshould be taught the principles and processes of patient-centered care, asshould conventional medical practitioners.EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 239 The second area of education about which the committee has chosen to comment relates to research training. In its charge, the sponsor asked thecommittee to provide guidance on \"the shortage of highly skilled practi- tioners who are able to participate in scientific inquiry that meets NIHguidelines, and who have access to institutions where such research is con-ducted \" (committee statement of task). The discussion in the next section focuses on this issue. Teaching Research A major goal of research on CAM therapies is to produce reliable evidence of the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of CAM approaches. Atpresent, however, there is a dearth of qualified scientists to undertake thebroad range of research that is needed to address the gaps in evidence onCAM approaches. Two major potential sources of trained scientists exist: academic health centers and CAM institutions. Training in research was not a part of CAMclinical training, nor for the most part have careers in CAM been dependenton publishing research findings. CAM institutions focus primarily on train-ing for practice, for which an important incentive on the part of the institu-tion is financial; the institutions are dependent on tuition from students,and the students in turn are motivated to enroll so that they can eventuallyearn income as practitioners. CAM practitioners have very little incentiveto become trained in research. Furthermore, very few CAM settings havethe infrastructure to facilitate the development of research teams. To ensure that research reflects as much as possible the actual ways in which CAM therapies are practiced, it is important to have CAM practitio-ners involved in such research. \"Studies might provide more accurate and applicable information when professionals with a profound understandingof the therapies participate in the research design, ensuring that studiesaccurately evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatments without compro-mising the integrity of the medicine \" (Shaw et al., 2003). As discussed in previous chapters, additional research about CAM is needed to understand many important factors, for example, why and howpeople choose to use CAM, the extent to which various CAM modalitiesare effective, whether CAM treatments are cost-effective, the placebo effect,and much more. CAM practitioners are important to the development andimplementation of these types of research. Furthermore, CAM practitionershave a responsibility to ensure that their practices are of benefit to theirpatients. Because ongoing evaluation and research foster improvements, theinformation that emerges from these research studies will be of great valueto both CAM practitioners and those in conventional medicine who are240 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE engaged in attempting to provide the best care for their patients. In the area of chiropractic, for example, Flanagan and Giordano (2002) suggest, \"Chi- ropractic institutions must embrace the initiative to train students to ac-tively conduct research, provide incentives to train researchers to becomechiropractors, and motivate practitioners in academically based joint ef-forts to contribute to strictly conducted outcomes studies. \" Flanagan and Giordano (2002) examined why progress in the training of chiropractic researchers has been slow, pointing out that there are fewopportunities in chiropractic institutions for research faculty; of the $224million total available for U.S. chiropractic colleges, most is used to \"en- hance and maintain student enrollment, \" with only 2.5 percent allocated to research programs. Flanagan and Giordano argue however, that researchshould be given a higher priority; that it not only achieves outcomes-basedresults but also encourages faculty collaboration. They conclude by encour-aging chiropractic institutions to train students in research, thereby creating\"an environment that stimulates and supports research to fortify the integ- rity of the chiropractic profession, the communities it serves, and society atlarge. \" CAM practitioners not only must know how to conduct research but also must know how to write up the results. Jobst and Murphy (1999)write, \"The willingness to share the expertise, to have one 's 'sacred cows ' examined for the greater good in order to better understand what helpsheal is what is needed not only in CAM practices but also in orthodoxmedicine. \" Programs in CAM Research Several efforts have begun to address the need to train CAM practi- tioners to participate in research. For example, Georgetown University haslaunched a science-based master 's program in CAM in which graduates receive a master 's in physiology. The program trains students to analyze current research critically using traditional methods of scientific inquiry,provides practice in designing research studies, and teaches students toidentify areas requiring further research. In another effort, ten massagetherapy schools have formed the Massage Therapy Research Consortiumwith the aim of enhancing each member school 's research capacity and activity, as well as to advance massage therapy education and practicegenerally. The initial focus will be on education about research designs andmethods (CHRF, 2004). The University of Pennsylvania Health System has a 2-year program, based in the Center for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, that focuses onteaching CAM practitioners how to conduct research. The first year isdevoted to learning research methodologies while the second year is spentEDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 241 applying the methodology. As of March 2004, five individuals were en- rolled in the program: four CAM practitioners and one anesthesiologistinterested in applying CAM in the management of arthritic pain (Fishman,2004). The Oregon Center for CAM (based at Kaiser Permanente 's Center for Health Research) has begun a program aimed at training CAM practi-tioners to conduct and collaborate in research. The postdoctoral fellow-ship is open to graduates who hold a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy), MD(Doctor of Medicine), ND (Doctor of Naturopathy), DDS (Doctor of Den-tistry), DO (Doctor of Osteopathy), or DC (Doctor of Chiropractic) de-gree. Acupuncturists, chiropractors, dental hygienists, massage therapists,naturopaths, nurses, osteopaths, physician 's assistants, physicians, and dentists can apply for the part-time clinician fellowship. The programincludes individual mentoring and training, group mentoring, a clinicalresearch class, education on the development of a research proposal, and ajournal club. Mentoring is a key component of the training with mentorsand fellows matched on the basis of their research interests, backgrounds,and skills. Together, the mentors and fellows establish goals for the train-ing, select projects, and outline how time will be distributed among se-lected projects, meetings and seminars, and additional activities. The clini-cal research component teaches classes that include such topics as grantwriting, study administration, and writing for publication. The proposaldevelopment process acts as a vehicle for instruction and practice in electronic literature search- es articulating specific aims; matching research design to research ques-tions; exploring research methodologies appropriate to CAM and how and when qualitative and quantitative techniques should be applied; se- lecting outcome measures, options for data analysis, and issues related tothe protection of human participants in research studies. (Shaw et al., 2003) The Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research and the Division of Graduate Studies at the Palmer College of Chiropractic are collaboratingwith the School of Public Health at the University of Iowa to offer a 2-yearcurriculum in clinical research training to selected chiropractors. The goalsof the program are to train chiropractors to become productive clinicalinvestigators and to increase the chiropractic and CAM research workforce.The program consists of course work, mentoring, seminars, and work-shops. Graduates of the program are expected to be able to select and apply appropriate study design and statistics; conduct clinical research according to professional and legal ethical standards;242 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE lead and manage a productive career in clinical research; acquire and maintain expertise in a research domain and communi- cate scientific knowledge through verbal presentations; and write well-organized, logical journal publications, research propos- als, and grant applications. In addition to providing research training in CAM clinical educational institutions, another approach is to incorporate research training throughcollaborations with conventional medical research institutions. For example,the Research Collaborative between the New England School of Acupunc-ture (NESA) and Harvard University explores the efficacy and safety ofacupuncture, while it also engages in academic and administrativementoring programs to prepare NESA faculty and students to submit com-petitive NIH grant applications. LESSONS FROM OTHER FIELDS The development of a cadre of scientists trained to perform research on CAM therapies will occur only as part of the overall development of CAMscience and education, especially in academic health centers, but also inCAM institutions. Two other fields have gone through processes that arerelevant to the challenges faced by CAM in attempting to develop qualifiedresearchers and a research infrastructure: geriatrics and HIV/AIDS. Theexperiences that practitioners in both of these fields underwent illustratethe importance of using multiple strategies to create an environment inwhich new science can flourish. Geriatrics 1 In the late 1960s, geriatricians were often thought of as \"nursing home doctors. \" Practitioners had low professional status and were economically marginal. In the 1970s U.S. geriatrics was at a crossroad; should it developas a service discipline that was focused on long-term care and the disabledand dying, that was outside the academic mainstream, and that was basedmainly in nursing homes; or should it develop along the lines of a respected,first-quality professional discipline in the classic academic model combin-ing research, education and training, and innovative clinical care? The field 1The material in this section is taken, in part, from a presentation to the committee by William R. Hazzard, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Washington and director of geriatrics and extended care at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System.EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 243 moved in the latter direction with a number of milestones marking its progress. Warshaw and Bragg (2003) describe a series of events in the history of geriatrics. In 1974 the National Institute on Aging (NIA) was established,and in 1976 the Veterans ' Health Administration (VHA) initiated the Ge- riatric Research, Education and Clinical Care Centers to improve physicianknowledge of aging and quality of care for veterans. Two years later theIOM published a report stating that geriatrics must become imbedded inmedical education (IOM, 1978). During, that same year VHA began offer-ing the first geriatrics fellowships. In the early 1980s the first divisions of geriatrics were established at major academic health centers, including the University of California at LosAngeles and Washington, Duke, Cornell, Harvard, and Johns HopkinsUniversities. In 1987 a second IOM report recommended the establishmentof centers of excellence in geriatrics. Such centers create critical mass as wellas the multidisciplinary expertise required to advance the scientific agenda.At the same time, foundation support for the development of curricula andpartnerships in geriatrics became available. The Hartford Foundation, forexample, contributed support that was critical to the establishment of part-nerships within academic health centers (Warshaw and Bragg, 2003). Thislaid the foundation for the integration of geriatrics into the subspecialties ofinternal medicine, the development of geriatrics programs within surgicaland related medical specialties, and the creation of analogous programs ingeriatric nursing and social work. Today geriatrics is firmly established as aseparate area of study in academic health centers. It is taught as part of thecurricula of nearly all medical schools, and clinical training in geriatrics isrequired as part of residencies in internal medicine, family practice, obstet-rics and gynecology, and psychiatry. Today there are approximately 100fellowship training programs in geriatrics, the NIA annual budget is morethan $1 billion, the field receives robust funding from industry, and col-laborations exist between geriatrics and multiple disciplines (NIA, 2004). A program developed to train geriatricians to conduct research pro- vides some lessons about the development of programs for CAM practi-tioners. The Summer Research Institute developed at the University of Cali-fornia in San Diego under an R-25 grant from the National Institute ofMental Health (NIMH) is an annual week-long training program for 25participants with regular follow-up after the program. Its goals are to in-crease knowledge of what research involves and increase motivation for aresearch career; provide information regarding issues and methods in re-search; shorten the time interval between the end of training and receipt ofthe first external grant; and foster relationships with established investiga-tors and peers. Faculty include individuals who have been successful at244 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE obtaining research funding as well as those who are able to teach scientific ethics and integrity. Core sessions provide education about scientific integrity; preparation of scientific autobiographies; career guidance; preparation of grants, papers, and presentations; recruitment and retention of research subjects; research administration; balancing life and work; and individual mentoring. In terms of achievement, of the 123 individuals who have attended one of these institutes, 90 percent have \"presented and written publishable papers within a year of attendance, and over 50 percent have received grantfunding within 18 months \" of completing the program (Halpain et al., 2001). HIV/AIDS 2 In the early 1980s, HIV/AIDS was a newly discovered disease without a ready-made research workforce to investigate it. Over the subsequent 10to 15 years, the field attracted many seasoned scientists and trained newones, with the result that, today, a well-developed research workforce oper-ates at all levels of HIV/AIDS-related science. The development of scientiststrained to conduct behavioral research in HIV/AIDS provides an excellentcase illustration with many relevant applications to the development ofCAM research. The development of behavioral research in HIV/AIDS was spurred by scientists who were present when AIDS first emerged in the United States.In 1983 NIMH received four investigator-initiated grant applications. Sup-port was provided from the director 's supplemental funds. The NIH Office of AIDS Research was established in 1988, accompanied in the same yearby the establishment of the Office of AIDS Research at the NIMH. TheNIMH program used a number of strategies to jump start research includ-ing announcements for requests for applications, program announcementsfor secondary data analysis, supplemental funding to existing R01 grants, 2The material in this section is taken from a presentation to the committee by Willo Pequegnat, MD, associate director for AIDS and mental health programs, National Instituteof Mental Health.EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 245 supplemental funding from nongrant organizations, community participa- tion, aggressive technical assistance and grant monitoring, and the creationof consortia of investigators that brought together investigators to addressnovel ideas. Of particular interest was the involvement of NIMH programstaff in the grant development process. The staff was encouraged to workwith investigators, especially junior investigators, to help them developstrong proposals. The NIMH program also devoted extensive resources totraining. It established institutional training grants, supplements to traininggrants, postdoctoral and predoctoral fellowships, minority and disabilitysupplements, and career development awards. Of particular interest is a program that was developed to train behav- ioral and social scientists to conduct HIV/AIDS behavioral research withminority populations. The Collaborative HIV Prevention Research in Mi-nority Communities Program (Marin and Diaz, 2002) is a comprehensiveintensive program that provides training, research collaboration, and tech-nical assistance over a 2-year period. The 27-month program includes fund-ing for small grants, a structured summer program to which the partici-pants return for three summers, individualized long-term researchcollaboration in which program faculty serve as mentors throughout theyear, and access to relevant scientific expertise. Although such programsrequire a large investment of resources, the participants emerge with pre-liminary data and fundable research proposals. This program may be amodel that can be used to train CAM practitioners to become rigorousresearchers. Many CAM institutions do not at present have the infrastructure or institutional culture for research, nor do they have the financial resources todevelop them. Strategic partnerships with NIH and academic health sci-ences universities would help foster this development. NCCAM has fundedsuch partnerships (e.g., NESA and Harvard University Research Collabora-tive). It will be important to be able to define characteristics of the CAMinstitution, the traditional academic institution, and the relationship be-tween them that will predict the successful development of research capa-bilities at the CAM institutions. It is important to increase the numbers of trained researchers who come from the CAM fields of practice in order to advance knowledge aboutCAM. Well trained CAM researchers would be in a position to lead inves-tigations into research in their own domains and participate in the designand conduct of other research on these therapies. Increasing the number ofsuch researchers, however, depends on the availability and implementationof research training.246 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PRACTICE GUIDELINES The variations in the kinds of education and training for CAM practi- tioners, particularly unlicensed practitioners, were discussed above. Varia-tion in education, however, leads to variations in clinical practice. ManyCAM practitioners argue that their therapies are individualized to meet thespecific needs of each patient and that variation is good. Conventionalmedical practitioners also tailor therapies to individual patients, and whenpractice guidelines were first proposed, many were concerned about thenegative effects of those guidelines on \"clinical autonomy, health care costs, and satisfaction with clinical practice \" (Tunis et al., 1994). Indeed, both conventional medical and CAM practitioners would argue strenuouslyagainst \"cookbook \" clinical practice. Variation makes it difficult to conduct research on the efficacy or effec- tiveness of certain therapies because no practice guidelines have been agreedupon. However, CAM practitioners could develop their own practice guide-lines. Such guidelines would help overcome some of the difficulties of inap- propriate practice variation in research. Practice guidelines are \"systemati- cally developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions aboutappropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances \" (IOM, 1990). Ideally, good practice guidelines have eight attributes, although, as theIOM report recognized, it is not anticipated that practice guidelines will score well on each of these attributes. Rather, they are something to strivefor. Guidelines should be valid; when followed they result in anticipated health outcomes. be reliable and reproducible; any group of experts would develop similar guidelines given the same evidence and methods. have clinical applicability; they should be inclusive of appropriately defined patients as permitted by scientific and clinical evidence and expertjudgement. have clinical flexibility; the known or expected exceptions should be identified. have clarity; they should be easy to follow and should use clear, unambiguous language. be developed by using a multidisciplinary process; all key groups affected should participate. have scheduled reviews; times for review and revision should be determined. have documentation of the process, participants, evidence, and as- sumptions used for guideline development (IOM, 1990). Two major approaches are used to develop such guidelines. The first isEDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 247 an evidence-based approach. In conventional medicine evidence consists of that obtained by Western-scientific type evaluations. Mills et al. (2002)proposed that evidence-based CAM (EBCAM) be taught to CAM practi-tioners and outlined the implications of such education (Table 8-3). Theyargue that, even though EBCAM is viewed negatively by many in the CAMcommunity, in reality it is not incompatible with the principles of holismand clinical autonomy. Research results are only one factor that CAMpractitioners consider when they make a clinical decision. Other factorsinclude clinical judgment and patient values. \"The essence of the EBCAM process is the use of data collected on groups of patients to assist clinicaljudgment. However, ultimately these data need to be transferred to theindividual recognizing that it is likely the patient being examined will differfrom the average patient in the study \" (Wilson and Mills, 2002). What is needed is a blending of research findings with the values of patients andCAM providers to improve how clinical decisions are made (Mills et al.,2002). For CAM practices for which standard Western scientific research is lacking, experiential evidence and traditional healing manuals might beused. This could be combined with the second approach discussed in theTABLE 8-3 Implications of Introducing Evidence-Based Medicine Strategies into CAM Curricula Area Affected Desired Effect Political Increased research would improve practice capabilities and inclusion in health care delivery centers Economic Stop the time-consuming use of unproven therapies Decrease costs of unproven medicaments Potential coverage by health maintenance organizations and governments Increased research funding Social Increased communication among health care providersTechnological Increased purchase of computers and increased database access Development of additional CAM databases Legal Development of best-practice guidelines CAM therapists become responsible for actions Ethical Discontinue therapies proven to be ineffectiveStructural Increased collaboration among schools of medicine and CAM colleges SOURCE: Mills et al. (2002).248 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IOM report on practice guidelines; the use of professional judgment. This second approach is used in areas in which the science is weak or nonexist-ent (IOM, 1992). A key element of practice guidelines is that their development be under- taken by those who will be affected by the guidelines as recommended inthe IOM report (IOM, 1992). This includes practitioners, patients, andconsumers. Professional societies are also frequently involved in sponsoringthe development of practice guidelines. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Education about CAM is needed for both conventional medical practi- tioners and CAM practitioners. For those in conventional practice, it isimportant to learn about CAM to appropriately interact with and advisepatients in a manner that contributes to high-quality, comprehensive care.There are no guidelines on what should be taught, and great heterogeneityin the content and methods in use exist. Suggestions on what should betaught frequently emphasize critical thinking and the evaluation of thera-pies, as well as an understanding of different belief systems. Didactic ap-proaches to teaching include electives, required courses, or the integrationof CAM content into existing courses throughout all years of training.Some programs include experiential learning, fellowship, and residencyprograms. Although the individual content and organization of an educa-tional program on CAM vary from institution to institution on the basis ofthe goals and objectives of each program, the committee believes that it isessential to provide health professionals of today with information suffi-cient to enable them to competently advise their patients. Therefore, the committee recommends that health profession schools (e.g., schools of medi-cine, nursing, pharmacy, and allied health) incorporate sufficient informa-tion about CAM into the standard curriculum at the undergraduate, gradu-ate, and postgraduate levels to enable licensed professionals to competentlyadvise their patients about CAM. As such programs are introduced, it will be important to subject them to the same evaluation and scrutiny that areapplied to curricula on other topics. Many issues related to the training of the CAM practitioners are beyond the scope of this committee. It is clear, however, that CAM practitionerswho are well trained in the conduct of research are needed. Such individualsare important to the design and conduct of studies that accurately reflecthow CAM therapies are practiced. Some programs aimed at preparingCAM practitioners trained in research have been implemented. These tendto be programs rather than individual courses, and all include curriculumon research design and methods. Lessons can also be learned from otherfields, for example, the fields of geriatrics and of HIV/AIDS research. TheEDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CAM 249 Summer Research Institute developed to train researchers in geriatrics pro- vides some useful ideas for enlarging the number of researchers trained inCAM research. Another model that could prove useful is the CollaborativeHIV Prevention Research in Minority Communities Program, a 27-monthprogram that includes funding for small grants, a structured summer pro-gram to which the participants return for three summers, individualizedlong-term research collaboration with program faculty serving as mentorsthroughout the year, and access to relevant scientific expertise. Many CAM institutions do not have the infrastructure or institutional culture for research, nor do they have the financial resources to developthem. Strategic partnerships with NIH and academic health sciences univer-sities would help foster this development. NCCAM has funded such part-nerships. It will be important to be able to define the characteristics of theCAM institution, the traditional academic institution, and the relationshipbetween them that predict the successful development of research activitiesat the CAM institutions. Furthermore, some CAM modalities are not taughtwithin an educational infrastructure such as that provided by schools ofchiropractic medicine, naturopathy, or massage therapy. For practitionersof modalities without such an educational infrastructure it will be moredifficult to develop the necessary research expertise. The committee believes that despite the difficulties, it is of the highest importance to develop and implement research training for CAM practi-tioners. Therefore, the committee recommends that federal and state agen- cies, and private and corporate foundations, alone and in partnership, cre-ate models in research training for CAM practitioners. Furthermore, both research and quality would be fostered by the de- velopment of practice guidelines for CAM therapies. Practice guidelinesare \"systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances \" (IOM, 1992). Guidelines provide an important tool that the members of adiscipline can use to assess the quality of care they provide. They aredeveloped by using both evidence-based approaches and professional judg-ment. Key to guideline development is the participation of those who willbe affected by the guidelines. This means that CAM practitioners, possiblythrough their own professional organizations, would develop guidelinesfor their own therapies. Such guideline development requires knowledgeabout evidence-based decision making and the appropriate use of the thera-pies under consideration. The committee recommends that the national professional organizations for all CAM disciplines ensure the presence oftraining standards and develop practice guidelines. Health care profes-sional licensing boards and accrediting and certifying agencies (for bothCAM and conventional medicine) should set competency standards in theappropriate use of both conventional medicine and CAM therapies, con-250 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE sistent with practitioners' scope of practice and standards of referral across health professions. Both conventional medicine practitioners and CAM practitioners have educational challenges ahead. However, meeting those challenges will con-tribute to the knowledge base and therefore the ability to provide compre-hensive care that uses the best scientific evidence on benefits and harmavailable, encourages a focus on healing, recognizes the importance ofcompassion and caring, emphasizes the centrality of relationship-basedcare, encourages patients to share in decision making about therapeuticoptions, and promotes choices in care that can include CAM therapieswhere appropriate. The next chapter examines the area of dietary supplements. REFERENCES AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges). 1998.

J Altern Complement Med 8(6):875 -876.2539 Dietary Supplements Dietary supplements have become a prominent part of American popu- lar health culture, a fact attested to by the ready supply of supplements inpharmacies; chain stores such as Sam's Club, Costco, and Walmart; super-markets; and health food stores. Vendors advertise cut-rate prices for di-etary supplements on the Internet. Since the 1960s, the prevalence of vita-min, mineral, and herbal product use has increased in the United States(Kessler et al., 2001). Today, dietary supplements comprise a major indus-try, responsible for $18.7 billion in sales in 2002 (Nutrition Business Jour-nal, 2003). Herbal product use increased 380 percent between 1990 and1997 (Eisenberg et al., 1998), and recent survey data indicate that 14percent of Americans have taken an herbal product or supplement withinthe last week (Kaufman et al., 2002) and that 18.9 percent have taken onein the past year (Barnes et al., 2004). The use of dietary supplements isprimarily self-initiated rather than practitioner based and presents uniqueregulatory, safety, and efficacy challenges to consumers, researchers, andpractitioners. These challenges are an integral part of the committee's charge to identify major scientific, policy, and practice issues related to comple-mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) and are the focus of this chapter. DIETARY SUPPLEMENT USE IN THE UNITED STATES Kaufman and colleagues (2002) have described the patterns of medica- tion use (for both prescription and nonprescription drugs) by the ambula-tory adult population of the United States. Among their findings were theobservations that (1) 40 percent of the population routinely used one or254 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE more vitamin or mineral supplements; (2) 14 percent of the population had taken herbals and supplements during the previous week; and (3) amongprescription drug users, 16 percent also took an herbal or supplement.Tables 9-1 and 9-2 summarize data on the most common supplementsconsumed by the American public. One shift in supplement usage is instruc-tive. The use of St. John 's wort declined significantly between 2000 and 2001. A plausible reason for this is the negative attention that this herbalmedicine received in both scientific journals and the popular press (Piscitelliet al., 2000; Shelton et al., 2001). To the extent that this is true, it demon-strates that the American public is responsive to reports of adverse eventsand scientific evidence involving the safety and efficacy of supplements aswell as product adulteration disseminated in the press. Market sensitivity toscientific reports as well as drug advertisements related to CAM therapiesneed to be further examined, as they have for conventional medicine. The American public 's views on the federal regulation of dietary supple- ments are also instructive. Blendon et al. (2001) reported on Americans ' views on dietary supplements determined in multiple randomized surveys,each with a sample size of greater than 1,000, performed from 1996 to1999. The investigators found that approximately half (48 percent) of allAmerican adults surveyed reported that they regularly take some type ofnonprescription vitamin or dietary or mineral supplement. One in six (16 to18 percent) reported that they regularly use dietary supplements, such asechinacea, ginseng, amino acids, or nonprescription hormones. Respon-dents with higher levels of education reported greater use than those with TABLE 9-1 Ten Most Commonly Used Vitamins/Minerals and Herbal Supplements Vitamin or Herbal Mineral Percent Use Supplement Percent Use Multivitamin 26 Ginseng 3.3 Vitamin E 10 Gingko biloba 2.2 Vitamin C 9.1 Garlic 1.9 Calcium 8.7 Glucosamine 1.9Magnesium 3.0 St. John 's wort 1.3 Zinc 2.2 Echinacea 1.3 Folic acid 2.2 Lecithin 1.1Vitamin B 12 2.1 Chondroitin 1.0 Vitamin D 1.9 Creatine 0.9 Vitamin A 1.8 Saw palmetto 0.9 Any vitamin 40 Any herbal 14 or mineral supplement SOURCE: Adapted from Kaufman et al.

Regular users were also more likely to be white and non- Hispanic. Americans older than age 45 years were more likely to use supple-ments regularly than those who were younger (44 and 24 percent, respec-tively). The investigators also reported that uninsured Americans weresignificantly more likely than those with insurance to use dietary supple-ments (21 and 15 percent, respectively). Of note, they comment that one ofsix parents (18 percent) reported that they give dietary supplements to theirchildren. Blendon and colleagues (2001) noted that a 1997 survey found that one-third (36 percent) of adults thought that there was a dietary supple-ment that could help them live longer. Overall, 85 percent of regular usersreported that dietary supplements are good for people 's health and well- being. That proportion was lower for those who were not regular dietarysupplement users. Regular users believed that dietary supplements couldhelp with the treatment of a wide range of medical conditions. About halfof regular users believed that supplements are helpful for people with colds(61 percent), arthritis (53 percent), depression (52 percent), and influenza(49 percent). Some regular users viewed dietary supplements as helpful inthe treatment of cancer (35 percent) and HIV infection-related immunode-ficiency syndromes (16 percent). Another study that the investigators iden-tified found that 82 percent of Americans surveyed said that they wouldseriously consider trying alternative treatments such as herbal medicines ifthey were terminally ill. Importantly, Blendon and colleagues (2001) also found that those who were regular users believed strongly in the usefulness of various dietarysupplements, irrespective of the scientific evidence. When asked what theywould do if a government agency said that the supplement that they usedmost often was ineffective, 71 percent of regular users reported that theywould continue to use it. In a follow-up survey, respondents were askedwhat they would do if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifi-cally said that the supplement that they used most was ineffective to see ifuse of the FDA name versus an unknown government agency would alterthe results. Specific mention of the FDA did not lead to different responses.Once again, two-thirds (67 percent) of regular users of dietary supplementssaid that they would continue to take the supplement. Regular users had more confidence in the safety of these products than nonusers: the majority of regular users (53 percent) believed that people are\"rarely or never \" harmed by taking dietary supplements; in contrast, 51 percent of nonusers reported that people are \"often or sometimes \" harmed by these supplements (Blendon et al., 2001). Blendon and colleagues (2001) also queried the respondents about their attitudes towards governmental regulation of dietary supplements. A sub-stantial percentage of respondents were confused about the role that theDIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 257 government currently plays in regulating supplements. Slightly more than half (53 percent) were aware that supplements are not regulated by thegovernment. One-third (35 percent) believed that supplements are currentlyregulated, and 12 percent reported that they did not know (Blendon et al.,2001). However, the investigators reported that even with this level ofpublic confusion, a majority of respondents expressed support for increasedgovernment regulatory efforts to ensure that dietary supplements are notharmful and are pure, that doses are consistent, and that advertising claimsare true (Blendon et al., 2001). Eighty-one percent of respondents sup-ported giving FDA the authority to allow new supplements to be sold onlyif the safety of the supplements has been tested by FDA; 80 percent sup-ported giving FDA the authority to remove dietary supplements from themarket if they are proven to be unsafe. Despite the large percentage ofpeople in support of greater regulation, Blendon et al. (2001) also note, \"a substantial number of respondents were not prepared to be denied access toexisting dietary supplements that have not been previously tested for safety. \" Similar levels of support were found among those who were regular usersand those who were not (Blendon et al., 2001). As such, the matter offederal regulation of dietary supplements is clearly one for which there iscurrently much confusion on the part of the American public. REGULATION OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act The capstone of herbal medicine regulation is the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA, 1994). As seen from thesurvey data presented above, dietary supplements encompass many prod-ucts, including herbs, vitamins, and minerals. DSHEA formally defineddietary supplements as a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; ora concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described above. Dietary supplements are further defined as products that are labeled as dietary supplements and are not represented for use as a conventional258 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet. Supplements can be marketed for ingestion in a variety of dosage forms including capsule, powder, soft- gel, gelcap, tablet, liquid, or indeed, any other form so long as they arenot represented as conventional foods or as sole items of a meal or of the diet. (DSHEA, 1994) DSHEA had enormous consumer support as evidenced by the approxi- mately 2 million letters sent to members of the U.S. Congress in support theact (Soller, 2000). The legislation sought to be responsive to the public andwas passed in the spirit of improving the health of Americans and empow-ering consumers to make their own choices about preventive health carepractices. In doing so, however, DSHEA designated that supplements beregulated similarly to foods. This crucial distinction exempted manufactur-ers from conducting premarket safety and efficacy research and eliminatedFDA's premarket regulatory authority. Before DSHEA, FDA attempted to regulate dietary supplements as foods evaluating the safety of all new ingre-dients, including those used in dietary supplements. DSHEA eliminated thisrequirement, and as a result, the dietary ingredients used in dietary supple-ments are no longer subject to the premarket safety evaluations required ofother new food ingredients or for new uses of old food ingredients. Theymust, however, meet the requirements of other safety provisions (FDA,1995). Table 9-3 shows how dietary supplements are regulated in compari-son to foods and drugs. The establishment of dietary supplements as foods limited FDA 's premarketing regulatory authority and placed FDA in a reactive,postmarketing role. If FDA can prove that a supplement presents a signifi-cant or unreasonable risk of injury or illness when it is used as recom-mended on the label, it may remove a product from the market. Thisoccurred in 2004, when FDA prohibited the sale of dietary supplementscontaining ephedrine alkaloids. To substantiate its ruling, FDA conducted arisk-benefit analysis of ephedra and examined evidence from the knownpharmacology of ephedrine alkaloids, the peer-reviewed literature on ef-fects of ephedrine alkaloids, and reported adverse events after consumptionof the product. Review \"showed little evidence of ephedra 's effectiveness except for short-term weight loss, while confirming that the substance raisesblood pressure and stresses the heart \" (http://nccam.nih.gov/health/alerts/ ephedra/consumeradvisory.htm). FDA determined that data did not indi-cate a health benefit sufficient to outweigh the short- and long-term risks ofuse (e.g., increased blood pressure, and heart rate) (FDA, 2004). Adverseevent analysis is complicated by the fact that supplement manufacturers arenot required to report adverse events. DSHEA authorized FDA to establish good manufacturing practice regu- lations specific to dietary supplements, and these are in development (FDA,2003a). However, until these practices are implemented, manufacturers are259 TABLE 9-3FDA Regulation of Foods, Drugs, and Dietary SupplementsDietary Food New Status Supplements FoodsaAdditives Drugsb Premarket approval requiredNocNodYes Yes Risk-benefit analysis conducted by FDA before marketingNoNo No Yes Postmarketing reporting or surveillance by industry requiredNo No Rarely Yes Burden of proof for demonstrating safety or lack thereofFDA FDA Manufacturer Manufacturer aFoods (including conventional foods and dietary supplements), unlike drugs, are considered safe (reasonable certainty of no harm), and thus risk- benefit analysis is not applicable.bThis description applies to \"new\" drugs. Many over-the-counter drugs are regulated under FDA's Over-The-Counter Drug Review procedures, which do not provide for postmarketing surveillance.cA 75-day premarketing notification, but not premarketing approval, is required for dietary supplements containing ingredients not marketed before 1994.dIn 2001, FDA proposed a rule requiring marketers of food developed through biotechnology to notify the agency at least 120 days before commercial distribution and to provide information to demonstrate that the product is as safe as its conventional counterpart (FDA, 2001). SOURCE: Adapted from IOM (2005).260 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE accountable to consumers only on the basis that they have made a good faith effort to ensure that their products contain pure substances and arenot contaminated, weakened, or mislabeled. Dietary Supplement Labels DSHEA also included labeling guidelines for supplements and prohib- ited products from containing information on the label that claims that theproduct can treat or cure a disease. Three categories of claims for food anddietary supplement labels are allowed: (1) health claims, (2) structure-function claims, and (3) nutrient content claims. Table 9-4 provides ex-amples of each type of claim. Health Claims Health claims can be established by three methods: (1) authorization by FDA after a careful review of the scientific literature, (2) an authoritative TABLE 9-4 Label Claims for Dietary Supplements Structure- Unallowable Nutrient Content Function Disease Claim or Health Claim Claim Claim Percentage Claim Regular exercise and a Supports the Supports the Excellent source of healthy diet with enough immune system body 's ability to choline; contains calcium helps teens and resist infection 55 mg of choline young adult white and per serving, whichAsian women maintain is 10 percent of good bone health and the daily value for may reduce their high risk choline (550 mg)of osteoporosis later in life.

Some scientific evidence Helps promote Promotes low suggests that consumption digestion blood pressure of antioxidant vitamins may reduce the risk ofcertain forms of cancer. However, FDA has determined that thisevidence is limited and not conclusive.DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 261 statement of a scientific body of the U.S. government or National Academy of Sciences,1 or (3) the results of the 1999 Pearson v. Shalala court decision (FDA, 2003b). The Pearson case challenged FDA 's denial of four health claims: dietary fiber may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, antioxidantvitamins may reduce the risk of certain cancers, omega-3 fatty acids mayreduce the risk of coronary heart disease, and 0.8 milligram (mg) of folicacid in dietary supplement form is more effective than a smaller amountobtained through foods for reducing neural tube defects. The final decisionstated that FDA could not \"reject health claims that the agency determines to be potentially misleading unless the agency also reasonably determinesthat no disclaimer would eliminate the potential deception \" (FDA, 1999). The court also called for FDA to clarify the meaning of the \"significant scientific agreement \" standard. Most health claims are applicable only to foods, for example, \"low-fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables mayreduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with manyfactors. \" However, two health claims for dietary supplements have been approved: folate reduces the risk of neural tube defects, and calcium re-duces the risk of osteoporosis (FDA, 2000). Structure-Function Claims The second category created by DSHEA for foods and dietary supple- ments labels is structure-function claims. Such claims may only containstatements about how a product affects maintenance of normal function-ing or describe general well-being because of the \"consumption of a nutri- ent or dietary ingredient. \" Structure-function claims may also describe the means by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain a particu-lar structure or function. Examples include \"calcium builds strong bones \" and \"fiber maintains bowel regularity. \" Because manufacturers are re- sponsible for the truthfulness and accuracies of these claims, if a productlabel contains a structure-function claim, it must also include the dis-claimer, \"This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, orprevent any disease. \" An additional requirement of structure-function claims is that FDA must be notified of the claim within 30 days after sucha product is marketed. 1At present, this method of oversight for health claims cannot be used for dietary supple- ments, as Congress did not include dietary supplements in the provisions for health claims based on authoritative statements.262 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Nutrient Content Claims The final category of product labels is nutrient content claims. These claims describe the level of a nutrient or dietary substance in a product,using terms such as \"good source, \" \"high, \" or \"free.\" With few exceptions, nutrient claims may be used only for nutrients or dietary substances thathave an established daily value, such as fat, cholesterol, calories, and so-dium. However, since many dietary ingredients, including most dietarysupplements, lack established or recommended daily intake values, a sub-category called percentage claims also exists. These claims describe thepercentage of a product, such as \"40 percent omega-3 fatty acids \" or make a comparative percentage claim, such as \"twice the omega-3 fatty acids per capsule (80 mg) as in 100 mg of manhaden oil (40 mg) \" (FDA, 2003b). Off-Label Use of Dietary Supplements For the majority of dietary supplements, particularly herbal products, inadequate evidence exists to qualify them for health or nutrient contentclaims. Consequently, many dietary supplements are subject to structure-function claims. However, despite all the attention given to proper labeling,recent survey data and clinical trials indicate that dietary supplements arenot being used according to label claims (Blendon et al., 2001; Kaufman etal., 2002). Instead, many supplements are being taken for specific healthconcerns and health promotion, even though the effectiveness of the supple-ments has not yet been demonstrated. In response to this problem, severalresearch efforts have been launched to evaluate the efficacies of supple-ments for off-label health uses, for example: Echinacea and colds (Grimm and Muller, 1999; Turner et al., 2000) Hypericum perforatum (St. John 's wort) and major depressive disor- der (Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group, 2002; Shelton et al., 2001) Black cohosh and red clover for the relief of menopausal symptoms (ongoing National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine[NCCAM]-funded study at the University of Illinois, Chicago) Effects of garlic on cholesterol (ongoing NCCAM-funded study at Stanford University) Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and the combination of glu- cosamine and chondroitin sulfate for knee pain associated with osteoarthri-tis (ongoing multisite NCCAM-funded study) Chelation with EDTA treat heart disease (ongoing multisite NCCAM-funded study)DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 263 Federal Trade Commission In addition to FDA 's responsibilities for ensuring safety, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates product advertising. For all products,FTC maintains two guiding principles: (1) advertising must be truthful andnot misleading, and (2) before an advertisement is disseminated, all objec-tive product claims must be adequately substantiated (FTC, 2001). In accordance with its goal of ensuring that consumers receive accu- rate information about dietary supplements so that they may make in-formed decisions about the use of products, FTC released Dietary Supple- ments: An Advertising Guide for Industry (FTC, 2001). The guidelines are intended to clarify how FTC policies and enforcement practices relate todietary supplement-related advertising. In addition to FTC 's standard sub- stantiation requirements, the document outlines the type of evidence neededto support both expert endorsements and claims based on traditional use,as well as appropriate use of the DSHEA disclaimer and third-party litera-ture. In addition to the guidance document, FTC launched Operation Cure. Although the campaign is not limited to dietary supplements, it aims toenforce FTC regulations and educate consumers on recognizing healthfraud. However, as evident in the literature (Bonakdar, 2002; Morris andAvorn, 2003) and acknowledged by Howard Beales, director of FTC 's Bureau of Consumer Protection, \"unfounded and exaggerated claims for dietary supplements have proliferated, \" and the FTC has partnered with FDA to increase its enforcement activities (Beales, 2003). Dietary Supplement Regulation Outside of the United States The use of herbal products is prevalent throughout the world (WHO, 2002), and several countries have been addressing the use and regulation ofdietary supplements for many years, whereas others like the United Statesare in the early years of their regulatory efforts. Canada New Natural Health Products (NHP) regulations came into effect in Canada on January 1, 2004. The intent of the regulations is to \"ensure a balance between Canadians ' freedom of choice with respect to natural health products and the assurance of consumer safety \" (HealthCanada, 2003). The regulations establish NHPs as a subset of drugs. Before theestablishment of the regulations, NHPs could be sold as either foods ordrugs, depending on whether a health or therapeutic claim was made. In264 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE developing the regulations, Health Canada decided that because NHPs are taken for therapeutic reasons rather than caloric purposes or to addresshunger, they are more similar to drugs than foods. The NHP regulations authorize the following regulatory oversight: (1) a premarketing review and approval for safety, efficacy, claims, and prod-uct specification; (2) adherence to good manufacturing practice (GMP)requirements for manufacturing, packaging, and labeling; (3) requirementfor a site license where any regulated activity is conducted; (4) regulatoryoversight for a clinical trial process; and (5) a postmarketing surveillanceprogram for adverse reactions (Taller, 2003). The regulations call for a 6-year transition period. By the end of 2 years, all manufacturers, importers,packagers, and labelers will use GMPs and have site licenses, and by the endof 6 years, all NHPs will be identified with either a natural product number(NPN) or a drug identification number for homeopathic medicine (DIN-HM). Product labels will include a complete list of ingredients, conditionsfor use, a health claim when appropriate, a lot number, and themanufacturer 's contact information. Germany Since 1976 Germany has defined herbal medicines as medicinal prod- ucts and required premarketing approval of their quality, safety, and effi-cacy. In addition, herbal medicinal products must contain only plant mate-rial in crude or processed form and may have a therapeutic or prophylacticclaim. The same manufacturing standards, as well as labeling and advertis-ing regulations, pertain to both herbal and medicinal products (i.e., theproducts must be reproducible and nontoxic) (Richter, 2003b). The safety,efficacy, and quality of herbal products were determined by Germany 's Second Medicines Act of 1978. The act required a scientific review of allmedicines in the pharmaceutical market, including conventional drugs aswell as medicinal plants. Several commissions were established, and Com-mission E was charged with reviewing botanical drugs and preparationsfrom medicinal plants. Commission E completed the monographs in 1994,and the American Botanical Council published the monographs in English(Levy, 1998). The stated objective of Commission E was to ensure that approved botanicals are reasonably safe when they are used according to the labelinstructions and to remove unapproved botanicals from the market, even ifthey pose only minor safety risks (Blumenthal et al., 1998). For the Com-mission E reviews, it was the manufacturer 's responsibility to provide proof of quality, and the commission assessed the scientific literature on safetyand effectiveness. Herbal products were assigned one of three approvalratings: (1) positive (approved), (2) negative (unapproved), or (3) negative-DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 265 null (unapproved). The potential therapeutic benefit was a factor in making the ratings. France As in Germany, France also regulates herbal products that are intended for medicinal use as drugs. All medicinal products, including herbals, re-quire premarketing approval, and the manufacturer bears the responsibilityof proving quality, safety, and efficacy. An abridged approval process isavailable for herbal products with a history of traditional use. For theseproducts, the pharmacologic, toxicologic, and clinical data are evaluated,in addition to information on safety, risks-benefits, and well-established usefor self-medication. Products approved through the abridged process arelimited to making a claim on the label, such as \"Traditionally used in _______ \" rather than a disease claim (Richter, 2003b). Compared with the regulatory frameworks adopted in these industrial- ized countries, it is clear the United States has developed a unique regula-tory system for dietary supplements. Unlike Canada, Germany, and France,the United States regulates dietary supplements similarly to foods, and doesnot require premarketing approval of safety, nor does the burden of proofrest on the manufacturer. PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY As described above, many Americans are uncertain whether dietary supplements are subject to safety and efficacy evaluations similar to thoseused for over-the-counter medications (Blendon et al., 2001). In the samesurvey, the majority of respondents also believed that there was \"not enough regulation \" to ensure that supplements are not harmful (59 percent), to ensure that supplements are pure and contain consistent doses (60 percent),and to confirm that advertising claims are true (64 percent). At present, there is a lack of quality control for dietary supplements which is troubling because an adulterated product could compromise thatproduct 's safety. One report noted that 32 percent of Asian patent medi- cines were found to contain undeclared pharmaceuticals or heavy metals;10 to 15 percent contained lead, mercury, or arsenic (Marcus and Grollman,2002). Also, the herbal product PC-SPES (used by thousands for the treat-ment of advanced prostate cancer) was found to be contaminated withdiethylstilbestrol and warfarin (Straus, 2002). In a recent article, De Smet(2002) recommends that data on the manufacturer, product composition,storage, and indications for use be maintained to ensure the quality ofdietary supplements. The manufacture of a consistent product, a processoften referred to as \"standardization, \" is another component of product266 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE quality. Standardization of dietary supplements is challenging, however, because herbal products contain a mixture of chemically active compo-nents, and the primary active component is often unknown. This lack ofconsistency affects both researchers and consumers, as neither can be en-sured of a reliable product. One approach implemented by several supplement manufacturers is a \"seed-to-shelf \" philosophy of quality control. This approach enacts stan- dards for each step of the manufacturing process: from the use of purestarting products to growth, harvest, extraction, and screening for impuri-ties. In addition to setting such standards, quality tests are also performedat each step of the process (Dentali, 2003; Morrison, 2003). Good Manufacturing Processes One effort to improve the quality of dietary supplements is currently in development. In March 2003, FDA released draft standards for currentGMPs (cGMPs) for dietary supplements. The cGMPs will require standardsin the manufacturing, packing, and holding of dietary supplements to re-duce the risk of contamination with pesticides, heavy metals, and otherimpurities. A lack of GMPs contributes to problems with standardization.For example, Gilroy et al. (2003) conducted a study to assess the contentsof preparations containing only echinacea. They found that of the 59 sepa-rate samples purchased in the Denver, Colorado area, 10 percent containedno measurable echinacea. Proposed cGMPs would ensure proper labelingof a dietary supplement 's identity, purity, quality, strength, and composi- tion (FDA, 2003a). The goal of cGMPs is to develop more consistent prod-ucts, but they do not address safety, efficacy, or cost-effectiveness com-pared with those of existing prescription or over-the-counter drugs.Standards will be established by the individual manufacturers, which willincrease product consistency within a company but not within the industry(Betz, 2003). For example, Company A will now produce a consistent St.John's wort product, but it may not be consistent with or comparable to the St. John 's wort manufactured by Company B. Furthermore, GMPs will likely not solve the fundamental issues regarding the need for consistentproducts and quality assurance. Reactions to the cGMPs are varied. Although many acknowledge that the cGMPs should yield higher consumer confidence in herbal products,many are concerned that the proposed cGMPs are strongly based on apharmaceutical model and the implementation of such practices will haveprohibitive costs (Blumenthal, 2003b). Blumenthal notes that industry andFDA have reached a general consensus that many smaller to medium-sizemanufacturers will not be able to meet the requirements and will be put outof business.DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 267 Assessing Product Safety and Quality Because research on the efficacies of herbal products requires consistent products, NCCAM recently established a policy on the quality of naturalproducts to provide guidance for researchers seeking NCCAM funding(NCCAM, 2003). The policies are intended to help researchers identify anduse products of sufficient quality for their investigations. NCCAM recom-mends that the natural products used in a study be described in sufficientdetail and that the results be understood and independently reproduced.Studies must prove that the test material has been reliably identified, andthe content should be described by analysis of putative active ingredientsand by chromatographic analysis of the whole material by the commercialcompany or independent laboratory. Also, depending on the study design,verification of the samples at the start and end of the study may be neces-sary to ensure product stability (NCCAM, 2003). With the lack of federal standards for dietary supplements, several organizations have initiated efforts to improve and test the safety, quality,and efficacy of supplements. The following overview focuses on approachestaken by organization- or government-sponsored committees or a peer-reviewed process. 2 The list should not be considered inclusive of all efforts to consider safety, efficacy, or quality of dietary supplements, nor should itbe considered committee endorsement of the approaches used. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to sponsor, con-duct, and disseminate research to improve the quality and effectiveness ofhealth care. AHRQ administers evidence-based practice centers (EPCs),which have produced reports on the effectiveness and safety of a limitednumber of dietary supplements requested by other federal agencies. TheEPC reports are based on a systematic analysis of the relevant scientific dataand are designed to differentiate the types and strengths of a comprehensivebody of evidence. Nominations for clinical topics to be reviewed by an EPC are solicited through notices in the Federal Register. Topics must meet specific selectioncriteria, including high incidence; significance for the needs of users ofMedicare, Medicaid, or other federal health programs; high cost; contro-versy about effectiveness; and availability of scientific data. On the basis ofthis process, reports on six dietary supplements 3 have been reviewed as of October 2003. 2A comprehensive discussion of these private and public safety assessments is available in Dietary Supplements: A Framework for Evaluating Safety (IOM, 2005). 3The topics of the six reports are: Antioxidant supplements for prevention and treatment of cancer (October 2003); Antioxidant supplements for prevention and treatment of cardio-268 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE The American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP), a nonprofit organiza- tion, develops monographs on the quality, effectiveness, and safety of bo-tanical products commonly used in the United States. The monographs areintended to provide consumers, health care professionals, and botanicalmanufacturers with the knowledge required to use and manufacture bo-tanical products safely and effectively and to provide regulatory bodies andresearchers with guidance on the integration of botanical products into thehealth care system (AHP, 2004a). Botanicals are selected for review and description in a monograph on the basis of the extent of use, the unique value of the botanical, and spon-sorship by other interested organizations or companies (AHP, 2004a). Themonographs are relatively detailed compared with the monographs pro-duced by other organizations and are released as they are completed. Eigh-teen monographs have been published 4 since 1994, and 7 more have been proposed. The American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) is a national trade association for the botanical products industry. AHPA reviewed safety datafor 600 herbs and published the information in the American Herbal Prod- ucts Associations' Botanical Safety Handbook (McGuffin et al., 1997). The publication assigned botanicals to one of four safety classes. Class 1 con-tains botanicals that AHPA believes can be used safely when they are usedappropriately. Class 2 contains botanicals for which certain restrictionsapply (e.g., external use only and not recommended for use during preg-nancy). Class 3 contains botanicals for which significant data exist to rec-ommend special labeling. Class 4 contains botanicals for which AHPAfound insufficient data for classification. The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database (NMCD) is a private effort and was first published in 1999 by the Therapeutic Research Center.It is designed to bring together the consensus of the available data onnatural medicines so that practitioners do not need to search multiplesources to find scientifically reliable and clinically practical information onbotanical medicines and supplements for their patients. Products are evalu-ated on the basis of several factors: safety, effectiveness, mechanism of vascular disease (CVD) (July 2003); Ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic performance enhancement (March 2003); S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) for depression, osteoarthritis, and liver disease (August 2002); Garlic and CVD (October 2000); and Milk thistle effects 2000). 4The monographs published by AHP covered astragalus root, hawthorn berry, hawthorn leaf and flower, schisandra berry, valerian root, willow bark, ashwaganda goldenseal mushroom, bilberry fruit, cranberry ginkgo leaf, black cohosh (AHP, 2004b).DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 269 action and active ingredients, adverse reactions, interactions, drug influ- ences on nutrient levels and depletion, and dosage and administration(NMCD, 1999). Natural Standard was founded by clinicians and researchers as a multi- institution initiative in January 2000 to provide evidence-based informa-tion about CAM therapies (Natural Standard, 2004). The organization is aprivate, independent service that is not supported by any interest group,professional organization, or pharmaceutical manufacturer. Each mono-graph assigns a letter grade (A to F) pertaining to the level of evidence ofeffectiveness for specific indications. Information on safety, toxicology,precautions, contraindications, interactions, and mechanism of action isalso provided; but these do not contribute to the letter grade. In 1998 the Physician 's Desk Reference (PDR) organization, a private, for-profit group, expanded its publications to include a PDR for Herbal Medicines . The second edition was published in 2000 and contains mono- graphs on approximately 700 herbs. Of the 700 monographs, 300 arebased on the German Commission E monographs. The monographs con-tain information on efficacy, safety, potential interactions, effects, contra-indications, precautions, adverse reactions, and dosage. In addition, PDRpublished a reference volume for nonprescription drugs and dietary supple-ments in 2003 and a PDR for nutritional supplements in 2001. The World Health Organization (WHO) has undertaken several efforts related to the safety, efficacy, and quality control of herbal medicines andhas published three volumes of monographs since 1999, with a fourthvolume in development. Each volume contains approximately 30 mono-graphs. For each medicinal plant, information is included about puritytests, chemical constituents, uses, clinical studies, pharmacology, contra-indications, warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, and posology (i.e.,pharmacological determination of appropriate doses of drugs and medi-cines). In addition, in 2004 WHO published Guidelines on Good Agricul- tural and Collection Practices for Medicinal Plants , as well as several other reports related to quality control, appropriate use, and regulations pertain-ing to herbal medicines. The U.S. Pharmacopeia-National Formulary (USP-NF), a non- government, nonprofit organization, develops and provides standards ofidentity, strength, quality, purity, packaging, and labeling of drugs sold inthe United States. However, unlike the previously discussed monographs,USP-NF standards do not evaluate safety. Their standards were recognizedby the U.S. Congress in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938as the official compendium of the United States, making its establishedstandards for drugs essentially similar to federal regulations. As a separate effort, USP-NF also developed the Dietary Supplement Verification Program (DSVP) in November 2001. DSVP is designed to270 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE ensure that dietary supplement products contain the declared ingredients in the declared quantities. USP collaborates with manufacturers who volun-tarily submit their products for testing. The USP certification award isgranted if the product meets five quality standards: (1) contains the ingredi-ents stated on the label; (2) has the declared amount of ingredients; (3) willdisintegrate or dissolve effectively to release nutrients for absorption intothe body; (4) has been screened for harmful contaminants such as pesti-cides, bacteria, and heavy metals; and (5) has been manufactured by safe,sanitary, and well-controlled procedures. In addition, USP performs aninitial screening so that products with known safety concerns are not certi-fied and conducts random tests of marketed products carrying the mark forthe USP certification award to ensure that they continue to meet USP stan-dards over time. SAFETY Under the current DSHEA legislation, supplements are not subject to the same safety precautions as prescription and over-the-counter medica-tions. Instead of premarketing testing, FDA must prove that a supplement isunsafe to remove it from the market. For medications, manufacturers arerequired to comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act andensure the safety of their products before marketing. For new dietary supple-ment ingredients (those not marketed before the passage of DSHEA), be-fore marketing manufacturers must provide FDA with the information thatforms the basis on which the manufacturer has concluded that the productis safe. Although many supplement manufacturers recognize that the indus-try can be sustained only if they market safe products that perform inaccordance with their claims (Young, 2000), product inconsistency hasbeen demonstrated for several herbs (Gilroy et al., 2003; Raloff, 2003). De Smet (2002) identified three safety concerns: adverse effects of the herb, drug-herb interactions, and an indirect risk of delaying or replacingconventional treatment with treatment with an herb with unestablishedefficacy. Even though they are natural products, herbs contain biologicaland chemical properties that may lead to rare, acute, or chronic adverseeffects. Drug-herb interactions also present a potential risk to many con-sumers, given that one in six people take prescription or over-the-countermedications and dietary supplements concurrently (Kaufman et al., 2002).The interactions of a popular herb, St. John 's wort, with cyclosporine, indinavir, nevirapine, oral contraceptives, and amitriptyline have been re-viewed in the literature (Ioannides, 2002). To address the question of product safety, the FDA recently asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to develop a framework for evaluating thesafety of dietary supplement ingredients. The framework was published inDIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 271 2005 and includes a process for evaluating and describing the available information to establish the risk of harm and science-based principles toserve as guidance for evaluating the risk to human health (IOM, 2005). The IOM framework suggests a three-step process for determining the risk of harm. Because FDA evaluation of every dietary supplement ingredi-ent is unrealistic, the first step of the framework relies on \"signal detection \" to indicate that there may be a safety concern warranting further examina-tion. If a signal is found, the second step is to conduct a review of theavailable information, such as the quality of the adverse event report, itsapplicability to humans, or the route of exposure. In addition to reviewingthis information, it may be feasible to collect information to place the signalin context. If a safety concern remains after completion of this initial re-view, IOM recommended the performance of an integrative evaluationconsisting of an in-depth literature search and review, drafting of a safetymonograph, integration of the data into an analysis to complete the mono-graph, and possibly, referral of the monograph to an advisory body foradditional input before FDA decides whether to take regulatory action. Ifthe integrative evaluation results in a lower level of concern, FDA shouldcontinue to monitor the supplement for safety concerns through ongoingassessments of the literature. This responsibility rests on FDA, becauseDSHEA does not require postmarketing surveillance. The committee supports several of the conclusions and recommenda- tions in the IOM framework that address the legal and regulatory barriersaffecting FDA 's ability to protect the health of the public: It is very challenging to carry out the mandate of DSHEA given the limita- tions it imposes on the quantity and quality of the currently availablescientific data related to the safety of dietary supplement ingredients . . . In line with these findings, members of the scientific and medical commu- nity have strongly advised that the regulatory mechanisms for monitoringthe safety of dietary supplements, as currently defined by DSHEA, be revised. The constraints imposed on the FDA with regard to ensuring the absence of unreasonable risk associated with the use of dietary supple-ments make it difficult for the health of the American public to be ade- quately protected. (IOM, 2005) An additional conclusion from the 2005 framework report states, \"DSHEA should be amended to require that a manufacturer and distribu- tor report to the FDA, in a timely manner, any serious adverse event asso-ciated with use of its marketed product of which the manufacturer ordistributor is aware \" (IOM, 2005). Both the IOM framework and a recent review on the quality of dietary supplement reference books (Chambliss et al., 2002) conclude there is awide variation among references, and multiple sources should be consultedto obtain the most comprehensive information about product safety and272 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE quality. This uncertainty about safety, the lack of premarketing safety data, and the proliferation of misleading and unfounded claims about dietarysupplements place researchers, consumers, and conventional medical prac-titioners in a unique situation. It is a challenge to guide and advise patientsabout their use of supplements in the absence of evidence on their safety,quality, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. Only when products are consis-tently manufactured, characterized, and evaluated for safety and efficacywill physicians be able to judiciously advise their patients about their use. RESEARCH ON DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Office of Dietary Supplements Another component of DSHEA established the Office of Dietary Supple- ments (ODS) within the National Institutes of Health to promote, conduct,and coordinate scientific studies on dietary supplements. As discussed inChapter 1, the ODS 2004 -2009 Strategic Plan sets five overarching goals related to research, information communication, and education. To achievethese goals, ODS plans to place greater emphasis on the use of emergingtechnologies, cross-disciplinary studies, training and education of investiga-tors, translation of research, and establishment of a process for regularevaluation of ODS programs and activities. In the last 5 years, ODS has initiated many efforts to improve the quality of dietary supplement research. It established a program to improveanalytical methodologies and develop standard reference preparations ofdietary supplements and has created two databases that are publicly acces-sible: the Computer Access to Research on Dietary Supplements (CARDS)database and the International Bibliographic Information on DietarySupplements (IBIDS) database. The CARDS database currently containsinformation on federally funded dietary supplement research and is con-tinually updated. The IBIDS database provides access to bibliographic cita-tions and abstracts from the published international scientific literature ondietary supplements. An additional resource for the research communityand the public is evidence-based review reports, commissioned through apartnership with NCCAM from AHRQ 's EPCs. Another instance of ODS partnerships involves NCCAM, the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, the Office of Research onWomen 's Health, and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Together, they fund six Centers for Dietary Supplement Research. Thecenters emphasize botanicals and aim to identify and characterize botani-cals, assess their bioavailabilities and activities, explore their mechanisms ofaction, conduct preclinical and clinical evaluations, establish training andDIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 273 career development, and help select the botanicals to be tested in clinical trials. NCCAM Research Efforts As part of its effort to understand which CAM therapies work and which ones are safe, NCCAM supports research on herbal products. Re-cently, NCCAM noted that much of its research portfolio was devoted toclinical trials and in the future, it plans to place greater emphasis on studiesthat will help provide an understanding of the mechanisms of CAM mo-dalities. It is hoped that such research will aid with the acceptance of CAMtherapies by conventional medicine, as well as clarify research markers anddesign questions. For dietary supplements in particular, NCCAM notesthat poorly characterized products and unknown optimal dosage schedulesmay cause premature efficacy studies to fail and may limit further research.Therefore, NCCAM is interested in determining \"active ingredients, dos- ing, pharmacology, stability, and bioavailability; to identify surrogate mark-ers; and to assess study feasibility \" (NCCAM, 2003). The committee be- lieves that more preclinical and clinical trials on dietary supplements areneeded and that it is crucial for the products being evaluated to adhere to aseed-to-shelf quality control system. NCCAM supports five Centers for Dietary Supplement Research, which are located at Purdue University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, theUniversity of California at Los Angeles, the University of Arizona, and theUniversity of Missouri-Columbia. Each center has a unique focus: age-related diseases, women 's health, botanicals, phytomedicines, and phytonutrients, respectively. Examples of ongoing NCCAM-funded re-search include interactions between olive leaf extract and anti-HIV drugs,phytoestrogens for multiple sclerosis, ginger for chemotherapy-induced interac- tions. Research abstracts for all research funded by the National Institutesof Health are available through an online database, CRISP (ComputerRetrieval of Information on Scientific Projects [http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/]). Research Needs and Disincentives Reliable products are necessary to conduct quality research, and at present, most herbal supplements are not available in reliable or consistentforms. As stated above, unlike prescription drugs and over-the-countermedicines, manufacturers of dietary supplements are not required to testtheir products for safety or efficacy. In addition to this missing legal re-quirement, there is a financial disincentive for such research. Because di-etary supplements are ineligible for patent protection, manufacturers have a274 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE financial disincentive to invest in research on these products. Without patent protection and an ensuing period of exclusivity, a manufacturer 's results would be publicly available for use by its competitors, thus jeopardizing themanufacturer 's ability to regain the money invested in safety and efficacy testing (Richter, 2003a). Despite this disincentive, research on the efficacy of dietary supple- ments is crucial, and for future studies to be most useful, dietary supple-ments should be evaluated in comparison with conventional medicines andthe studies must use well-characterized products. Even when a reliableproduct is used, there is still a challenge in synthesizing the research resultsand performing meta-analyses, given the multiple brands and product char-acteristics. Future product reviews that identify safe and effective herbs andthat stratify the research results by brand or manufacturer would add mean-ing and value. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The committee is concerned about the quality of dietary supplements in the United States. There is little product reliability (Raloff, 2003), andbecause patent protection is not available for natural products, there is littleincentive for manufacturers to invest resources in improving product stan-dardization. In addition to the confusion that this introduces to consumers,the lack of reliable and consistent products is a challenge to the researchand clinical practice communities. Without consistent products, research isextremely difficult to conduct or generalize. Furthermore, without high-quality research, evidence-based clinical recommendations cannot be madeto guide patients. As a result of their pharmacological properties, dietary supplements, particularly botanical products, carry a risk of adverse effects and interac-tions. Unlike vitamins and minerals, herbal supplements are composed ofmany active compounds, and often, the primary active ingredient is un-known. Without knowing the active ingredient(s), it is a challenge formanufacturers to set standards that bear any therapeutic meaning. As such,consistency and quality checks throughout the manufacturing process gar-ner even more importance (Berman and Straus, 2004). To improve product consistency and reliability, the committee recom- mends that the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, in consultation withindustry, research scientists, consumers, and other stakeholders, amend theDietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 and the currentregulatory scheme for dietary supplements, with emphasis on strengthening: Seed-to-shelf quality control, Accuracy and comprehensiveness in labeling and other disclosures, Enforcement efforts against inaccurate and misleading claims,DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 275 Research into how consumers use supplements, Incentives for privately funded research into the efficacies of prod- ucts and brands, and Consumer protection against all potential hazards.

HerbalGram 48:31.27810 Conclusion Approximately one-third of adults in the United States use complemen- tary and alternative medicine (CAM) yet less than 40 percent disclose suchuse to their physician and other health care providers. Women are morelikely than men to use CAM therapies; use appears to increase as educationlevel increases; use patterns vary by race, depending on the type of CAMtherapy considered; and those who use CAM generally use more than oneCAM modality and do so in combination with conventional medical care(Barnes et al., 2004; Eisenberg et al., 1998; Mackenzie et 2003; 2002; Wolsko 2002; Wootton and Sparber, 2001). Some forms ofCAM are being incorporated into services provided by hospitals; coveredby health maintenance organizations; delivered in conventional medicalpractitioners' offices; and taught in medical, nursing, and other health pro-fessions schools. Insurance coverage of CAM therapies is increasing andintegrative medicine centers and clinics are being established. What do patients and health professionals need to know to make good decisions about the use of health care interventions, including CAM? Ofprimary importance is determining that they are safe and effective. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness may be important to both the individual andto society. In this report, the committee has recommended that the sameprinciples and standards of evidence of treatment effectiveness apply to alltreatments, with the understanding that certain characteristics of someCAMs and some conventional medical interventions make it difficult orimpossible to conduct standard randomized controlled trials. For thesetherapies, innovative methods of evaluation are needed as are measures andstandards for the generation and interpretation of evidence.CONCLUSION 279 The committee believes that it is necessary and desirable to use a variety of study designs to research CAM therapies. Given the limitedfunding, the committee suggests that the following criteria be used whenconsidering the CAM therapies to be selected for testing. No interventionwill meet all criteria, and a therapy should not be excluded from consider- ation because it does not meet any one particular criterion, for example,biological plausibility. A biologically plausible mechanism for the intervention exists, rec- ognizing that the science base on which plausibility is judged is a work inprogress and that potential science bases for some CAM therapies have notbeen well studied scientifically. Research could plausibly lead to the discovery of biological mecha- nisms of disease or treatment effect. The condition is highly prevalent (e.g., diabetes mellitus). The condition causes a heavy burden of suffering. The potential benefit is great. Some evidence that the intervention is effective already exists. Some evidence that there are safety concerns exists. Research design is feasible and likely to yield an unambiguous result. The target condition or the intervention is important enough to have been detected by existing population surveillance mechanisms. Ideally, potential new treatments go through a series of scientific chal- lenges that, if met, lead to acceptance of the test or treatment and integra-tion into clinical practice. Many CAM therapies and many conventionalmedical therapies, however, are already in widespread use without suchvalidation. The committee therefore concluded that, in addition to researchaimed at determining efficacy and uncovering mechanisms of action, re-search aimed at investigating what is occurring in practice (that is, effective-ness) is also needed. This report proposes that such research be conductedwithin a research framework with four major components: practice-basedresearch networks, a sentinel surveillance system, CAM research centers,and input from national surveys. To ensure that research reflects as much as possible the actual ways in which CAM therapies are practiced, it is important to have CAM practitio-ners involved. However, most CAM practitioners do not have researchtraining. CAM institutions focus primarily on training for practice; re-search training is rarely a part of CAM curricula. Investments in suchtraining are crucial. The widespread use of CAM therapies has implications not only for research but also for the education of conventional health care profession-280 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE als. Health care professionals need to be informed about CAM and knowl- edgeable enough to discuss with their patients the CAM therapies that theirpatients are using or thinking of using. However, there are no guidelines forwhat should be taught, and there is great variation in the content and themethods currently in use. Suggestions for what to teach frequently empha-size critical thinking and evaluation of therapies as well as understanding ofdifferent belief systems. Although the content and organization of an indi-vidual educational program on CAM will vary from institution to institu-tion, it is important for the health care professions schools to incorporatesufficient information about CAM into their curricula to enable licensedhealth care professionals to competently advise their patients about CAM.Furthermore, advances in understanding and applying CAM that derivefrom basic or clinical research should be incorporated into the pre-professional and continuing education programs of all relevant healthprofessionals. The committee chose to examine more closely the area of dietary supple- ments because they not only are a prominent part of American popularhealth culture but also present unique regulatory, safety, and efficacy chal-lenges to consumers, researchers, and practitioners. The committee is con-cerned about the quality of dietary supplements in the United States. Thereis little product reliability (Raloff, 2003). Reliable and standardized prod-ucts are necessary for the conduct of research on safety and efficacy as wellas consumer protection, and the committee recommends that the U.S. Con-gress amend the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994(DSHEA) to require the appropriate reliability of dietary supplements. The committee believes that the goal should be to provide comprehen- sive care that is based on the 10 rules outlined in the Institute of Medicinereport Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001). A comprehensive system uses the best available scientific evidence on benefits and harm, recognizesthe importance of compassion and caring, encourages patients to share indecision making about their therapeutic options, and promotes choices incare that can include CAM therapies when appropriate. Scientific inquiryinto little understood or unproven ideas, no matter whether they are fromCAM or conventional medical sources, can lead to new information that inturn can lead to improvements in care for the public. Health care is in the midst of an exciting time of discovery, a time when an evidence-based approach to health care delivery brings opportunities forthe incorporation of the best options from all sources of care, be it conven-tional medicine or CAM. The challenge is to avoid parochial bias and toapproach each possibility with an appropriate degree of skepticism or be-lief. Only then will it be possible to ensure that informed, reasoned, andknowledge-based decisions are being made.CONCLUSION 281 REFERENCES Barnes PM, Powell-Griner E, McFann K, Nahin RL. 2004.

This duty of beneficence takes precedence over anyself-interest. 1 Because of the increasing interest in and use of complementary and alternative therapies in medical practices (CAM), state medical boards havea responsibility to assure that licensees utilize CAM in a manner consistentwith safe and responsible medicine. On behalf of the Federation of StateMedical Boards and its continued commitment to assist state medical boardsin protecting the public and improving the quality of health care in theUnited States, the Special Committee for the Study of UnconventionalHealth Care Practices (Complementary and Alternative Medicine), 2 under- took an initiative in April 2000 to develop model guidelines for state medi-cal boards to use in educating and regulating (1) physicians who use CAMin their practices, and/or (2) those who co-manage patients with licensed orotherwise state-regulated CAM providers. CAM is a fluid concept that has been defined differently by various organizations and groups. For the purposes of these guidelines, the Com-mittee has chosen to use the term CAM as defined by the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Complementary and AlternativeAPPENDIX E 299 Medicine (NCCAM) (see Definitions). The Committee acknowledges that some therapies deemed CAM today may eventually be recognized as con-ventional, based on evidence over time. This initiative focuses on encouraging the medical community to adopt consistent standards, ensuring the public health and safety by facilitatingthe proper and effective use of both conventional and CAM treatments,while educating physicians on the adequate safeguards needed to assurethese services are provided within the bounds of acceptable professionalpractice. The Committee believes adoption of guidelines based on this modelwill protect legitimate medical uses of CAM while avoiding unacceptablerisk. The intention of the Committee is to provide guidelines that are clini- cally responsible and ethically appropriate. These guidelines are designed tobe consistent with what state medical boards generally consider to be withinthe boundaries of professional practice and accepted standard of care. MODEL GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IN MEDICAL PRACTICE Section I. Preamble The ( name of board ) recognizes that the practice of medicine consists of the ethical application of a body of knowledge, principles and methodsknown as medical science and that these objective standards are the basis ofmedical licensure for physicians of the state of (name of state). These stan-dards allow a wide degree of latitude in physicians ' exercise of their profes- sional judgment and do not preclude the use of any methods that arereasonably likely to benefit patients without undue risk. Furthermore, pa-tients have a right to seek any kind of care for their health problems. TheBoard also recognizes that a full and frank discussion of the risks andbenefits of all medical practices is in the patient 's best interest. There are varying degrees of potential patient harm that can result from either conventional medical practices or CAM: Economic harm, which results in monetary loss but presents no health hazard; Indirect harm, which results in a delay of appropriate treatment, or in unreasonable expectations that discourage patients and their fami-lies from accepting and dealing effectively with their medical condi-tions; Direct harm, which results in adverse patient outcome. Regardless of whether physicians are using conventional treatments or CAM in their practices, they are responsible for practicing good medicine by300 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE complying with professional standards and regulatory mandates. In consid- eration of the above potential harms, the (name of board) will evaluatewhether or not a physician is practicing appropriate medicine by consider-ing the following practice criteria. Is the physician using a treatment that is: effective and safe? (having adequate scientific evidence of efficacy and/or safety or greater safety than other established treatment mod-els for the same condition) effective, but with some real or potential danger? (having evidence of efficacy, but also of adverse side effects) inadequately studied, but safe? (having insufficient evidence of clini- cal efficacy, but reasonable evidence to suggest relative safety) ineffective and dangerous? (proven to be ineffective or unsafe through controlled trials or documented evidence or as measured bya risk/benefit assessment) Inasmuch as the (name of board) is obligated under the laws of the state of (name of state) to protect the public 's health, safety and welfare and recog- nizes that the standards used in evaluating health care practices should beconsistent, whether such practices are regarded as conventional or CAM,the Board recognizes that a licensed physician shall not be found guilty ofunprofessional conduct for failure to practice medicine in an acceptablemanner solely on the basis of utilizing CAM. Instead, the Board will use thefollowing guidelines to determine whether or not a physician 's conduct constitutes a violation of the state 's Medical Practice Act. Section II. Definitions For the purposes of these guidelines, the following terms are defined as indicated: Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Medical Practices (CAM)CAM refers to a broad range of healing philosophies (schools of thought), approaches and therapies that mainstream Western (conventional) medi-cine does not commonly use, accept, study, understand, or make available.A few of the many CAM practices include the use of acupuncture, herbs,homeopathy, therapeutic massage, and traditional Oriental medicine topromote well-being or treat health conditions. People use CAM treatmentsand therapies in a variety of ways. Therapies may be used alone, as analternative to conventional therapies, or in addition to conventional, main-stream therapies, in what is referred to as a complementary or an integra-tive approach. Many CAM therapies are called holistic, which generallyAPPENDIX E 301 means they consider the whole person, including physical, mental, emo- tional and spiritual aspects.3 Conventional Medical Practices Conventional medical practices refer to those medical interventions that are taught extensively at U.S. medical schools, generally provided atU.S. hospitals, or meet the requirements of the generally accepted standardof care. Section III. Guidelines The ( name of board ) has adopted the following guidelines when evalu- ating the delivery or co-management of CAM: 1. Evaluation of PatientParity of evaluation standards should be established for patients whether the physician is using conventional medical practices or CAM.Prior to offering any recommendations for conventional and/or CAM treat-ments, the physician shall conduct an appropriate medical history andphysical examination of the patient as well as an appropriate review of thepatient 's medical records. This evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, conventional methods of diagnosis and may include other methods ofdiagnosis as long as the methodology utilized for diagnosis is based uponthe same standards of safety and reliability as conventional methods, andshall be documented in the patient 's medical record. The medical record should also document: what medical options have been discussed, offered or tried, and if so, to what effect, or a statement as to whether or not certain optionshave been refused by the patient or guardian; that proper referralhas been offered for appropriate treatment; that the risks and benefits of the use of the recommended treatment to the extent known have been appropriately discussed with thepatient or guardian; that the physician has determined the extent to which the treatment could interfere with any other recommended or ongoing treatment. 2. Treatment PlanThe physician may offer the patient a conventional and/or CAM treatment pursuant to a documented treatment plan tailored to the individual needs ofthe patient by which treatment progress or success can be evaluated withstated objectives, such as pain relief and/or improved physical and/or psy-chosocial function. Such a documented treatment plan shall consider perti-302 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE nent medical history, previous medical records and physical examination, as well as the need for further testing, consultations, referrals or the use ofother treatment modalities. The treatment offered should: have a favorable risk/benefit ratio compared to other treatments for the same condition; be based upon a reasonable expectation that it will result in a favor- able patient outcome, including preventive practices; be based upon the expectation that a greater benefit will be achieved than that which can be expected with no treatment. 3. Consultation and/or Referral to Licensed or Otherwise State-Regulated Health Care Practitioners The physician may refer the patient as necessary for additional evaluation and treatment in order to achieve treatment objectives and may includereferral to a licensed or otherwise state-regulated health care practitionerwith the requisite training and skills to utilize the CAM therapy beingrecommended. However, the physician is responsible for monitoring theresults and should schedule periodic reviews to ensure progress is beingachieved. 4. Documentation of Medical RecordsThe physician should keep accurate and complete records to include: the medical history and physical examination; diagnostic, therapeutic and laboratory results; results of evaluations, consultations and referrals; treatment objectives; discussion of risks and benefits; appropriate informed consent; treatments; medications (including date, type, dosage and quantity prescribed); instructions and agreements; periodic reviews. Records should remain current and be maintained in an accessible manner, and readily available for review. 5. EducationAll physicians must be able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the medical scientific knowledge connected with any method they are offeringAPPENDIX E 303 or using in their medical practices as a result of related education and training. 6. Sale of Goods from Physician OfficesDue to the potential for patient exploitation, physicians should not sell, rent or lease health-related products or engage in exclusive distributorshipsand/or personal branding; Physicians should provide a disclosure statement with the sale of any goods, informing patients of their financial interest; and Physicians may distribute products to patients free of charge or at cost in order to make products readily available. Exceptions should be made for the sale of durable medical goods essential to the patient 's care, as well as nonhealth-related goods associated with a charitable or service organization. 4 [Language on the sale of goods from physician offices is contained in the report ofthe Special Committee on Professional Conduct and Ethics asadopted in April 2000.] 7. Clinical InvestigationsAs expected of those physicians using conventional medical practices, phy- sicians providing CAM therapies while engaged in the clinical investigationof new drugs and procedures (a.k.a. medical research, research studies) areobligated to maintain their ethical and professional responsibilities. Investi-gators shall be expected to conform to the following ethical standards: Clinical investigations should be part of a systematic program com- petently designed, under accepted standards of scientific research, toproduce data which are scientifically valid and significant. A clinical investigator should demonstrate the same concern and caution for the welfare, safety and comfort of the patient involved asis required of a physician who is furnishing medical care to a patientindependent of any clinical investigation. 5 Furthermore, investigators shall be expected to abide by all federal guide-lines and safeguards, such as approval and monitoring of the clinical trialby an Institutional Review Board (IRB), when applicable, to ensure therisks to the patient are as low as possible and are worth any potentialbenefits. In ConclusionThe Committee recognizes that legitimate standards of medical practice are rooted in competent and reliable scientific evidence and experience. How-ever, these standards are subject to continual change and improvement as304 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE advances are made in scientific investigation and analysis. In addition, standards of medical practice to some degree, and the provision of medicalservices in individual circumstances in particular, are influenced by psycho-logical, social, political and market forces. It is the responsibility of statemedical boards to balance all of these considerations in fulfilling theirmission of protecting the public through the regulation of the practice ofmedicine. Public protection is carried out, in part, by ensuring physicians in all prac- tices, whether conventional or CAM, comply with professional, ethical andpractice standards and act as responsible agents for their patients. Accord-ingly, the Federation encourages state medical boards to adopt these guide-lines to assist them in educating and regulating physicians who are (1)engaged in a practice environment offering conventional and/or CAM treat-ments; and/or (2) engaged in cooperative therapeutic relationships for theirpatients with a non-physician licensed or otherwise state-regulated healthcare practitioner offering CAM. State medical boards should ensure a balance between the goal of medical practices being evidence-based while remaining compassionate and respect-ful of the dignity and autonomy of patients. This balance should also ensureinformed consent and minimize the potential for harm.The Federation reaffirms its commitment to cooperate with physicians andprofessional, governmental and other organizations and agencies in sup-porting the further study of all health care practices that offer promise.

The Federation 's House of Delegates adopted the Committee 's recommendations as policy in April 1997. That same year, the Committee was charged with providing objective information to medical boards for their use in educating licensees, the public and state legislators on issues surrounding health care practices that may be potentially harmful and/or deceptive. In 2000, the Committee wascharged with the development of these guidelines. 3NIH.
