Not only do massages help with muscle fatigue and soreness, but they also lower stress, improve quality of sleep, and increase energy. We offer 30, 60, and 90 minute massages under the following methods. Swedish (Regular) Swedish massage is the most common. It focuses on relaxing and lengthening muscles. It also encourages fresh blood flow to improve circulation, and increases an overall sense of well being. Shiatsu Shiatsu massage is a unique and luxurious experience that gives you the benefit of a yoga class without breaking a sweat. Like yoga, the massage therapist will apply relaxation techniques on a mat. A combination of stretches, holds, and precisely pressured weight on key points of the body will open the blocked pathways for energy to flood through the body. An energy blockage or restriction is typically caused by stress or injury. The main goal of Shiatsu is to encourage proper function within the body to improve the quantity and quality of energy you have. Structural Integration Structural Integration is a deep tissue massage that improves posture and blood flow while resetting your muscles to help your body find its best, natural standing position. Over time, certain repeated actions damage posture. Actions such as sitting over a computer each day, wearing a purse or bag on the same shoulder, doing work in a bent position, etc are slowly harming the way the body's muscles operate. The slow, deep strokes of the Structural Integration reestablishes the functional patterns in the body. With consistent structural integration therapy, the body can experience permanently improved results. Ten sessions are required to see optimal results. Injury Massage Similar to a deep tissue massage , injury massage focuses on a specific injury site, by gently stretching out the muscles, breaking down scar tissue, and any tightness in the muscles that may be restricting movement. It will also help reduce persistent swelling that won't seem to go away. Cranial Sacral Cranial sacral massage uses a gentle approach that focuses on the bones of the head, spinal column and sacrum. Decompressing the cranial bones improves the central nervous system by releasing tension in the body's tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord, resulting in a variety of improvements throughout the body. A cranial sacral massage not only clears the mind, improves thought process and relaxes the body, but also has been found to help alleviate tinnitus. This therapy is especially effective for relieving recent and old head injuries (no children under 10). Sports Massage Sports massage is geared towards those with an athletic lifestyle. This massage will encourage optimal capacity during performance and results in expedited recovery post workout. This invigorating massage awakens the muscles with a rhthmic series of stretches to lengthen the muscles and develop alertness for maximum potential. After your event, it is recommended to schedule an additional, relaxing massage to help cool the muscles and minimize recovery time. Cupping Therapy Cupping therapy uses small cups that are placed over the skin and generate a gentle negative pressure, or vacuum, over the area. This small vacuum pressure draws more blood into the area, increasing circulation, which helps to reduce inflammation, pain, stiffness, anxiety, and fatigue. The increased circulation also helps promote cellular repair, connective tissue formation (such as collagen), and the formation of new blood vessels in the tissue, which improves long-term circulation in the area. Taoists developed Cupping. Many Taoists believe that Cupping promotes the flow of \"Qi\", balancing Yin and Yang, or the positive and negative forces, in the body. There are different versions of the cups. Some use flame to heat the cup and generate negative pressure as the cup cools, some use a vacuum pump to achieve the negative pressure, etc. The cups we use are made of medical-grade silicone and gently achieve suction without the use of pumps or flame.
