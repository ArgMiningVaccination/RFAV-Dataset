ATTACHMENT A STATE REGISTER NOTICE OF PROPOSED REGULATION FOR REGULATION 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards June 7, 2018 Document No. _____ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL CHAPTER 61 Statutory Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48-1-10 et seq. 61-62. Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards. Preamble: 1. Pursuant to the South Carolina Pollution Control Ac t, 1976 Code Sections 48-1-10 et seq., and the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 7410, 7413, and 7416, the Department must ensure national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards are achieved and maintained in South Carolina. No state may adopt or enforce an emission standard or limitation less st ringent than these federal standards or limitations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 7416. 2. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgates amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) throughout each calendar year. Recent fe deral amendments to 40 CFR Parts 60, 61, and 63 include revisions to New Source Performan ce Standards (NSPS) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7411; federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412; and federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories mandated by 42 U.S.C Section 7412. 3. The Department proposes to am end Regulation 61-62.60, South Carolina Designated Facility Plan and New Source Performance Standards; Regulation 61-62 .61, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Regulation 61-62.63, National Emission St andards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories; and the South Carolina State Im plementation Plan (SIP), to adopt the federal amendments to these standards promulgated from Jan uary 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017. 4. The Department proposes changes to Regulation 61 -62.68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, which include corrections for internal consistency, cl arification, chemical nomenclature, codification, and spelling to improve the overall text as necessary. 5. Regulation 61-62.96, Nitrogen Oxides (NO X) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO 2) Budget Trading Program, is based on the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) . CAIR has been replaced by the federal Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Trading Program, adopted by the Department as Regulation 61-62.97 on August 25, 2017. As a result, federal CAIR require ments implemented by Regulation 61-62.96 have sunsetted and are no longer in effect. The Departme nt, therefore, proposes repealing Regulation 61-62.96 in its entirety. 6. The Department also proposes other changes to Re gulation 61-62 that include corrections for internal consistency, clarification, referenc e, punctuation, codifi cation, formatting, and spelling to improve the overall text of Regulation 61-62 as necessary. 7. South Carolina industries are already subject to th ese national air quality standards as a matter of federal law. Thus, there will be no increased cost to the stat e or its political subdivisions resulting from codification of these amendments to federal law. South Carolina is already reaping the environmental benefits of these amendments. There also will be no increased cost to the state or its political subdivisions as a result of the repeal of Regulation 61-62.96, which reflects the sunsetting of federal CAIR regulations. 8. In accordance with S.C. Code Section 1-23-120(H) (Supp. 2017), legislative review is not required because the Department proposes promulgating the amendm ents to maintain compliance with federal law. As such, neither a preliminary assessment report nor a preliminary fiscal impact statement is required. 9. The Department had a Notice of Drafting pub lished in the March 23, 2018, State Register.

The Department, therefore, proposes amending the aforementioned regula tions and SIP to codify federal amendments to these standards promulgated from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 201 7. Additionally, the Department proposes repealing R.61-62.96 due to sunse tted requirements no longer in effect and replaced by R.61-97. The Department also proposes corrections to R.61-62.68 for internal consistency, clarification, chemical nomenclature, codification, and spe lling to improve the overall text as necessary. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48-1-10 et seq ., and the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 7410, 7413, and 7416. Plan for Implementation: The proposed amendments will take effect upon approval by the Board of Health and Environmental Control and publication in the State Register. These requirements are in place at the federal level and are currently being implemented. Th e proposed amendments will be implemented in South Carolina by providing the regulated community with copies of the regulation, publishing associated information on the Department's website at h ttp://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/, sending an email to stakeholders, and communicating with affected f acilities during the permitting process. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONAB LENESS OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The EPA promulgates amendments to its air quality regulations throughout each calendar year. Federal amendments in 2017 included revised NSPS rules, N ESHAPs, and NESHAPs for Source Categories. States are mandated by law to adopt these federal amendments . These amendments are reasonable as they promote consistency and ensure compliance with both state a nd federal regulations. The proposed amendments also serve to repeal a regulation that is no longer in for ce, based on the sunsetting of federal CAIR requirements. The proposed amendments also include corrections fo r internal consistency, clarification, chemical nomenclature, codification, and spelling to improve th e overall text as necessary to ensure compliance with federal law. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: There is no anticipated increase in costs to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from these proposed revisions. The standards to be adopted are al ready in effect and applicable to the regulated community as a matter of federal law, thus the amendments do not present a new cost to the regulated community. The proposed amendments incorporate th e revisions to the EPA regulations, which the Department implements pursuant to the authority gran ted by Section 48-1-50 of the Pollution Control Act. The proposed amendments will benefit the regulated community by clarifying and updating the regulations and increasing their ease of use. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates relative to the costs to the state or its political subdivisions. EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: Adoption of the recent changes in federal regulations through the proposed amendments to Regulation 61- 62 will provide continued protection of the environment and public hea lth. Repeal of Regulation 61-62.96 has no detrimental effect on the environment and public health because the federal rule it was promulgated to satisfy, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, has sunsette d and is superseded by the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. South Carolina's Regulation 61-62.97, Cross-Stat e Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Trading Program, is already state-effective. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: The state's authority to implement federal requirement s, which are beneficial to the public health and environment, would be compromised if these ame ndments were not adopted in South Carolina.

The South Carolina trading budget for annual allocations of CAIR NO X allowances for the control periods in 2009 through 2014 is 32,662 tons, and in 2015 and thereafter is 27,219 tons. Section 96.141 Timing Requirements for CAIR NO X Allowance Allocations . (a) By April 30, 2007, the Department will submit to the Administrator the CAIR NO X allowance allocations, in a format prescribed by the Administra tor and in accordance with Section 96.142(a) and (b), for the control periods in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. (b) By October 31, 2009, and October 31 of every fourth year thereafter, the Department will submit to the Administrator the CAIR NO X allowance allocations, in a format prescribed by the Administrator and in accordance with Sections 96.142(a) and (b), for the control periods in th e fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh years after the year of the applicable d eadline for submission under this paragraph. (c) By October 31, 2009, and Oct ober 31 of each year thereafter, the Department will submit to the Administrator the CAIR NO X allowance allocations for new units fr om the new unit set-aside account, in a format prescribed by the Administrato r and in accordance with Section 96.142 (a), (c), and (d) for the control period in the year of the applicable dead line for submission under this paragraph. Section 96.142 CAIR NO X Allowance Allocations. (a) (1) The baseline heat input (in million metric Br itish thermal units (mmBtu)) used with respect to CAIR NO X allowance allocations for each CAIR NO X unit will be: (i) The allowances allocated for the year s 2009 through 2012 will be determined using the unit's baseline heat input equal to the unit's single high est adjusted control period heat input for the years 2002 through 2005 for the control periods for which the CAIR NO X annual allowance allocation is being calculated, with the adjusted control period h eat input for each year calculated as follows: (A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 1.0 (100 percent); or (B) If the unit is not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 0.60 (60 percent). (ii) For a CAIR NO X allowance allocation under Section 96.141(b), the allowances will be determined using the unit's baseline heat input equal to the unit's single highest adjusted control period heat input for the years that are five, six, seven, and ei ght years before the first year of the control periods for which the CAIR NO X annual allowance allocation is being calcu lated with the adjusted control period heat input for each year calculated as follows: (A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 1.0 (100 percent); or (B) If the unit is not subject to paragra ph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 0.60 (60 percent). (2) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as coal-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and a unit's total tons of NO X emissions during a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 75, to the extent the unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 75 for the year, or will be based on the best available data reported to the Department for the unit, to the extent the uni t was not otherwise subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 75 for the year. Heat input data under 40 CF R 75 will be obtained from the Administrator. (b) (1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the Depart ment will allocate to all CAIR NO X units in the State that have a baseline heat input (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) a total amount of CAIR NO X allowances equal 97 percent for a control of the tons of NO X emissions in the State trading budget under Section 96.140 (except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section). (2) The Department will allocate CAIR NO X allowances to each CAIR NO X unit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in an amount determined by multiplying the total amount of CAIR NO X allowances allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by th e ratio of the baseline heat input of such CAIR NO X unit to the total amount of baseline heat input of all such CAIR NO X units in the State and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. (c) New Unit Set-aside: For each control period in 2009 and ther eafter, the Department will allocate CAIR NO X allowances to CAIR NO X units in the State that are not allocated CAIR NO X allowances under paragraph (b) of this section because the units do not ye t have a baseline heat input under paragraph (a) of this section or because the units have a baseline heat input but all CAIR NO X allowances available under paragraph (b) of this section for the control period are already allocated, in acco rdance with the following procedures: (1) The Department will establish a separate new unit set-aside for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated CAIR NO X allowances equal three percent fo r a control period of the amount of tons of NO X emissions in the State trading budget under Section 96.140. (2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NO X unit may submit to the Department a request, in a format specified by th e Department, to be allocated CAIR NO X allowances, starting with the later of the control period in 2009 or the first contro l period after the control period in which the CAIR NO X unit commences commercial operation and until the first c ontrol period for which the unit is allocated CAIR NO X allowances under paragraph (b) of this section. A separate CAIR NO X allowance allocation request for each control period for which CAIR NO X allowances are sought must be submitted on or before May 1 of such control period. (3) In a CAIR NO X allowance allocation request under para graph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated representative may request for a control period CAIR NO X allowances in an amount not exceeding the CAIR NO X unit's total tons of NO X emissions during the calendar year immediately before such control period in accordance with Subpart HH of this regulation. (4) The Department will review each CAIR NO X allowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and will allocate CAIR NO X allowances for each control period pursuant to such request as follows: (i) The Department will accept an allowance allocation request only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the Department as necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section. (ii) On or after May 1 of the control peri od, the Department will determine the sum of the CAIR NO X allowances requested (as adjusted under paragr aph (c)(4)(i) of this section) in all allowance allocation requests accepted under paragraph (c)(4 )(i) of this section for the control period. (iii) If the amount of CAIR NO X allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or equal to the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Department will allocate the amount of CAIR NO X allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) to each CAIR NO X unit covered by an allowance allo cation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. (iv) If the amount of CAIR NO X allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Department will allocate to each CAIR NO X unit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section the amount of the CAIR NO X allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), multiplied by the amount of CAIR NO X allowances in the new unit set-a side for the control period, divided by the sum determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. (v) The Department will notify each CAIR designated representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the amount of CAIR NO X allowances (if any) a llocated for the control period to the CAIR NO X unit covered by the request. (d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragr aph (c)(4) of this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NO X allowances remain in the new unit set-aside for the control period, the Department will allocate to each CAIR NO X unit that was allocated CAIR NO X allowances under paragraph (b) of this section an amount of CAIR NO X allowances equal to the total amount of such remaining unallocated CAIR NO X allowances, multiplied by the unit's allocation under pa ragraph (b) of this section, divided 97 percent for a control period the amount of tons of NO X emissions in the State trading budget under Section 96.140, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. Section 96.143 Compliance Supplement Pool. (a) In addition to the CAIR NO X allowances allocated under Section 96 .142, the Department may allocate for the control period in 2009 up to 2,600 tons of CAIR NO X allowances to CAIR NO X units in the State. These allowances are referred to as the Compliance Supplement Pool. (b) For any CAIR NO X unit in the State that achieves NO X emission reductions in 2007 and 2008 that are not necessary to comply with any state or federal emi ssions limitation applicable during such years, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may requ est early reduction credits, and allocation of CAIR NO X allowances from the compliance supplement pool unde r paragraph (a) of this section for such early reduction credits, in accordance with the following: (1) The owners and operators of such CAIR NO X units shall monitor and report the NO X emissions rate and the heat input of the unit in accordance with Part 96 subpart HH of this regulation in each control period for which early reduction credit is requested. (2) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO X unit shall submit to the Department by May 1, 2009, a request, in a format specified by the Department, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NO X allowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the sum of the amounts (in tons) of the unit's NO X emission reductions in 2007 and 20 08 that are not necessary to comply with any state or federal emissions limitation applicable during such years, de termined in accordance with Part 96 Subpart HH of this regulation. (c) For any CAIR NO X unit in the State whose compliance with the CAIR NO X emissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may request the allocation of CAIR NO X allowances from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section, in accord ance with the following: (1) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO X unit shall submit to the Department by May 1, 2009, a request, in a format specified by th e Department, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NO X allowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the minimum amount of CAIR NO X allowances necessary to remove such undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply. (2) In the request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO X unit shall demonstrate that, in the absence of allocation to the unit of the amount of CAIR NO X allowances requested, the unit's compliance with the CAIR NO X emissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period. This demonstration must include a showing that it would not be feasible for the owners and operators of the unit to: (i) Obtain a sufficient amount of electric ity from other electricity generation facilities, during the installation of control technology at the unit for compliance with the CAIR NO X emissions limitation, to prevent such undue risk; or (ii) Obtain under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, or otherwise obtain, a sufficient amount of CAIR NO X allowances to prevent such undue risk. (d) The Department will review each request under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section submitted by May 1, 2009, and will allocate CAIR NO X allowances for the control period in 2009 to CAIR NO X units in the State and covered by such request as follows: (1) Upon receipt of each such request, the Depa rtment will make any necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that the amount of the CAIR NO X allowances requested meets the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. (2) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section has an amount of CAIR NO X allowances not less than the total amount of CAIR NO X allowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) , the Department will allocate to each CAIR NO X unit covered by such requests the amount of CAIR NO X allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section). (3) If the State's compliance supplement pool unde r paragraph (a) of this section has a smaller amount of CAIR NO X allowances than the total amount of CAIR NO X allowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this sec tion), the Department will allocate CAIR NO X allowances to each CAIR NO X unit covered by such request s according to the following formula and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate: Unit's allocation = Unit's adjusted allocation \u00d7 (State's compliance supplement pool \u00f7 Total adjusted allocations for all units) Where: \"Unit's allocation\" is the amount of CAIR NO X allowances allocated to the unit from the State's compliance supplement pool. \"Unit's adjusted allocation\" is the amount of CAIR NO X allowances requested for the unit under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. \"State's compliance supplement pool\" is the amount of CAIR NO X allowances in the State's compliance supplement pool. \"Total adjusted allocations for all units\" is the sum of the amounts of allocations requested for all units under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as ad justed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (4) By November 30, 2009, the Department will determine, and submit to the Administrator, the allocations under paragraph (d)(2 ) or (3) of this section. (5) By January 1, 2010, the Administrator will r ecord the allocations under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards. Preamble: Pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"), 42 U.S.C. Sections 7401 et seq., and the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, 1976 Code Sections 48-1-10 et seq., the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") proposes ame nding South Carolina Regula tion 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the St ate Implementation Plan (\"SIP\"), as follows: 1. R.61-62.1, Definitions and General Requirements, Section II, Permit Requirements, to expand and improve consistency in la nguage regarding general and registration permits. 2. The introductory paragraph to R. 61-62.5, Standard No. 2, Ambient Air Quality Standards, to remove the sentence describing the test method for Gaseous Fluor ides to improve the accuracy and clarity of the regulation's text. 3. R.61-62.5, Standard No. 5.2, Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NO X), to update applicability and exemptions, as well as to propose corrections for inte rnal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling. 4. R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Signif icant Deterioration, to update applicability and exemptions, as well as to propose corrections for consiste ncy with federal regulations , internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling. 5. R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New So urce Review (NSR), to improve the overall clarity and structure of the regulation, as well as to propose corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctuati on, codification, and spelling. 6. R.61-62.1, Definitions and General Requirements; R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration; R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nona ttainment New Source Review (NSR); and R.61-62.70 Title V Operating Permit Program, to upda te public participation procedures. 7.

DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: Amendment of Regul ation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the South Carolina State Implementation Plan (\"SIP\"). Purpose: The proposed amendments to Regulation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, support the Department's goal of promoting and prot ecting the health of the public and the environment in a more efficient and effective manner. These amen dments expand and clarify definitions applicable to air pollution control regulations and standards; streamline permitting op tions; clarify reporting requirements; identify the nt's method; improve the re corrections for consistency, clarif ication, reference, punc tuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve th e overall text of Regulation 61-62. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48-1-10 et seq. Plan for Implementation: The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdat es/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to this proposed amendment. Additionally, printed copies are available for a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. U pon taking legal effect, Depa rtment personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendment and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONAB LENESS OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: (1) The Department propos es amending R.61-62.1, Definitions a nd General Requirements, Section II, Permit Requirements, to expand an d improve consistency in language regarding general and registration permits. (2) The Department propos es amending the introductory paragra ph to R.61-62.5, Standard No. 2, Ambient Air Quality Standards, to remove the sentence describing the test method for Gaseous Fluorides to improve the accuracy and clarity of the regulation's text. (3) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.5, Standard No. 5. 2, Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), to update applicability and exemptions, as well as to propose corrections for internal consistency, punctuation, c odification, and spelling. (4) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration, to update applicability and exemptions, as well as to propose corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling. (5) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR), to improve the overa ll clarity and structure of the regulation, as well as to propose corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctu ation, codification, and spelling. (6) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.1, Definitions and General Requirements; Regulation 61-62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significan t Deterioration; R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR); and R.61-62.70, Title V Op erating Permit Program, to update public participation procedures. The Department also proposes ot her changes to R.61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, including definitional upda tes, clarification of certain pe rmitting provisions, and other changes and additions deemed necessary, as well as corrections for internal consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve the overall text of R.61-62. In accordance with S.C. Code Section 1-23-120(A) (Supp. 2017), these amendments require General Assembly review. The intent of these amendments is to simplify, clarif y, and correct elements of the Department's air quality regulations to support the Department 's goal of promoting and protecting the health of the public and the environment in a more efficient and effective manner. There would be no detrimental effect on the environment or public health if the proposed am endments to R. 61-62 and the SIP are adopted. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: The Department does not anticipate an increase in costs to the state, its political subdivisions, or the regulated community resulting from these proposed revisions. The proposed amendments ensure consistency with Environmental Protection Agen cy (\"EPA\") regulations, which the Department implements pursuant to the authority granted by Sec tion 48-1-50 of the Pollution Control Act. The proposed amendments will benefit the regulated community by maintaining state implementation of the federal requirements, as opposed to federal implementation. Amendments to Regulation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the SIP, will help streamline state requirements related to permitting and other matters to conform to current Prevention of Significant Deterioration, New Source Review, and th e Title V Permit Program standards. These revisions may potentially save money for th e regulated community by providing clarification on exemptions, permitting, and other requirements , while continuing to ensure environmental protection. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates relative to the costs to the state or its political subdivisions. These revisions seek to provide clarity to the regulated community. EFFECT ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: The amendments to Regulation 61-62, Air Pollution C ontrol Regulations and Standards, seek to provide continued state-focused protection of the environment and public health. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: The Department does not anticipate detrimental effect on the environment and/or public health associated with these revisions. To the contrary, the state's delega ted authority to implement programs beneficial to public health and the environment may be compromi sed if these amendments are not adopted. Permit streamlining and regulatory text clarification seek to have a positive effect on both the environment and public health. Statement of Rationale: The Department proposes amending Regulation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regul ations and Standards, to support the goal of promoting and protecting the h ealth of the public and the environment in a more efficient and effective manner. These amendments expand and clarify definitions a pplicable to air pollution control regulations and standards; streamline permitting options; clar ify reporting requirements; identify the consistent notic ing method; improve the regulations' organizational structure; and provide corrections for consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve the overall text of Regulation 61-62.

Unless otherwise exempt, sources may be exempted under this section at higher emission levels if there is a demonstration that there are no applicable limits or requirement s. These applicable requirements include federally applicable limits or requirements. However, these sour ces may be required to be included in any subsequent construction or operating permit review to ensure that there is no cause or contribution to an exceedance of any ambient air quality standard or limit. For toxic ai r pollutant exemptions, refer to Regulation 61-62.5, Standard No. 8. Emissions calculations and any othe r information necessary to document qualification for this exemption must be maintained onsite and provided to the Department upon request. 3.(3) The Department will place the exempt sour ces listed in Section II.B.2.a(B)(2)(a) through B.2.g (B)(2)(g) above, and other sources that have been dete rmined will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of any state or federal standard, on a lis t of sources to be exempted without further review. The Department may develop emission thresholds fo r exemption that have been determined will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of any stat e or federal standard, to be maintained with the list of sources to be exempted without further review. This list of sources and source emission thresholds that are exempt without further review from the requirement to obtain a construction permit will be maintained by the Department and periodically published in the S outh Carolina State Register for use by the public and the regulated community. Requests to the Departme nt may be made to add sources to the list. 4.(4) Sources with only fugitive em issions must submit source informa tion, and the need for permit(s) will be made by the Department on a case-by-case basis. This determination will ta ke into consideration, but will not be limited to, the nature and amount of the pollutants, location, proximity to residences and commercial establishments, etc. 5.(5) Sources of VOCs greater than 1000 lbs/month may not require a permit. This determination will take into consideration, but will not be limited to, applicability to state and federal requirements. No waiver will be permissible if federal requirements apply unl ess otherwise exempt. Emissions calculations and any other information necessary to docume nt qualification for this exemption and the need for permit(s) will be made by the Department on a case-by-case basis. Exempt sources of VOCs may be required to be included in any subsequent construction or op erating permit review to ensure that there is no cause or contribution to an exceedance of any ambient air quality standard or limit. 6.(6) Requests for exemption from the requirement to obtain a construction permit, for new sources similar to sources already on the Department maintained list established in Section II.B.3(B)(3) above, or for modifications to existing equipment, including th e reconstruction, relocation, and replacement of existing equipment, which may qualify for exemption as per Section II.B.2.h(B)(2)(h) and Section II.B.4 (B)(4) above, shall include the following information: a.(a) A complete description of the exis ting equipment and pro posed modification; b.(b) The pollutant(s) being emitted and any devi ation from the parameters provided in earlier permit applications, permit exemp tions, and issued permits; c.(c) Any ambient air quality demonstrations need ed for Regulation 61-62.5, Standards No. 2, No. 7, and No. 8; and d.(d) A regulatory review to demonstrate the proj ect is not a CAA Title I modification nor subject to Regulation 61-62.5, Standards No. 7 and No. 7.1. 7.(7) The construction permitting exemptions in Secti on II.B(B) do not relieve the owner or operator of any source from any obligation to co mply with any other applicable re quirements. The Department reserves the right to require a construction permit, and the need for permit(s) will be made by the Department on a case-by-case basis. This determination will take into c onsideration, but will not be limited to, the nature and amount of the pollutants, location, proximity to residences and commercial establishments, etc. C.(C) Construction Permit Applications 1.(1) Construction permit applications shall be reviewed, and signed, and sealed by a professional engineer registered to practice in the State of So uth Carolina (except professional engineers employed by the federal government preparing a pplications for the federal governm ent or other professional engineers exempted from the state registration requirements). 2.(2) The following are exempt from the requireme nt that the construction permit applications be reviewed, and signed, and sealed by a registered professional engineer provided the proposed unit is identical to a prototype model which has been prev iously designed or otherwise certified by a professional engineer: a.(a) Package-type incinerators of 750 lb/hr rate d capacity or smaller which burn Types 0 and 1 wastes as defined by the Incinerator Institute of America; b.(b) Package-type incinerators of 500 lb/hr ra ted capacity or smaller which burn animal remains excluding those remains that are c onsidered infectious waste; and c.(c) Package-type boilers of 100 x 106million Btu/hr input capacity or smaller which burn natural gas or virgin oil as fuel.; and (d) Package-type concrete batch plants that are de signed to be hauled to a site, set up, and broken down quickly, with little to no additional equi pment needed to manufacture product. 3.(3) Construction permit appli cations shall provide the informa tion described in Section II.C.3.a (C)(3)(a) through C.3.p(C)(3)(r).

The Department shall grant a registration permit to sour ces certifying qualification for and agreeing to the conditions and terms of the registration permit applicable to similar sources. (b) The Department also may grant coverage unde r the conditions and terms of a registration permit to sources that have not requested coverage under a regi stration permit, but which are determined to qualify for the registration permit applicable to similar sour ces. Whether such a source will be permitted under an individual permit or under the registra tion permit applicable to similar sources will be within the sole discretion of the Department. b.(c) The source shall be subject to enforcemen t action for operation without a valid permit if the source is later determined not to qualify for the conditions and terms of coverage u nder a registration permit. (d) The Department reserves the right to re quire a construction and/ or operating permit; the requirement for a permit(s) will be made by the De partment on a case-by-case basis. This determination will take into consideration, but ma y not be limited to, the nature and amount of the pollutants, location, and proximity to residences and commercial establishments. c.(e) The Department may grant a source's requ est for authorization to operate under a registration permit, but such a grant shall be a final permit action for purposes of judicial review. (f) A source that qualifies for coverage under a De partment issued registration permit may submit a permit application to the Department and request an i ndividual permit in lieu of coverage under a general registration permit. 3.(3) Registration Permit Conditions a.(a) Registration permits shall contain any applicab le permit conditions listed in Section II. J(J) below as the Department finds appropriate. b.(b) Registration permits shall contain any appli cable special permit conditions required to verify a source's compliance with any emissions limitations and operational requirements. 4.(4) Any registration permit may be reopened by the Department for cause or to include any new standard or regulation which becomes applicab le to a source during the life of the permit. (J)J. Permit Conditions 1.(1) Standard Permit Conditions All construction and operating permits shall contain the follo wing standard permit conditions. a.(a) No applicable law, regulati on, or standard will be contravened. b.(b) All official correspondence, plans, permit app lications, and written statements are an integral part of the permit. Any false information or misrepresentati on in the application for a construction or operating permit may be grounds fo r permit revocation. c.(c) For sources not required to have continuous emission monitors, any malfunction of air pollution control equipment or system, process upset, or other equipment failure which results in discharges of air contaminants lasting for one (1) hour or more and which are greater than tho se discharges described for normal operation in the permit application, shall be re ported to the Department within twenty-four (24) hours after the beginning of the occurrence and a written report shall be submitted to the Department within thirty (30) days. The written report shall include, at a minimum, the following: i.(i) The identity of the stack and/or em ission point where the excess emissions occurred; ii.(ii) The magnitude of the excess emissions expressed in the units of the applicable emission limitation and the operating data and calculati ons used in determining the excess emissions; iii.(iii) The time and duration of the excess emissions; iv.(iv) The identity of the equipment causing the excess emissions; v.(v) The nature and cause of such excess emissions; vi.(vi) The steps taken to remedy the malfunc tion and the steps taken or planned to prevent the recurrence of such malfunction; vii.(vii) The steps taken to limit the excess emissions; and viii.(viii) Documentation that the air pollutio n control equipment, process equipment, or processes were at all times maintained and operated, to the maxi mum extent practicable, in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions. d.(d) Sources required to have continuous emissi on monitors shall submit reports as specified in applicable parts of the permit, law, regulations, or standards. e.(e) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this regulati on or with the terms of any approval to construct, or who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be s ubject to enforcement action. f.(f) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months after receipt of such approva l, if construction is discontinued fo r a period of eighteen (18) months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Department may extend the 18- month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extens ion is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approve d phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within eighteen (18) m onths of the projected and approved commencement date. g.(g) A copy of the Department issued construc tion and/or operating permit must be kept readily available at the facility at all times.

For the purpose of determining comp liance, permit limitations will, in general, not exceed one (1) month and shall not exceed an annual limit with a rolling monthly average or sum. d.(d) An owner or operator of stationary sources that desires or is required to conduct performance tests to verify emissions limitations shall ensure that source tests are conducted in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 61-62.1, Section IV, Source Tests. e.(e) An hourly emission limit shall be sufficient onl y if the permit condition(s) require the installation, calibration, maintenance, and operation of a CEMS or any other monitoring approved by the Department. All monitoring data shall be defined and recorded for showing compliance with the emission limit(s). f.(f) The limitations and requirements listed in the permit conditions shall be permanent, quantifiable, or otherwise enforceable as a practical matter. K.(K) Exceptions 1.(1) Upon request, the Department may alter operating permits, compliance schedules, or other restrictions on operation of a source provided that resulting ambient air c oncentration levels will not exceed any national or state ambient air quality standard. Factor s to be considered by the Department may include, but are not limited to, technology, economics, national energy policy, and existing air quality. The request by the source must also show the following: a.(a) Good faith efforts have been made to comply with the state requirements; b.(b) The source is unable to comply with the state requirements because the necessary technology or other alternative methods of control are not reasonably available or have not been available for a sufficient period of time; c.(c) Any available operating procedures or cont rol measures reducing the impact of the source on ambient air concentrations have been implemented; and d.(d) The request is submitted in a timely manner. 2.(2) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to mass emission limits which are imposed upon any source by the following requirements: a.(a) Federal New Source Performance Standards (NSPS); b.(b) National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP); c.(c) Federal or State Prevention of Sign ificant Deterioration (PSD) Regulations; or d.(d) Nonattainment requirements. 3.(3) Where a permanent increase in the visible emission limitation for a source is requested, the source must demonstrate that it will remain in compliance with the applicable particulate emission standard. 4.(4) Any alternative compliance sch edule shall provide for compliance with the applicable regulations as expeditiously as practicable based on a plan subm itted with the request for the alternative compliance schedule. 5.(5) Any request under this section will be subject ed to public notice and opportunity for a public hearing. Upon approval by the Boar d, the recommendations of this Department shall be sent to the Administrator, or his designated representative, for approval or disapproval. 6.(6) Where alternative compliance schedule provisi ons are contained elsewhere in the air pollution control regulations, those provisions shall s upersede the requirements in this section. L.(L) Emergency Provisions 1.(1) An \"emergency\" means any situation aris ing from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, in which a situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to exceed a technology-based emission limitation under the permit due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error. 2.(2) An emergency may be documented through pr operly signed, contemporaneous operating logs and other relevant evidence that verify: a.(a) An emergency occurred and the owner or ope rator can identify the cause(s) of the emergency; b.(b) The permitted source was, at the time the emergency occurred, being properly operated; c.(c) During the period of the emergency, the owne r or operator took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission st andards or other requirements in the permit; and d.(d) The owner or operator gave a verbal notif ication of the emergency to the Department within twenty-four (24) hours of the time when emission limitations were exceeded, followed by a written report within thirty (30) days.

The written report shall contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigat e emissions, and corrective actions taken. 3.(3) This provision is in addition to any emerge ncy or upset provision contained in any applicable requirement. M.(M) Transfer of Ownership/Operation Within thirty (30) days of the transfer of owners hip/operation of a facility, the current permit holder and prospective new owner/operator shall submit to the Depa rtment a written request for transfer of the source operating or construction permit(s). Th e written request for transfer of the source operating or construction permit(s) shall include any changes pertaining to the facility name; the name, mailing address, and telephone number of the owner or operator for the facility; and any proposed changes to the permitted activities of the source. Transfer of the operating or construction permit(s) will be effective upon written approval by the Department. N.(N) Public Participation Procedures 1.(1) When determined to be appropriate by the Department (or specified by regulation), notice of permitting activity shall be provided to the public and other entities for their review and comment. Public notice shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the source is located, or by posting on to a public website identified by the Department's website, or by publication in the South Carolina State Register, and to persons on a mailing list developed by the Department, including those who request in writing to be on the list. Th e Department may use otheradditional means of public notice, including, but not limited to public meetings. 2.(2) The notice shall include the following: a.(a) The name and physical address of the facility; b.(b) The name and address of the Department; c.(c) Applicable activities involved in the permit action; d.(d) Applicable emission change involved in any permit modification; e.(e) The name, address, and telephone number of a person from whom interested persons may obtain additional information, including copies of the permit draf t, the application, and all other materials available to the Department that are relevant to the permit decision, except for information entitled to confidential treatment (the contents of any proposed or draft pe rmit shall not be treated as confidential information); f.(f) A brief description of the comment procedures; and g.(g) The time and place of any public hearing that may be held, including a statement of procedures to request a hearing (unless a hear ing has already been scheduled). 3.(3) The Department shall provide at least thirty (30) days for public and EPA comment and shall give notice of any public hearing at least thirty (30) days in advance of the hearing. a.(a) The Department shall keep a record of the commenters and the comments made during the public comment period. b.(b) The Department shall consider all written comments submitted within a time specified in the notice of public comment and all comments received at any public hearing(s) in making a final decision on the approvability of the application. 4.(4) A newly constructed or modified source issued a federally enforceable final construction permit will not require an additional public comment period a nd/or hearing to obtain an operating permit, unless the source proposes a change in the original construction and/or operational plan, prior to commencing construction, which the Department determines would require an add itional public comment period and/or hearing. 5.(5) Any proposed new or modified stationary s ource required to undergo a public comment period shall not commence any construction until all public participa tion procedures of this section are completed, and the source has received an effective construction permit from the Department. (6)6. Maintenance activities, repairs, and replacement s which the Department determines to be routine for that source category shall not, by themselves, be re quired to undergo the public participation procedures of Section II. N(N). (O)O. Inspection and Entry Upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the owner or operator shall allow the Department or an authori zed representative to perform the following: 1.(1) Enter the facility where emissions-related activi ty is conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of the permit; 2.(2) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit; 3.(3) Inspect any facilities, equipment (includi ng monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under this permit; and 4.(4) As authorized by the Clean Air Act and/or the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, sample or monitor, at reasonable times, substances or parame ters for the purpose of assuring compliance with the permit or applicable requirements. SECTION III - EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND EMISSIONS STATEMENTS A.(A) General 1.(1) An emissions inventory is a study or compilation of pollutant emissions. The purposes of emissions inventories are to locate air pollution sources, to define the type and size of sources, to define the type and amount of emissions from each source, to determine pol lutant frequency and duration, to determine the relative contributions to air pollution from classes of sources and of individual sources, to provide a basis for air permit fees, and to determine the adequacy of regulations and standards. The requirements of this section notwithstanding, an emissions inve ntory may be required from any source at any time. 2.(2) An emissions statement is a less detailed statement which focuses on emissions estimates for pollutants associated with a nonattainment designation. B.(B) Emissions Inventory Reporting Requirements 1.(1) Beginning with the effective date of this re gulation, sources must submit an emissions inventory for the previous calendar year by Ma rch 31 at a frequency as outlined below: a.(a) Type A Sources are Title V Sources with annual emissions greater than or equal to any of the emission thresholds listed for Type A Sources in Tabl e 1 below. Type A Sources must submit an emissions inventory every year. Table 1 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutants Type A Sources: Annual Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 SO X 2500 Potential VOC 250 Potential NO X 2500 Potential CO 2500 Potential Pb 0.502 Actual PM 10 250 Potential PM 2.5 250 Potential NH 3 250 Potential 1 Tons per year (tpy) potential to emit m eans the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restricti ons on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, will be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the Admi nistrator and included in the source's permit prior to the end of the reporting year. 2 The EPA considers that the ambient monitoring rule threshold is 0.5 tons of actual emissions; therefore, this criterion is based on actual emissions rather than the potential- to-emit approach taken for other criteri a pollutant and precursor thresholds. b.(b) All other Title V Sources with annual emissions less than the emission thresholds listed for Type A Sources in Table 1 above must submit emissions invent ories every three (3) years beginning with calendar year 2014 data. c.(c) Nonattainment area (NAA) Sources are sources located in a NAA with annual emissions during any year of the three (3) year cycle greater than or e qual to any of the emission thresholds listed for NAA Sources in Table 2 below. These sources that are not also Type A Sources must submit emissions inventories every three (3) years beginning with calendar year 2014 data. Table 2 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutant NAA3 Sources: Three-year Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 SO X 100 Potential VOC 100 (moderate O 3 NAA ) Potential 50 (serious O 3 NAA) 25 (severe O 3 NAA) 10 (extreme O 3 NAA) NO X 100 (all O 3 NAA) Potential CO 100 (all O 3 NAA)Potential 100 (all CO NAA) Pb 0.50 Actual PM 10 100 (moderate PM 10 NAA)Potential 70 (serious PM 10 NAA) PM 2.5 100 Potential NH 3 100 Potential 1 Tons per year (tpy) potential to emit m eans the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restricti ons on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, will be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the Administrator and included in the source's permit prior to the end of the reporting year. 2 The EPA considers that the ambient monitoring ru le threshold is 0.5 tons of actual emissions; therefore, this criterion is based on actual emissi ons rather than the potential-to-emit approach taken for other criteria pollutant and precursor thresholds. 3 Special point source reporting thresholds appl y for certain pollutants by type of NAA. The pollutants by nonattainment area are: Ozone: VOC, NO X, and CO; Carbon Monoxide: CO; and Particulate matter less than 10 microns: PM 10. 2.(2) Other Requirements a.(a) Unless otherwise indicated, all emissions i nventories must be submitted to the Department by March 31 following the year of inventory. All applicable information must be recorded in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department. b.(b) All newly permitted and c onstructed Title V Sources which have obtained or are in the process of obtaining a Title V permit and all newly perm itted and constructed NAA Sources must complete and submit to the Department an initial emissions invent ory for the source's first partial calendar year of operation and an emissions inventory for the s ource's first full calendar year of operation. i.(i) The partial year emissions inventory must be submitted to the Department no later than March 31 of the year following the source's partial year of operation and must include an emissions inventory from the source's operation start date th rough December 31 of the same year. ii.(ii) The first full calendar year emissions inve ntory must be submitted to the Department by March 31 of the year following the source's first calendar year of operation. iii.(iii) Sources must submit future emissions inventories on the schedule as described in paragraph B.1.a(B)(1)(a), paragraph B.1.b(B)(1)(b), a nd paragraph B.1.c(B)(1)(c) of this section. c.(c) Any existing sources that are determined by the Department to be subj ect to Regulation 61-62.70, Title V Operating Permit Program, and/or NAA Sources must complete and submit to the Department an emissions inventory for the previous calendar year w ithin ninety (90) days. These sources must then submit future emissions inventories on the schedule as d escribed in paragraph B.1.a(B)(1)(a), paragraph B.1.b(B)(1)(b), and paragraph B.1.c(B)(1)(c) of this section. d.(d) Submittal of emissions inventories outside of the schedules in this section will be accepted and reviewed only if a modification has occurred that requi red issuance of an air quality permit since the last emissions inventory submittal by the source. This modi fication must alter the quantity or character of the source's emissions. These sources may submit a new emi ssions inventory following the first full calendar year of operation after the modification. These sources must then submit future emissions inventories on the schedule described in paragrap h B.1.a(B)(1)(a), paragraph B.1. b(B)(1)(b), and paragraph B.1.c (B)(1)(c) of this section. e.(e) Information required in an emissions invent ory submittal to the Department must include the following: i.(i) Information on fuel burning equipment; ii.(ii) Types and fuel used; Exhaust parameters; v.(v) Raw process materials and quantities used; vii.(vii) Design, normal, and actual process rates; viii.(viii) Hours of operation; ix.(ix) Significant emission generating points or processes as discussed in the current format for reporting emissions data pr ovided by the Department; x.(x) Any desired information listed in 40 CF R Part 51 Subpart A (December 17, 2008) that is requested by the Department; xi.(xi) Emissions data from all regulated pollutants; and xii.(xii) Any additional info rmation reasonably relate d to determining if emissions from an air source are causing standards of air quality to be exceeded. f.(f) A source may submit a written request to the Department for approval of an alternate method for estimating emissions outside of those methods prescr ibed by the Department. Such requests will be reviewed by the Department's emissions inventory st aff on a case-by-case basis to determine if the alternate method better characterizes actual emissions for the reporting period than the Department's prescribed methods. g.(g) Emission estimates from insignificant activiti es listed on a source's permit are required only in the initial emissions inventory subm itted by the source. If emissions from these insignificant activities have not been included in a past emissions inventory subm itted to the Department, the source must include these emissions in their next required emissions inventory submittal. h.(h) Copies of all records and reports relating to emissions inventories as required in this section must be retained by the owner/operator at the source for a minimum of five (5) years. C.(C) Emissions Statement Requirements 1.(1) Sources in areas designated nonattainment for an ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) must submit to the Department by March 31 for the previous calendar year an emissions statement which includes emissions estimat es for both VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NO X) beginning with the effective date of this regulation. 2.(2) The statement must contain a certification that the information contained in the statement is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. 3.(3) All applicable information must be recorded in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department. 4.(4) Copies of all records and reports relating to emi ssions statements as required in this section must be retained by the owner or operator at th e source for a minimum of five (5) years. SECTION IV - SOURCE TESTS A.(A) Applicability 1.(1) This section shall apply to the owner, opera tor, or representative of any source which conducts: a.(a) A source test required under an applicable st andard or permit condition; or pursuant to a judicial or administrative order, consent agreement, or any other such binding requirement entered into after the effective date of this standard; or b.(b) Any other source test from which data w ill be submitted to the Department for any purpose including but not limited to: determination of applic ability of regulatory requirements, development of emission factors, establishment of parameters for co mpliance assurance monitoring, continuous emission monitor performance specification testing, a nd Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA). 2.(2) The Department may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt from the requirements of this section source tests which are performed for development of emissi on factors or for determination of applicability of regulations. B.(B) Submission and Approval of a Site-Specific Test Plan 1.(1) Prior to conducting a source test subject to this section, the owner, operator, or representative shall ensure that: a.(a) A written site-specific test plan, including all of the information required in Section IV.

Telephone notification shall include a description of the circumstance(s) causing the cancella tion of the test, and a projected retest date. The written follow-up report shall include a description of th e condition(s) which prevented the source test from being conducted, and when applicable, what correctiv e action was performed, or what equipment repairs were required. 3.(3) Rescheduling of canceled source tests must meet the two-week notice requirement. However, shorter notification periods may be allo wed subject to Department approval. 4.(4) All tests shall be conducted by or under the direction of a person qualified by training and/or experience in the field of air pollution testing or, where required by federal regulation, meeting the minimum competency requirements for air emissions testing as specified in ASTM D7036-04, Standard Practice for Competence of Air Emission Testing Bodies. 5.(5) Unless approved otherwise by the Department, the owner, operator, or representative shall ensure that source tests are conducted while the source is ope rating at the maximum expected production rate or other production rate or operating parameter which would result in the highest emissions for the pollutants being tested or as otherwise specified in a relevant federal or state requirement. Examples of the operating parameters that may affect emission rates are: type an d composition of raw materials and fuels, isolation of control equipment modules, product types and dimens ions, thermal oxidizer combustion temperature, atypical control equipment settings, etc. Some sources may have to spike fuels or raw materials to avoid being permitted at a more restrictive feed or process rate. Any source test performed at a production rate less than the rated capacity may result in permit limits on emission rates, including limits on production if necessary. 6.(6) When conducting a source test subject to this section, the owner, operator, or representative of a source shall provide the following: a.(a) Department access to the facility to observe source tests; b.(b) Sampling ports adequate for test methods; c.(c) Safe sampling site(s); d.(d) Safe access to sampling site(s); e.(e) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment; and f.(f) Equipment and supplies necessary for safe testing of a source. E.(E) Source Test Method Performance Audit Program 1.(1) The Department may request that samples collected during any source tests be split with the Department for analysis by an independent or Depart ment laboratory. Any request for split samples will be made in advance of the source test. 2.(2) Performance testing shall include a test met hod performance audit (PA) during the performance test if a PA sample is commercially available. a.(a) PAs consist of blind audit samples supplie d by an accredited audit sample provider (AASP) and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. b.(b) An \"accredited audit sample provider (AASP) \" is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an indepe ndent, third party accrediting body. 3.(3) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. a.(a) No audit samples are required for the follo wing test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of of 40 CFR Part Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of Appendix A-4 of 40 CFR Part 60; Method 18 of Appendix A-6 of 40 CFR Part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of Appendix A-7 of 40 CFR Part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 63. b.(b) If multiple sources at a single facility are t ested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. c.(c) Upon request, the Department may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if the Department determines that an audit sample is not necessary. A waiver of the performance audit requirements to conduct a PA for a particular sour ce does not constitute a waiver of performance audit requirements for future source tests. d.(d) \"Commercially available\" means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm whether th ere is an AASP that can supply an audit sample for that method. e.(e) If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be re quired to include an audit sample as part of the quality assura nce program for the compliance test. f.(f) When ordering an audit sample, the source, operator, or representative shall give the AASP an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the Department. g.(g) The source owner, operator, or representativ e shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the a udited pollutant to the Department and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or sh all report to the Department first and then report to the AASP. h.(h) If the method being audited is a method that a llows the samples to be an alyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the Department is present at the testing site. The source owner, operator, or representative may request in the test protocol a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the Department must be presen t at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. i.(i) The final test report shall document any attempt to obtain an audit sample and, if an audit sample was ordered and utilized, the p ass/fail results as applicable. 4.(4) The Department shall have discretion to requi re any subsequent remedial actions of the owner, operator, or representative based on the split samples and/or performance audit results. F.(F) Final Source Test Report 1.(1) The owner, operator, or representative of a source subject to this section shall submit a written report of the final source test results to the Depart ment by the close of business on the 30th day following the completion of the test, unless an alternative date has been requested in an d approved with the site- specific test plan prior to testing or is otherwise speci fied in a relevant federal or state standardrequirement. 2.(2) The final test report for each site-specific test plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following supporting information when applicable: a.(a) Summary of the results; b.(b) Emission calculations and emission rates in un its of the applicable standard, permit limit, etc.; c.(c) Allowable emission rates in units of the applicable standard, permit limit, etc.; d.(d) Source compliance status; e.(e) Process operating rates; f.(f) Methods including actual calculations, equations, and other related information that were used to demonstrate and verify the operating rate during the source test; g.(g) Chain of custody records; h.(h) Certification of all reference standards used; i.(i) Signature of a responsible facility repr esentative who can verify process operating rates and parameters; j.(j) Legible copies of all raw laboratory data (fo r example, filter tare and final weights, titrations, chromatograms, spectrograms, analyzer measurements, etc.); k.(k) Legible copies of all raw field data (for exam ple, strip charts, field data forms, field calibration forms, etc.); l.(l) Legible copies of applicable stack gas or opacity monitoring system re adings identified in the approved site-specific test plan; m.(m) Legible copies of all applicable process a nd air pollution control operating parameter readings identified in the approved site-specific test plan; n.(n) Results of all calibrations and QA/QC me asures and checks identified in the approved site- specific test plan; o.(o) Results of performance audits pursuant to S ection IV. E(E) above or documentation that no audit sample was commercially available 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test; p.(p) Description of any deviations from the proposed process operations as approved in the site- specific test plan during testing; q.(q) Description of any deviations from approved sampling methods/procedures; r.(r) Description of any deviations from approved analytical procedures; s.(s) Description of any problems encountered dur ing sampling and analysis, and explanation of how each was resolved; and t.(t) Legible copies of any applicable or required certifications (for example, Visible Emission Observer, Qualified Source Testing Individual (QSTI), etc.). G.(G) Noncompliant Results Within fifteen (15) days of submission of a test re port indicating noncompliance, the owner, operator, or representative shall submit to the Department a written plan which includes at a minimum: 1.(1) Interim actions being taken to minimize emissions pending demonstration of compliance; 2.(2) Corrective actions that have been taken or that are proposed to return the source to compliance; 3.(3) Method that will be used to demonstrate the source has returned to compliance (for example, retest and proposed date); and 4.(4) Any changes necessary to update the site-specific test plan prior to a retest. H.(H) Analytical Observation Upon request by the Department, the owner, operator, representative, or the source test consultant shall ensure that Department representatives are provided acces s to the analytical laboratory for observation of instrument calibrations and analysis of field and audit samples. I.(I) Site Inspection Upon request by the Department and prior to approval of the site-speci fic test plan, the owner, operator, or representative shall ensure Department representati ves are provided access to the site for inspection of the source(s) to be tested. J.(J) Modifications Modifications to the approved site-specific test pl an must have prior Depa rtment approval. Approval shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. Failure to obtain prior Department approval may cause final test results to be unacceptable. SECTION V - CREDIBLE EVIDENCE A.(A) The Department promulgated Regulation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and developed the South Carolina Air Qu ality Implementation Plan to provide enforceable emission limitations; to establish an adequate enforcement program; to require owners or operators of st ationary sources to monitor emissions, submit periodic re ports of such emissions, a nd maintain records as specif ied by various regulations and permits; and to evaluate reports and records for consistency with the applicable emission limitation or standard on a continuing basis over ti me. The monitoring data collected a nd records of operations would serve as the basis for a source to certify compliance, and could be used by the Department as direct evidence of an enforceable violation of the underlyi ng emission limitation or standard. B.(B) The purpose of this section is: 1.(1) To clarify the statutory authority of Re gulation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the South Carolina Air Quality Implem entation Plan, whereby non-re ference test data and various kinds of information already available and utilized for other pur poses may be used to demonstrate compliance or noncompliance with emission standards; 2.(2) To eliminate any potential ambiguity regardin g language that has been interpreted to provide for exclusive reliance on referenc e test methods as the means of certify ing compliance with various emission limits; and 3.(3) To curtail language that limits the types of testing or monitoring data that may be used for determining compliance and for establishing violations. C.(C) The following are applicable in the determina tion of noncompliance by the Department or for compliance certification by the owners or operators of stationary sources: 1.(1) Enforcement - Consistent with South Caro lina's Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act, codified as S.C. Code Ann. Sec tions 48-57-10 et seq., and notwithstanding any other provision in the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan, any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source would have been in comp liance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any standard in the plan; and 2.(2) Compliance Certifications - Consistent with South Carolina's Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act, codified as S.C. Code A nn. Sections 48-57-10 et seq., and notwithstanding any other provision in the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan, the owner or operator may use any credible evidence or information relevant to whet her a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performan ce or compliance test had been performed for the purpose of submitting compliance certifications.

No. 2872), June 25, 2004; Vol. 31, Issue No. 5, (Doc. No. 3069), May 25, 2007; Vol. 36, Issue No. 12, (Errata), December 28, 2012; Vol. 40, Issue No. 6, (Doc. No. 4590), June 24, 2016. 61-62.5. Standard No. 7. Prevention of Significant Deterioration. (a)(A)(1) Reserved. (2) Applicability procedures. (i)(a) The requirements of this regulation apply to the construction of any ne w major stationary source (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(32)) or any project at an existing major stationary source in an area designated as attainment or unclassifiable unde r 40 Code of Federal Re gulations (CFR) (ii)(b) The requirements of (r)(R) apply to the cons truction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any ex isting major stationary source, except as this section otherwise provides. (iii)(c) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requirements of paragraphs (j)(J) through (r)(R)(5) apply shall begin actual construc tion without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet t hose requirements. The Department has authority to issue any such permit. (iv)(d) The requirements of the program will be applied in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(a)(A)(2)(d)(i) through (f)(A)(2)(d)(vi). (a)(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(v) and (vi) (A)(2)(e), and consistent with the definition of major modification contained in paragraph (b)(B)(30), a project is a major modification for a regulated New Source Review (NSR) pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases - a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(50)), and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (b)(B)(34) and (b)(B)(49)). The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project cau ses a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also resu lts in a significant net emissions increase. (b)(ii) The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant emissions increase (that is, the first step of the pro cess) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(c )(A)(2)(d)(iii) through (f)(A)(2)(d)(vi). The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual constructio n) whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source (that is, the second st ep of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (b)(B)(34). Regardless of any such preconstr uction projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increas e and a significant net emissions increase. (c)(iii) Actual-to-projected-actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions units. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual em issions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(41)) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(B)(4)(a) and (ii)(B)(4 )(b)), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant am ount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (d)(iv) Actual-to-potential test for projects that on ly involve construction of a new emissions unit(s). A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defi ned in paragraph (b)(B)(37)) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the b aseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(4)(c)) of these units before the project e quals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (e)(v) [Reserved] (f)(vi) Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emissions units. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is proj ected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases for each emissions unit, using the method specifie d in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(c)(A)(2)(d)(iii) and (d)(A)(2)(d)(iv) as applicable with respect to each emissi ons unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds, the significant amount for that polluta nt (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (v)(e) For any major stationary source for a Plan twide Applicability Limitation (PAL) for a regulated NSR pollutant, the major stationary source shall comply with the requirements under paragraph (aa) Section (AA). (b)(B) Definitions. For the purposes of this regulation: For the purposes of this regulation: (1)(i)(a) \"Actual emissions\" means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with para graphs (b)(1)(ii)(B)(1)(b) through (b)(1)(iv)(B)(1)(d), except that this definition shall not apply for cal culating whether a significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under paragraph (aa) Section (AA). Instead, pa ragraphs (b)(B)(41) and (b)(B)(4) shall apply for those purposes. (ii)(b) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year (tpy), at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period which precedes the particular date and which is repres entative of normal source operation. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculate d using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored , or combusted during the selected time period. (iii)(c) The Department may presume that sour ce-specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. (iv)(d) For any emissions unit that has not begu n normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (2) \"Adverse impact on visibility\" means visibility impairment which interferes with the management, protection, preservation or enjoyment of the visito r's visual experience of the Class I area. This determination must be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the geographic extent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of visibility impairme nt, and how these factors correlate with (1) times of visitor use of the Class I area, and (2) the frequency a nd timing of natural conditions that reduce visibility. (3) \"Allowable emissions\" means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following: (i)(a) The applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61; (ii)(b) The applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or (iii)(c) The emissions rate specified as a federa lly enforceable permit condition, including those with a future compliance date. (4) \"Baseline actual emissions\" means the rate of emissions, in tpy tons per year, of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in acco rdance with paragraphs (b)(4)(i )(B)(4)(a) through (iv)(B)(4)(d). (i)(a) For any existing electric utility steam ge nerating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollu tant during any consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the five (5)-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project. The Department shall allow the use of a different time pe riod upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. (a)(i) The average rate shall include fugitive em issions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (b)(ii) The average rate shall be adjusted dow nward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emi ssion limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period. (c)(iii) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A di fferent consecutive twenty-four (24 )-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (d)(iv) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determin ing annual emissions, in tpy tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (b)(4)(i)(b)(B)(4)(a)(ii). (ii)(b) For an existing emissions unit (other th an an electric utility steam generating unit), baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty-four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the ten (10)-year period immediately preceding e ither the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete pe rmit application is received by the Department for a permit required under this section or under a plan appr oved by the Administrator, whichever is earlier, except that the ten (10)-year period shall not includ e any period earlier than November 15, 1990. The Department reserves the right to determine if the twenty-four (24)-month period selected is appropriate. (a)(i) The average rate shall include fugitive em issions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (b)(ii) The average rate shall be adjusted dow nward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above an emi ssion limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period. (c)(iii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the major stationary source must currently comply, had such major stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable control technology standard that the Administrator proposed or pr omulgated under 40 CFR Part 63, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the State has taken credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan consistent w ith the requirements of 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(G). (d)(iv) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all the emissions units being changed. A different consec utive twenty-four (24)-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (e)(v) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determin ing annual emissions, in tpy tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragra phs (b)(4)(ii)(b)(B)(4)(b)(ii) and (c)(B)(4)(b)(iii). (iii)(c) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial cons truction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and thereafter, for all other purposes, sh all equal the unit's potential to emit. (iv)(d) For a PAL for a stationary source, the b aseline actual emissions shall be calculated for existing electric utility steam generating units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(4)(a), for other existing emissions units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B)(4)(b), and for a new emissions unit in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(4)(c). (5)(i)(a) \"Baseline area\" means any intrastate area (and every part thereof) designated as attainment or unclassifiable under Section 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Clean Air Act in which the major source or major modification establishing the minor source baseline date would construct or would have an air quality impact for the pollutant for which the baseline date is established, as follows: Equal to or greater than one (1) microgram(s) per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) (annual average) for SO 2, NO 2, or PM 10; or equal or greater than 0.3 \u00b5g/m3 (annual average) for PM 2.5. (ii)(b) Area redesignations under Section 107(d)(1 )(A)(ii) or 107(d)(1)(A)(iii) of the Clean Air Act cannot intersect or be smaller than the area of impact of any major stationary source or major modification which: (a)(i) Establishes a minor source baseline date; or (b)(ii) Is subject to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR 51.166. and would be constructed in the same state as the state proposing the redesignation. (iii)(c) Any baseline area established originally for the TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of available PM 10 increments, except th at such baseline area shall not remain in effect if the Department resc inds the corresponding minor source baseline date in accordance with paragraph (b)(31)(iv)(B)(31)(d). (6)(i)(a) \"Baseline concentration\" means that ambient concentration level that exists in the baseline area at the time of the applicable minor source baselin e date. A baseline concentration is determined for each pollutant for which a minor source base line date is established and shall include: (a)(i) The actual emissions, as defined in paragr aph (b)(B)(1), representative of sources in existence on the applicable minor source baseline date, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B)(6)(b); and (b)(ii) The allowable emissions of major stati onary sources that commenced construction before the major source baseline date, but were not in operati on by the applicable minor source baseline date. (ii)(b) The following will not be included in the b aseline concentration and will affect the applicable maximum allowable increase(s): (a)(i) Actual emissions, as defined in paragr aph (b)(B)(1), from any major stationary source on which construction commenced after th e major source baseline date; and (b)(ii) Actual emissions increases and decreases, as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(1), at any stationary source occurring after the minor source baseline date. (7) \"Begin actual construction\" means, in general, initiation of ph ysical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent natu re. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, la ying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures.

(8) \"Best available control technology (BACT)\" means an emissions limitation (including a visible emission standard) based on the maximum degree of reduc tion for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act which would be emitted from any propo sed major stationary source or major modification which the Department, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable fo r such source or modification through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of BACT result in emissions of any pollutant which w ould exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61. If the Depa rtment determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodol ogy to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a desi gn, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of BACT. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set fo rth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operatio n, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. (9)(a) \"Building, structure, facility, or installation\" means all of the pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) except the activities of any vessel.

(2) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the air quality impact projected for the area as a result of general commercial, residential, industria l and other growth associated with the source or modification. (3) Visibility monitoring. The Department may requi re monitoring of visibility in any Class I area near the proposed new stationary source for major modifi cation for such purposes and by such means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate. (p)(P) Sources impacting Federal Class I areas - additional requirements. (1) Notice to Federal Land Managers. The Depart ment shall provide written notice of any permit application for a proposed major stationary source or major modification, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the Federal Land Manager and the federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands within any such area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application and sh all be given within thirty (30) days of receipt and at least sixty (60) days prior to any public hearing on the application fo r a permit to construct. Such notification shall include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impa cts on visibility in the Class I area. The Department shall also provide the Federal Land Manager and such federal officials with a copy of the preliminary determination required under paragraph (q)(Q), and shall make availa ble to them any materials used in making that determination, promptly after the De partment makes such determination. Finally, the Department shall also notify all aff ected Federal Land Managers within th irty (30) days of receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application. (2) Federal Land Manager. The Fe deral Land Manager and the federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of such lands have an affirmative responsibility to protect the air quality related values (including visibility) of such lands a nd to consider, in consulta tion with the Department, whether a proposed source or modification will have an adverse impact on such values. (3) Visibility analysis. The Department shall cons ider any analysis performed by the Federal Land Manager, provided within thirty (30) days of the notification required by paragraph (p)(P)(1), that shows that a proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Class I area. Where the Department finds th at such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that an adverse impact on visibility will result in the Federal Class I area, the Department must, in the notice of public hearing on th e permit application, either explain its decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained. (4) Denial- impact on air quality related values. The Federal Land Manager of any such lands may demonstrate to the Department that the emissions from a proposed source or modification would have an adverse impact on the air quality-related values (includi ng visibility) of those lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions fro m such source or modification would not cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed th e maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Department concurs with such demonstra tion, then the permit shall not be issued. (5) Class I variances. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification may demonstrate to the Federal Land Manager that the emissions from su ch source or modification would have no adverse impact on the air quality related values of any such lands (including visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from su ch source or modification would cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Federal Land Manager concurs with such demonstration and so certifies, the state may authorize the Administrator: Provided, That, provided that the app licable requirements of this regulatio n are otherwise met, to issue the permit with such emission limitations as may be necessar y to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide, PM 2.5, PM 10, and nitrogen oxides would not exceed the follow ing maximum allowable increases over minor source baseline concentration for such pollutants: Pollutant Maximum Allowable Increase (micrograms per cubic meter) PM 2.5: annual arithmetic mean 4 24-hr maximum 9 PM 10: annual arithmetic mean 17 24-hr maximum 30 Sulfur dioxide: annual arithmetic mean 20 24-hr maximum 91 3-hr maximum 325 Nitrogen dioxide: annual arithmetic mean 25 (6) Sulfur dioxide variance by Governor with Federal Land Manager's conc urrence. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification whic h cannot be approved under paragraph (q)(Q)(4) may demonstrate to the Governor that the source cannot be constructed by reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for a period of twenty-four ( 24) hours or less applicable to any Class I area and, in the case of Federal mandatory Class I areas, that a variance under this clause would not adversely affect the air quality related values of the area (including vi sibility). The Governor, after consideration of the Federal Land Manager's recommendation (if any) and c oncurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the Department shall issue a permit to such source or modification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (q)(Q)(7): Provided, provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met. (7) Variance by the Governor with the President 's concurrence. In any case where the Governor recommends a variance in which the Federal Land Ma nager does not concur, the recommendations of the Governor and the Federal Land Manager shall be tran smitted to the President. The President may approve the Governor's recommendation if it is found that the va riance is in the national interest. If the variance is approved, the Department shall issue a permit purs uant to the requirements of paragraph (q)(Q)(7): Provided, provided that the applicable require ments of this regulation are otherwise met. (8) Emission limitations for Presidential or gubernatorial variance. In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph (q)(Q)(5) or (q)(Q)(6) the source or modifi cation shall comply with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulf ur dioxide from the source or modification would not (during any day on which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded) cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to assure that such emissions would not cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the otherwise applicable maximum allowa ble increases for periods of exposure of twenty- four (24) hours or less for more than eighteen ( 18) days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period: MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE INCREASE (Micrograms per cubic meter) Period of exposure Terrain Areas Low High 24-hr maximum 36 62 3-hr maximum 130 221 (q)(Q) Public participation. (1) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an appli cation to construct, or any addition to such application, the Department shall advise the applicant of any defi ciency in the application or in the information submitted and transmit a copy of such application to EPA .

(3) The requirements of Section (q)(Q), Public Particip ation, of this standard shall not apply to any major plant or major modification which Section (i)(I), Exemptions, would exempt from the requirements of Sections (k)(K), (m)(M), and (o)(O), but only to the extent that, with respect to each of the criteria for construction approval under the South Carolina State Im plementation Plan and for exemption under Section (i)(I), requirements providing the public with at least as much participation in each material determination as those of Section (q)(Q) have been met in the granting of such construction approval. (r)(R) Source obligation. In addition to all other applicable requirements speci fied in this regulation, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (r)(R)(1) through (r)(R)(8). (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or op erates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or w ith the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action. (2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months after receipt of such approva l, if construction is discontinued fo r a period of eighteen (18) months or more, or if construction is not completed with in a reasonable time. The Department may extend the eighteen (18)-month period upon a satisfactory showing th at an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within eighteen (18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. (3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the State Implementation Plan and any ot her requirements under local, state, or federal law. (4) At such time that a particular source or m odification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or m odification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requireme nts or paragraphs (j)(J) th rough (r)(R) shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification. (5) Reserved (6) Monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. The provisions of this para graph (r)(R)(6) apply to with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at an existing emissions unit at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragraphs (b)(41)(ii)(a)(B)(41)(b)(i) through (c)(B)(41)(b)( iii) for calculating projected actual emissions. (i)(a) If the project requires construction perm itting under Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (r)(6)(ii)(R)(6)(b) as part of the permit application to the Department. If c onstruction permitting under Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" is not required, the owner or operator shall maintain the information set out in paragraph (r)(6)(ii)(R)(6)(b). (ii)(b) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: (a)(i) A description of the project; (b)(ii) Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (c)(iii) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded unde r paragraph (b)(41)(ii)(c)(B)(41)(b)(iii) and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. (c) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a c opy of the information set out in paragraph (R)(6)(b) of this section to the Department. Nothing in this pa ragraph shall be construed to require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determinat ion from the Department before beginning actual construction. (iii)(d) The owner or operator shall monitor the em issions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the project and that is emit ted by any emissions unit identified in paragraph (r)(6)(ii)(b)(R)(6)(b)(ii); and calculate and maintain a reco rd of the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five (5) y ears following resumption of regular operations after the change, or for a period of ten (10) years following resu mption of regular operations after the change if the project increases the design capacity of or potential to emit that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit. (iv)(e) If the unit is an existing electric utility stea m generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department within sixty (60) days afte r the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (r)(6)(iii)(R )(6)(d) setting out the unit's annual emissions during the calendar year that preceded submission of the report. (v)(f) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department if the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year, from the project identified in paragraph (r)(6)(ii)(R)(6)(b), ex ceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(ii)(c)(R)(6 )(b)(iii)), by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)) for that regulated NSR po llutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintain ed pursuant to paragraph (R)(6)(b)(iii)(r)(6)(ii)(c). Such report shall be submitted to th e Department within sixty (60) days after the end of such year. The report shall contain the following: (a)(i) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source; (b)(ii) The annual emissions as calculate d pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(iii)(R)(6)(d); and (c)(iii) Any other information needed to ma ke a compliance determination (for example, an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). (g) A \"reasonable possibility\" under paragraph (R)(6) of this section occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either: (i) A projected actual emissions increase of at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragr aph (B)(50) of this secti on (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or (ii) A projected actual emi ssions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(41)(b)(iii) of this section, sums to at leas t fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(50) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for th e regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only with in the meaning of paragraph (R)(6 )(g)(ii) of this section, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (R)(6)(g)(i) of this section, then provisions (R)(6)(c) through (R)(6)(f) do not apply to the project. (7) If a project at a source with a PAL requires c onstruction permitting under Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements\", the owner or operator shall pr ovide notification of source status as part of the permit application to the Department. (8) The owner or operator of the source shall ma ke the information require d to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(R)(6) available for review upon a request for inspection by the Department or the general public pursuant to th e requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(viii).

(u)(U)(4) In the case of a source or modification which proposes to construct in a Class III area, emissions from which would cause or contribute to air quality exceeding the maximum allowable increase applicable if the area were designated a Class II area, and where no standard under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act has been promulgated for such source category, the Ad ministrator must approve the determination of BACT as set forth in the permit. (v)(V) Innovative control technology. (1) An owner or operator of a proposed major sta tionary source or major modification may request the Department in writing no later than the close of the comment period under 40 CFR 124.10 to approve a system of innovative control technology. (2) The Department shall, with the consent of the go vernor(s) of the affected state(s), determine that the source or modification may employ a system of innovative control technology, if: (i)(a) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function; (ii)(b) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous emis sions reduction equivalent to that which would have been required under paragra ph (j)(J)(2), by a date specified by the Department. Such date shall not be later than four (4) years fro m the time of startup or seven (7) years from permit issuance; (iii)(c) The source or modification would meet the requirements of paragraphs (j)(J) and (k)(K), based on the emissions rate that the stationary source em ploying the system of innovative control technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the Department; (iv)(d) The source or modification would not before the date specified by the Department: (a)(i) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standard; or (b)(ii) Impact any area where an appli cable increment is known to be violated; and (v)(e) All other applicable requirements including those for public participation have been met. (vi)(f) The provisions of paragra ph (p)(P) (relating to Class I areas) have been satisfied with respect to all periods during the life of the source or modification. (3) The Department shall withdraw any approval to employ a system of innovative control technology made under this section, if: (i)(a) The proposed system fails by the specified date to achieve the required continuous emissions reduction rate; or (ii)(b) The proposed system fails before the specifi ed date so as to contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; or (iii)(c) The Department decides at any time that the proposed system is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the public health, welfare, or safety. (4) If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of continuous emission reduction within the specified time period or the approval is withdr awn in accordance with paragraph (v)(V)(3), the Department may allow the source or modification up to an additional three (3) years to meet the requirement for the application of best available control technology through use of a demonstrated system of control. (w)(W) Permit rescission . (1) Any permit issued under this section or a prior vers ion of this regulation shall remain in effect, unless and until it expires or is resci nded under this paragraph (w)(W). (2) Any owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who holds a permit issued under this section for the construction of a new source or modi fication that meets the requirement in paragraph (w)(W)(3) of this section may request that the Departme nt rescind the permit or a particular portion of the permit. (3) The Department may grant an application for rescission if the application shows that this section would not apply to the source or modification. (4) If the Department rescinds a permit under this paragraph, the Department shall post a notice of the rescission determination on a public website identified by the Department within sixty (60) days of the rescission. (x)(X) [Reserved] (y)(Y) [Reserved] )(1) through (aa)(AA)(15) govern actuals PALs. (1) Applicability. (i)(a) The Department may approve the use of an actuals PAL for any existing major stationary source if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa )(AA)(1) through (aa)(AA)(15). The term \"PAL\" shall mean \"actuals PAL\" throughout paragraph (aa) Section (AA). (ii)(b) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that maintains its total source-wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(AA)(1) through (aa)(AA)(15), and complies with the PAL permit: (a)(i) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant; (b)(ii) Does not have to be approved throug h Regulation 61-62.5, Standard 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration. However, the change will be reviewed through R. Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, A. Permit Requirements; and (c)(iii) Is not subject to the provisions in pa ragraph (r)(R)(4) (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary source u sed to avoid applicability of the major NSR program). (iii)(c) Except as provided under paragraph (aa)(1)( ii)(c)(AA)(1)(b)(iii), a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all applicable federal or st ate requirements, emission limitations, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL. (2) Definitions. The definitions in paragraphs (aa)(2)(i)( AA)(2)(a) through (aa)(2)(xi)(AA)(2)(k) shall apply to actual PALs consistent w ith paragraphs (aa)(AA)(1) through ( aa)(AA)(15). When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in paragraph (b)(B) or in the Clean Air Act. (i)(a) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(4)) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(20)) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) \"Allowable emissions\" means \"allowable emissions\" as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(3), except as this definition is modified according to paragraphs (aa)(2)(ii)(a)(AA)(2)(b)(i) and (aa)(2)(ii)(b)(AA)(2)(b)(ii). (a)(i) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit. (b)(ii) An emissions unit's potential to emit sha ll be determined using th e definition in paragraph (b)(B)(37), except that the words \"or enforceable as a practical matter\" should be added after \"federally enforceable.\" (iii)(c) \"Small emissions unit\" means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant leve l for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. (iv)(d) \"Major emissions unit\" means: (a)(i) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit one hundred (100) tpy tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or (b)(ii) Any emissions unit that emits or has the pot ential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major source threshol d for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act for nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance w ith the definition of major stationary source in Section 182(c) of the Clean Air Act, an emissions unit would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or has the potential to emit fifty (50) or more tons of VOC per year. (v)(e) \"Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL)\" means an emission limitation expressed in tpy tons per year, for a pollutant at a major stationary source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source-wide in accordance with para graphs (aa)(AA)(1) through (aa)(AA)(15). (vi)(f) effective date\" generally means the date of issuan ce of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (vii)(g) \"PAL effective period\" means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending ten (10) years later. (viii)(h) \"PAL major modification\" means, notwithstanding paragr aphs (b)(B)(30) and (b)(B)(34) (the definitions for major modificati on and net emissions increase), any physi cal change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL. (ix)(i) \"PAL permit\" means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the state operating permit under Regulation 61-62.1, Section II.G, or the Title V permit issued by the Department that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source. (x)(j) \"PAL pollutant\" means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major stationary source. (xi)(k) \"Significant emissions unit\" means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or great er than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lowe r) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iv)(AA)(2)(d). (3) Permit application requirements. As part of a permit applicati on requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source shall submit the following information to the Department for approval: (i)(a) A list of all emissions units at the source designated as small, significant or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, federal or state applicable requirements, emission limita tions, or work practices apply to each unit. (ii)(b) Calculations of the baseline actual emi ssions (with supporting docum entation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown, and malfunction. (iii)(c) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly em issions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12)- month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i)(AA)(13)(a). (4) General requirements for establishing PALs. (i)(a) The Department is allowed to establish a PA L at a major stationary source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(4)(i )(a)(AA)(4)(a)(i) through (aa)(4)(i)(g)(AA)(4)(a)(vii) are met. (a)(i) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limi tation in tpy tons per year, that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first twelve (12) months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous twelve (12) consecutive months is less than the PAL (a tw elve (12)-month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first eleven (11) months from the PA L effective date, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the precedi ng monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL. (b)(ii) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (aa)(AA)(5). (c)(iii) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA)(7). (d)(iv) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source. (e)(v) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. (f)(vi) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (g)(vii) The owner or operator of the major st ationary source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (aa)(AA)(12) through (aa)(AA)(14) for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. (ii)(b) At no time (during or after the PAL effectiv e period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant that occur during the PAL effective period credita ble as decreases for purposes of offsets under 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii) unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. (5) Public participation requirements for PALs. PALs for existing major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with sectionSection (q)(Q) \"Public Participation\" of this regulation. This includes the re quirement that the Department provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a thirty (30)-day period for submittal of public comment. The Department must address all material comments before taking final action on the permit. (6) Setting the 10-year actuals PAL level. (i)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (aa)(6)( ii)(AA)(6)(b), the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source shall be established as the sum of th e baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(4)) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragra ph (b)(B)(49) or under the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. When establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period must be used to determine the base line actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive twenty-four (24)-m onth period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down afte r this twenty-four (24)- month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The Department shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tpy tons per year) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the Department is aware of prior to the issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissi ons of sixty (60) parts per million (ppm) NO X to a new rule limit of thirty (30) ppm, then the permit shall contain a fu ture effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). (ii)(b) For newly constructed units (which do no t include modification to existing units) on which actual construction began after the tw enty-four (24)-month period, the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units. (7) Contents of the PAL permit. The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (aa)(7)(i)(AA)(7)(a) through (aa)(7)(x)(AA)(7)(j). (i)(a) The PAL pollutant and the applicable sour ce-wide emission limitation in tpy tons per year. (ii)(b) The PAL permit effective date and the e xpiration date of the PAL (PAL effective period). (iii)(c) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (aa)(AA)(10) before the end of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effectiv e period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by the Department. (iv)(d) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance purposes must include emissions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (v)(e) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA)(9). (vi)(f) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emi ssions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12)- month rolling total as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i)(AA)(13)(a). (vii)(g) A requirement that the major stationary source owner or operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (aa)(AA)(12). (viii)(h) A requirement to retain the records re quired under paragraph (aa)(AA)(13) on site. Such records may be retained in an electronic format. (ix)(i) A requirement to submit the reports re quired under paragraph (aa)(AA)(14) by the required deadlines. (x)(j) Any other requirements that the Department deems necessary to implement and enforce the PAL. (8) PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit. The requirements in paragraphs (aa)(8)(i)(AA)(8)(a) and (aa)(8)(ii)( AA)(8)(b) apply to actuals PALs. (i)(a) PAL effective period. The Department shall specify a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (ii)(b) Reopening of the PAL permit. (a)(i) During the PAL effective period, th e Department must reopen the PAL permit to: (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL; (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offsets under 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii); and (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (aa)(AA)(11). (b)(ii) The Department shall have discre tion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicab le federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date; (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any othe r requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the state may impose on the major stationary source under the State Implementation Plan; and (3) Reduce the PAL if the Department determ ines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a National Ambient Air Quality Standa rd or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. (c)(iii) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (aa)(8)(ii)(a)(1)(AA)(8)(b)(i)(1) for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public par ticipation requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA)(5). (9) Expiration of a PAL. Any PAL that is not renewed in accord ance with the procedures in paragraph (aa)(10)(AA)(10) shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i)(AA)(9)(a) through (aa )(9)(v)(AA)(9)(e) shall apply. (i)(a) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissi ons units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i)(a)(AA)(9)(a)(i) and (aa)(9)(i)(b)(AA)(9)(a)(ii). (a)(i) Within the time frame specified for PAL re newals in paragraph (aa )(10)(ii)(AA)(10)(b), the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allo wable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as decided by the Department) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as requi red under paragraph (aa)(10)(v)(AA)(10)(e), such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted. (b)(ii) The Department shall decide whet her and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating al lowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Departme nt determines is appropriate. (ii)(b) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply w ith the allowable emission limitation on a twelve (12)- month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than CEMS, CERMS, PEMS, or CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation. (iii)(c) Until the Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (aa)(9)(i)(b)(AA)(9)(a)(ii), the source shall continue to comply with a source-wide , multi-unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation. (iv)(d) Any physical change or change in the me thod of operation at the major stationary source will be subject to major NSR requirements if such cha nge meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (b)(B)(30). (v)(e) The major stationary source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any state or federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except fo r those emission limitations that had been established pursuant to paragraph (r)(R)(4), but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(c)(AA)(1)(b)(iii). (10) Renewal of a PAL. (i)(a) The Department shall follow the procedur es specified in paragraph (aa)(AA)(5) in approving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL level fo r the source for consideration by the Department. (ii)(b) Application deadline. A major stationary source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Department to request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted at least six (6) months prior to, but not earlier than eight een (18) months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure th at the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source submits a complete application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall con tinue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. (iii)(c) Application requirements. The application to renew a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs (aa)(10)(iii)(a)( AA)(10)(c)(i) through (aa)(10)(iii)(d)(AA)(10)(c)(iv). (a)(i) The information required in paragraphs (aa)(3)(i)(AA)(3)(a) through (aa)(3)(iii)(AA)(3)(c). (b)(ii) A proposed PAL level. (c)(iii) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units unde r the PAL (with supporting documentation). (d)(iv) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (iv)(d) PAL adjustment. In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Department shall consider the options outlined in paragr aphs (aa)(10)(iv)(a)(AA)(10)(d)(i) and (aa)(10)(iv)(b)(AA)(10)(d)(ii). However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(c)(AA)(10)(d)(iii). (a)(i) If the emissions level calculated in accord ance with paragraph (aa)(AA)(6) is equal to or greater than eighty (80) percent of the PAL level, the Department may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(b)(AA)(10)(d)(ii); or (b)(ii) The Department may set the PAL at a leve l that it determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that it determines to be more appr opriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic grow th in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factor s as specifically identified by the Department in its written rationale. (c)(iii) Notwithstanding paragra phs (aa)(10)(iv)(a)(AA)(10)(d)(i) and (aa)(10)(iv)(b)(AA)(10)(d)(ii): (1) If the potential to emit of the major stati onary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater th an the potential to emit of the source; and (2) The Department shall not approve a rene wed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source has complied with the provi sions of paragraph (aa)(AA)(11) (increasing a PAL). (v)(e) If the compliance date for a state or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Department has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewa l or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first. (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period. (i)(a) The Department may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source complies with the provisions in paragr aphs (aa)(11)(i)(a)(AA)(11)(a)(i) through (aa)(11)(i)(d)(AA)(11)(a)(iv). (a)(i) The owner or operator of the major stati onary source shall submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to th e increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL. (b)(ii) As part of this application, the majo r stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the sma ll emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivale nt controls on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT anal ysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply wi th a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding ten (10) years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. (c)(iii) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(a)(AA)(11)(a)(i), regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These em issions unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the major NSR process (for example, BACT), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. (d)(iv) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modifi cation becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) The Department shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equi valent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(b)(AA)(11)(a)(ii)), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units. (iii)(c) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA)(5). (12) Monitoring requirements for PALs. (i)(a) General requirements. (a)(i) Each PAL permit must contain enforceab le requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL perm it must be based on sound science and meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and ma nipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the PAL permit. (b)(ii) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set fo rth in paragraphs (aa)(12)(ii)(a)(AA)(12)(b)(i) through (aa)12(ii)(d)(AA)(12)(b)(iv) and must be approved by the Department. (c)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(b )(AA)(12)(a)(ii), the owner or operator may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that me ets paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(a )(AA)(12)(a)(i) if approved by the Department. (d)(iv) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this regulation renders the PAL invalid. (ii)(b) Minimum performance requirements for approved monitoring approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches when conduc ted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii)(AA)(12)(c ) through (aa)(12)(ix)(AA)(12)(b)(i): (a)(i) Mass balance calculations fo coatings solvents; (b)(ii) CEMS; (c)(iii) CPMS or PEMS; and (d)(iv) Emission factors. (iii)(c) Mass balance calculations. An owner or operator using mass balance calculations to monitor PAL pollutant emissions from activities using coating or solvents shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) Provide a demonstrated means of validati ng the published content of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by all materials used in or at the emissions unit; (b)(ii) Assume that the emissions unit emits all of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by any raw material or fuel used in or at the emissions unit, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for in the process; and (c)(iii) Where the vendor of a material or fuel, wh ich is used in or at the emissions unit, publishes a range of pollutant content from such material, the owne r or operator must use the highest value of the range to calculate the PAL pollutant emissions unless the Depart ment determines there is site-specific data or a site-specific monitoring program to s upport another content within the range. (iv)(d) CEMS. An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) CEMS must comply with applicable Pe rformance Specifications 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B; and (b)(ii) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes while the emissions unit is operating. (v)(e) CPMS or PEMS. An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site-specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and (b)(ii) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analy ze, and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes, or at another less frequent interval approv ed by the Department, while the emissions unit is operating. (vi)(f) Emission factors. An owner or operator using emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' development; (b)(ii) The emissions unit shall operate within th e designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and (c)(iii) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation t esting to determine a site- specific emission factor within six (6) months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Department determines that testing is not required. (vii)(g) A source owner or operator must reco rd and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations or opera tional restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, un less another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit. (viii)(h) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii)(AA)(12)(c) through (aa)(12)(vii)(AA)(12)(g), where an owner or operator of an emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL polluta nt emissions rate at all operating points of the emissions unit, the Department shall, at the time of permit issuance: (a)(i) Establish default value(s) for determ ining compliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or (b)(ii) Determine that operation of the emissi ons unit during operating conditions when there is no correlation between monitored parame ter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL. (ix)(i) Re-validation. All data used to establis h the PAL pollutant must be re-validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid mean s approved by the Department. Such testing must occur at least once every five (5) years after issuance of the PAL. (13) Recordkeeping requirements. (i)(a) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance w ith any requirement of paragraph (aa) Section (AA) and of the PAL, including a determination of eac h emissions unit's twelve (12)-month rolling total emissions, for five (5) years from the date of such record. (ii)(b) The PAL permit shall require an owner or ope rator to retain a copy of the following records for the duration of the PAL effective period plus five (5) years: (a)(i) A copy of the PAL permit application a nd any applications for revisions to the PAL; and (b)(ii) Each annual certification of compliance pursu ant to Title V and the data relied on in certifying the compliance. (14) Reporting and notification requirements. The owner or operator shall submit semi-annual monitoring reports and prompt deviation reports to th e Department in accordance with the applicable title V operating permit program Regulation 61-62.70. The reports shall meet the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(14)(i)(AA)(14)(a) through (aa)(14)(iii)(AA)(14)(c). (i)(a) Semi-annual report. The semi-annual report shall be su bmitted to the Department within 30 days of the end of each reporting period.

(1) This rule applies to all major stationary sour ces constructed or modified in any nonattainment area as designated in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 81.341 (\"nonattainment area\") if the emissions from such facility will cause or contribute to concentrations of a regulated NSR pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(13)(B)(32)) for which the nonattainment area wa s designated as nonattainment. Applicability to this regulation shall be based on the pollutant emission ra te set out in paragraph (c)(14)(B)(37) for only those pollutants for which the area's designation is based. (A)(a) The requirements of paragraph (d) this regul ation apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any ex isting major stationary source, except as provided in paragraph (b) Section(A)(10). (B)(b) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requirements of paragraph (d) this regulation apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirement s. The Department has authority to issue any such permit. (2) Redesignation to attainment . If any nonattainment area to whic h this regulation applies is later designated in 40 CFR 81.341 as attainment, all sources in that nonattainment area subject to this regulation before the redesignation date shall conti nue to comply with this regulation. (3) For any area designated as nonattainment a major stationary source or major modification that is major for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or oxi des of nitrogen oxides is also major for ozone. (b) Applicability procedures. (1)(4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(7)(A)(9), and consistent with the definition of major modification contained as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(A)(B)(21)(a), a project is a major modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases - a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (c)(15)(B)(38), and a significa nt net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (c)(8)(B)(24) and (15)(B)(37)). The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase. (2)(5) The procedure for calculating, (before be ginning actual construction), whether a significant emissions increase (the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs (b)(1)(A)(6) throu gh (6)(A)(8). The procedure for calculating, (before beginning actual construction), whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source (the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (c)(8)(B)(24). Regardless of any such preconstruc tion projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase. (3)(6) Actual-to-projected-actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions units . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR po llutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(11)(B)(31)) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (c)(2)(A )(B)(3)(a) and (B)(B)(3)(b), as applicable), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significan t amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14)(B)(37)). (4)(7) Actual-to-potential test for projects that only involve construction of a new emissions unit(s) . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR po llutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (b)(37) of Regul (\"Standard 7\") (B)(27)) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the baseline actual emis sions (as defined in para graph (c)(2)(C)(B)(3)(c)) of these units before the project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14)(B)(37)). (5) [Reserved] (6)(8) Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emissions units . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases for each emissions unit, using the method specified in paragr aphs (b)(3)(A)(6) and (4)(A)(7) as applicable with respect to each emissions unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37)). (7)(9) For any major stationary source for a Plan twide Applicability Limitation (PAL) for a regulated NSR pollutant, the major stationary source shall co mply with requirements under paragraphSection (i)(N) (10) The provisions of this section shall not appl y to a particular major stationary source or major modification if the source or modification would be a major stationary source or major modification only if fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, ar e considered in calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or modification and the source doe s not belong to any of the following categories: (a) Coal cleaning plants (with thermal dryers); (b) Kraft pulp mills; (c) Portland cement plants; (d) Primary zinc smelters; (e) Iron and steel mills; (f) Primary aluminum ore reduction plants; (g) Primary copper smelters; (h) Municipal incinerators capable of char ging more than 250 tons of refuse per day; (i) Hydrofluoric, sulfuric, or nitric acid plants; (j) Petroleum refineries; (k) Lime plants; (l) Phosphate rock processing plants; (m) Coke oven batteries; (n) Sulfur recovery plants; (o) Carbon black plants (furnace process); (p) Primary lead smelters; (q) Fuel conversion plants; (r) Sintering plants; (s) Secondary metal production plants; (t) Chemical process plants - The term chemical processing plant shall not include ethanol production facilities that produce ethanol by natural fermen tation included in NAICS codes 325193 or 312140; (u) Fossil-fuel boilers (or combination thereof) totaling more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input; (v) Petroleum storage and transfer units with a total storage capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels; (w) Taconite ore processing plants; (x) Glass fiber processing plants; (y) Charcoal production plants; (z) Fossil fuel-fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input; and (aa) Any other stationary source category which, as of August 7, 1980, is be ing regulated under Section 111 or 112 of the Clean Air Act. (c)(B) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this Sta ndard only. Any other term contained within this Standard is as defined where indicated in Regul ation 61-62.5, Standard 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration. For the purposes of this regulation: (1)(A)(a) \"Actual emissions\" means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(B)(B)(1)(b) through (D)(B)(1)(d), except that this definition shall not apply for cal culating whether a significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under paragraphS ection (i)(N). Instead, paragraphs (c)(2)(B)(3) and (c)(11)(B)(31) shall apply for those purposes. (B)(b) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year (tpy), at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period which precedes the particular date and which is repres entative of normal source operation. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculate d using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored , or combusted during the selected time period. (C)(c) The Department may presume that sour ce-specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. (D)(d) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (2) Allowable emissions means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following: (a) The applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61; (b) Any applicable State Implementation Plan em issions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or (c) The emissions rate specified as a federally en forceable permit condition, including those with a future compliance date. (3)(2) \"Baseline actual emissions\" means the rate of emissions, in tp y tons per year, of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with pa ragraphs (c)(2)(A)(B)(3)(a) through (D)(B)(3)(d). (A)(a) For any existing electric utility steam ge nerating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollu tant during any consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the five (5)-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project. The Department shall allow the use of a different time pe riod upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive em issions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted dow nward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emi ssion limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period. (iii) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A di fferent consecutive twenty-four (24 )-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (iv) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty-four (2 4)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tp y tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by para graph (c)(2)(A)(ii)(B)(3)(a)(ii). (B)(b) For an existing emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam generating unit), baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty-four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the ten (10)-year period immediately preceding e ither the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete pe rmit application is received by the Department for a permit required either under this section or under a plan approved by the Administrator whichever is earlier, except that the ten (10)-year period shall not includ e any period earlier than November 15, 1990. The Department reserves the right to determine if the twenty-four (24)-month period selected is appropriate. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive em issions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted dow nward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above an emi ssion limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period. (iii) The average rate shall be adjusted dow nward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the major stationary source must currently comply, had such major stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable control technology standard that the Administrator proposed or pr omulgated under 40 CFR Part 63, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the state has taken credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan consistent with the requirement s of paragraph (d)(1)(c)(viii)(D)(7) (iv) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A di fferent consecutive twenty-four (24 )-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (v) The average rate shall not be based on an y consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tp y tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (c )(2)(B)(ii)(B)(3)(b)(ii) and (iii)(B)(3)(b)(iii). (C)(c) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial cons truction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and thereafter, for all other purposes, sh all equal the unit's potential to emit. (D)(d) For a PAL for a major stationary source, the baseline actual emissions shall be calculated for existing electric utility steam generating units in acco rdance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(A)(B)(3)(a), for other existing emissions units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(B)(B)(3)(b), and for a new emissions unit in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(C)(B)(3)(c). (4) Begin actual construction means, in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Su ch activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations , laying of underground pipework, and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operating this term refers to those on-site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change. (3)(5) \"Best available control technology (BACT)\" means an emissions limitation (including a visible emissions standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the Department, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, envi ronmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source or modifica tion through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques, includ ing fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of best available control technology result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR Parts 60 or 61. If the Department determines that technological or economic limitations on the applica tion of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasi ble, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed in stead to satisfy the requirement for the application of BACT. Such standard shall, to the degree possi ble, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work pr actice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. (4) [Reserved] (6)(a) Building, structure, facility, or installation means all of the pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant-emitting activities shall be considered as pa rt of the same industrial grouping if they belong to the same \"Major Group\" (which have the same tw o-digit code) as described in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, as amende d by the 1977 Supplement (U.S. Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101-0066 and 003-005-00176-0, respectively). (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (B)(6 )(a), building, structure, facility, or installation means, for onshore activities under Standard Industri al Classification (SIC) Major Group 13: Oil and Gas Extraction, all of the pollutant-emitting activities in cluded in Major Group 13 that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are unde r the control of the same person (or persons under common control). Pollutant emitting activities shall be c onsidered adjacent if they are located on the same surface site; or if they are located on surface sites that are located within one-fourth (1/4) of a mile of one another (measured from the center of the equipment on the surface site) and they share equipment. Shared equipment includes, but is not limited to, produced fluids storage tanks, phase separators, natural gas dehydrators, or emissions control devices. Surface site , as used in this paragraph, has the same meaning as in 40 CFR 63.761. (7) Temporary clean coal technology demonstration project means a clean coal technology demonstration project that is operate d for a period of five (5) years or less, and which complies with the State Implementation Plan for the state in which the project is located and other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality st andards during the project and after it is terminated. (8) Clean coal technology means any technology, including technologies applied at the precombustion, combustion, or post combustion stage, at a new or ex isting facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity, or process steam which was not in widespread use as of November 15, 1990. (9) Clean coal technology demonstration project means a project using funds appropriated under the heading \"Department of Energy-Clean Coal Technology,\" up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial demonstration of clean coal technology, or similar projects funded through appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency. The Federal cont ribution for a qualifying project shall lie at least twenty (20) percent of the total cost of the demonstration project. (10) Commence as applied to construction of a major stationary source or major modification means that the owner or operator has all necessary prec onstruction approvals or permits and either has: (a) Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on-site construction of the source, to be completed within a reasonable time; or (b) Entered into binding agreements or contractua l obligations, which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to un dertake a program of actual construction of the source to be completed within a reasonable time. (11) Construction means any physical change or change in the method of operation (including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, or modi fication of an emissions unit) that would result in a change in emissions. (12) Continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) means all of the equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements, to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of emissions on a continuous basis. (13) Continuous emissions rate monitoring system (CERMS) means the total equipment required for the determination and recording of the pollutant mass emissions rate (in terms of mass per unit of time). (14) Continuous parameter mo nitoring system (CPMS) means all of the equipment necessary to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements, to monitor process and control device operational parameters (for example, control device secondary voltages and electric currents) and other information (for example, gas flow rate, O 2 or CO 2 concentrations), and to record av erage operational parameter value(s) on a continuous basis. (15) Electric utility steam generating unit means any steam electric generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than twenty-five (25) MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for sale. Any steam supplied to a steam distribution system for the purpose of providing steam to a steam-electric generator that would produce electrical energy for sale is al so considered in determining the electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility. (16) Emissions unit means any part of a stationary source that emits or would have the potential to emit any regulated NSR pollutant and includes an electric utility steam generating unit as defined in paragraph (B)(15) of this section. For purposes of this section, th ere are two types of emissions units as described in paragraphs (B)(16)(a) and (B )(16)(b) of this section. (a) A new emissions unit is any emissions unit wh ich is (or will be) newly constructed a nd which has existed for less than two (2) years from the date such emissions unit first operated. (b) An existing emissions unit is any emissions uni t that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (B)(16)(a) of this section. A replacement unit, as defi ned in paragraph (B)(33), is an existing emissions unit. (17) Federal Land Manager means, with respect to any lands in the United States, the Secretary of the Department with authority over such lands. (18) Federally enforceable means all limitations and conditions which are enforceable by the Administrator, including those requirements develope d pursuant to 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61, requirements within any applicable State implementation plan, an y permit requirements established pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I, including operating permits issued under an EPA-approved program that is inco rporated into the State implementation plan and expressly requires adherence to any permit issued under such program. (19) Fugitive emissions means those emissions which could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other func tionally equivalent opening. (5)(20) \"Lowest achievable emission rate (LAER)\" means, for any source, the more stringent rate of emissions based on the following: (A)(a) The most stringent emissions limitation whic h is contained in the implementation plan of any state for such class or category of stationary source, unless the owner or operator of the proposed stationary source demonstrates that such limitations are not achievable; or (B)(b) The most stringent emissions limitation whic h is achieved in practice by such class or category of stationary sources. This limitation, when app lied to a modification, means the lowest achievable emissions rate for the new or modified emissions units within a the stati onary source. In no event shall the application of the term permit allow a proposed new or modified stationary source to emit any pollutant in excess of the amount allowable under an applicable new source standard of performance. (6)(A)(21)(a) \"Major modification\" means any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result in: (i) A significant emissions increase of a regul ated NSR pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(13)(B)(32)); and (ii) A significant net emissions increase of th at pollutant from the major stationary source. (B)(b) Any significant emissions increase (as defi ned in paragraph (c)(15)(B)(38)) from any emissions units or net emissions increase (as defined in paragra ph (c)(8)(B)(24)) at a major stationary source that is significant for volatile organic compounds or oxides of nitrogen oxides shall be considered significant for ozone. (C)(c) A physical change or change in the method of operation shall not include: (i) Routine maintenance, repair, and replacement; (ii) Use of an alternative fuel or raw materi al by reason of an order unde r sectionsSections 2(a) and (b) of the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordina tion Act of 1974 (or any superseding legislation) or by reason of a natural gas curtailment pl an pursuant to the Federal Power Act; (iii) Use of an alternative fuel by reason of an order or rule under sectionSection 125 of the Clean Air Act; (iv) Use of an alternative fuel at a steam genera ting unit to the extent that the fuel is generated from municipal solid waste; (v) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material by a stationary source which; (a)(1) The source was capable of accommodating before December 21, 1976, unless such change would be prohibited under any federally enfor ceable permit condition which was established after December 21, 1976, pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21 or unde r regulations approved pursu ant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I or Section 51.166; or (2)(b) The source is approved to use under an y permit issued under regula tions approved pursuant to this section; (vi) An increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate, unless su ch change is prohibited under any federally enforceable permit condition whic h was established after December 21, 1976 pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I or 40 CFR 51.166; (vii) Any change in ownership at a stationary source.; (viii) [Reserved] (ix) The installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a temporary clean coal technology demonstration project, provided that the project complies with: (a)(1) The South Carolina State Implementation Plan, and (b)(2) Other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) during the project and after it is terminated. (D)(d) This definition shall not apply with respect to a particular regulated NSR pollutant when the major stationary source is complying with the require ments under paragraphSection (i)N for a PAL for that pollutant. Instead, the definition at para graph (i)(2)(viii)(N)(2)(h) shall apply. (e) [Reserved] (7)(A)(22)(a) \"Major stationary source\" means: (i) Any stationary source of air pollutants which that emits, or has the potential to emit, one-hundred (100) tpy tons per year or more of any regulated NSR pollutant, except that lower emissions thresholds shall apply in areas subject to Subpart 2, Subpart 3, or Subpart 4 of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act, according to paragraphs (c)(7)(A)(i)(a) through (e) of this section. the following table: (a) 50 tpy of volatile organic compounds or oxi des of nitrogen in any serious ozone nonattainment area.

If the Department finds that the major stationary source or major modification would be constructed in an area designated in 40 CFR 81.341 as nonattainment for a pollutant for which the stationary source or modification is major, approval may be granted only if the following conditions are met: (A)(a) The major stationary source or major modi fication is required to meet an emission limitation which specifies the lowest achievable em ission rate (LAER) for such source. (B)(b) The applicant must certify that all existi ng major sources owned or operated by the applicant (or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the applicant) in the same state as the proposed source are in compliance with all appl icable emission limitations and standards under the Clean Air Act (or are in compliance with an exped itious schedule which is federally enforceable or contained in a court decree). (C)(c) The owner or operator of the proposed new major stationary source or major modification will obtain sufficient emission reductions of the nonattainment pollutant from other sources. Emission reductions shall be in effect and enforceable prior to the date the new source or modification commences operation.

(d) The emission offsets must provide a positive net air quality benefit in the affected area as determined by 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling. (e) Alternative Sites Analysis. An analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for such proposed source demonstrates that benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and so cial costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modificat ion shall be required. (2) Exemptions. Temporary emission sources, such as pilot plants and portable facilities which will be relocated outside of the nonattainment area after a short period of time, are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (C)(1 )(c) and (C)(1)(d) of this section. (3) Secondary emissions. Secondary emissions need not be considered in determining whether the stationary source or modification is major. However, if a source is subject to this regulation on the basis of the direct emissions from the source, the applicable conditions in paragraph (C)(1 ) must also be met for secondary emissions. However, secondary emission s may be exempt from paragraphs (C)(1)(a) and (C)(1)(b) of this section. (4) The requirements of this regulation applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 10 shall also apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 10 precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels that exceed the PM 10 ambient standards in the area. (D) Offset standards. (1) All emission reductions claimed as offset cred it shall be permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable and surplus; (i)(2) Where the permitted emissions limit allows great er emissions than the potential to emit of the source (as when a state has a single particulate emissi on limit for all fuels), emissions offset credit will be allowed only for control below this potential; (ii)(3) For an existing fuel combustion source, cred it shall be based on the allowable emissions for the type of fuel being burned at the time the application to construct is filed. If the existing source commits to switch to a cleaner fuel at some future date, emissi ons offset credit based on the allowable (or actual) emissions for the fuels involved is not acceptable, unless the permit is conditioned to require the use of a specified alternative control measure which would ac hieve the same degree of emissions reduction should the source switch back to a dirtier fuel at some later date. (iii)(a)(4) Emissions reductions achieved by shutting down an existing source or curtailing production or operating hours below baseline levels may be generally credited if such reductions are permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable, o ccurred on or after the date of th e most recent emissions inventory, and if the area has an EPA-approved attainment plan. for offsets if the shutdown or curtailment occurred after the last day of the base year for the SIP plan ning process. For purposes of this paragraph, the Department may choose to consider a prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the last day of the base year if the projected emissions invent ory used to develop the attainment demonstration explicitly includes the emissions from such previously shutdown or curtailed emission units. No credit may be given for shutdowns that occurred before August 7, 1977. (b)(5) Such reductions may be credited if Emissi ons reductions achieved by shutting down an existing emissions unit or curtailing production or operating ho urs and that do not meet the requirements in paragraph (D)(4) may be generally credited only if: (a) the The shutdown or curtailment occurred on or after the date the new source permit application is filed,; or, (b) if the The applicant can establish that the proposed new source is a replacement for the shutdown or curtailed source, and the cutoff date provisi on of paragraph (d)(C)(iii)(a) are observed emission reductions achieved by the shutdown or curtailm ent met the requirements of paragraph (D)(4). (iv)(6) No emissions credit may be allowed fo r replacing one hydrocarbon compound with another of lesser reactivity, except for those compounds listed in Table 1 of EPA's \"Recommended Policy on Control of Volatile Organic Compounds\" ( 42 FR 35314, July 8, 1977); (v) All emission reductions claimed as offset cr edit shall be federally enforceable and surplus; (7) Credit for an emissions reduction can be claimed to the extent that the Department has not relied on it in issuing any permit under regulations approved pursu ant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I or the Department has not relied on it in demonstrating atta inment or reasonable further progress. (8) The total tonnage of increased emissions, in t ons per year, resulting from a major modification that must be offset in accordance with Section 173 of th e Clean Air Act shall be determined by summing the difference between the allowable emissions after the modification (as defined by paragraph (B)(2)) and the actual emissions before the modification (as defi ned in paragraph (B)(1)) for each emissions unit. (9) If a designated nonattainment area is projected to be an attainment area as part of an approved SIP control strategy by the new source start-up date, off sets would not be required if the new source would not cause a new violation. (a)(10) Eligibility as Emission Offsets . Any facility that has the pote ntial to emit any NAAQS pollutant in an amount greater than five (5) tpy tons per year and that is located in a federally-designated nonattainment area shall be eligible to create emission offsets. (1) To be eligible to be an emission offset: (A) A reduction in emissions shall be permanen t, quantifiable, enforceable, and surplus and must have occurred after December 31 of the base year i nventory for those pollutants that are designated nonattainment by the EPA. The base year inventory date is two years preceding the date of nonattainment designation. However, the Department may choose to c onsider a prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the last day of the base year if the projected emissions inventory used to develop the attainment demonstration explicitly includes the emi ssions from such previously shutdown or curtailed emission units. (11) (B) Emission reductions shall have been cr eated by an existing facility that has obtained an enforceable air quality permit or letter of permit can cellation resulting from the surrender of the source's permit(s). (2)(12) Emission reductions may be created by an y of, or a combination of, the following methods: (A)(a) Installation of control equipment be yond what is necessary to comply with existing requirements; (B)(b) A change in process inputs, formulations, pr oducts or product mix, fuels, or raw materials; (C)(c) A reduction in actual emission rates; or (D) A reduction in hours of operation; (E) Production curtailment or reduction in throughput; (F) Shutdown of emitting sources; or (G)(d) Any other enforceable method that the Depa rtment determines to resu lt in real, permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable, and surplus reduction of emissions. (3)(13) A completed emissions offset submittal must be received by the Department within one (1) year of the date of the creation of the reductions. Emission o ffsets not requested within one (1) year of the date of the creation of the reductions will be permanently retired.

(E) (b) Calculation of Emission Offsets (1) The following procedure shall be used to calculate emission offsets: (A)(a) The source shall calculate average annual actual emissions, in tpy tons per year, before the emission reduction using data from the twenty-four (24)-month period immediately preceding the reduction in emissions. With the Department's approval, the use of a different time period, not to exceed ten (10) years immediately preceding the reduction in emissions, may be allowed if the owner or operator of the source documents that such period is more represent ative of normal source operation, but not prior to the base year inventory date, which is the last day of th e two (2) years preceding the date of nonattainment designation; and (B)(b) The emission offsets created shall be calculated by subtracting the allowable emissions following the reduction from the average annual actual emissions prior to the reduction. (2) For any emissions unit that has been operating for a consecutive period of at least twelve (12) months but less than twenty-four (24) months on the base year inventory date, based on the unit's potential to emit, emissions shall be calculated equal to the amount n eeded to complete a twenty-four (24)-month period on the base year inventory date. (F) ( v i ) Location of offsetting emissions. Emission offsets shall be obtained from sources currently operating within the same designated nonattainment ar ea as the new or modified stationary source. Emission offsets may be obtained from another nonatt ainment area with the Department's approval only if: (a) the other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the proposed source is located and (b) emissions from the other ar ea contribute to a violation of the NAAQS in the nonattainment area in which the source is located. (1) The other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the proposed source is located, and (2) Emissions from the other area contribute to a vi olation of the NAAQS in the nonattainment area in which the source is located. (G) (vii) Emission offsetting ratios . Emission offsets shall be required in nonattainment areas in accordance with the following provisions: (a)(1) Emissions for carbon monoxi de (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), lead (Pb), and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) nonattainment areas shall be offset at a ratio greater than one to one.

(ix) [Reserved] (x) [Reserved] (xi) The total tonnage of increased emissions, in tpy, resulting from a major modification that must be offset in accordance with section 173 of the Clean Ai r Act shall be determined by summing the difference between the allowable emissions after the modification (as defined by paragraph (b )(3) of Standard 7) and the actual emissions before the modification (as de fined in paragraph (c)(1)) for each emissions unit. (D) The emission offsets must provide a positive net air quality benefit in the affected area as determined by 40 CFR 51, Appendix S, Em ission Offset Interpretative Ruling. (E) Alternative Sites Analysis. An analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for such proposed source demonstrates that benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and so cial costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modificat ion shall be required. (H) Interpollutant offsetting. (1) In meeting the emissions offset requirements of Section (D) the emissions offsets obtained shall be for the same regulated NSR pollutant unless interpollutant offsetting is permitted for a particular pollutant as specified in this paragraph. (a) The offset requirement(s) of Section (D) for emissions of the ozone precursors NO X and VOC may be satisfied by offsetting reductions of emissions of eith er of those precursors, if all other requirements for such offsets are also satisfied. (b) The offset requirements of Section (D) for direct PM 2.5 emissions or emissi ons of precursors of PM 2.5 may be satisfied by offsetting reductions of direct PM 2.5 emissions or emissions of any PM 2.5 precursor identified under paragraph (B)(32)(c) if such offsets comply with the interprecursor trading hierarchy and ratio established in the approved plan for a particular nonattainment area. (2) The control requirements applicable to majo r stationary sources and ma jor modifications of PM 2.5 shall also apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 2.5 precursors in a PM 2.5 nonattainment area, except that the Department ma y exempt new major stationary sources and major modifications of a particular precursor from the requirements for PM 2.5 if the nonattainment NSR precursor demonstration submitted to and approved by the Admi nistrator shows that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 2.5 levels that exceed the standard in th e area. Any demonstration submitted for the Administrator's review must meet the conditions fo r a nonattainment NSR precursor demonstration as set forth in 40 CFR 51.1006(a)(3). (I) Banking of emission offsets. For new sources obtaining permits by applying offsets after January 16, 1979, the Department may allow offsets that exceed the requirement of reasonable progress toward attainment to be \"banked\" (i.e., saved to provide o ffsets for a source seeking a permit in the future) for future use. Likewise, the Department may allow th e owner of an existing source that reduces its own emissions to bank any resulting reductions beyond t hose required by the State Implementation Plan for future use. (J) [Reserved] (K) [Reserved] (L) Source obligation. (2)(A)(1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subj ect to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without a pplying for and receiving appr oval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action. (B)(2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months after receipt of such approva l, if construction is discontinued fo r a period of eighteen (18) months or more, or if construction is not completed with in a reasonable time. The Department may extend the eighteen (18)-month period upon a satisfactory showing th at an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within eighteen (18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. (C)(3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the plan State Impl ementation Plan and any other requirements under local, state, or federal law. (D)(4) At such time that a particular source or modi fication becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforcement limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or m odification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirement s of regulations approved pursuant to this section shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification; (3)(5) Monitoring, Recordkeeping, and Reporting. Th e following provisions apply to with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at existing emissions units at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstance s where there is a reasonable possibility that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase of such pollutant, and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragraphs (c)(11)(B)(i)(B)(31)(b)(i) through (iii)(B)(31)(b)(iii) for calculating projected actual emissions. (A)(a) If the project requires construction pe rmitting under Regulation 61-62.1, Section II \"Permit Requirements,\" the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (d)(3)(B)(L)(5)(b) as part of the permit application to the Department. If c onstruction permitting under Regulation 61-62.1, Section II \"Permit Requirements,\" is not required, the owner or operator shall maintain the information set out in paragraph (d)(3) (L)(5). (B)(b) Before beginning actual construction of th e project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: (i) A description of the project; (ii) Identification of the emissions unit(s) w hose emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (iii) A description of the applicability test u sed to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (c)(11)(B)(iii)(B)(31)(b)(iii) and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. (c) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator sh all provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (L)(5)(b) to the reviewing authority. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to requir e the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the review ing authority before begi nning actual construction. (C)(d) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the project and that is emitte d by any emissions units identified in paragraph (d)(3)(B)(ii)(L)(5)(b)(ii); and calculate and maintain a r ecord of the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five (5) y ears following resumption of regular operations after the change, or for a period of ten (10) years following resu mption of regular operations after the change if the project increases the design capacity or potential to emit of that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit. (D)(e) If the unit is an existing electric utility stea m generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department within sixty (60) days afte r the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (d)(3)(B)(L )(5)(b) setting out the unit's annual emissions during the year that preceded submission of the report. (E)(f) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utilit y steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department if the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year, from the project identified in paragraph (d)(3)(B)(L)(5)(b), exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(B)(iii)(L )(5)(b)(iii), by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (c)(14)(B)(37)) for that regulated NSR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintain ed pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(B)(iii)(L)(5)(b)(iii). Such report shall be submitted to th e Department within sixty (60) days after the end of such year. The report shall contain the following: (i) The name, address and telephone nu mber of the major stationary source; (ii) The annual emissions as calculate d pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(C)(L)(5)(d); and (iii) Any other information needed for to make a compliance determination (for example, an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). (6) A \"reasonable possibility\" under paragraph (L)(5) occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either: (a) A projected actual emissions increase of at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(38) (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or (b) A projected actual emissions increase that , added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(31)(b)(iii), sums to at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(38) (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for wh ich a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of this paragraph, and not al so within the meaning of paragraph (L)(6)(a), then provisions (L)(5)(c) through (L)(5)(f) do not apply to the project. (4) If a project at a source with a PAL requi res construction permitting u nder Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" the owner or operato r shall provide notification of source status as part of the permit application to the Department. (5)(7) The owner or operator of the source shall ma ke the information require d to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(L)(5) for re view upon a request for inspection by the Department or the general public pursuant to the requir ements contained in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(viii).

The provisions of paragraph (d) shall not a pply to a particular major stationary source or major modification if the source or modificati on would be a major stationary source or major modification only if fugitive emissions, to the extent qua ntifiable, are considered in calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or modification and the source does not belong to any of the following categories: (i) Coal cleaning plants (with thermal dryers); (B) Kraft pulp mills; (C) Portland cement plants; (D) Primary zinc smelters; (E) Iron and steel mills; (F) Primary aluminum ore reduction plants; (G) Primary copper smelters; (H) Municipal incinerators capable of char ging more than 250 tons of refuse per day; (I) Hydrofluoric, sulfuric, or nitric acid plants; (J) Petroleum refineries; (K) Lime plants; (L) Phosphate rock processing plants; (M) Coke oven batteries; (N) Sulfur recovery plants; (O) Carbon black plants (furnace process); (P) Primary lead smelters; (Q) Fuel conversion plants; (R) Sintering plants; (S) Secondary metal production plants; (T) Chemical process plants - The term chemical process plant shall not include ethanol production facilities that produce ethanol by natural fermen tation included in NAICS codes 325193 or 312140; (U) Fossil-fuel boilers (or combination thereo f) totaling more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input; (V) Petroleum storage and transfer units with a total storage capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels; (W) Taconite ore processing plants; (X) Glass fiber processing plants; (Y) Charcoal production plants; (Z) Fossil fuel-fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input; and (AA) Any other stationary source category whic h, as of August 7, 1980, is being regulated under section 111 or 112 of the Clean Air Act. (f) [Reserved] (g) [Reserved] (h) [Reserved] (i)(N) Actuals (15)(N)(15) govern actuals PALs. (1) Applicability . (i)(a) The Department may approve the use of an actuals PAL for any existing major stationary source (except as provided in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) (N)(1)(b)) if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1)(N)(1) through (15)(N)(15). The term \"PAL\" sha ll mean \"actuals PAL\" throughout paragraphSection (i)(N). (ii)(b) The Department shall not allow an actuals PAL for VOC or NO X for any major stationary source located in an extreme ozone nonattainment area. (iii)(c) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that maintains its total source-wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1)(N)(1) through (15)(N)(15), and complies with the PAL permit: (A)(i) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant; (B)(ii) Does not have to be approved throug h Regulation 61-62.5, Standa rd 7.1, \"Nonattainment New Source Review\"; however, will be reviewed thr ough Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, A. \"Permit Requirements,\" and (C)(iii) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (d)(2)(D)(L)(4) (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major sta tionary source used to avoid applicability of the nonattainment major NSR program). (iv)(d) Except as provided under paragraph (i)(1)(iii) (C)(N)(1)(c)(iii), a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all applicable federal or st ate requirements, emission limitations, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL. (2) Definitions. The definitions in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(N )(2)(a) through (xi)(N)(2)(k) shall apply to actuals PALs consistent with paragraphs (i)(1)(N)(1) through (15)(N)(15). When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in pa ragraphSection (c)(B) of this regulation; paragraph (b) of Regulation 61-62.5, Standard 7, \"Prevention of Significant Deterioration\"(\"Standard 7\"); or in the Clean Air Act. (i)(a) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(B)(3)) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(20) of Standard 7 (B)(16) of this regulation) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) Allowable emissions means \"allowable emissions\" as define d in paragraph (b)(3) of Standard 7 (B)(2) of this regulation, except as this de finition is modified according to paragraphs: (i)(2)(ii)(A)(N)(2)(b)(i) through (B)(N)(2)(b)(ii). (A)(i) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit. (B)(ii) An emissions unit's potential to emit sha ll be determined using the definition in paragraph (b)(37) of Standard 7 (B)(27), except that the words \"or enforceable as a practical matter\" should be added after \"federally enforceable.\" (iii)(c) Small emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant leve l for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragraph (c)(14)(B)(37) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. (iv)(d) Major emissions unit means: (A)(i) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit one-hundred (100) tpy tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or (B)(ii) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major source thr eshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act for nonattainment areas. For exam ple, in accordance with the definitio n of major stationary source in section Section 182(c) of the Clean Air Act, an emi ssions unit would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nona ttainment area and it emits or has the potential to emit fifty (50) or more tons of VOC per year. (v)(e) Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL) means an emission limitation expressed in tpy tons per year, for a pollutant at a major stationary source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source-wide in accordance with paragr aphs (i)(1)(N)(1) through (15)(N)(15). (vi)(f) PAL effective date generally means the date of issuance of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date an y emissions unit which is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (vii)(g) PAL effective period means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending ten (10) years later. (viii)(h) PAL major modification means, notwithstanding paragr aphs (c)(6) and (8)(B)(21) and (B)(24) (the definitions for major modification and net emissions increase), any physical change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL. (ix)(i) PAL permit means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the State operating permit under Regulation 61-62.1 Section II G(G), or the Title V permit issued by the Department that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source. (x)(j) PAL pollutant means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major stationary source. (xi)(k) Significant emissions unit means an emissions unit that em its or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or great er than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (c)(13)(B)(37) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions un it as defined in paragraph (i)(2)(iv)(N)(2)(d). (3) Permit application requirements . As part of a permit applicati on requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source shall submit the following information to the Department for approval: (i)(a) A list of all emissions units at the source d esignated as small, significant, or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, Federal or State applicable requirements, emission limita tions or work practices apply to each unit. (ii)(b) Calculations of the baseline actual emi ssions (with supporting docum entation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown, and malfunction. (iii)(c) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly em issions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12) month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (i)(13)(i)(N)(13)(a). (4) General requirements for establishing PALs . (i)(a) The Department is allowed to establish a PA L at a major stationary source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (i)(4 )(i)(A)(N)(4)(a)(i) through (G)(N)(4)(a)(vii) are met. (A)(i) The PAL shall impose an annual emission lim itation in tpy tons per year that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first twelve (12) months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous twelve (12) consecutive months is less than the PAL (a tw elve (12) month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first eleven (11) months from the PA L effective date, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the precedi ng monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL. (B)(ii) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (i)(5)(N)(5) (C)(iii) The PAL permit shall contain a ll the requirements of paragraph (i)(7)(N)(7) (D)(iv) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source. (E)(v) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. (F)(vi) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (G)(vii) The owner or operator of the major st ationary source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirement s provided in paragraphs (i)(12)(N)(12) through (14)(N)(14) for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. (ii)(b) At no time (during or after the PAL e ffective period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant, which occur during the PAL effective period, creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under paragraph (d)(1)(c) Section (D) Offset standards unles s the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. (5) Public participation requirement for PALs . PALs for existing major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent paragraph (d)(6) and (d)(7) with Section M. This includes the requirement that the Depa rtment provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a thirty ( 30)-day period for submitta l of public comment. The Department must address all material comment s before taking final action on the permit. (6) Setting the 10-year actuals PAL level . (i)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(6)(ii)(N)(6 )(b), the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source shall be established as the sum of the baseline ac tual emissions (as define d in paragraph (c)(2)(B)(3)) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the sour ce; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under para graph (c)(14)(B)(37) or under the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. When establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutiv e twenty-four (24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units th at were permanently shut down afte r this twenty-four (24)-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The Department shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tons/yr) in tons per year in the PAL permit to become effec tive on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the De partment is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of sixty (60) ppm NO X to a new rule limit of thirty (30) ppm, then the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). (ii)(b) For newly constructed units (which do no t include modifications to existing units) on which actual construction began after the tw enty-four (24)-month period the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units. (7) Contents of the PAL permit . The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (i)(7)(i)(N)(7)(a) through (x)(N)(7)(j). (i)(a) The PAL pollutant and the applicable sour ce-wide emission limitation in tpy tons per year. (ii)(b) The PAL permit effective date and the e xpiration date of the PAL (PAL effective period). (iii)(c) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (i)(10)(N)(10) before the end of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effectiv e period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by the Department. (iv)(d) A requirement that emission calculati ons for compliance purposes include emissions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (v)(e) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (i)(9)(N)(9). (vi)(f) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emi ssions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12) month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (i)(13)(i)(N)(13)(a). (vii)(g) A requirement that the major stationary source owner or operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (i)(12)(N)(12). (viii)(h) A requirement to retain the records re quired under paragraph (i)(13)(N)(13) on site. Such records may be retained in an electronic format. (ix)(i) A requirement to submit the reports re quired under paragraph (i)(14 )(N)(14) by the required deadlines. (x)(j) Any other requirements that the Department deems necessary to implement and enforce the PAL. (8) PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit . The requirements in paragraphs (i)(8)(i)(N)(8)(a) and (ii)(N)(8)(b ) apply to actuals PALs. (i)(a) PAL effective period . The Department shall specify a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (ii)(b) Reopening of the PAL permit . (A)(i) During the PAL effective period, th e Department must reopen the PAL permit to: (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL. (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offset s under paragraph (d)(2)Section (D). (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (i)(11)(N)(11). (B)(ii) The Department shall have discre tion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicab le federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date. (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any othe r requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the Department may impose on the ma jor stationary source under the State Implementation Plan. (3) Reduce the PAL if the Department determ ines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a Federal Clas s I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. (C)(iii) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (i)(8)(ii)(A)(1)(N)(8)(b)(i)(1) for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public pa rticipation requirements of paragraph (i)(5)(N)(5) (9) Expiration of a PAL . Any PAL which is not renewed in accord ance with the procedures in paragraph (i)(10)(N)(10) shall expire at the end of the PAL ef fective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (i)(9)(i)(N)(9)(a) through (v)(N)(9)(e) shall apply. (i)(a) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissi ons units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (i)(9)(i)(A)(N)(9)(a )(i) through (B)(N)(9)(a)(ii). (A)(i) Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (i)(10)(ii)(N)(10)(b), the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allo wable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as decided by the Department) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as re quired under paragraph (i)(10)(v)(N)(10)(e), such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted. (B)(ii) The Department shall decide whet her and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating al lowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Departme nt determines is appropriate. (ii)(b) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limitation on a twelve (12) month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than Continuous Emissions Mon itoring System (CEMS), Continuous Emissions Rate Monitoring System (CERMS), Predictive Emissions M onitoring System (PEMS), or Continuous Parameter Monitoring System (CPMS) to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation. (iii)(c) Until the Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (i)(9)(i)(A)(N)(9)(a)(i), the source shall continue to comply with a source-wide, mu lti-unit emissions cap equivale nt to the level of the PAL emission limitation. (iv)(d) Any physical change or change in the me thod of operation at the major stationary source will be subject to the nonattainment major NSR requirement s if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (c)(6)(B)(21). (v)(e) The major stationary source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any State or Federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except fo r those emission limitations that had been established pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(D)(L)(4), but were elim inated by the PAL in acco rdance with the provisions in paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(C)(N)(1)(c)(iii). (10) Renewal of a PAL . (i)(a) The Department shall follow the procedures sp ecified in paragraph (i)(5)(N)(5) in approving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the p ublic for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL level for th e source for consideration by the Department. (ii)(b) Application deadline . A major stationary source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Department to request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted at least six (6) months prior to, but not earlier than eight een (18) months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure th at the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source submits a complete application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall con tinue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. (iii)(c) Application requirements . The application to renew a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs (i)(10 )(iii)(A)(N)(10)(c)(i) through (D)(N)(10)(c)(iv). (A)(i) The information required in para (i)(3)(i)(N)(3)(a) through (iii)(N)(3)(c). (B)(ii) A proposed PAL level. (C)(iii) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation). (D)(iv) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (iv)(d) PAL adjustment . In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Department shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs (i)(10 )(iv)(A)(N)(10)(d)(i) and (B)(N)(10)(d)(ii). However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (i)(10)(iv)(C)(N)(10)(d)(iii). (A)(i) If the emissions level calculated in accord ance with paragraph (i)(6)(N)(6) is equal to or greater than eighty (80) percent of the PAL level, the Department may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (i)(10)(iv)(B)(N)(10)(d)(ii); or (B)(ii) The Department may set the PAL at a level that it determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that it determ ines to be appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic grow th in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factor s as specifically identified by the Department in its written rationale. (C)(iii) Notwithstanding para graphs (i)(10)(iv)(A)(N)(10)(d)(i) and (B)(N)(10)(d)(ii), (1) If the potential to emit of the major stati onary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater th an the potential to emit of the source; and (2) The Department shall not approve a rene wed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (i)(11)(N)(11) (increasing a PAL). (v)(e) If the compliance date for a state or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Department has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewa l or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first. (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period. (i)(a) The Department may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (i )(11)(i)(A)(N)(11)(a)(i) through (D)(N)(11)(a)(iv). (A)(i) The owner or operator of the major stati onary source shall submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to th e increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL. (B)(ii) As part of this application, the majo r stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the sma ll emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivale nt controls on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT anal ysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply wi th a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding ten (10) years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. (C)(iii) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (i)(11)(i)(A)(N)(11)(a)(i), regardless of th e magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These em issions unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the nonattainment major NSR program process (for example, LAER), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. (D)(iv) The PAL permit shall require that the in creased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modifi cation becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) The Department shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equi valent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (i)(11)(i)(B)(N)(11)(a)(ii)), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units. (iii)(c) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (i)(5)(N)(5). (12) Monitoring requirements for PALs . (i)(a) General Requirements. (A)(i) Each PAL permit must contain enforceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL perm it must be based on sound science and meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and ma nipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the PAL permit. (B)(ii) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set fort h in paragraphs (i)(12)(ii)(A)(N)(12)(b)(i) through (D)(N)(12)(b)(iv) and must be approved by the Department. (C)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(12)(i)(B)(N )(12)(a)(ii), you may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph (i)(12)(i )(A)(N)(12)(a)(i) if approved by the Department. (D)(iv) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this regulation renders the PAL invalid. (ii)(b) Minimum Performance Requirements for Approved Monitoring Approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches when conduc ted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs (i)(12)(iii)(N)( 12)(c) through (ix)(N)(12)(i): (A)(i) Mass balance calculations for activities using coatings or solvents; (B)(ii) Continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS); (C)(iii) Continuous parameter monitoring syst em (CPMS) or Predictive emissions monitoring system (PEMS); and (D)(iv) Emission Factors. (iii)(c) Mass Balance Calculations. An owner or operator using mass balance calculations to monitor PAL pollutant emissions from activities using coating or solvents shall meet the following requirements: (A)(i) Provide a demonstrated means of valida ting the published content of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by all materi als used in or at the emissions unit; (B)(ii) Assume that the emissions unit emits all of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by any raw material or fuel used in or at the emi ssions unit, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for in the process; and (C)(iii) Where the vendor of a material or fuel, wh ich is used in or at the emissions unit, publishes a range of pollutant content from such material, the ow ner or operator must use the highest value of the range to calculate the PAL pollutant emissions unless the Department determines there is site-specific data or a site-specific monitoring program to support another content within the range. (iv)(d) CEMS. An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (A)(i) CEMS must comply with applicable Pe rformance Specifications 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B; and (B)(ii) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes while the emissions unit is operating. (v)(e) CPMS or PEMS. An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (A)(i) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site-specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and (B)(ii) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analy ze, and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes, or at another less frequent interval approv ed by the Department, while the emissions unit is operating. (vi)(f) Emission factors. An owner or operator using emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (A)(i) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' development; (B)(ii) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and (C)(iii) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation t esting to determine a site-specific emission factor within six (6) months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Department determines that testing is not required. (vii)(g) A source owner or operator must reco rd and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations or opera tional restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, un less another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit. (viii)(h) Notwithstanding the requirements in para graphs (i)(12)(iii)(N)(12)(c) through (vii)(N)(12)(g), where an owner or operator of an emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating points of the emissions unit, the Department shall, at the time of permit issuance: (A)(i) Establish default value(s) for determ ining compliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or (B)(ii) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating cond itions when there is no correlation between monitored paramete r(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL. (ix)(i) Re-validation. All data used to establis h the PAL pollutant must be re-validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid mean s approved by the Department. Such testing must occur at least once every five (5) years after issuance of the PAL. (13) Recordkeeping requirements . (i)(a) The PAL permit shall require an owner or ope rator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance with any requirement of para graphSection (i)(N) and of the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's twelve (12) mont h rolling total emissions, for five (5) years from the date of such record. (ii)(b) The PAL permit shall require an owner or ope rator to retain a copy of the following records for the duration of the PAL effective period plus five (5) years: (A)(i) A copy of the PAL permit application and any applications for revisions to the PAL; and (B)(ii) Each annual certification of compliance pursu ant to Title V and the data relied on in certifying the compliance. (14) Reporting and notification requirements . The owner or operator shall submit semi-annual monitoring reports and prompt devia tion reports to the Department in accordance with the applicable Title V operating permit program. The reports shall meet th e requirements in paragraphs (i)(14)(i)(N)(14)(a) through (iii)(N)(14)(c). (i)(a) Semi-Annual Report. The semi-annual report sha ll be submitted to the Department within thirty (30) days of the end of each reporting period.
