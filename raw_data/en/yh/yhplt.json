Jayant Udgaonkar National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru The protein can spontaneously misfold to form beta-sheet rich oligomeric structures that have been correlated with the propensity to get prion disease. We have examined the structural changes that happen in the monomeric mouse prion protein upon initiation of misfolding by real time NMR (in collaboration with Ranabir Das), hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry and other methods. In my talk, I will discuss the sequence of structural changes that have to occur in the prion protein before the misfolding reaction can commence. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 7 9.30 AM - 10.00 AM Protein structures by single particle electron cryo microscopy Vinothkumar MRC-LMB, Cambridge, UK Electrons and electron microscopy have the power to image individual atoms. In the study of inorganic materials, resolutions better than 1 \u00c5ngstrom are routinely achieved. However, this requires high electron dose and radiation damage by the electron beam, which means that structure determination of biological molecules requires averaging multiple molecular images. Together with radiation damage, electron beam-induced movement and the need for higher signal to noise are limiting factors for biological specimens and the resolutions that was achieved by CryoEM until recently has remained low. During the last few years, there has been enormous progress in the determination of three-dimensional biological structures by CryoEM, allowing maps to be obtained with higher resolution and from fewer images than required previously. This is due principally to the introduction of a new type of direct electron detector that has 2- to 3-fold higher detective quantum efficiency (DQE) than available previously, and to the improvement of the computational algorithms for image processing. Using selected biological molecules as examples, I will describe how these advances result in high-resolution structures of proteins and computationally separate different conformational states of biological macromolecules. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 8 10.00 AM - 10.30 AM Studying the role of post-translational modifications observed during the Herpes infection Ranabir Das National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Post-translational modification of proteins by chains of ubiquitin (Ub) molecules has long been known to play several functions in the inducible and reversible control of signaling pathways. Ubiquitylation is a multistep process where several classes of enzymes function in a sequential regulated manner. First, Ub is activated by an activating enzyme (E1). The activated ubiquitin is then conjugated to the conjugating enzymes (E2s). The E2s interacts with another class of proteins known as ubiquitin ligase (E3s), which function to transfer ubiquitin to the targeted protein. Repeated cycles of ubiquitylation can assemble a poly-ubiquitin chain on a substrate protein. A substrate tagged with a particular form of poly-ubiquitin chains (K48-linked chains) are destined to be degraded by the macro-molecular machinery known as the 26S proteasome. It has been reported earlier that viruses can hijack the Ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway to suppress anti-viral responses. In this talk, we will report recent results that provide molecular mechanism of how the herpes simplex virus may modulate this pathway and other post-translational modifications for an effective infection. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 9 RNA, DNA and their interactions 12.00 PM - 1.00 PM Genetic cardiomyopathy: One model embodying one prime future direction of biology and medicine, and modern therapeutic approaches James A. Spudich Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California With the advent of technologies for sequencing the entire human genome in a cost-effective manner, this decade and those to come will see an exponential increase in our understanding of the genetics that underlies human diseases. And where we have a deep understanding of the biochemical and biophysical basis of the machineries and pathways involved in those genetic changes, there will be opportunities to develop modern therapeutics that specifically target the actual machinery and pathways altered by individual mutations. Prime examples of such genetic disease, are classes of hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies that result from single amino-acid substitutions in one of several proteins that make up the cardiac sarcomere. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy alone affects ~1 in 500 individuals worldwide, and it is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. I will describe approaches we are taking to understand the molecular basis of the changes in power output that result from these mutations, which have yielded major surprises along the way. Small molecules binding to the mutant sarcomeric protein complex, now in clinical trials, should be able to mitigate the effects of hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy mutations at their sources, leading to possible new therapeutic approaches for these genetic diseases. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 10 12.00 PM - 12.30 PM Role of transcriptional enhancers in gene regulation Dimple Notani National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Genes are regulated by distal regulatory elements known as enhancers that exert their function on target genes by establishing looping with the promoter. ENCODE (ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) has revealed thousands of enhancers populate mammalians genomes where they act in cell-type specific manner. Although discovered over thirty-five years ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying enhancer functions still remain poorly understood. Recently, another layer of complexity has been uncovered by the discovery that in addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Different roles of eRNAs in gene regulation are just emerging. Using genomic techniques that quantify the alterations in nascent transcription and three-dimensional architecture we have shown that these eRNAs are required for gene activation and establishing looping with the promoter. Further, they mostly are involved in cis-gene regulation and act in a sequence specific manner. Interestingly, high resolution chromatin structures reveal a complex pre-existing network of multiple enhancers, which mediate their effects on target genes in a hierarchical order. This phenomenon warrants a new model of enhancer function that depends on the strength of other enhancers where eRNA-mediated recruitment of protein cargo ultimately determines the strength and position of target loci in three-dimensional space of nucleus. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 11 12.30 PM - 1.00 PM Insights into micro RNA biogenesis and their functions in plants P.V. Shivaprasad National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Micro (mi)RNAs are a class of small RNA molecules resulting from RNA silencing pathways across eukaryotes. These 21-22 nt RNAs associate with protein partners called Argonautes to target nucleic acids having high base-pair complementarity. miRNAs regulate various aspects of plant development, typically acting as second-generation gene switches controlling expression of primary gene switches, the transcription factors and their co-factors. Intriguingly, miRNAs are also capable of arresting invading viruses and promote resistance to bacterial and fungal infections. Our lab focuses on various aspects of small RNA biogenesis and their functions, using genetic, molecular, bioinformatic and biochemical approaches. We have identified at least two novel mechanisms that regulate miRNA biogenesis in plants. We have previously shown that miRNA:miRNA* loop length plays a prominent role in miRNA biogenesis. In addition, we find that specific GC signature along the primary miRNA transcript is required for proper processing of these precursors. I will also discuss functions of few miRNAs that regulate phenotypes such as leaf development and secondary metabolism, taking examples from less conserved miRNAs that contribute towards clade/family specific phenotypes. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 12 4.00 PM - 4.30 PM Structure to signaling: Understanding biological roles and mechanisms of non-coding RNAs in bacteria Arati Ramesh National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru To sense and respond to their environment is a fundamental requirement for all organisms. A major mode of signal sensing in response to changing environments is via non-coding RNAs. This is especially evident in bacteria, where ligand-sensing riboswitches and RNA-protein complexes control important processes such as growth, metabolism, adaptations and stress response. We are interested in understanding mechanisms of RNA-mediated response to environmental cues. We have discovered a class of small RNAs that specifically recruit proteins containing the RNA-binding ANTAR domain, in response to metabolic cues in many gut bacteria. Metabolite induced phospho- cascades activate the ANTAR protein for RNA recognition. Using a combination of RNA-protein biochemistry, biophysics and genetics we uncover the mechanism by which these small RNAs function. Our broad bioinformatic analyses suggest that the ANTAR protein-RNA regulatory network is widely prevalent across bacteria, and that the central tenets for gene regulation by ANTAR may be conserved in nature. These findings open new avenues to address RNA-mediated mechanisms of signaling in pathogenic bacteria such as mycobacteria and pseudomonas where the biological roles of non-coding RNAs are poorly understood. In addition, we are currently investigating the presence of these small RNAs and their possible function in eukaryotes. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 13 4.30 PM - 5.00 PM Regulation of DNA double-strand break repair in bacteria Anjana Badrinarayanan National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru DNA damage is a threat to genome stability and unrepaired damage, including double-strand breaks (DSBs), can lead to loss of genetic information as well as cell death. Cells in all domains of life can faithfully repair DSBs via homologous recombination. While recombination has been well-characterized biochemically, the spatial organization and regulation of this process inside cells is less understood. To study recombination in the context of living cells, I developed a system to introduce site-specific DSBs at various locations across the chromosome of the bacterium, Caulobacter, and probed DSB processing and repair using a combination time-lapse microscopy and deep-sequencing techniques. In this talk, I will first describe the spatial organization of the repair process and how it is coordinated with chromosome replication, organization and segregation. I will then discuss a novel assay to measure DSB processing in vivo and the mechanism by which this is regulated. Together, these studies provide important insight into the effect of DSBs on chromosome organization and segregation as well as the mechanisms used by cells to ensure that genomic integrity is maintained during the repair process. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 14 5.00 PM - 5.30 PM The genetic landscape of bacteria in prolonged stationary phase Aswin Seshasayee National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Prolonged stationary-phase is an approximation of natural environments presenting a range of stresses and require alternative metabolic pathways for survival. This study describes the repertoire of mutations accumulating in starving E. coli populations in lysogeny broth. A wide range of mutations accumulate over the course of one month in stationary-phase. SNPs constitute 64% of all mutations. Majority of these mutations are non- synonymous and are located at conserved loci. There is an increase in genetic diversity in the evolving populations over time. Simulations of stationary-phase evolution suggest that the maximum frequency obtained by mutations in our experimental populations can not be explained by neutral drift. Moreover there is frequent genetic parallelism across populations suggesting that these mutations are under positive selection. Finally functional analysis of mutations suggests that regulatory mutations are frequent targets of selection. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 15 6.00 PM - 7.00 PM TET methylcytosine oxidases, immune responses and cancer Anjana Rao La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California USA Department of Pharmacology, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, California, USA Some years ago, our lab discovered that enzymes of the TET (Ten-Eleven Translocation) family were a new class of epigenetic regulators that altered the modification status of cytosine bases in DNA. The three mammalian TET enzymes - TET1, TET2 and TET3 - successively oxidize the methyl yield termed oxidized methylcytosines, oxi-mC) facilitate DNA demethylation and are also novel epigenetic marks. DNA methylation has long been linked to develop-mental processes and to oncogenesis; similarly TET proteins, which alter DNA modification status, are implicated in numerous biological processes, including cell lineage specification, embryonic development, neuronal function, somatic cell reprogramming and cancer. NCBS Annual Talks Futures in Biology 16 Thursday,January 12, 2017 Neuroscience 9.00 AM - 9.30 AM Honey Bee Daily Foraging - Molecular Biology of Animal Behavior under Natural Conditions Axel Brockmann National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru, India My lab is interested in the organization and mechanisms of animal behavior. How do animals do what they do and what are the underlying neural and molecular mechanisms? Our primary experimental paradigm is daily foraging activity of honey bees. Honeybee foragers continuously fly back and forth between the nest and a food source over the whole day and they do this as long as the food source is rewarding. Most, if not all, of the famous sensory and behavioral capabilities of honey bees, e.g. color perception, time-memory, concept formation, have been demonstrated using this natural behavior. My lab started using this behavioral paradigm to study molecular mechanisms underlying animal behavior under natural conditions. We started our exploration using two different approaches: (1.) time-training and clock gene expression, and (2.) foraging activity induced immediate early gene (IEG) expression. First results indicate that time training of honey bees leads to changes in clock gene expression and continuous foraging behavior is associated with up-regulation of different IEGs and candidate downstream genes. We think both findings open the possibility to identify molecular processes involved in specific behavioral responses during daily foraging. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 17 9.30 AM - 10.00 AM Trumping fear: What goes up must come down Sumantra Chaterjee National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Annual 2017 Futures in Biology 18 10.00 AM - 10.30 AM Altered neural function as a consequence of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling and SOCE in neurons Gaiti Hasan for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru, India Inositol-1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) is a key cellular signaling molecule that functions downstream of specific G-protein coupled receptors and links GPCR activation to changes in intracellular Ca2+. The primary cellular target of IP3 is the endoplasmic reticulum localized ligand-gated calcium channel, the IP3 receptor (IP3R). We also study the consequences of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which is stimulated upon IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER-store. My group's interest is to understand the developmental and physiological consequences of IP3 signaling and SOCE in neurons in the context of the whole organism. This requires that we perturb IP3R function and SOCE specifically in neurons and not in other cell types. The ubiquitous expression of the IP3R as well as STIM and Orai in multiple cell types in all multicellular organisms is a challenge for achieving this aim. Traditionally, cellular functions of ubiquitous proteins have been addressed using pharmacological methods on cells in culture. However, this approach does not allow an understanding of the physiological and/or developmental function of the targeted protein in the context of the whole organism. Sophisticated genetic tools, either available or developed by us in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, have helped in understanding the consequences of cell and tissue specific abrogation of IP3R function as well as SOCE. I will discuss our recent findings in this area. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 19 Developmental Biology 11.00 AM - 12.00 PM TBA Utpal Banerjee University of California, Los Angeles, USA TBA 12.00 AM - 12.30 PM The roles of actomyosin in secretion Benny Shilo Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel Releasing content from large vesicles measuring several micrometers in diameter poses exceptional challenges to the secretory system. An actomyosin network commonly coats these vesicles, and is thought to provide the necessary force mediating efficient cargo release. We follow the spatial and temporal dynamics of the formation of this actomyosin coat around large vesicles and the resulting vesicle collapse, in live Drosophila melanogaster salivary glands. We identify the Formin family protein Diaphanous (Dia) as the main actin nucleator involved in generating this structure, and uncover Rho as an integrator of actin assembly and contractile machinery activation comprising this actomyosin network. High-resolution imaging reveals a unique cage-like organization of myosin II on the actin coat. This myosin arrangement requires branched-actin polymerization, and is critical for exerting a non-isotropic force, mediating efficient vesicle contraction. I will discuss an activity-driven instability that leads to the clustering of myosin II and branched actin. I will also present a negative-feedback loop whereby branched actin leads to inactivation of Rho, as content release of the vesicle is competed, to promote actin disassembly by blocking actin nucleation. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 20 12.30 PM - 1.00 PM Gap junctions instruct chemical synapse formation and dendritic growth VatsalaThirumalai National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru, India The formation of chemical synapses between neurons is a carefully orchestrated process. Molecular signals and electrical activity play critical roles in chemical synaptogenesis. During development, gap junctions between neurons (electrical synapses) are upregulated in a time window that precedes chemical synapse formation. It has been suggested that electrical synapses could instruct chemical synapse formation by enhancing correlated firing between connected pairs. I will present evidence that, indeed, electrical synapses are required for normal wiring of the cerebellum in zebrafish. Using TALEN-mediated genome editing, we generated zebrafish lacking a key neural gap junction protein, connexin 35 (Cx35). Electrophysiological and ultrastructural analysis revealed reduced chemical synapse density in Purkinje neurons of mutant fish at 7 days post fertilization (dpf). Time lapse imaging of Purkinje neurons upto 7 dpf showed that dendritic arbors grew less between 6 and 7dpf in mutants compared to wild type. Taking these results together, we propose a model in which Cx35-mediated gap junctions regulate chemical synaptogenesis by providing growth cues for dendrites. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 21 1.00 PM - 1.30 PM A temperature-dependent shift in dietary preference alters the viable temperature range of Drosophila Suzanne Eaton Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Germany How cold-blooded animals adapt their behaviour and physiology to survive seasonal changes in temperature is not completely understood - even for well-studied model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we show that Drosophila respond to high and low temperature extremes by modifying their feeding behaviour. Above 15C, Drosophila feed and lay eggs on yeast. In contrast, below 15C, Drosophila prefer to feed and lay eggs on plant material. The different lipids present in yeast and plants improve survival at high and low temperatures, respectively. Yeast lipids promote high temperature survival by increasing systemic insulin signalling. This expands the range over which developmental rate increases with temperature, suggesting that faster nutrient utilization is required to fuel biochemical reactions driven faster by kinetic energy. In addition to speeding development, yeast lipids increase fertility. Thus, yeast provide cues that could help Drosophila to exploit a transient summer food resource. Plant lipids, on the other hand, are required to maintain membrane lipid fluidity at low temperature, and increase cold-resistance of larvae and adults. The cold-resistance and lowered insulin signalling conferred by feeding on plants allows adults to survive for many months at temperatures consistent with overwintering in temperate climates. Thus, temperature-dependent changes in feeding behaviour produce physiological changes that could promote seasonal adaption. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 22 Health: Better or worse 4.00 PM - 4.30 PM Calcium signaling: a microcosm of the new cell biology Patrick Hogan La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, California, USA The STIM-ORAI pathway is one of the cornerstones of cellular calcium signalling. Its core mechanism is that the ER-resident regulatory protein STIM1 detects reduced ER-luminal calcium during physiological signalling and triggers a calcium current through the plasma membrane calcium channel ORAI1. We have been examining the subtle choreography of STIM and ORAI, their modulators, and their downstream effectors in living cells, focusing on three general areas. First, we have undertaken parallel studies of STIM and ORAI as isolated proteins and in their native cellular context to dissect the protein conformational changes in STIM and ORAI themselves that underlie their biological function. Second, we have applied single-molecule tracking and other subdiffraction imaging techniques in living cells to locate ORAI channels in relation to modulatory proteins and membrane lipid nanodomains and, more broadly, to examine the dynamic reorganization of the ER-plasma membrane junctions where STIM engages ORAI during signalling. Third, we have paired protein-biochemical approaches with genome-wide monitoring of mRNA transcription to investigate the role of calcium signals in the balance between T cell activation and T cell unresponsiveness. Each line of experimentation addresses questions specific to cellular calcium signalling. However, the analysis of STIM-ORAI signalling also serves as a case study in applying newly available tools that are driving advances in all areas of cell biology. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 23 4.30 PM - 5.00 PM Extensive interactions of Plasmodium with host cell organelles during liver stage malarial infections Varadharajan Sundaramurthy National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru, India Plasmodium parasites undergo dramatic growth during the liver stage malarial infection, multiplying from a single parasite to tens of thousands of merozoites in couple of days while remaining within a vacuole inside a single infected hepatocyte. This rapid growth necessitates extensive interactions of the parasite with the host cellular machinery. While several studies have explored these interactions using in vitro experimental systems, relatively little is known about the contours of these interactions in vivo. We have embarked on an approach to understand these interactions using unbiased ultrastructure studies and quantitative image analysis in 3d. Our results have uncovered several previously unappreciated facets of liver stage pathogenesis and reveal extensive membrane contact sites of Plasmodium vacuole membrane (PVM) with diverse host cell organelles. Most interestingly, our results reveal an unexpected link between liver stage Plasmodium development and the hepatic polarity machinery. These results will lead to better understanding of pathogenesis mechanisms during the enigmatic liver stage of malaria. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 24 5.00 PM - 5.50 PM Challenges, lessons and opportunities at the interface of research niches with the health ecosystem Sudhir Krishna National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru, India I will trace our journey of engaging St. John's medical college with a program in haematology genomics and the evolution of an infectious disease ecosystem. I will also update with our work on CD66/Notch high cells in human cervical cancers and focus on cellular migration. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 25 6.00 PM - 7.00 PM Biogenesis and function of the autophagosome membrane Randy Schekman University of California, Berkeley, USA NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 26 Friday, January 13, 2017 Ecology and Evolution 9.00 AM - 9.30 AM A decade of tiger population genetics suggests conservation priorities Uma Ramakrishnan National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Tigers are emblematic of conservation, and India harboring around 60% of the world's wild tigers. While the total numbers of tigers in India has increased due to focused conservation efforts, only 10 populations have more than 50 individuals, and the median population size is 19. The key issues that face tiger populations today are genetic isolation, and subsequent extinction due to stochastic effects. Genetic data from contemporary and extinct populations have allowed us to quantify the (a) extent and timing of a historical, human-induced demographic bottleneck and (b) loss of connectivity between populations over the last 150 years. Genome-level data from 10,000 SNPs helps identify 'tiger landscapes' and potentially 'at risk' populations that could be targets of conservation action. The future survival of tigers is critically dependent on exchange between these fragmented populations. But is such connectivity possible given current models of economic development in India? Genetic data from 116 individuals from the Central Indian tiger landscape reveals how human footprints, agriculture and forests impact connectivity. Modeling future landscapes under different development scenarios allows us to assess how tiger connectivity, extinction and genetic variation will change. Our results suggest that connectivity between populations will decrease with high risk of local extinction in many small and/or isolated populations. Decreasing extinction will require stepping-stone populations that act as corridors between larger populations. Our results can prioritize mitigation efforts associated with development activities, providing a link between science and policy. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 27 9.30 AM - 10.00 AM Forest-grassland mosaics: history, dynamics and an uncertain future Sankaran National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Forest-grassland mosaics, characterized by abrupt boundaries between the two contrasting vegetation types, are an enigmatic and puzzling feature of many landscapes. Although traditionally believed to be artifacts of human activity, paleo-ecological evidence has revealed that many of these mosaics are in fact ancient ecosystems that predate human presence, often supporting unique biodiversity. They have been documented from diverse array of sites across the globe, ranging from the tropics to temperate regions. Their occurrence under these diverse climatic and biotic conditions has made it challenging to derive general theories for the mechanisms creating, structuring and maintaining these mosaics. Here, I discuss some of our ongoing work in one such forest-grassland mosaic, the iconic montane shola-grasslands of the Western Ghats: from their history, to the factors maintaining these mosaics, the conservation challenges they face, both currently and in the face of future climate change, and the implications of our results for a broader understanding of what structures these mosaics globally. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 28 10.00 AM - 10.30 AM How to make a bacterium: A recipe of genes Deepa Agashe National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Bacteria encompass an enormous diversity of phenotypes, encoded by an equally diverse set of genomes. We aim to understand the evolutionary processes that lead to this genomic diversity, focusing on genomic GC content, codon use, tRNA genes. We test various recipes for bacterial success, answering key questions such as: which genes should be retained, and in how many copies? Which codons should be used, and how best to translate them? Our results indicate multiple, dynamic blueprints for bacterial genome evolution that emerge via both stochastic and deterministic processes. 11.00 AM - 12.00 PM Biology for meeting the environmental challenges of the 21st century Kamal Bawa University of Massachusetts, Boston, and Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, Bengaluru The major challenges for conservation biology remain: a) curtailment of biodiversity loss, b) better understanding of land use transitions, and the impact of such transitions on biodiversity c) enhancing sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems services, d) mitigation of climate change through green pathways, and e) highlighting the role of biodiversity in meeting sustainable development goals. For each of these areas I address major issues, approaches to address these issues, and potential new areas of inquiry. I will largely draw upon examples from the work of my group and the work of my colleagues at ATREE. I will conclude with comments on the opportunities conservation biology offers to address significant scientific issues and the interactions between society and nature. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 29 12.00 AM - 12.30 PM How flies determine the location of an odor source Sanjay Sane National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Insects routinely forage in complex sensory environments. Typically, the search for a food or pheromone source begins with a whiff of odor, which triggers a flight response. Insects then track turbulent plumes of odor until they approach the vicinity of the odor source. However, pinpointing the precise location of the odor source requires the use of both visual and olfactory modalities. We have investigated the basic rules of this process in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster specifically asking how these flies are able to determine the precise location of an odor source amidst a visually cluttered environment. Our experiments show that the decision of flies to land on a putative odor source is biased by the presence of other visual objects in its vicinity. Flies are more likely to land on visually distinct objects that are close to the odor source, if they are of a higher visual contrast. There are significant quantifiable alterations in their search trajectories based on the presence or absence of one or more visually-distinct objects in the vicinity of the odor source. Our experiments also indicate the possibility of olfactory \"working memory\" that enables them to continue their search even when the olfactory feedback is reduced or absent. Together, these results allow us to gain insight into some basic rules that the flies may use to determine where the source of odor is located. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 30 12.30 PM - 1.00 PM From Insect Dreams to Virtual Reality Shannon Olsson National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru One of the most important tasks for any organism is to identify objects in the world around them. All organisms must, for example, discriminate what to eat from what might eat them. Identifying complex objects in an even more complex world is a difficult task. Most insects are solitary, which means they must initially identify some objects, such as food or enemies, innately. Our group is interested in how insects identify objects across different environments, and how they can detect new introduced objects in an environment, such as invasive species. Using field assays, multivariate analysis, and physiological analyses, we have found that cosmopolitan species of hoverflies use unique combinations of visual and olfactory cues to identify flowers in tropical South India, the alpine Himalayas, or cold temperate Sweden. For the latter question, we have compared olfactory processing of host odors for different fruit-specific populations of Tephritid flies that have recently diverged in preference for various fruit within the past 300 years. Finally, we are quantitatively characterizing object identification itself using a novel chemo-visual virtual reality arena. We hope to offer a comparative approach to understand how animals parse the environment to identify objects in nature.

Contemporary historical, political and economic documents giveglimpses of the complex knowledge systems in botany and medicine that were the underpinnings of India Trade in the beginning of the 1st Millennium. In ancient India the \"healer (bhisaj), a demon-killer, the plague-dispeller\" with knowledge of \"those herbs, the firstborn of the gods\" was a revered individual and represented all levels of Indian society. Documents on Indian botanical medical uses found across Asia, the middle East and Greco-Roman world, attest that Indian plant medicines were available all across Asia, in the Middle East and Europe. By the Middle Ages \"India trade was the backbone of the international economy\" and \"medicinal substances and spices of India were primary commodities.\" At the end of the 15th century, Spain and Portugal, at the farthest end of the European export market, decided to enter India trade directly. The search for shorter and direct sea routes to India, to acquire spices and medicines, was the driving force behind the voyages of discovery that profoundly changed the map and history of the world. Soon after their arrival Europeans found that their medicines were inadequate for the tropics, and that Indian traditional medical systems had powerful therapies, and Indian physicians were \"very well acquainted with medicine.\" So an important commodity Europeans collected in India was the rich legacy of regional botanical medical knowledge systems for their use in India, and tropical colonies in Asia and the Americas. And for the next 250 years, physicians and scholars and civil servants in the NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 33 employ of the Portuguese, Dutch and the British, documented regional medicinal, agricultural and horticultural knowledge systems of India from scholars and practitioners in India, who largely remain unidentified. These European works on Indian medical botany and therapeutics, highlighted in the exhibition Seeds of Culture, are vital sources of regional folk medical knowledge of India not found in classical Indian medical texts. These works document uses of individual medicinal plants, not formulations, and refer to diseases more in contemporary medical terminology. With the critical need for new medicines, especially for chronic diseases, \"natural compounds for which innocuous long-term use in human populations has already been documented might be more tolerable and acceptable in disease prevention...\"(Commentary, Dries et al., PNAS, 2012). One challenge for biomedical institutions in India is how to integrate the sophisticated technologies of modern sciences with the age-old therapeutic knowledge unique to India, to discover their underlying chemistry, and develop medicines to treat intractable diseases. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 34 5.00 PM - 5.30 PM The predicaments of institutional legacy: The archives of TIFR and what they tell us about molecular biology Indira Chowdhury Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bengaluru Institutions recall their past for a purpose \u2014 a purpose that is often embedded in the present. Institutions and the people who work within them do not mechanically reproduce the past, as the sociolinguist, Charlotte Linde tells us, rather, they work the past, representing it each time in new but related ways for a particular purpose, in a particular form to create a particular desired present and future. This presentation focuses on the history of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, a premier scientific institution that was founded by Homi Bhabha in 1945 and analyses the nature of Bhabha's legacy. Reflecting on the nature of the Nehruvian scientific vision as well as the nature of institutional practices that Bhabha put in place, this presentation will focus on the ways in which legacies are put in place within institutions. What elements of Bhabha's legacy defined TIFR as an institution? What enables legacies to remain alive in new institutions that the parent institution might create? Looking specifically at Molecular Biology which had a rather late start within TIFR, this presentation will analyze the detours that that this discipline took by examining archival records and oral history interviews. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 35 5.30 PM - 6.00 PM Can neuroscience address India's public health needs: from myths to reality Vikram Patel Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine The government of India has recently published a national survey showing that about70 million adult Indians suffer from a mental disorder and nearly 90% of them have never received any treatment. Such massive treatment gaps are also true for many other developing countries. Despite billions of dollars invested in neuroscience, there appears to be little impact on influencing population health more generally, and the lives of those who are affected by mental disorders more specifically. This lecture will make the case that translational research is an essential component of the menu of neuroscience in India. Using examples of ongoing research, the lecture will highlight tangible opportunities for neuroscientific approaches to inform the mechanisms of how social determinants affect brain development and behaviour, enable the assessment of normal and deviant development, and influence the design of tailored interventions which can be scaled up through the public health system. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 36 6.00 PM - 6.30 PM Research and the endless frontier Kris Gopalakrishnan 6.30 PM - 7.30 PM Panel Discussion Moderated by Janaki Nair NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 37 Saturday, January 14, 2016 Theory and Biology 9.00 AM - 9.30 AM A cell for every song U.S. Bhalla National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru Sequences of events are ubiquitous in sensory, motor, and cognitive function.Typically, a correctly ordered sequence (such as a tune) has much greater salience than scrambled input. We employ experiments and computer models to study sequences in brain computation and memory. Using models that span the range from highly abstract 2 variable systems to complex multiscale electrical and chemical signaling, we show how chemical networks can recognize sequential synaptic input on dendrites. Specifically, successive and ordered inputs on nearby synapses over ~20 microns elicit strong responses, whereas scrambled inputs on the same synapses give weak responses. We suggest that this is an extremely powerful computational operation. We show that even in a random network such sequence recognition has combinatorial properties that potentially scale to match the combinatorics of possible sequential input representations. In other words, for every possible tune (or dance, or poem) there are many cells that can learn to recognize it. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 38 9.30 AM - 10.00 AM What Active Matter can do for biology Sriram Ramaswamy National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru The physics tradition of modelling collective phenomena in biology is not new. Why then the excitement about \"Active Matter\" as a way of looking at cells, tissue and organisms as living materials, and why should biologists care? My talk will offer some answers with examples from recent and current work as well as directions for the future. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 39 10.00 AM - 11.00 AM Subsurface microbial ecosystems: a photon flux and a metabolic cascade Albert Libchaber The Rockefeller University, New York Mud is a porous medium containing a high density of diverse microorganisms. It is out of equilibrium as the energy from a photon flux is dissipated by a cascade of biochemical reactions, mediated by the metabolisms of the constituent organisms. Despite its complexity, microbes in nature self-organize into simple reproducible patterns. We present two experiments in which the dynamics of natural mud coming to steady state are observed and modelled. In the first, the oxygen gradient produced by cyanobacteria in an imposed light gradient is measured. In the second, a thin front of oxygen-consuming microbes forms at the penetration depth of oxygen and moves with the changing oxygen gradient. NCBS Annual Talks 2017 Futures in Biology 40 Posters 1.
