By regulating time, temperature and consistency, I was able to form salt crystals into spherical structures. I inserted the spherical structure, as a crystal seed, into a highly concentrated salt solution where clear salt crystals would strengthen the structure by forming layers. With this research I investigated new approaches to fabrication technologies, aiming to form objects using natural resources from the sea. My previous teacher of chemistry, Marjon Dullemond helped me with specific chemical information for this project. With her help, I was able to brainstorm my ideas and substantiate my findings. "}
