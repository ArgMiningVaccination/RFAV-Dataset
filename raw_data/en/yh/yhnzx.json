Meditation is the practice of 'quieting' the mind, in order to cultivate a feeling of inner peace. It has its roots in a variety of cultural and spiritual settings, dating back hundreds of years, and has more recently been shown to improve both mental and physical well-being in a number of ways. Meditation and mindfulness practice can be undertaken at any time, alone or as part of a group.

Meditation in practice involves focusing on your breathing, posture and concentration in a relaxed setting, guided by an experienced practitioner. Both individual and group sessions are available. You may be asked to focus on an external object, such as a plant or candle flame, and the practitioner will guide you through the process of clearing your mind of all thoughts. Afterwards, you may feel your relaxed state continuous for some time after a session. Daily meditative practice is advised for lasting results. Please contact [Sam](/sam-may) for further details. "}
