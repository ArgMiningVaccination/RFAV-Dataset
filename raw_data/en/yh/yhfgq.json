They were absolutely right she is amazing. I cant wait to work with her. Shannon Re-alignment Lois is such a beautiful, talented healer! I cannot say enough about her gifts, her compassion, and her ability to hold space for your highest. I came in very much in need of a healing and re-balancing. I received both. Lois is a chiropractor for the soul:)) Sarah M Mental Healing Lois is amazing\u2014she is so easy to talk to and provides excellent tools to help you battle the every day life. I feel blessed to have met her!! Deanna A Healing the soul Although my dad was skeptical, he decided to try meeting with Lois. Lois is amazing!! You can tell by just the way she talks to you that she genuinely cares for your well-being and wants you to feel better! We can't say enough about how amazing Lois is and are looking forward to another session! Tom C A wonderful refresh! I went to Lois to clear out old energy, protect my energy, and get clarity. She offers a great insight and tools to do all that and more! I look forward to continuing this healing work in future sessions. Amanda A Meeting Lois I scheduled a free zoom to meet Lois and learn of her practice. And to see if she could help me. Her presence is very welcoming and comforting. She truly wants to know and understand you as she asks questions. And in turn, answers any of yours. I am looking forward to getting balanced. As she could see, I am not. And for her to \"see\" that, was a great validation to me. Holly B Blessed to be understood When you are stuck and have tried everything in your power to feel better Lois is the answer! Sometimes the answer is not known but intuitively she can help you release what you may subconsciously be holding onto. The release experienced is like nothing I have ever experienced and enjoyed. Thank you for Lois as her gifts and talents are unique and cherished by those she helps. Carrie S Lois is both gifted and dedicated. She is intuitive, open, and thoughtful and I find our sessions very productive and helpful. So grateful for Quantum Balance Erie. In tune Lois is so in tune with my emotions. She guides me to my answers and does so in such a non-judgmental way. She has helped me through a very difficult time in my life and continues to do so. C.L. Peace & Clarity I must say that weights were lifted, heart encouraged and a complete state of peace and well-being enveloped me the rest of my day : ) after having a beautiful session with Lois. Thank you !!! Tammy F Life changing! I worked with Lois using Zoom online for 4 sessions so far. It was a life-changing experience for me. I didn't know I had so much \"mucky\" energy that I needed to clear, and stories that needed to be reframed. Being honest, I was skeptical, but my therapist of all people recommended that I see an energy healer and after the first session I felt lighter. Session 2, even lighter, session 3, lighter yet! I found her technique to really work for me and she was able to give me homework that I could relate to. If you are on the fence, at least take advantage of her 20-minute free session. I am so thankful I found out about Lois! J. C. Compassionate & Empathetic Lois really listens to what you have to say. She is empathetic and offers real-life options for dealing with whatever you're going through. She \"hears\" you and validates your feelings. I'm so glad that I decided to give Lois at Quantum Balance Erie a call. Highly recommend! After one QB session, I feel like a different person and have begun a healing journey hopefully back to myself. Lois is the real deal and a shining light! I highly recommend Quantum Balance Erie! Highly Recommend! After one QB session, I feel like a different person and have begun a healing journey hopefully back to myself. Lois is the real deal and a shining light! I highly recommend Quantum Balance! - satisfied client \"K\" Lois is insightful, authentic, and sincere Wow, truthfully I wasn't sure what to expect from my appt with Lois. Well, let me say that it exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds. I'm so thankful that my path has connected with Lois and Quantum Balance. Insightful, authentic, sincere and blessed with a gift is how I describe Lois! I left my session feeling excited, but calm and very empowered to achieve my personal Quantum Balance. Thank you Lois and I'll see you in the spring! Lisa H Overwhelmingly grateful Lois truly cared for my well being, she almost immediately responded to my email with love and compassion, but it didn't end there! She then followed up via phone and worked with me to get me in that week. I was not just a number, not just another client. I found a true friend that day I walked into our session. It is such an incredible feeling to know that someone is in your corner, that someone is there to remind you how strong and powerful you are. Someone who will listen without judgment and provide you with positive uplifting words of encouragement and the tools you need to move forward. I will forever be grateful to Lois and can only smile when I think of all the people who will be led into her presence because they will have the opportunity to experience the light and love of this incredible woman. I cannot recommend their services enough, they have truly found a lifelong client in me. I found a true friend that day Infinite Possibilities taught me about my belief systems One of my greatest takeaways from the {Infinite Possibilities} course was how to deconstruct my belief system. We are who we are based on our core beliefs. {IP} was very helpful and my take away from the course was {learning and understanding that} I have the ability to think and rearrange my thoughts based on my belief system. And if I shift my belief system, then that will create other possibilities for me. https://youtu.be/0JcwCe28GuI Jada B. Infinite Possibilities works! {After taking Infinite Possibilities}I am still who you see on the outside but what has happened inside is the renewing of my heart AND spirit. {Before Infinite Possibilities} I didn't dare dream because whenever I shared a dream it was squashed. I often had \"thoughts\" of merely existing, no purpose after retirement, just go through life. {I now} Dare to Dream!! I don't worry about how or when it is going to happen. I just keep getting out of bed and do what I have to do, and {using the tools from Infinite Possibilities} now my dreams are coming true! Denise P Infinite Possibilities allowed me to GROW When I started the Infinite Possibilities class, having my own business all on my own & being successful at it was a long distance dream that I thought I would do later in the future, something that would happen later down the road. I wasn't sure how to get the confidence to make it my reality. Fear of the unknown and fear of \"owning it\" was holding me back from making it happen. And now here I am now a few months later & it's happening. I'm completely shocked and delighted because this vision has been a dream of mine for a long time & I just kept thinking later later later and after I started IP class, I realized it could be now now now. IP class gave me the tools to make my dream a reality. I am so grateful and feel so blessed because of it. Kimberly O Excellent Experience I would highly recommend Lois. She was caring, sensitive and very knowledgeable. I am hopeful now and feel I have some good tools to use. The Real Deal I have experienced positive and significant personal growth as a result of my quantum balance sessions with Lois. She provides a safe, comfortable environment and utilizes her knowledge of different energy techniques in a genuinely insightful, caring manner. Thank you for helping me Lois - your wisdom and kindness has had a profound impact on me! Jennifer N Lois really cares Lois helped me a lot. A lot of lightbulbs turned on during my time with her. You can tell she cares, she WANTS to help you. Thank you again Lois. Linda N Balancing Session I didn't know what to expect from my first visit with Lois. I was nervous and anxious (two of the reasons I was there in the first place) to express my insecurities with another person. Lois made me feel at ease, comfortable and able to express myself without fear of judgment. I learned so much about myself and why I feel and act the way I do. Lois helped me release a lot of pent-up emotions and self-doubt. It was a wonderful experience and I look forward to using the tools she taught me to become even more self-aware. Lori S Positively Resonating I had a wonderful first time experience Quantum Balance Erie with Lois Thompson. I was fully accepted and affirmed and felt so comfortable and safe. This was such a positive experience for me and RESONATED with life and vibrancy! Thank-You! Susan O *gratitude* I'm so grateful to God for lighting the path to your doorstep. I asked and it was delivered. Thank you for your knowledge, your teaching, your kind, loving service to this lifetime, and for helping me find a way to protect myself. I look forward to continuing this journey with you! Carrie M Worth every penny! I felt \"mucked up\" before I walked into Lois' office. When I walked out, I felt lighter, happier, and free. I took a salt bath according to her recommendations and I had the best night's sleep of my life. It's the day after, and I feel clear, calm, focused, and free of anxiety. I intend to do the homework I was given and I will definitely be returning for another session. Jennifer C Reiki with Julia I had been interested in a reiki session for some time. I had been having trouble in my upper back which conventional methods had not alleviated, and as a spiritual-minded person myself, had suspicions one or more of my chakras were 'off.' The session with Julia certainly lived up to my expectations! Very soothing, first off and in general. I left feeling absolutely no pain or tightness in the spot in my upper back, a feat which nearly never happens. In addition, my suspicions on my chakras were confirmed and she gave some advice on clearing them. Those of you who have been contemplating a reiki session yourself, stop contemplating! Vince S I left more than satisfied! Lois's compassion, intuitive capabilities and training in energy work combine to provide a meaningful and potent healing experience. You leave with hands on tools so that you can continue the work at home and in days and weeks to come. I left more than satisfied!!! Maura P Will definitely be back! As always Lois Thompson does an amazing job of using her skills and love to invoke important change. Lois is a true healer, and her services are desperately needed in this world. Thank you Lois for being a ray of light! Will definitely be back! Christian S Helps you release your negative energy I had such a great experience with Lois yesterday. I would recommend Quantum Balance of Erie to everyone. Lois really knows how to break through your barriers and help you release your negative energy. After my session I had people telling me that I sound different, more positive and upbeat than before. How great is that?! Nancy D Excellent experience Excellent experience. Lois is compassionate and competent and a joy to be around. Stephanie C Relief of grief Recently a family member passed away and I thought I was coping well. I was coughing and couldn't catch my breath - but figured it was the cold weather or I was catching something. It turns out I was holding my grief in; my body wanted me to release feelings/thoughts/ but I was in denial that it even existed. I was too busy taking care of those around me and figured \"I was fine!\". Thank God for Lois. She truly is an angel on earth and is helping me through this tough time. I feel lighter and a little more at peace with each visit. I can't explain what she does but I can tell you I leave there feeling WONDERFUL. I highly recommend Quantum Balance Erie. Lisa S Peaceful, Enlightening, Empowering What a beautiful experience! The appointment began with a warm and friendly greeting, as though I was meeting an old and dear friend. This was followed by easy conversation and healing in a relaxed and peaceful atmosphere. Every bit of this experience was beautiful: The music, the d\u00e9cor, the aromas, the healing experience and the feeling of camaraderie. Thank you, Lois, for a wonderful afternoon. Dayna Y Healing of old wounds Lois is a true healer with a magnificent gift. She helped me immensely with some old wounds and was able to get things moving that had felt stuck for a long time. I am so grateful for her healing attention. Jenn P Growing Together From my first appointment with Lois I've experienced so many life changes that I can't even begin to list them all. I've grown emotionally and spiritually and become physically stronger beyond anything I could have imagined. What I find most impressive about this experience, however, is how much growth and change I see in Lois's practices as well! Already a marvelous guide and healer - Lois continually explores and expands her knowledge and practices to give her very best to her clients! Christina W Deeper Work I came to Lois for help with some physical ailments that were plaguing me and have found, over the course of a few months, that the work we have done has changed my life so much more dramatically in so many more ways than I had intended or expected. Regardless of the level of which you wish to commit to your healing, YOU will find healing though, I am sure, and I can't recommend Lois more as a guide. Christina Anxiety and stress relief Lois is able to customize each session based on what I need that day. During this session, we did a little QiGong and Emotion Code. I arrived at my session stressed out from General life and the stress of house hunting. After the session, I felt a sense of peace and I felt lighter, ready to take on what life had to offer that day. I highly recommend that everyone tries at least one session! Missy M So pleased Lois has been instrumental in helping me out of my 2 year \"funk\". She is helping restore my energy as well as giving me the tools I need to maintain a healthy balance going forward. Andrea L Emotion Code I had an initial emotion code healing session with Lois. I have been going through a great deal emotionally, physically and mentally for a couple years. This subtle energy work was very effective - am still in process- to help with my integration and release of past trauma/experiences. Lois is very professional and knowledgeable. She is a healer and guide that is doing her work to assist others in wellness goals... Jan F Get rid of what bugs you If it is not visible or broken but something just doesn't feel right - Lois can probably help. I am so thankful she is part of my wellness team. Denise P Gems in our community I've been working with the practitioners from Quantum Balance Erie for a while now. And I can honestly say I've never felt better! I am a highly sensitive individual and the tools that they are teaching me are priceless! I am able to carry these tools to my family and better assist them in their energetic care. I have done many years of talk therapy and I feel that I have gained more healing in one session with QBE than I did in the cumulative years of talk therapy. The practitioners of QBE are making ripples in the world around us and work very hard to make our world a better place. Jennifer H Exactly what was needed Lois, thank you for everything! Our session met and exceeded any and all expectations. I've learned so much about me through you! I can't thank you enough! Linda N Responsive. Respectful. Refreshing. While every aspect of my time with Lois was productive and healing, it was most useful for me to be truly \"seen and heard\". So often I feel like the first half of every thing is a review of things I'm already versed in...or a practitioner is focusing on concepts I have yet to incorporate into my journey. Lois was able to quickly ascertain where my knowledge of energy work was...she really met me where I was at...and we could ease in at my comfort level. I was within my comfort zone...but also adequately challenged to shift my thinking. I didn't feel like this was a routine, one-size-fits-all checklist of care...it felt like I was being seen very individually and that care was tailored on the spot to be what I needed. Responsive. Respectful. Refreshing. I've been ready to break through some old paradigms and this was the perfect session for that. Thank you, Lois! Justine Emotional Healing Lois performed an emotional release on me that was life changing. I have suffered with throat and thyroid problems all my life and she helped me to release the emotions that were leading to my issues. I now feel like someone removed the noose that has been around my throat for as long as I can remember. Thank you Lois. I am so much lighter and freer now. Debbie R An exquisite unique enriching experience I like massages & get them regularly so when I learned of this opportunity for something different, I tried it. It was very transforming and it left me open to using my own resources to heal. Len P I experienced a shift in my energy I am a firm believer that the universe sends us what we need at the precise moment we need it. So when googled alternative health up popped Quantum Balance Erie. And my heart, mind, body, and spirit were yearning for balance. The session with Lois allowed me to clear my mind, process past and current emotions that directly impact my thoughts, actions, and clear some mental space. I experienced a shift in my energy both during and after the session. Lois is a wealth of knowledge and experienced practitioner in her field. The tools she has given me are life changing. Such a blessing to meet her and look forward to working with her again in the near future. Jada I feel lighter After one session with Lois my spirits are renewed, I feel lighter than ever. Amazing! The time (& money) I have invested with Lois Thompson have been LIFE-CHANGING!!! Since I suffer from a chronic disease, finding help (especially in Erie) has been very challenging. Lois has helped me both physically and mentally and I highly recommend her services to anyone seeking peace, BALANCE and contentment. Lauren Always Feel Better Always look forward to a visit with Lois and always feel better afterwards! Whether I'm having troubles emotionally or physically Lois manages to make me feel better than when I came in. Looking forward to my next visit. A very relaxing and caring experience. Deb S Reiki with Julia Very healing, mystical, magical and totally awesome! I felt like something dark was removed from my heart and I feel so much lighter - blessings to Julia and Quantum Balance:) Annie P Quantum Balance session with Lois This energy treatment by Lois was absolutely amazing!! I was able to divulge things to her that I had been holding inside for a very, very long time. She is truly a gifted healer and she spent extra time with me to help me work through some very serious emotional problems and distress. By the time our session was ending, I felt much stronger and able to take on daily stress more easily. If you can experience what Lois does then book an appointment as soon as possible. Reiki with Crystal Enhancement Great atmosphere,energy and knowledge . This was my first reiki session. I was slightly nervous at first but Julia was great at explaining everything and making me feel comfortable. I felt so relaxed and like I was sitting on a happy cloud of love all day. I will be returning for my tune ups. Kayla F Julia is very insightful The environment, the service, the friendly nature of the employees, it was all very nice. Everything is done very professionally and you review before, sometimes during, and after your session. Anybody looking for answers for questions they don't have answers to or just a release from the overwhelming Daily Grind I would recommend this. Aaron F Awesome Love it, Lois is super easy to talk to and does a wonderful job. I would definitely recommend!! Matt M Helped me to see limiting beliefs I just had my second session with Lois and it was again very helpful. She listened and was open, yet able to make very relevant suggestions. Her intuition was spot on. Lois helped me see some limiting beliefs and old but charged emotions I had not been able to access on my own and she helped me to start release them. Chris Lois is insightful I really enjoyed my latest session with Lois - she is so amazing and loving and creates such a safe place for healing and helps guide to help yourself stay protected in this world on a daily basis. Thank you so much Lois Annie P Non-judgmental Lois is so in tune with my emotions. She guides me to my answers and does so in such a non-judgmental way. She has helped me through a very difficult time in my life and continues to do so. Chris L Manifest Your Dreams I have been working hard on building my business and purchasing a house with my fiance. Life was progressing great, but I felt an energetic roadblock - I was not getting the results I wanted fast enough! I decided it was time for another Manifest Your Dreams session with Julia. My vision is reignited and I have regained my enthusiasm for this journey again! Sometimes, I begin doubting myself/my path and forget that I can only control my actions/intentions and not necessarily the results and that I need to ASK God/Angels/Universe for what I want! I am excited to see what unfolds over the next few weeks! I highly suggest trying one of these sessions! Julia is a great mentor/adviser! Empowered - Manifest Your Dreams Session I am so thrilled that Julia created a Manifest Your Dreams service! It's a unique, healing, heart-centered session that truly leaves you feeling empowered. She assists you in understanding the Law of Attraction, what actions will be helpful towards striving forward with your dreams, helps you identify and heal personal blocks and more. Healing helps facilitate change. I left our session knowing that I AM stronger than my worries & doubts regarding my dream. After identifying some underlying blocks that came to light during the session, I can learn from them, heal and move past them! I see them for what they are now. I am so excited for the road ahead, thank you Julia! Katie F Excellent practicioner \"Had a great experience thru Reiki thanks to Julia. She was very informative and skilled more so than I was used to with regular Reiki sessions. I felt welcome the entire time and she is very pleasant. Would definitely recommend for anyone familiar with reiki or in need of general stress relief, healing, or guidance. Do yourself a favor and see her.\" Michael S. A life changing experience \"In just two visits with Lois, I can't believe how she has made a difference in my life. I feel better in so many ways because she is helping me to help myself feel better every day. Lois feels like a friend you've known forever who wants nothing but the best for you and is here to help you be your best.\" Kathy B. Gifted \"Lois is truly gifted in what she does! She left me feeling better about my life and where I am going!\" Alicia G. Radiant Hope \"I love how I feel when I leave Lois' office. I feel refreshed, relieved and renewed. I am thankful for Lois and her strengths, wisdom, and guidance. I always feel comforted by her presence. I have had much success and growth thus far, so I thank and appreciate the workings of a truly blessed healer.\" Jessica W. A great experience. \"This is an excellent way to start the holidays and the new year. Thank you Lois for helping me to be all that I can be.\" Casey S. "}
