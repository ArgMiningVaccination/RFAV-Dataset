Yes No b) DISABILITY / EXTENDED STAY Did the injury or complication result in disability at the time of discharge and/or a prolonged hospital stay (or re -admission or out-patient treatment) or death? 1 Disability at discharge Yes No 2 Prolonged/subsequ ent stay or treatment Yes No 3 Death Yes No c) CAUSE OF INJURY OR COMPLICATION This question relates to circumstances that led to the injury such as a procedure or treatment that caused the injury or whether there was some omission in management or ordinary standard of care. One way to help understand this question is to consider whether the injury or complication would have occurred if th e procedure had not been carried out. For example where a patient suffered a wound infection following surgery t here is strong evidence that healthcare management is responsible (the wound infection would not have occurred without the surgery). Where the patient may have been predisposed to wound infections then the confidence score for will be reduced. Was the pat ient's injury/complication caused by 1 health care management 2 health care management interacting with disease process 3 solely by disease process Modular Adverse Events Review Form Clinical Safety Research Unit, Imperial College, London 3 A6 (cont.) After consideration of the clinical details of the patient's management, irrespectiv e of preventability , what level of confidence do you have that the HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT caused the injury ? 1 Virtually no evidence for management causation/system failure. Injury entirely due to patient's pathology (no AE: then STOP) 2 Sligh t to modest evidence for management causation 3 Management causation not likely; less than 50 -50 but close call 4 Management causation more likely than not, more than 50 -50 but close call 5 Moderate/strong evidence for management causation 6 Virtually certain evidence for management causation If more than one AE is identified, assess each AE independently completing the necessary sections only (i.e. it's not necessary to repeat previously answered general questions ) and indicat e on the front page the number of AEs A7 ADVERSE EVENT SUMMARY Date of adverse event Describe AE in context of overall illness d d m m y y Give detail s of the pre -admission assessment / waiting period to the AE ___________________________________________ ___________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___ Give details of any key action/inacti on that played a significant part in the causation of the AE ____________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___ _______________________________________________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___ Give details of the injury or details relevant to the AE (e.g. time of event if known) _______________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___ With this clinical scenario indicate, if poss ible, how often this sort of injury or complication may occur? 1 very rarely (<1%) 3 occasionally (10 -24%) 2 rarely (1 -9%) 4 frequently (> 25%) Describe the principal problem in the patient's care that led to the AE (e.g. was it a d iagnostic error, technical mishap, failure to monitor, etc. ) __________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________ ________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ Modular Adverse Events Review Form Clinical Safety Research Unit, Imperial College, London 4 A7 (cont.)

Many of these could only be assessed satisfactorily by interviewing the staff involved in t he care of the patient. Please indicate, where possible, likely causative factors. Mark unlikely factors with U, possible factors with 1, 2 or 3. Please rate each of the following factors according to its importance, as you see it, in the occurrence of this particular adverse event. Unlikely to Possibly Somewhat Very be relevant relevant important important U 1 2 3 1. Patient characteristics U 1 2 3 1.1 Patient was not able to understand/communi cate with clinical/nursing team (e.g. deaf, stroke, language difficulties in absence of interpreter or cultural differe nces) 1.2 Personality or social factors 1.3 Was co -morbidity an important contributory factor? 1.4 Other patient characteristics (specify) ______________________________ 2.

Yes No Rate on a 6 point scale the strength of evidence for preventability . 1 Virtually no evidence for preventability 2 Slight to modest evidence for preventability 3 Preventability not quite likely; less than 50 -50 but close call 4 Preventability more likely than not; more than 50 -50 but close call 5 Strong evidence for preventability 6 Virtually certain evidence for preventability If you ticked 2 - 6, answer the following questions: Describe br iefly the manner in which the AE have been prevented . ___________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ ___________ _______________________________________________________________________ Can you identify prevent this AE ___________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________ ________ _________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________ Modular Adverse Events Review Form Clinical Safety Research Unit, Imperial College London 25 E4 EXPERTISE OF REVIEWER Was the reviewer's judgements limited or hampered by lack of subspeci alty knowledge?
