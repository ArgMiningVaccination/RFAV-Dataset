This editorial is being published simultaneously in multiple journals. For the full list of journals see: https://www.bmj.com/content/full-list-authors- and-signatories-climate-emergency-editorial-october-2022 The 2022 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) paints a dark picture of the future of life on earth, characterised by ecosystem collapse, species extinction, and climate hazards such as heatwaves and floods (1). These are all linked to physical and mental health problems, with direct and indirect consequences of increased morbidity and mortality. To avoid these catastrophic health effects across all regions of the globe, there is broad agreement\u2014as 231 health journals argued together in 2021\u2014that the rise in global temperature must be limited to less than 1.5oC compared with pre-industrial levels. While the Paris Agreement of 2015 outlines a global action framework that incorporates providing climate finance to developing countries, this support has yet to materialise (2). COP27 is the fifth Conference of the Parties (COP) to be organised in Africa since its inception in 1995. Ahead of this meeting, we\u2014as health journal editors from across the continent\u2014call for urgent action to ensure that it is the COP that finally delivers climate justice for Africa and vulnerable countries. This is essential not just for the health of those countries, but for the health of the whole world. Africa has suffered disproportionately although it has done little to cause the crisis The climate crisis has had an impact on the environmental and social determinants of health across Africa, leading to devastating health effects (3). Impacts on health can result directly from environmental shocks and indirectly through socially mediated effects (4). Climate change-related risks in Africa include flooding, drought, heatwaves, reduced food production, and reduced labour productivity (5). Droughts in sub-Saharan Africa have tripled between 1970-1979 and 2010-2019 (6). In 2018, devastating cyclones impacted 2.2 million people in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe (6). In West and Central Africa, severe flooding resulted in mortality and forced migration due to loss of shelter, cultivated land and livestock (7). Changes in vector ecology brought about by floods and damage to environmental hygiene have led to increases in diseases across sub-Saharan Africa, with increases in malaria, dengue fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, Lyme disease, Ebola virus disease, West Nile virus, and other infections (8,9) . Rising sea levels reduce water quality, leading to waterborne diseases, including diarrhoeal diseases, a leading cause of mortality in Africa (8). Extreme weather damages water and food supply, increasing food insecurity and malnutrition, which causes 1.7 million deaths annually in Africa (10). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that malnutrition has increased by almost 50% since 2012, due to the central role agriculture plays in African economies (11). Environmental shocks and their knock-on effects also cause severe harm to mental health (12). In all, it is estimated that the climate crisis has destroyed a fifth of the gross domestic product of the countries most vulnerable to climate shocks (13). The damage to Africa should be of supreme concern to all nations, partly for moral reasons. It is highly unjust that the most impacted nations have contributed the least to global cumulative emissions, which are driving the climate crisis and its increasingly severe effects. Wealthy nations must step up support for Africa and vulnerable countries in addressing past, present and future impacts of climate change. Book Vol 28-11.indb 785Book - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022North America and Europe have contributed 62% of carbon dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution, whereas Africa has contributed only 3% (14). The fight against the climate crisis needs all hands on deck It is not just for moral reasons that all nations should be concerned for Africa. The acute and chronic impacts of the climate crisis create problems like poverty, infectious disease, forced migration, and conflict that spread through globalised systems (6,15) . These knock-on impacts affect all nations. COVID-19 served as a wakeup call to these global dynamics and it is no coincidence that health professionals have been active in identifying and responding to the consequences of growing systemic risks to health. However, lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic should not be limited to pandemic risk (16,17 ). Instead, it is imperative that the suffering of frontline nations, including those in Africa, be the core consideration at COP27. In an interconnected world, leaving countries to the mercy of environmental shocks creates instability that has severe consequences for all nations. The primary focus of climate summits remains to rapidly reduce emissions so that global temperature increases are kept to below 1.5\u00b0C. This will limit the harm. However, for Africa and other vulnerable regions, this harm is already severe. Achieving the promised target of providing US$ 100bn of climate finance a year is now globally critical if we are to forestall the systemic risks of leaving societies in crisis. This can be done by ensuring that these resources focus on increasing resilience to the existing and inevitable future impacts of the climate crisis, as well as on supporting vulnerable nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions: a parity of esteem between adaptation and mitigation. These resources should come through grants not loans, and be urgently scaled-up before the current review period of 2025. They must put health system resilience at the forefront, as the compounding crises caused by the climate crisis often manifest in acute health problems. Financing adaptation will be more cost-effective than relying on disaster relief. Some progress has been made on adaptation in Africa and around the world, including early warning systems and infrastructure to defend against extremes. However, frontline nations are not compensated for impacts from a crisis they did not cause. This is not only unfair, but also drives the spiral of global destabilisation, as nations pour money into responding to disasters, but can no longer afford to pay for greater resilience or to reduce the root problem through emissions reductions. A financing facility for loss and damage must now be introduced, providing additional resources beyond those given for mitigation and adaptation. This must go beyond the failures of COP26 where the suggestion of such a facility was downgraded to \"a dialogue\" (18). The climate crisis is a product of global inaction, and comes at a great cost not only to disproportionately impacted African countries, but also to the whole world. Africa is united with other frontline regions in requesting wealthy nations to finally step up, if for no other reason than that the crises in Africa will sooner rather than later spread and engulf all corners of the globe, by which time it may be too late to effectively respond. If they have failed so far to be persuaded by moral arguments, then hopefully their self-interest will now prevail. References 1. IPCC. Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

(Correspondence to: Juliana Erthal- Williamson: j.erthal@student.unsw.edu.au). Introduction Pharmaceutical opioids are indicated to treat a wide range of moderate to severe pain symptoms, including acute and cancer-related pain, chronic non-cancer pain and pain at the end of life (1). Selected opioids are listed in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (2). Ensuring adequate access to opioid analgesics is therefore important, especially as the burden of cancer is increasing rapidly globally (3). Untreated pain may not only reduce a person's quality of life, it may also have physical, psychological and social impacts (4). In turn, these indirect effects may hinder achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to poverty and economic growth (5). Over the past decade, pharmaceutical opioid consumption has been increasing in developed countries, yet disparities in the distribution of, and lack of access to, these medicines in developing countries continue to exist, and in some instances have increased (6). In 2015, more than 80% of the 61 million individuals who experienced either serious health-related suffering or death, lived in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to palliative care and pain relief (7). Furthermore, every year almost 2.5 million children globally die with serious health-related suffering (8). Access to palliative care is considered a human right as outlined in article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (9). Governments around the world have responded to the call by the United Nations General Assembly in 2016 to increase the availability of opioid analgesics for pain relief (10). The reality of the global divide in access to opioid analgesics for medical purposes has been clearly illustrated by the work of the Lancet Commission on Palliative Care and Pain Relief (7). The Commission measured the availability of opioid analgesics for consumption, as reported by competent national authorities to the International Narcotics Control Board, against the estimated amount needed for the health conditions most associated with serious health-related suffering (an indicator developed on the basis of existing health data and statistics) . In the Commission's report, an essential package of palliative medicine containing cheap, off-patent morphine (injectable and oral immediate-release) is proposed to be made universally accessible (8). However, in some regions, progress has varied and some countries have seen their Abstract Background Pharmaceutical opioid consumption has been increasing worldwide, but disparities in access to these medications exist. Few countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region have well defined pain management policies. Aims This study presents trends in the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids in the 22 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region from 2010 to 2019, with comparative intra- and extra-regional analyses; the correlation between pharmaceutical opioid consumption and human development index rankings; and pharmaceutical opioids use in the region. Methods We calculated the defined daily doses for statistical purposes (S-DDD) per million inhabitants per day of pharmaceutical opioids from 2010 to 2019, and used the mixed effects models to assess changes in consumption. We used regression analyses to establish the strength of associations between human development index level and consumption in the region and elsewhere. Results Pharmaceutical opioid use has fluctuated in the region since 2010, with a mean sum of S-DDD of 2547 for 2010- 2019. Consumption is relatively low in the region irrespective of the human development index. The highest-consuming country reported 369 S-DDD in 2019 and the lowest reported 1 S-DDD. The most used pharmaceutical opioids in the region were fentanyl, morphine, pethidine, oxycodone, and codeine. Conclusion Consumption could be considered inadequate in several countries of the region. Supporting these countries to improve collection and reporting of consumption data, and providing humanitarian assistance to enhance access to pain relief, should be a priority for the international community.

This paper is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 3.0 IGO EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022levels of consumption of palliative medicines decrease. Even for substances such as morphine, which is relatively cheap and easy to procure, access can be a challenge in low-income countries. Over the past 20 years, on average, only 9.0% of the morphine available globally was used for pain management, and in 2019, 80.4% of the population in low- and middle-income countries consumed only 12.8% of this amount (11). Despite the importance of having opioid analgesic available for medical purposes, in 2015, about 71.0% of the global population lived in countries with extremely low consumption of these medicines (6), indicating potential barriers to access. The Eastern Mediterranean Region was among the WHO regions that had inadequate consumption of pharmaceutical opioids, which was a defined daily doses for statistical purposes (S-DDD) of less than 200 in 2001-2003. Although pharmaceutical opioid use increased in 2011-2013, the majority of countries in the region still reported consumption of less than 200 S-DDD (12). The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region consists of several countries that have experienced social and political unrest, humanitarian crises and conflicts. Very few countries have well-defined policies on cancer management or palliative care (13). Pain management in the region has been hindered by unscientific cultural beliefs, stigma and bias (13,14) . While economic and healthcare developments have occurred in some countries of the region in the past few years (13,15) , it is unclear whether these developments were accompanied by increased pharmaceutical opioid consumption. A previous study indicated that contextual factors, such as the human development index (HDI), influenced the use of pharmaceutical opioids (12), but more recent studies (16,17) have suggested that contextual factors such as HDI may not be the only decisive factors. A study in 2013 described the trends in pharmaceutical opioid consumption specifically in the Middle East from 1980 to 2010, but it did not investigate the determinants of any changes (13). No up-to-date literature currently exists on the trends in pharmaceutical opioid consumption in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Information on such changes and associated determinants of pharmaceutical opioid consumption in this region is essential to aid the development of policies that can ensure availability of and adequate access to opioids for medical purposes. Objectives We aimed to present trends in the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids in countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen) from 2010 to 2019, with a comparative intra- and extra- regional analysis. We analyse the correlation between pharmaceutical opioid consumption and HDI rankings, and identify the opioids used in the region. Methods Data sources All countries that are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 are mandated to provide data to the International Narcotics Control Board on the annual consumption of controlled opioid analgesic medicines for medical and scientific purposes (18). The Convention has been ratified by 186 States. All countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region except Palestine are parties to the Convention. The Convention understands consumption as the full amount of each substance that is available for use in each country each year, thus it refers to the amount available for consumption, rather than the quantities actually dispensed to patients in each country in a given year. Countries are also mandated to submit estimates of their annual requirements of controlled substances for medical and scientific purposes, which are the basis for their annual imports and manufacture of controlled opioids. Opioids for which countries submit data and estimates are the ones scheduled under the Convention (19). This information was verified by the International Narcotics Control Board using data from export and import notifications. These data are expressed in terms of the S-DDD to establish the extent of use. The S-DDD is a technical unit of measurement established and used by the International Narcotics Control Board (20). This unit does not represent a recommended prescription dose. Because no internationally agreed standard doses exist for opioid analgesics, the S-DDD is used to provide a comparable measure to rank pharmaceutical opioid use across countries. S-DDD for a drug is calculated using the following formula: annual use of the pharmaceutical opioid divided by 365 days, divided by the population in millions of the country or territory during the year, divided by the defined daily dose for the opioid. Data for population to calculate the S-DDD were taken from the Human Development Reports published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the period 2010-2019 (21). While S-DDD relate to countries and territories, when reporting on regions we used regional S-DDD (sum of annual use in all countries and territories divided by 365 days, divided by the sum of the population in all countries and territories in millions during the year, divided by the defined daily dose) or sum of all individual S-DDD for each year in all countries and territories. We used UNDP's HDI categorical version for each country for each year rather than the HDI score. HDI categories are low, medium, high and very high. HDI data were also taken from UNDP Human Development Reports for 2010-2019 (21). The pharmaceutical opioids were excluded from these analyses because their use for pain relief cannot be distinguished from their use in treatment Book Vol 28-11.indb 789Book Vol Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022of opioid use disorder. The reported codeine use is limited to its use as a monotherapy for pain management and not for preparations containing codeine for the treatment of cough. Our analysis covered the period 2010-2019 and examined trends over this time. In particular, we examined consumption of the five most consumed pharmaceutical opioids in the region. Statistical methods We analysed the trends in pharmaceutical opioid consumption across the Eastern Mediterranean Region, by sum of S-DDD from 2010 to 2019. We analysed trends in pharmaceutical opioid consumption for all of the 22 countries in the region, and the five most consumed pharmaceutical opioids in the region, by S-DDD, for the same period. We analysed annual S-DDD data from 2010 to 2019 using mixed effects models to control for within- country correlations (i.e. to adjust for non-independence between the repeated observations of each country). Because the outcome data (S-DDD) were skewed and over-dispersed, we used negative binomial models. We conducted two mixed effects models. The first model compared countries of Eastern Mediterranean Region with the rest of the world, and included a three- way interaction with time and HDI category, allowing for change over time to vary based on the Eastern Mediterranean Region and HDI categories. The second model separated countries into broader geographical regions that do not correspond with the WHO regions, except for countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. This model included a region by time interaction. Both mixed effects models included a random slope for HDI category. The significance level was set at P < 0.05. We used Stata 17.0 for all analyses . Results Pharmaceutical opioid consumption in the Eastern Mediterranean region was low at the beginning of the period considered in this study, a total of 2419 S-DDD in 2010 (Figure 1). This regional consumption level increased in 2011, when it peaked at 2866 S-DDD. Since then, pharmaceutical opioid use in the region has somewhat decreased and in 2019, the S-DDD was 2360 for the region. The six highest-consuming countries in the region reported S-DDD between 242 (Jordan) and 369 (Saudi Arabia) in 2019, with consumption remaining within almost the same range since 2010 (Figure 2). Bahrain, which was the highest-consuming country in the region in 2010 with 382 S-DDD, decreased its consumption level to 283 S-DDD in 2019. Qatar, which consumed 215 S-DDD in 2010, reported even lower consumption levels between 2013 and 2016, but reached 272 S-DDD in 2019, the same level as Lebanon. Lebanon has had stable levels of consumption since 2010, when it reported 225 S-DDD. Consumption in Kuwait was 335 S-DDD in 2010 and 336 S-DDD in 2019, and was the second-highest consuming country in the region in 2010 and 2019, despite relative fluctuations in consumption in-between. Consumption in these countries mainly consisted of fentanyl, morphine, pethidine and oxycodone, while some countries also consumed codeine (mostly Bahrain and Saudi Arabia) and hydromorphone (Saudi Arabia). Other countries in the region reported slightly lower levels of pharmaceutical opioid consumption in 2010 than the top six countries mentioned above. These include the United Arab Emirates (195 S-DDD), Tunisia (145 S-DDD), Syrian Arab Republic (116 S-DDD), Oman (106 S-DDD) and Egypt (65 S-DDD). While Egypt reported a small increase to 75 S-DDD in 2019, the United Arab Emirates, Tunisia and Oman reported slight decreases to 163 S-DDD, 132 S-DDD and 103 S-DDD, respectively. The Syrian Arab Republic reported a large decrease to 31 S-DDD in 2019. This intermediate group of countries reported consumption of a more limited number of pharmaceutical opioids, mostly fentanyl, morphine and pethidine. In addition to those substances, consumption of oxycodone was reported by the United Arab Emirates, Syrian Arab Republic and Egypt; consumption of hydromorphone was reported by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt; and consumption of codeine was reported by Oman.

Note: S-DDD is the sum of the S-DDD of each country of the region. Book Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022Countries at the lowest level of consumption in the Eastern Mediterranean Region reported between 1 (Afghanistan) and 54 S-DDD (Morocco) in 2019. Morocco reported consumption of fentanyl and morphine. Although consumption increased slightly between 2015 and 2017, when it peaked at 5 S-DDDs, consumption reported by Afghan authorities in 2019 was back at 1 S-DDD, and included only morphine. A similar trend was observed for Pakistan, where consumption of fentanyl was reported in addition to morphine. The Islamic Republic of Iran reported 43 S-DDD in 2010, but this decreased to 34 S-DDD in 2019. Pharmaceutical opioids consumed in the Islamic Republic of Iran were fentanyl and pethidine. The consumption trend in Libya peaked at 49 S-DDD in 2013, but many gaps in reporting from this country existed. Libya reported consumption of three pharmaceutical opioids: fentanyl, morphine and pethidine. Iraq, Sudan and Yemen have provided minimal data for the period, and data from Djibouti and Somalia are entirely lacking. Data for Palestine are reported to International Narcotics Control Board by Israel, and the Board does not report a breakdown. The comparative analysis of trends in the Eastern Mediterranean Region with other regions of the world is shown in Figure 3, using regional S-DDD (total consumption/total population) instead of the sum of each individual country's S-DDD. Pharmaceutical opioid consumption in the Eastern Mediterranean Region was the third lowest in the world in 2010. Consumption has remained stable at 567 S-DDD in 2019, but as Asia almost doubled its pharmaceutical opioid consumption from 354 S-DDD in 2010 to 637 S-DDD in 2019, this has resulted in the Eastern Mediterranean Region now being the second-lowest consuming region. Africa was and still is the lowest consumer of pharmaceutical opioids in the world. Higher-consuming regions include Europe, North America and Oceania.Figure 2 Trends in pharmaceutical opioid consumption (in S-DDD) in the six highest consuming countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2010-2019 0100200300400500600700 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019S-DDD Year Bahrain Jordan Kuwait Lebanon Qatar Saudi Arabia S-DDD: defined daily doses for statistical purposes.

Countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region with low HDI had slightly higher consumption than countries with low HDI in other regions (Figure 4a). However, countries with low HDI in the Eastern Mediterranean Region were also reporting a decreasing trend in consumption over the study period. Pharmaceutical opioid consumption remained stable in Eastern Mediterranean Region countries with a medium HDI, while it increased in countries from other regions (Figure 4b). In addition, the S-DDD of Eastern Mediterranean Region countries are about half of those of other countries in the medium HDI ranking. For countries with high HDIs, consumption within the Eastern Mediterranean Region decreased during the study period. Consumption was above the S-DDD levels in other regions in 2010. However, countries from other regions that are within the same high HDI ranking have increased their pharmaceutical opioid consumption Figure 4 Trends in pharmaceutical opioid consumption (in S-DDD) in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and other regions by HDI category, 2010-2019 0510152025 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019S-DDD YearEMRO Other 020406080100120140160180 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019S-DDD YearEMRO Other 0100200300400500600 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019S-DDD YearEMRO Other 02000400060008000100001200014000 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019S-DDD YearEMRO Other(a) Low HDI (b) Medium HDI (d) Very high HDI (c) High HDI S-DDD: defined daily doses for statistical purposes; HDI: human development index.

Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region with very high HDIs reported a stable trend in pharmaceutical opioid consumption that was substantially lower than countries within the same HDI ranking in other regions (Figure 4d). Fentanyl was the most consumed pharmaceutical opioid based on S-DDD in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (Figure 5), with an average annual consumption of 1729 S-DDD in the 2010-2019 period. Consumption of fentanyl started to decline after 2011, after it peaked at 2033 S-DDD, and reached a low of 1388 S-DDD in 2016. However, fentanyl consumption increased again to 1952 S-DDD in 2018 and remained relatively stable at 1732 S-DDD in 2019. Morphine and pethidine were the second and third most consumed pharmaceutical opioids, with annual averages of 377 S-DDD and 216 S-DDD, respectively. Consumption of morphine remained stable throughout the observed period, while pethidine consumption declined from 270 in 2010 to 131 S-DDD in 2019. Oxycodone use, on the other hand, increased from 93 in 2010 to 121 S-DDD in 2019, and the use of codeine as an analgesic remains limited in the region. Discussion As with most regions in the world, availability of pharmaceutical opioids varies between countries and territories of the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Overall, the regional consumption peak over the study period coincided with a peak in fentanyl consumption in 2011. The HDI is considered one of the most important determinants of country-level pharmaceutical opioid use and accounts for many of differences and changes in use between countries (12). This is the case for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, although we also observed that some high and very high HDI countries had relatively low pharmaceutical opioid consumption, especially when compared with other high and very high HDI countries in other regions. A similar pattern can be seen for the level of palliative care services in Eastern Mediterranean countries as reported by the Global atlas of palliative care , published by the Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance and WHO. None of the countries in the region with very high HDI has palliative care services which are at an advanced stage of integration in the health system (22). Instead, they offer generalized (Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) or isolated (Bahrain) palliative care. Other countries considered to have an intermediate level of palliative care services include: Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya and Tunisia (high HDI); Afghanistan, Morocco and Pakistan (medium HDI); and Sudan (low HDI). The United Arab Emirates has an even lower level of palliative care service development, with only capacity-building activities, in spite of its very high HDI. All other countries in the region have no known hospice-palliative care activities ongoing. This includes Syrian Arab Republic (medium HDI), and Djibouti, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen (low HDI). Some factors other than HDI may further explain the overall low levels of availability of pharmaceutical opioids in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The International Narcotics Control Board has reported on the main impediments to availability of pharmaceutical opioids in the world (20). The main factors globally are lack of training of health professionals, fear of addiction, problems in sourcing, fear of diversion to illicit channels, limited financial resources, trade control measures (e.g. licensing requirements, import and export permissions and fees), cultural attitudes, fear of prosecution and onerous regulations (20). A regional analysis of the data used for the earlier study of the International Narcotics Control Board showed some specific features about impediments in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (19). While lack of training was mentioned as an impediment by 36% of responding countries globally, this percentage in the Eastern Mediterranean Region was only 9%. At the same time, cultural and social attitudes were the impediments most mentioned by Eastern Mediterranean Figure 5 Top five most consumed pharmaceutical opioids (in S-DDD) in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2010-2019 05001000150020002500 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Year Fentanyl Morphine Pethidine Oxycodone Codeine Vol Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022Region countries (55%), followed by problems in sourcing and international trade control measures (both 36%). In contrast, these impediments come in fifth, fourth and eight places, respectively, for responding countries globally. Also of relevance is the impediment of limited resources, which was mentioned by 32% of responding countries globally, but not mentioned by any of the responding countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. These differences in reported impediments could contribute to understanding the overall lower S-DDD in the region, including in all HDI groups. Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region have various religions, cultures and traditions that may affect how patients perceive pain, diseases and death (23). Some studies further investigated the role of the impediments suggested by the International Narcotics Control Board at the national level. A survey of physicians in Lebanon found that 45% of respondents declared that fear of adverse effects of analgesics was a barrier to effective pain control, especially respiratory depression and addiction to opioids (23). About 42% of physicians reported that poor knowledge of pain management was a barrier to providing adequate pain control; mid-career physicians reported having the lowest knowledge. This lack of knowledge is likely the result of suboptimal pain education in the medical curriculum in Lebanon (23). Similarly, in Morocco and Jordan, pain management and palliative care education was not available in undergraduate programmes, and only a few such education programmes existed in Pakistan (24). Other impediments to availability are a lack of health policies and onerous regulations that may lead to fear of legal sanctions. While pharmaceutical opioids are available, some countries have strict regulations on who is allowed to prescribe morphine and to whom, with prescription validity ranging from 7 to 30 days (22-25) , which limits accessibility. Affordability is another issue that affects countries with low HDI, which is likely to affect some of the countries that did not respond to the International Narcotics Control Board questionnaire on impediments (20) . Some countries lacked data, which may indicate that patients in those countries have very limited or no access to pain management and treatment. Challenges related to armed conflicts and political and social instability in the Eastern Mediterranean Region further complicate the issue of access to pharmaceutical opioids. About half of the countries in the region have experienced armed conflicts within their territories, some of them, for example, Afghanistan, for the entire period from 2010 to 2019 (26-29) . The lack of a functioning public health system, the absence of basic resources and security issues likely affect the extent to which these countries can access pharmaceutical opioids.We could not analyse these factors in-depth because of the lack of data on other sources of pharmaceutical opioids, such as use of other pain relief medication not under international control (e.g. tramadol), donations from nongovernmental organizations and illicit markets - either legal drugs diverted to illicit markets or falsified medicines. Other limitations to our data analysis include the lack of consumption data over several years for some countries. Conclusions In general, the consumption of opioid analgesics in most Eastern Mediterranean Region countries and territories could be considered inadequate or very inadequate. State Parties to the 1961 Single Convention have the obligation to guarantee availability of opioids for pain relief. Our study has shown that countries in the region with different HDIs may face different barriers to availability as indicated by their responses to the International Narcotics Control Board questionnaire. Countries with higher HDI should focus on overcoming cultural and social barriers and developing clear national policies to ensure the availability, affordability, and accessibility of pain relief. Many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region have low and medium human development levels, and several have been plagued by armed conflicts and social and political unrest, all of which create impediments to making analgesic opioids available and the government capacity to address these impediment is limited. Given that many countries may have weak and vulnerable institutions, the international community must play a role in supporting access to essential analgesic medicines for patients living in Eastern Mediterranean Region. In some contexts, expanding the number and types of healthcare professionals trained and licensed to prescribe opioids, such as nurses and family doctors, is key to reaching the most vulnerable groups of patients. Closer collaborations with patient organizations may allow decision-makers to enhance their knowledge of the analgesia needs of patients. Moreover, supporting the work of these countries to improve data and reporting of consumption patterns and impediments, as well as humanitarian assistance for access to pain relief, should be a priority for the international community.

(Correspondence to: Tahseen tahseenkazmi@gmail.com ). Introduction The burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) continues to rise and they have become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, accounting for almost 70.0% of all the deaths worldwide (1). The leading NCDs such as diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer jointly accounted for about 79.0% of all NCD deaths all over the world in 2018 (2). The estimated number of deaths globally caused by NCDs was 26.6 million in 1990 ( 3), which increased to 34.5 million in 2010 and to about 40.5 million in 2016. Because of the rapid change in lifestyle and advanced urbanization, low- and middle-income countries suffer from a great burden of NCDs ( 4-6) . Deaths caused by NCDs in low- and middle-income countries was 78.0% in 2016. This high burden of NCDs is due to the limited number of facilities and limited resources available for this kind of diseases ( 3). Pakistan is the fifth most populated country worldwide with a population of 207.7 million (7). The country is facing a double burden of communicable diseases and NCDs ( 8). Adoption of a sedentary lifestyle and changes in diet have resulted in a surge in NCDs in Pakistan ( 9). Hypertension is the most common NCD with a prevalence of 38.7%, followed by diabetes with a prevalence of 14.6% ( 10). The National Health Survey of Pakistan reported a diabetes prevalence of 11.0% in the general population (11). In 2013-2014, a large-scale survey was conducted in Sindh and Punjab provinces, to determine the prevalence of NCDs and risk factors using the WHO STEPS instrument (12). Hypertension was seen in 53% of the sample which is higher than other South Asian countries (12). The main factors affecting the level of hypertension in Pakistan were: lack of proper healthcare guidelines; absence of patient safety measures; drug misuse; limited public health research; lack of enforcement of policies; and limited resources (13). Several other risk factors for common NCDs exist, the most common being obesity, pre-hypertension, use of tobacco products and poor diet. Obesity was a risk factor for hypertension and diabetes in a study conducted using WHO STEPS instrument (14), with the prevalence of obesity reported as 31.2% (14). Another study in Kathmandu reported the obesity or over-weight prevalence as 52.2% (15). Abstract Background: Cases of noncommunicable (NCD) diseases are increasing in Pakistan. They are responsible for 58% of all deaths and information on the risk factors is lacking. Aims: To determine the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and abnormal heart rate and their risk factors in a multiethnic, low-income area of Lahore. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in an urban settlement of Lahore in 2018-2019. Eligible participants were aged 30 years and resident in selected settlements. We used a modified World Health Organization stepwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (STEPS) questionnaire to collect data from a random sample of 906 residents. The modified questionnaire had a Cronbach alpha of 80.0%. Participants were interviewed in their homes and their height, weight, heart rate, and hip circumference were measured. Results: Most of the respondents were women (64.5%). The greatest proportion of the participants were aged 30-39 years (42.4%). Of all the respondents, 40.1% had hypertension, 15.8% had diabetes and 17.0% had ischaemic heart disease. Of the risk factors examined, 68.8% of the respondents were overweight or obese, 37.0% had pre-hypertension, 13.6% used tobacco, and 1.8% used alcohol. Age was the most significant risk factor for noncommunicable diseases. Body mass index was significantly associated with diabetes in women, while family history of diabetes was significantly associated with diabetes in men. Conclusion: The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was higher among our study participants in Lahore than reported in the national statistics. Significant proportions of the respondents had pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes, making them vulnerable to serious complications of hypertension and diabetes.

This paper is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 3.0 IGO Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022The main objective of our study was to determine the overall prevalence of common NCDs in the general population in Lahore, Pakistan. For data collection, we modified the WHO STEPS questionnaire and determined its internal validity as the secondary objective. Methods Study design and setting This was a cross-sectional study carried out in urban settlements of Union Councils 120 and 122 of Lahore, Punjab from September 2018 to September 2019. Union councils are the fifth tier of government in Pakistan; each union council has 13 elected members or councilors. The two union councils were selected from Shalamar and Gulberg zones. Study sample The minimum sample size calculated was 882 using the WHO sample size calculator with 95% confidence interval (CI) and 49.0% as the prevalence of NCDs in Pakistan ( 10). We used a two-stage cluster sampling method to collect data. The union councils were the primary unit. Blocks were the secondary units and were made up of about 2000 houses in the two union councils. One block was randomly selected from each union council. We started with a randomly selected household within the block and then selected every fifth house in that block. Eligibility criteria were: age 30 years and resident in these union councils. Exclusion criteria were: refusal to participate; self-reported severe comorbid conditions with life expectancy of less than 1 year; or other self- reported serious conditions likely to interfere with study participation or with the ability to complete the study (e.g. terminal cancer, HIV or tuberculosis). All eligible individuals present in each household were interviewed. If any individual declined to participate, the whole household was excluded and the next household was selected. Data collection Data were collected through face-to-face, door-to-door interviews with all the eligible participants. The WHO STEPS questionnaire, modified to suit the setting with more detailed items excluded, was used to collect the data. The modified version was developed in English. Data were collected by nurses and doctors trained to conduct the interviews and complete the questionnaires. If any data were later found missing, the household was revisited to complete the information. The demographic information collected was age, sex, marital status, educational level and occupation. A few response categories were changed for some variables. The other sections of the WHO STEPS questionnaire were limited to basic information such as consumption of tobacco, alcohol, fruits and vegetables, and intensity of physical activity (mild, moderate or intense). Physical characteristics (height, weight, heart rate and hip circumference) were measured by trained nurses (male and female). Information on history of hypertension, diabetes, stroke and ischaemic heart disease (chest pain, angina and shortness of breath) was also collected. A few items on history of raised blood pressure, diabetes, raised cholesterol and cardiovascular disease were included in the modified version. Statistical analysis Data analysis was done using SPSS , version 26. Socioeconomic and demographic factors were cross- tabulated with age group and sex. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate significant differences . The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed and the Cronbach alpha determined was 80%. We used exploratory factor analysis to assess the internal structure of the questionnaire. Principal component analysis was used with varimax rotation. Factors with Eigen values > 1.0 were extracted. The prevalence of the main NCDs was determined and the association between various risk factors and common NCDs was examined. Ethical considerations The study was approved by the institutional review board of Shalamar Institute of Health Sciences (SMDC/IRB/11- 12/140). Verbal consent was obtained before entering any household and written consent was obtained before starting the interview. Results Data were collected from 906 participants who lived in Union Councils 120 and 121. The internal reliability of 34 items was 80% using Cronbach alpha. These items were related to tobacco use, dietary pattern, physical activity, raised blood pressure and physical measurements. With regard to history of NCDs, 38.2% (346/906) of the participants had a family history of high blood pressure, 41.9% (380/906) had a family history of diabetes and 7.9% (72/906) had a history of stroke. With regard to the risk factors, 68.8% (623/906) of the sample was overweight or obese, pre-hypertension, 13.6% (123/906) had pre- diabetes and 1.8% drank alcohol regularly (16/906). The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and ischaemic heart disease was 40.1% (363/906), 15.8% (143/906) and 17.0% (154/906), respectively. The prevalence of ischaemic heart disease was the same in male and female respondents. The greatest proportion of the participants were in the age group 30-39 years (42.5% [385/906]), and 64.5% (584/906) were female (Table 1). Age was significantly associated with sex ( P < 0.001). Marital status, educational level and occupation were all significantly associated with age and sex ( P < 0.001; Table 1). With regard to the internal structure of the questionnaire, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy and the Bartlett test of sphericity had values of 0.49 and 1248.07, respectively, ( P EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022allowing for exploratory factor analysis. The threshold for factor loadings was 0.3. Maximum factor loading for each item in the principal component analysis was used to assign that item in a particular factor. Twelve factors were extracted with about 76.1% of the variance explained (Table 2). Age was the most significant risk factor for NCDs. A statistically significant association was observed for body mass index and diabetes in females ( P = 0.02). Family history of diabetes was significantly associated with diabetes in males ( P < 0.001). In male participants, occupation was significantly associated with abnormal heart rate (less than 60 beats/minute (bradycardia) or more than 100 beats/minute (tachycardia; P = 0.05). Income, family history of ischaemic heart disease, family history of hypertension and regular walking were not significantly associated with common NCDs (Table 3). The prevalence of diabetes was same for male and female participants but varied with age: 4.5% in participants aged 30-39 years, 16.0% in participants aged 40-49 years, 19.6% in participants aged 50-59 years and 23.8% in participants aged 60 years and older.Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the study participants Characteristic No. 2 (P-value)aNo. 2 (P-value)a Age, in years Sex 30-39 40-49 50-59 60 Male Female Marital status 71.501 (< 0.001) 23.535 (< 0.001) Never married 30 9 2 0 19 22 Married 351 188 158 119 298 518 Separated 0 1 0 1 2 0 Widowed 3 7 14 21 3 42 No response 1 0 1 0 0 2 Education level 73.203 (< 0.001) 15.346 (0.036) No schooling 107 62 78 66 97 216 Less than primary 53 30 27 33 45 98 Primary 16 14 16 4 19 31 Secondary 69 30 24 20 67 76 High school 84 48 22 16 62 108 University 39 14 7 1 19 42 Postgraduate 16 6 0 1 12 11 No response 1 1 1 0 1 2 Ethnicity 13.398 (0.144) 0.514 (0.916) Punjabi 142 84 86 69 139 242 Urdu speaking 169 86 61 50 127 239 Pashtun 54 23 16 16 37 72 Other 20 12 12 6 19 31 Socioeconomic status 10.307 (0.112) 4.723 (0.094) Low 144 71 47 55 103 214 Middle 197 113 98 71 170 309 High 44 21 30 15 49 61 Occupation 176.379 (< 0.001) 603.380 (< 0.001) Government employee 35 21 35 12 84 19 Non-government employee 68 45 24 16 125 28 Self-employed 18 15 12 8 46 07 Student 32 0 0 0 2 1 Retired 2 2 0 27 29 2 Unemployed (can work) 10 5 4 8 11 16 Unemployed (disabled) 3 2 6 8 13 6 House work 245 115 93 62 12 503 No response 1 0 1 0 0 2 Total 385 205 175 141 322 584 a Fisher exact test.

Discussion We used exploratory factor analysis of the modified WHO STEPS questionnaire to assess the validity of the modified version. We could not use the original version of the STEPS questionnaire because it included questions on behavioural measurements, medical check-ups, tradition and background. The WHO STEPS questionnaire was designed to be applied to any community, we modified it according to our socioeconomic and demographic conditions. Another study on the burden of NCDs developed and validated the tool extracted from a past research questionnaire Book Vol Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022Table 3 Risk factors for three noncommunicable diseases, by sex, southern Lahore, Pakistan Risk factor Females Males Abnormal heart rateaDiabetes Hypertension Abnormal heart rateaDiabetes Hypertension Test statistics (P-value)Test statistics (P-value)Test statistics (P-value)Test (0.45) 1.77 (0.41) 0.10 (0.86) 0.001)* 1.17 (0.35) *Statistically significant at P < 0.05. a Less than 60 beats/minute (bradycardia) or more than 100 beats/minute (tachycardia). (16). In this study, the questionnaire was based on an 85- item questionnaire designed to assess cardiovascular disease risk ( 17). Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the validity of the newly designed 21-item questionnaire together with confirmatory factor analysis (16). Our study also aimed to assess the prevalence of NCDs by ethnicity and other demographic characteristics. Of all the NCDs examined, hypertension had the highest prevalence, followed by diabetes. This finding concurs with other studies in Pakistan on NCDs where hypertension or raised blood pressure was the most common NCD ( 10). The prevalence of hypertension in our study was 40.1%, which is similar to a 2016 study in Pakistan ( 10). A study in Myanmar found an inverse association between years of schooling and hypertension ( 16), which is similar to our finding that the prevalence of hypertension differed by educational level. A study based on samples from 29 countries concluded that an additional year of education was associated with a 0.13 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure for men ( 18). A cross-sectional study conducted in Swaziland found an overall hypertension prevalence of 48.3% ( 19). In our study the prevalence of diabetes was same for male and female participants. In other studies, the prevalence of diabetes ranged from 4.6% to 15% ( 10,20) . In general, the prevalence of diabetes was higher in older respondents. However, diabetes was most commonly seen among women (14) . The prevalence of diabetes varied by ethnicity, and this warrants further investigation; and a qualitative study to investigate the differences and interventions to reduce the prevalence of NCDs. We found no difference in the prevalence of diabetes according to occupation, which differs from a study in Sweden, which found that diabetes prevalence was higher among labourers, clerks, heavy machinery operators and drivers ( 21). The most common risk factor was pre-hypertension, with a prevalence of 37.0%. The prevalence of tobacco use was low in our study at 13.6%. Tobacco use is a leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality globally ( 22). A study in different districts of Pakistan reported that 37.7% of participants used tobacco ( 23), a higher figure than we found. About 1.8% of our sample drank alcohol regularly, which was considerably lower than the other risk factors. The risk of hypertension has been shown to increase with excessive use of alcohol ( 24). Overweight and obesity is another risk factor for many NCDs (14) and it was high in our study (68.8%). The prevalence of ischaemic heart disease was 17.0% in our study. A large-scale study in 53 cities of Punjab, Pakistan showed that 17.5% of the population had cardiovascular disease (25) , which concurs with our finding. However, another study reported a lower prevalence of 6.2% for ischaemic heart disease and among those most were male participants ( 26). The prevalence of ischaemic heart disease was same in male and female respondents. A strength of our study is that it was conducted in a multi-ethnic setting and covered almost all the economic classes. Two union councils were selected to remove the confounding of socioeconomic class. While the study was limited to one city, the sample size was large and representative. The important risk factors found in the study can be used to guide the development of policies to control NCDs. Funding: None. Competing interests: None declared.

It affects the health of the smokers and it is a threat to the lives of people inhaling second-hand smoke (1). According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013, second-hand tobacco smoke causes 600 000 deaths a year worldwide (2). Second-hand smoke exposure is associated with a risk of several diseases including cancer, diabetes, stroke and asthma (3-5) . In children, second-hand tobacco smoke causes sudden infant death syndrome and other respiratory diseases, and is associated with preterm deliveries and lower weight of newborn babies in pregnant women (6). The prevalence of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke is considerably higher in low- and middle-income countries such as Pakistan (7). Tobacco is used in many different forms in Pakistan including as hookah and shisha. According to the 2014 Global Adult Tobacco Survey, the prevalence of active smoking in Pakistan was 19.1% while exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke was 69.1% and 48.3% at the workplace and home, respectively (8). In the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey for 2012-2013, 39.1% of people were exposed to indoor tobacco smoke every day (8). Tobacco consumption including second-hand smoking is the fourth leading cause of death and disability in Pakistan (9). Second-hand tobacco smoke exposure caused 33 524 deaths in Pakistan in 2017, which was 2.37% of the total deaths (9). As second-hand tobacco smoke exposure is a major public health threat in Pakistan, calculating the precise prevalence and identifying high-risk population groups can support evidence-based policies on banning smoking. However, adequate research in this field is lacking in Pakistan. Previously, most of the studies in Pakistan focused on the prevalence and determinants of active smoking (8,10) . The few studies on second-hand tobacco smoke mostly focused on knowledge and attitude of people towards active and passive smoking (11,12) . Some studies analysed the relationship between second-hand tobacco smoke and specific diseases such as respiratory diseases and pregnancy outcomes (13,14) , and a few calculated the prevalence of exposure to second-hand Abstract Background: Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke is a public health problem in countries with high prevalence of active smoking such as Pakistan. However, few studies have assessed the prevalence and risk factors for exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Aims: To estimate the prevalence and factors associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke in Pakistan. Methods: This study used data from the 2017-2018 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey to calculate the prevalence and determinants of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure. Sociodemographic characteristics, family size and exposure to media by the respondents were the independent variables. The chi-square test and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and the independent variables.hy9 Results: The survey included 61 940 adults, of which 30 027 (48.5%) were males and 31 913 (51.5%) females. The overall prevalence of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke was 34.3%: 35.6% among males and 33.2% among females. Higher education level and rural residence were significantly positively associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke among both sexes. Having a radio was inversely associated with exposure while having a television was positively associated with exposure among both sexes. Large family size was inversely associated with exposure. Currently and previously married females had significantly greater risk of exposure than never-married females. Conclusion: Tailored health interventions and policies are needed that target populations at high-risk of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Strict smoking bans in public places should be implemented to limit exposure to second- hand tobacco smoke in Pakistan. Keywords: second-hand smoking, tobacco smoke pollution, prevalence, risk factors, smoking in Pakistan. East World Health Organization. EMHJ is an open access journal. This paper is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 3.0 IGO EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022tobacco smoke in a specific region or age group (12,15) . We found only one study that calculated second-hand tobacco smoke prevalence at the national level in Pakistan (16). However, this study did not consider all the factors that can affect the prevalence of exposure to second- hand tobacco smoke. Most of these previous studies are outdated and are not based on the latest information on second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in Pakistan. Therefore, this study aimed to calculate the prevalence of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in Pakistani adults, disaggregated by sex, using the latest data from the 2017-2018 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey. We analyzed the association between socioeconomic characteristics, family type and media-related factors and the prevalence of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. The results of this study will be useful for policymakers' interventions focusing on high-risk groups. Methods Data source This study used secondary data from the 2017-2018 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (17), a nationally representative household survey which provides the most recent and reliable data on a wide range of indicators, including maternal health, women's empowerment, domestic violence and HIV and AIDS. The data are freely accessible. This survey included four provinces of Pakistan: Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas, which were not included in the previous surveys. The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey included 16 240 households selected by two-stage, stratified, random sampling. In the first stage, all the regions were separated into urban and rural populations and divided further into small areas called enumeration blocks. In the second stage, households were selected from each block using random sampling design (17). For this study, we included males and females aged 15 years and older, both smokers and non-smokers. Variables The outcome variable was exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Respondents were asked how frequently household members smoked inside the house with four response categories: never, daily, weekly and monthly. We recoded the responses into no or yes. The independent variables were sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, family and media- related factors. Sociodemographic variables included: age group (15-35, 36-59, 60 years); level of education (no education, primary or secondary level, higher education); wealth index measured in quartiles (poor, middle, rich); place of residence (urban, rural); and region of residence Others included Gilgit Baltistan, Azad Jammu Kashmir, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Islamabad Capital Territory. Family-related factors included family size (2, 3-5, > 5 members) and marital status (never married, currently married, previously/ ever married). Media-associated variables were having a radio, a television, the internet; responses for all three categories were coded no or yes. Statistical analysis SPSS version 20 was used to analyse the data. To account for complex sampling design, weighted data were used to produce nationally representative results. Descriptive statistics were calculated and the chi-square test was used to assess the association between exposure to second- hand tobacco smoke and the independent variables. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted effects of the different variables on the prevalence of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Results were presented separately for males and females. Ethical considerations No ethical approval was needed for this study because we used secondary data from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey. These data are publicly available (17). Consent was not needed from subjects because we used already collected anonymized data from a national survey. Results The total sample size was 61 940; 30 027 (48.5%) males and 31 913 (51.5%) females. Respondents were aged 15- 85 years. Of the total sample, 34.3% (21 271/61 940) were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke. Of males, 35.6% (10 686/30 027) were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke compared with 33.2% (10 585/31 913) of females. Table 1 shows prevalence of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke in males and females by independent variables. In the younger population, the prevalence of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke was higher in females while exposure in the older age group was greater in males ( P < 0.001). Greater proportions of males with primary, secondary or higher education level were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke than females of the same education level ( P < 0.001). The prevalence of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke was higher in males than females in urban areas. A greater proportion of males living in a two-member family reported exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke than females, as did never-married males. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher education versus no education, living in rural rather than urban areas, and being in the high or middle wealth index versus low wealth index were positively and significantly associated with second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in both males and females (Table 1). Compared with Punjab, both males and females in Sindh and other areas had a significantly greater odds of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure, while males and females in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan had significantly lower odds. In both males and females, Book Vol Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022having a radio was significantly negatively associated with second-hand tobacco smoke exposure while having a television was positively associated. In males, having internet connections was significantly positively associated with second-hand tobacco smoke exposure. The odds of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke were significantly lower in large families than two-member families for both males and females. Previously married males had significantly lower odds of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke than never married males. However, both currently and previously married females had significantly greater odds of exposure to second- hand tobacco smoke than never married females.

Book Vol 807Book Vol EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022Discussion Our analysis showed a high rate of exposure to second- hand tobacco smoke in Pakistan (34.3%), which is comparable with previous studies from other Asian countries (18,19) . A study in Bangladesh found that 43% of non-smoking adults were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke at home (20). In our study men had higher rates of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke than women (35.6% versus 33.2%) which is consistent with other studies (21,22) . Greater exposure of men in other environments such as public places and workplaces may explain the higher exposure of men to second-hand tobacco smoke in traditional societies. We could not examine second-hand tobacco smoke exposure by place of exposure (at home or in other places) and sex as the data did not provide this information. In our study, exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke differed by age group, region, socioeconomic status and education level, which concurs with previous studies (23,24) . Rural and wealthier respondents in Pakistan were at increased risk for second-hand tobacco smoke exposure. This pattern is consistent with a study in tobacco-cultivating rural areas of China (21). In our study, respondents in Sindh, which is the largest province of Pakistan by area and second largest province by population, had the highest odds of second-hand tobacco Table 2 Factors associated with second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in males and females, Pakistan: logistic regression analysis Variable Males Females OR (95% CI) OR (95% CI) Age, in years 15-35 0.87* (0.79-0.97) 60 0.97(0.89-1.06) 0.92 (0.835-1.02) 1.20* (1.10-1.31) Higher 1.40* 1.24* Gilgit Baltistan, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu Kashmir and Federally Administered Tribal Areas. *Significant at P < 0.05. Book Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022smoke exposure. These findings underscore the need to devise appropriate policies and programmes at the provincial level to reduce second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in this region. Focus should be on creating tobacco-smoke-free environments with implementation of smoke-free laws in all public places, such as education institutes, health care facilities, workplaces, shopping malls, train and bus stations, and places of entertainment. Regarding education, respondents with primary and higher education were 1.2 times more likely to report second-hand tobacco smoke exposure than those with no education. A higher proportion of male respondents with higher education levels were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke than females with similar educational backgrounds. This differs from other studies that showed that a higher level of education was negatively associated with smoking behaviour (25), and that educated people had better risk perceptions of many environmental health risks and protective factors against them (26). However, this association and explanation is less likely to be true in developing countries where people, despite higher levels of education, are at increased odds of exposure to hazardous work environments. Such disparities have also been observed in developing countries where educated Black and Hispanic people were at increased risk of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure than White educated people (27). Thus, higher education, despite being a significant determinant of health behaviour, does not guard all people against exposure to second- hand tobacco smoke. Social influences and cultural factors contribute to the health behaviour of the general population. Tobacco use is associated with masculinity in some patriarchal societies (28). These findings emphasize the need to recognize the complex interaction of these factors in developing countries which can help policy- makers devise effective anti-smoking interventions focused on people of higher education status. People who reported access to the internet and television at home were significantly more likely to report second-hand tobacco smoke exposure. This association may be connected with fancy advertisements and scenes in movies showing heroes as smokers. Although, these advertisements and scenes carry written health warnings, visual effects are more effectual and memorable. Television and media campaigns focus more on the health effects of active smoking rather than on health risks of second-hand tobacco smoke. Therefore, policymakers should seek to raise awareness on the dangers of second-hand tobacco smoke through television and the internet and ban content that promotes smoking and tobacco products. Educational campaigns should develop messages that target both males and females bearing in mind the specific contexts that increase their vulnerability. For instance, second- hand tobacco smoke exposure of males is more likely to be in their work environment, whereas females are more likely to be exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke in their home settings. In this study 33.2% of the women reported second-hand tobacco smoke exposure, which is alarmingly high. Addressing the hazards of second- hand tobacco smoke exposure at the grass-roots level by creating smoke-free homes has been recommended (29). Women who were currently married or ever married were 1.3 times more at risk of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure than unmarried women. In Middle Eastern and Asian societies, the rates of tobacco smoking are relatively low among women because social norms usually disapprove of women smoking (30,31) . However, these women are often at increased risk of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure because of the tobacco use of their husbands, fathers or brothers (32). Women are not empowered enough to stop their male relatives from smoking; thus spreading information to whole families, especially men, about the effects of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure on health could be helpful. Indeed, even educated people perceive second-hand tobacco smoke as non-hazardous, therefore, it is important to create more awareness about the health-related effects of second- hand tobacco smoke across all education groups. In our study, the risk of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke was greater among respondents of higher socioeconomic status, which contradicts previous studies that demonstrated an inverse relationship between income and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure (33) or no relationship (21). The reasons for this difference in findings are unclear but it suggests that people of all socioeconomic levels are at risk of exposure to second- hand tobacco smoke and interventions should focus both on rich and poor communities. We found that people living in tribal regions such as Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Gilgit Baltistan, and Azad Jammu Kashmir were at a higher risk of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke than those in Punjab. The positive relationship between better wealth status and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure could be due to confounding variables such as region of residence. Our study has some limitations. First, the analysis is based on secondary data obtained from a demographic health survey in Pakistan which measured exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke through self-reporting. Second, the survey did not provide information on frequency of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure and the environments in which respondents were exposed. Lastly, we did not analyse the prevalence of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure among non-smokers. Despite these limitations, our findings indicate the need for all- inclusive interventions to prevent second-hand tobacco smoke exposure for all populations and directions for future research to obtain comprehensive data about the predictors of second-hand smoke exposure and its effect on health in Pakistan. In conclusion, the prevalence of second-hand smoke exposure is quite high in Pakistan and needs the attention of the public health authorities. Funding: None. Competing interests: None declared.

Introduction Tobacco use is one of the most significant preventable causes of death worldwide and a modifiable risk factor for noncommunicable diseases ( 1). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that > 8 million people die annually from tobacco use. Second-hand tobacco smoke exposure causes 1.2 million deaths annually ( 2), mostly among women and children ( 3). Globally, tobacco smoking and second-hand smoke incur substantial healthcare costs and loss of productivity through morbidity and premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is true for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates ( 4, 5). Tobacco use among adults in Qatar decreased from 36.7% in 2003 to 25.2% in 2021 ( 6, 7). Qatar ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and consequently introduced several antitobacco control measures, such as: strengthening tobacco legislation; reinforcing public smoking bans; introducing tobacco taxation; expanding smoking cessation services; and increasing prevention awareness to discourage people from smoking. The Tobacco Control Center, WHO Collaborative Center, in Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar, have aligned with the Qatar National Vision of 2030 and the Qatar Ministry of Public Health Strategy of 2018-2022 to work relentlessly towards further reduction in the prevalence of tobacco use. Although tobacco use is currently low among women in Qatar (9.2%), tobacco use among men is high (36.6%) (6), and the risk to women from second-hand smoke exposure is a pressing concern. Tobacco use, including second-hand smoke exposure, increases women's risk of noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer, as well as premature delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight infants, sudden-infant death syndrome, and acute lower respiratory infections ( 8, 9). In Qatar, prevalence data on second-hand tobacco smoke exposure among women is limited to the 2013 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) ( 10). WHO recommends the development of proactive and effective public health interventions to control tobacco use; therefore, research is needed to determine the potential risk of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure for women ( 11) and whether this should be a public health concern in Qatar. Abstract Background: Tobacco use among women in Qatar is currently low. However, the risk of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke among them is a pressing concern because of the high prevalence of tobacco use by men. Aims: To describe the prevalence and risk factors for second-hand tobacco smoke exposure at home and at workplaces, schools, cafes, and restaurants in Qatar. Methods: We analysed data from a population-based survey of 7921 adults aged 18 years, conducted in Qatar between March and December 2019. The study used multilevel cluster selection and comprised government employees and university students. Results: Among the participants, 19.3% (n = 1219) reported that smoking was allowed in their homes, 3.1% (n = 196) said it was allowed in the workplace or school, and 3.3% (n = 204) said it was allowed in cafes and restaurants. Among the women, 22.8% (n = 589) allowed smoking inside their homes, including 51.8% (n = 130) of tobacco users and 38.5% (n = 553) of those who lived with a tobacco user. Living with and being a tobacco user significantly predicted the likelihood of reporting second-hand tobacco smoke at home. Conclusion: Second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in the home is a health concern for women and children in Qatar. This study provides baseline data for tobacco control policies and programmes, particularly in relation to the promotion of smoke-free home environments.

This paper is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 3.0 IGO EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022The objectives of this study were to: (1) report the prevalence of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure inside the home, workplaces/universities, and caf\u00e9/ restaurants in Qatar; (2) determine second-hand tobacco smoke exposure inside the home among women (tobacco users and nonusers) living with a smoker; and (3) identify key factors associated with second-hand tobacco smoke exposure. Methods Study design, population, and sampling We used data from a nationwide, population-based cross-sectional study of adults aged 18 years (nationals and expatriates) conducted in Qatar during March to December 2019. The study reference population of government employees and university students was formed using multilevel cluster selection. The government employees were selected from the health sector, ministries, and government authorities and units, and the students were selected from 4 government universities, to achieve a fair representation of Qatari adults. The study's research design was based on a systematic process to ensure replicability. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board, Medical Research Center, Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar. The details of the methodology have been published previously ( 6). Data collection Data were collected using a self-administered ques- tionnaire consisting of a country-adapted summarized version of GATS. The questionnaire was administered with attention to protocol adherence by trained staff to guarantee a unified procedure. Study participants were provided with an envelope that included the questionnaire along with an information sheet describing the study. To ensure anonymity and confidentiality of responses, the respondents were asked to complete the questionnaire and return it in a sealed envelope. The questionnaire included questions on: key demographic characteristics; use of all tobacco products including cigarettes, waterpipe or shisha, medwakh (traditional Arabic pipe), and cigars; whether smoking was allowed in the home (proxy for second-hand smoke exposure), workplaces/universities, cafes/restaurants; participant's attitude towards the ban on tobacco sales to minors, ban on tobacco smoking in workplaces/cafes/restaurants, and raising the price of tobacco. Sample size and data analysis The sample size for the survey was 7921, with an overall survey response rate of 89.7%. Data were analysed for complete responses about second-hand tobacco smoke in the home, workplaces/universities, and cafes/restaurants, and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in the home among women. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 27. Sample characteristics were expressed as number (%) or mean and standard deviation. The outcome variable was allowing smoking at home because this was a potential route for second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in the home among women. We used the Chi square test to evaluate the association between tobacco smoking at home and demographic characteristics including: monthly income; current tobacco use; living with a smoker at home; knowing that breathing other people's tobacco smoke causes illness in nonsmokers; banning the sales of tobacco to individuals aged < 18 years; banning smoking in workplaces and restaurants; raising the price of tobacco products; and raising the price reduces tobacco consumption. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to test for the risk factors associated with allowing smoking and second-hand tobacco smoke in the home by subgroups (total numbers of women, female smokers, and female nonsmokers living with a smoker in the household). Statistical significance was defined as P 0.05. Results Second-hand tobacco smoke exposure Overall, 19.3% of participants ( n = 1219) reported living in a household where smoking was allowed inside the home: this represented 16.9% ( n = 630) of male and 22.8% ( n = 589) of female participants (Table 1). When participants were asked what best described the rules inside workplaces/universities, 3.1% ( n = 196) reported that smoking was allowed, 41.5% ( n = 2589) that it was not allowed, and 55.4% ( n = 3459) that it was allowed in designated areas. When participants were asked about what best described the rules inside cafes/restaurants that they visited frequently, 3.3% ( n = 204) reported that smoking was allowed, 39.0% ( n = 2425) that it was not allowed, and 57.8% ( n = 3596) that it was allowed in designated areas. Second-hand tobacco smoke exposure inside the home among women A total of 2585 women reported on smoking rules in their homes (Table 1). Of these, 22.8% ( n = 589) said smoking was allowed in their homes: 85.8% ( n = 488) on a daily versus 14.2% ( n = 81) on a nondaily basis (results not shown). Less than a quarter of Qatari women (22.3%) and non- Qatari women (23.8%) reported that tobacco smoking was allowed in their homes (Table 2). Among women aged 18- 24 years, 25.3% allowed smoking inside the home, which was higher than in other age groups. Tobacco smoking was allowed in the home by 25.8% of women with secondary or less education; 23.4% of married women; 27.8% of women with monthly income of 5000-10 000 QR; 51.8% of women who were current tobacco users; 38.5% of women who reported having a smoker in the home; 24.4% of women with health problems; and 22.0% of women who thought that breathing other people's tobacco smoke caused illness in nonsmokers. Smoking was allowed in the home by 22.2% of women who thought that banning sales of tobacco to individuals aged Book Vol No. 11 - 2022< 18 years was important; 21.5% of women who supported smoking bans in workplaces, 21.1% of women who supported smoking bans in restaurants; 21.3% of women who supported raising the price of tobacco products; and 20.5% of women who thought that increasing the price of tobacco products would reduce consumption. Multivariable logistic regression Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the impact of 10 significant variables identified in the bivariate analysis on the likelihood that women would allow smoking/second-hand smoke in the home (Table 3). The full model was found to be statistically significant, 2 (9, N = 2139) = 82.75, P < 0.001, -2LL pseudo-R2) of the variance in allowing smoking/second-hand smoke in the home (results not shown). Only 4 of the independent variables made a significant contribution to the model. The strongest predictor for allowing tobacco smoking and second-hand tobacco smoke in the home was having a member of the household who was currently using tobacco products [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 25.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.56-39.82]. The next strongest predictor was if the female participant was herself a tobacco user (AOR 4.26; 95% CI 2.85-6.35). However, women who thought that increasing the price of tobacco products would reduce consumption were less likely to allow smoking in the home (AOR 0.71; 95% CI 0.54-0.92). Women who thought banning tobacco sales to minors was important were less likely to allow smoking in the home (AOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.35-1.0), with borderline significance compared with those who disagreed. Among female tobacco users, having a smoker in the household was a risk factor for allowing smoking and second-hand tobacco smoke in the home (AOR 10.37; 95% CI 5.10-21.10). However, those who supported banning tobacco in restaurants were less likely to allow smoking in the home (AOR 0.52; 95% CI 0.27-1.0). Female nonusers of tobacco living with a smoker and who supported banning tobacco sales to minors were less likely to allow smoking in the home (AOR 0.51; 95% CI 0.29-0.90). Discussion Tobacco use among women in Qatar is currently lower than global (20%) and regional rates (up to 30%) ( 9). In a previous population-based study, we found that tobacco use was significantly lower among Qatari women (3.0%) than non-Qatari women (19.7%) ( 6). Similar to GATS 2013, the proportion of tobacco use was almost 7 times less among Qatari than non-Qatari women (0.6% vs 4.6%) ( 10). In Qatar, tobacco use by women had low social acceptability and stigma ( 7). Shisha smoking among women is more socially acceptable than tobacco smoking, and is a potential gateway for tobacco use (9,12,13). The low prevalence of tobacco use among Qatari women is likely associated with the dominant cultural norm that can be preserved and even strengthened through additional public awareness interventions. For instance, healthcare professionals can play a crucial role in increasing awareness among communities about the health risks of tobacco smoking, encouraging them to quit, or discouraging them from starting ( 14). A recent study found that healthcare workers in Qatar were promoting a culture that contributed to adopting nonsmoking behaviour by providing tobacco counselling and cessation interventions ( 15). This study is the first to explore second-hand tobacco smoke exposure at the community level in Qatar. We found that 19.3% of adults were exposed to tobacco smoke at home. This was higher than the GATS results (16.8%) (10), but lower than worldwide exposure to second-hand smoke among female nonsmokers (35%) ( 16,17), as well as being lower than in other studies conducted in the region (18-20). Understanding the factors that allow tobacco use indoors will help inform the development of tailored primary prevention interventions that take into consideration the unique gender-specific motivations Table 1 Second-hand tobacco smoking rules inside the home, workplace/university, and cafes/restaurants according to gender Total Male Female n (% of total) n (%) n (%) What best describes the rules inside your home? 6307 (100) 3722 (41.8) 2585 (58.2) Allowed 1219 Not allowed 5088 (80.7) 3092 (83.1) 1996 (77.2) What best 6244 (100) 3687 (59.0) 2557 (41.0) Allowed 196 (3.3) 76 (3.0) Not allowed 2589 (41.5) 1527 (41.4) 1062 (41.5) Designated areas 3459 (55.4) 2040 (55.3) 1419 (55.5) What best describes the cafes/restaurants? 6225 (100) 3665 (58.9) 2560 (41.1) Allowed 204 (3.3) (3.5) 76 (3.0) Not allowed 2425 (39.0) 1497 (40.8) 928 (36.3) Designated EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022 Table 2 Percentage distribution of adult women describing the rules about smoking in the home, according to demographic characteristics and tobacco use All women Woman is active tobacco user Woman is not tobacco user Smoker in family No smoker in family House rules for smoking Never allowed Allowed P valueNever allowed Allowed P valueNever allowed Allowed P valueNever allowed Allowed P value Demographic characteristics n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) 1996 (77.2) 589 (22.8) 121 (48.2) 130 (51.8) 821 (64.3) 1002 (76.2) 234 (23.8) 93 (46.7) 106 (53.3) 211 (63.7) 120 (36.3) 433 (98.6) 6 (1.4) Age 18-24 387 (74.7) 131 (25.3) 0.177 35 47 (47.0) 53 (53.0) 285 (66.7) 142 (33.3) 323 (98.8) 4 (1.2) 35-44 482 (79.0) 128 (21.0) 24 (47.1) 27 (52.9) 213 (69.6) 93 (30.4) 237 (97.1) 7 (2.9) 45+ 200 (81.0) 47 (19.0) 5 (31.1) 11 (68.8) 78 (70.9) 32 (29.1) 111 (98.2) 2 (1.8) Education Secondary or less 414 (74.2) 144 (25.8) 0.076 18 (40.9) 26 (59.1) 0.373 191 (62.8) 113 (37.2) 0.371 193 (98.5) 3 (1.5) 0.983 University 1309 (77.6) 377 (22.4) 79 (49.1) 82 (50.9) 558 (66.8) 277 (33.2) 638 (98.3) 11 (1.7) Postgraduate (80.5) 18 (43.9) 69 (62.7) 41 (37.3) 167 (98.2) 3 (1.8) Marital status Single 864 (77.0) 258 (23.0) 0.204 58 (49.6) 59 (50.4) 0.165 320 (62.6) 191 (37.4) 0.108 472 (99.4) 3 (0.6) 0.066 Married 991 (76.6) 302 (23.4) 49 (43.4) 64 (56.6) 446 (67.0) 220 (33.0) 465 (97.5) 12 (2.5) Widowed/separated/divorced 123 (83.1) 25 (16.9) 12 (66.7) 6 (33.3) 50 (73.5) 18 (26.5) 56 (98.2) 1 (1.8) Monthly income, QR 0-5000 245 (76.6) 75 (23.4) 0.013 29 (56.9) 22 (43.1) 0.427 71 (58.7) 50 (41.3) 143 (100) 0 0.024 5000-10000 255 (72.2) 98 (27.8) 26 (44.8) 32 (55.2) 64 (41.3) 135 (99.3) 1 (0.7) 10000-25000 (28.0) 197 (99.5) 1 (0.5) >40000 146 (82.5) 31 (17.5) 3 (60.0) 2 (40.0) 59 (70.2) 25 (29.8) 79 (95.2) 4 (4.8) Tobacco user Current user 121 (48.2) 130 (51.8) <0.001 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Nonuser 1859 (80.5) 451 (19.5) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Smoker at homea\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Yes 883 (61.5) 553 (38.5) <0.001 57 (33.3) 114 (66.7) <0.001 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 No 1073 (97.4) 29 (2.6) 62 (83.8) 12 (16.2) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Book Vol Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022All women Woman is active tobacco user Woman is not tobacco user Smoker in family No smoker in family House rules for smoking Never allowed Allowed P valueNever allowed Allowed P valueNever allowed Allowed P valueNever allowed Allowed P value Demographic characteristics n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) Health problems Yes 682 (75.6) 220 (24.4) 0.150 36 (51.4) 34 (48.6) 0.533 (67.0) (78.2) (21.8) 78 (47.0) 88 (53.0) 304 (63.5) 175 (36.5%) 326 (97.9) 7 (2.1) Breathing other people's smoke cause illnesses in nonsmokers Yes 16 (1.8) 0.707 No 178 (70.1) 76 (29.9) 17 (39.5) 26 (60.5) 71 (59.7) 48 (40.3) 82 (98.8) 1 (1.2) Banning the sales of tobacco to individuals aged < 18 years Yes 1833 (77.8) 522 (22.2) 0.003 109 (48.2) 117 (51.8) 0.637 (66.5) 382 (33.5) 0.036 921 (98.4) 15 (1.6) 0.237 No 101 (67.3) 49 (32.7) 9 (42.9) 12 (57.1) 38 (54.3) 32 (45.7) 51 (96.2) 2 (3.8) Banning smoking in the workplace Yes 1765 (78.2) 493 (21.8) 0.008 379 (34.1) 0.922 899 (98.6) 13 (1.4) 0.021 No 174 (70.7) 72 (29.3) 25 (43.9) 32 (56.1) 67 (66.3) 34 (33.7) 78 (95.1) 4 (4.9) Banning smoking in the restaurants Yes 1766 (78.9) 473 (21.1) <0.001 99 (36.9) 36 (36.0) 64 (64.0) 64 (66.7) 32 (33.3) 65 (97.0) 2 (3.0) Raising the price of tobacco products Yes 1725 (78.7) 467 (21.3) <0.001 74 (53.2) (65.0) 35 (35.0) 80 (97.6) 2 (2.4) Raising the price reduces consumption Yes 1378 (79.5) 355 (20.5) <0.001 No (71.3) (28.7) 56 (44.1) 71 (55.9) 224 (61.9) 138 (38.1) 244 (99.2) 2 (0.8) aIdentifies other household members smoking who are living in the same home regardless of whether the participant was a smoker.

The strongest predictors of second- hand smoke in the home were having a member of the household who uses tobacco products, and if the women themselves were tobacco users, as reported in other studies ( 17,22,23). While this may seem intuitive, in a setting where research on smoking behaviour is nascent, it is important to be able to document smokers who are smoking in their homes and outside. Although only 22.8% of women reported that smoking was allowed in the home, 85.8% reported potential daily exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke in their homes. This reflected suboptimal Book EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022efforts to enforce smoking rules and maintain a smoke- free environment in the home, and/or that women did not have the power to negotiate smoke-free spaces, even within their own homes. Designated smoking areas, which are not in line with smoke-free environments described in WHO FCTC Article 8, are a potential source of second-hand tobacco smoke, because the smoke spreads widely, both vertically and horizontally, from the designated area (24). Therefore, designated smoking areas do not provide effective protection from second-hand tobacco smoke and should not be allowed. GATS 2013 showed that 12.0% of adults who worked indoors were exposed to second- hand tobacco smoke in the workplace ( 10). We found that only 3.1% of adults reported that smoking was allowed in the workplace/university and 41.5% reported that smoking was not allowed, but 55.4% reported smoking in designated areas only. GATS 2013 reported that 25.9% of adults were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke in restaurants ( 10), whereas we found that only 3.3% reported that smoking was allowed in restaurants but 57.8% reported that it was allowed in designated areas. There remains an urgent need for comprehensive tobacco use and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure monitoring at the national level, as recommended by WHO FCTC ( 25). A lot of national tobacco control legislation has been enacted recently in Qatar, but our findings indicated that laws aimed at establishing smoke-free environments in public places may not have been effectively implemented and enforced. An example is Law no. 10 of 2016 on the control of tobacco and its derivatives in Qatar ( 26), which outlines the prohibition of smoking in enclosed public spaces. Other measures include a smoking ban in vehicles with children under the age of 18 years, large fines if an individual is caught smoking in an enclosed public space, and licence cancellation for cafes. The Tobacco Control Center has been providing tobacco cessation services over the telephone, including in-depth counselling, treatment planning, follow-up sessions, and psychological support for behaviour modification ( 27). Strengthened tobacco control has also formed part of Qatar's strong measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. Shisha smoking has been prohibited since the beginning of the pandemic. Although shisha smoking is perceived as lower risk than cigarette smoking, elevated levels of particulate pollution were found in the waterpipe cafes in Doha, Qatar, endangering air quality and public health ( 28). This highlights the importance of continuing to monitor shisha smoking trends and increasing awareness of its harmful health effects and subsequent exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. In this study, supporting an increase in the price of tobacco was predictive of not allowing smoking in the home. Female tobacco users supporting a tobacco ban in restaurants, and nonusers living with a smoker, and who were concerned about selling tobacco to minors, were also less likely to allow smoking in the home. Importantly, these findings relate to attitudes and perceptions toward tobacco control that may effectively influence smoking-related behaviour ( 29). This emphasizes the need for strengthening health-related knowledge and planning effective health education programmes in family settings. The Government of Qatar should continue to take effective measures to change attitudes to smoking by promoting and enacting smoke-free legislation, to change social norms towards nonsmoking, so that second-hand tobacco smoke in the home and other smoking-related behaviours are not allowed ( 30). Unlike other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the economic cost of smoking and second-hand tobacco smoke in Qatar is estimated to be low ( 4, 20). There is no projected increase in tobacco use across Qatar or expansion of tobacco-related activities (such as tobacco sponsorship of sporting events), and within the FCTC framework, Qatar has committed to adopting effective measures for tobacco control ( 6, 10). However, our findings highlight the need for additional education and preventive programmes to emphasize the importance of maintaining a smoke-free home environment. In Qatar, antitobacco education and awareness are still not included as an integral part of the curriculum in schools and colleges. The Tobacco Control Center is predominantly responsible for the provision of smoking cessation services and raising public awareness of the dangers of tobacco use, to prevent its uptake among adolescents, particularly young women. The Center also discourages indoor smoking and exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, because starting smoking disproportionately affects the health of women and children. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift of these antitobacco health promotion activities online and on social media. Further research is needed to understand the role that awareness, decision-making, self-efficacy, empowerment, and social status play in women's ability to limit their exposure and that of other household members to second-hand tobacco smoke ( 17). Our finding that 25.3% of women aged 18-24 years reported that smoking was allowed in the home highlights the opportunity to focus on prevention of tobacco-related illnesses among women of reproductive age and their unborn children. Integration of tobacco control programmes that focus on second-hand tobacco smoke into Qatar's maternal and child health programme could be a cost-effective strategy to educate women about the dangers of tobacco use and benefits of quitting. Increased levels of awareness of the health risks, increased exposure to antitobacco messaging, and increased surveillance could lead to a significant increase in the adoption of household smoking bans, especially among households with no smokers ( 31, 32). Greater adoption of smoking bans could potentially influence the community and change acceptance of tobacco use and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure ( 25). There is clearly a need for education on the risks of all forms of tobacco use, bans on tobacco advertising, protection against second-hand tobacco smoke, and increased support for quitting. It is also important to empower women to take Book Vol 28-11.indb 819Book Vol EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022a leading role in tobacco control, and to encourage men to take greater responsibility in protecting women and children from their personal tobacco use. The current study adds to an emerging body of evidence on female second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in Qatar. A strength of this study was the use of data from a representative sample based on a systematic sampling technique with a large sample size using a modified version of a standardized and validated questionnaire. The limitations of our study were mainly related to the self-reported nature of the data collected because this may have underestimated smoking prevalence ( 33). However, the reliability of the self-report of second-hand smoke exposure was strengthened by use of a self-administered survey to assure privacy and confidentiality because sensitive issues to the local Qatari context were discussed (34). Other limitations were the cross-sectional design and lack of data from nonresponders. However, these limitations were counterbalanced by the methodological advantages. Conclusions Our findings make an important contribution to the current understanding of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in Qatar. While the reported prevalence of second-hand tobacco smoke in the home was low (22.8%), the current rate of exposure represents an increased risk for women and children. Living with a tobacco user and being a tobacco user were associated with second-hand tobacco smoke exposure in the home environment. These findings could be helpful in guiding the development of contextualized sex-specific primary prevention and tobacco control interventions to promote tobacco-smoke-free homes. This is a useful starting point for understanding tobacco-related behaviour and decision-making among women in Qatar, and could help to control exposure to tobacco in Qatar and beyond.

Introduction The World Health Organization declared a pandemic status for COVID-19 on 11 March 2020. On 19 February 2020, the Islamic Republic of Iran reported its first confirmed cases of COVID-19. As of 19 February 2021, more than 7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and almost 136 000 deaths had been reported by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education ( 1). The COVID-19 pandemic caused a worldwide blood inventory shortage and a significant reduction in blood donation. In the United States of America (USA), nearly 4000 American Red Cross blood drives were cancelled, representing approximately 130 000 fewer donations (2). A significant drop in blood donors was reported in Zhejiang Province in China, up to 67% during the first weeks of the pandemic ( 3). While this shortfall was less serious in countries such as Canada (30%) and Greece (36%) ( 4), some African countries reported up to 80% decrease in blood collection ( 5). Among the Eastern Mediterranean Region Member States, the reduction in blood supply in the early stages of the pandemic ranged from 10% to 75% ( 6). Reduced in-house collections and cancellation of blood drives as well as public fear of contracting COVID-19 contributed to the decrease in donations in this region. This gap was partly filled by a reduction in demand due to the cancellation of elective surgeries and the unwillingness of patients to be referred to hospitals because of fear of contracting COVID-19 ( 7). However, blood services reported that blood utilization returned almost to the same levels shortly after the critical phase of the pandemic ( 8). During the first 8 weeks of the pandemic in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has a centralized blood transfusion organization, the number of blood donations decreased by about 29.4%. By implementing emergency and precautionary measures, the number of donations gradually increased, from 23 465 to 29 665 blood units (26.4%) within the next 2 weeks. Improving the online blood donation appointment system, changes in the Abstract Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected blood inventory and donation worldwide. The Islamic Republic of Iran was among the first countries to report the COVID-19 pandemic and it faced a significant blood shortage during the first weeks of the pandemic. Aims: We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the number, type, and safety of blood donations, comparing the periods before and during the pandemic. Methods: This retrospective study evaluated data from all volunteers who attended the blood transfusion centres in the Islamic Republic of Iran from March to December 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and during the same period in 2019, i.e. pre-pandemic. Data on the number of blood collections, confirmed transfusion transmissible infection marker test results, and donor demographic information were collected from the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization integrated donor database. Results: Total blood donations decreased by 8.38%. The number of first-time, lapsed, and female blood donors increased by 4.41%, 0.17%, and 0.90% respectively. Regular blood donation decreased by 4.58%. The distribution of the 3 main blood products, red cell concentrate, frozen fresh plasma and platelets, decreased by 7.86%. All changes were statistically significant. The prevalence rates of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B surface antigen increased significantly during the pandemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 had a negative effect on blood safety and availability in the Islamic Republic of Iran. To improve blood supply and enhance regular blood donation, the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization needs to reassure blood donors of the safety and hygiene measures being observed at blood collection sites.

This paper is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 3.0 IGO Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022eligibility criteria for blood donation, interacting with hospitals to better manage blood wastage, and engaging with social media may have contributed to this increase (9). Some studies showed that the COVID-19 pandemic may have had an impact on the type (first-time/regular) and demographic profile of blood donors as well as on blood safety ( 10-12 ). In a 2021 study, it was found that the numbers of first time and female blood donors increased in the Islamic Republic of Iran during the pandemic compared to February to April 2019 and 2020 ( 11). A study conducted in the USA showed an increase in the number of female and middle-aged donors during the pandemic (10). To further assess these possible changes, we compared the numbers, types and demographic characteristics of blood donors as well as the rates of transfusion- transmissible infections (TTIs) during the 10-month pre- pandemic and pandemic periods in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods This retrospective study was conducted at the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO). We included all volunteers ( n = 3 307 062) who attended the blood collection centres for whole blood donation. All the data collected from March to December 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) along with data from the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID) were collected from the IBTO integrated donor database. The total number of blood collections, the total extent of the distribution of the 3 main blood products (red cell concentrate, frozen fresh plasma and platelets) to hospitals and health care centres, and demographic information such as type (regular, first, lapsed) and sex of blood donors were retrieved for the study periods. A regular blood donor is one who donates at least 2 times a year; a lapsed blood donor is one who has a record of blood donation but has not made any donation in the past year. Test results from all donations received during the 2 study periods were used to report TTI markers. Reported rates (per 100 000) included only confirmed reactive results using ELISA tests in 2019 and electrochemiluminescence and chemiluminescence tests in 2020 after a reactive screening test for human HBsAg, anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV Ab) and HIV antigen/antibody (HIV Ag/Ab). Comparisons for total blood donations and distribution of total blood products were carried out for the study periods in 2019 and 2020. Chi-square testing (RStudio Team , 2020) was used to compare TTI markers for the corresponding periods in 2019 and 2020. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Iranian High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine. Results In total, 1 581 174 blood donations were made during the 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Islamic Republic of Iran, indicating an 8.38% reduction compared with the same period pre-pandemic in 2019 (1 725 882) (Table 1). First-time blood donors accounted for 15.79% (248 631) of these donations, an increase of 4.41% during the pandemic period in 2020 ( P < 0.001) (Table 1). The share of lapsed blood donors was slightly higher, from 28.98% in 2019 to 29.15% in 2020 ( P < 0.001). Conversely, the share of regular donors decreased from 59.64% to 55.06% (4.58% reduction) during the study period ( P < 0.001). However, the number of female blood donors during the study period in 2020 was 81 856 (5.05%), an increase of 0.90% over the same period in 2019 (4.29%) ( P < 0.001). The participation of female blood donors was the highest since the 5.16% recorded in 2012. Altogether, 2 755 708 allotments of the 3 main blood products (red cell concentrate, frozen fresh plasma and platelets) were distributed to the hospitals during March-December 2020 (Table 2). Compared with the same period in 2019, this shows a 7.86% total reduction (P < 0.0001). However, the request/distribution ratio was 83.00% and 86.42% during the 2 study periods, indicating that hospitals and health care centres did not face any shortage in their needs; this was mainly due to the cancellation of elective surgeries.

The prevalence of human T-lymphotropic virus was relatively unchanged. However, the prevalence of HCV and HBsAg increased significantly ( P < 0.05) in 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, from 0.016% to 0.020% and 0.036% to 0.045% respectively. Discussion The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the number and type of blood donations in the Islamic Republic of Iran. While it caused a significant reduction in the number of blood collections from regular donors, the share of first- time, lapsed and female donors increased. Blood shortage during the 10 months studied was reported as 8.38%. Although IBTO filled the initial shortfall, the fear of infection at collection sites and the government's lockdown measures had an impact on the number of donors. The rate of reduction was lower than the average shortfall rate worldwide and in the World Health Organization Region for the Eastern Mediterranean considering estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic reduced blood supply by 20-30% across all 6 World Health Organization regions ( 13). Similarly, during the influenza pandemic in 2009, 10-30% fewer blood donations were recorded worldwide ( 14). A recent study in Europe found that almost half of the donors reported fewer donations than during the normal situation, which shows a concerning drop in the number of blood collections during the COVID-19 pandemic ( 15). However, research conducted in the USA showed an improvement for blood centres during the COVID-19 pandemic; a recent study reported a significant increase in blood donations during the pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period ( 16). Launching targeted blood donation campaigns for traditional blood donors (first, repeat and lapsed) and offering to test all allogeneic donations for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 2 of the main reasons for this increase. Although offering to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not adversely affect blood safety, it seems the offer acted as an incentive for blood donors in the USA. Considering the results of a study that showed a low rate of COVID-19 deferrals among Iranian donors, it seems that lower blood collection during the pandemic was related to other factors ( 11). The findings of another study from the Eastern Mediterranean Region showed that representatives of most countries believed that fear of infection was the factor contributing the most to a decrease in blood collections ( 6). Australian researchers believe that during the pandemic blood donors needed to be reassured that all safety measures were in place to protect them from infection in public places such as collection sites and blood centres ( 17). These findings have also been confirmed in Hong Kong ( 18). As in other disaster situations, the number of female and first-time blood donors increased significantly in the Table 2 Comparison of number of blood products distributed in the Islamic Republic of Iran before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2019/2020 Blood product Mar-Dec 2019 (No.)Mar-Dec 2020 (No.)% change +/- Red cell concentrate 1 617 224 1 506 984 -6.8 Platelets 828 200 733 815 -10.0 Frozen fresh plasma 546 278 504 910 -7.5 Total 2 990 702 2 755 708 -7.8 Table 3 Prevalence of transfusion transmissible infection markers in donated blood in the Islamic Republic of Iran before (2019) and during (2020) the COVID 19 pandemic Item Year, method Odds ratio95% CI P-value 2019, ELISA 2020, ECL & CL Donations (No.) 1 725 882 1 581 180 Infection marker No. (%) No. (%) HIV 48 (0.0028) 60 (0.0038) 1.36 chemiluminescence. confidence interval.

During the 2 days following the burning down of the Plasco Building in Tehran, the proportion of first-time and female blood donors increased by 62.7% and 12.0% respectively ( 19). Conversely, the proportion of regular blood donors decreased by 25%. This pattern was also evident after the Bam earthquake in the Islamic Republic of Iran, during which the number of first-time and female blood donors was significantly higher than normal ( 20). A study from the USA reported an increase in first-time, lapsed and female blood donors during the COVID-19 pandemic ( 17). Another reason for a higher rate of female blood donations during 2020 is related to the centralization of IBTO activities to encourage more females to donate blood by launching targeted campaigns such as involving the Women's Basij Organization. The prevalence of all TTIs among blood donors increased during the pandemic in the Islamic Republic of Iran. However, the changes were only statistically significant for HBsAg and HCV . Our findings confirm the results of other studies in which the prevalence of TTI markers increased after the disasters, mainly due to an increase in first-time donors ( 20,21 ). It is known that first-time blood donors have a 2.5-3.5-fold greater residual risk for TTI markers than repeat donors, and any increase in the number of first-time blood donors may raise the prevalence of these markers ( 22). However, the temporary influx of reactive and first-time blood donors during the pandemic seems not to have had a great or enduring impact on blood safety in the country since the slight increases in the prevalence of HIV and human T-lymphotropic virus were not statistically significant. Conclusion In conclusion, to maintain a stable blood supply, IBTO needs to regain the confidence of its regular donors by encouraging them to keep donating blood during the COVID-19 pandemic and reassuring them of the safety and adherence to hygiene protocols at collection sites. IBTO should increase its mobile collection sites to facilitate donations by donors who may be reluctant to travel long distances to collection sites during the pandemic. At the same time, an increase in the number of first-time and female blood donors is an opportunity for IBTO to retain those with low residual risk for TTIs in the blood supply chain. Further assessment is recommended to evaluate the motives of those blood donors who donated and those who avoided donating during the COVID-19 pandemic.

(Correspondence to: Amer Goreal: amer.goreal@uod.ac). Introduction Hepatitis A virus (HAV), transmitted by the faecal-oral route, is one of the main causes of acute viral hepatitis globally (1). Epidemiologically, the distribution of HAV infection varies geographically, correlating with the sanitary and hygienic conditions and other indicators of socioeconomic development (2,3). The clinical expression of the HAV infection is age-dependent and is least expressed in children (1). Children play an important part in the transmission of HAV. The seroprevalence of anti-HAV antibody by age group can be used as a marker for the epidemiological patterns of the HAV and viral transmission through the community (3,4) . A decline in the seroprevalence of HAV antibodies in a population, especially in the children, indicates a reduced incidence of HAV infection (1,3). Seroepidemiological results have shown that transition to lower infection rates has occurred in several of the hyperendemic countries (1,5). In this case, the clinical manifestations of HAV will possibly be more serious in those countries. The WHO recommends two methods for determining HAV seroprevalence. Both methods are based on the detection of the anti-HAV IgG antibodies for the determination of HAV endemicity in countries whose populations are mostly unvaccinated against HAV . The first method depends on determination of the prevalence of HAV in the whole population; the second method uses an age-specific approach (6). For the first method, HAV endemicity is categorized as: high where the prevalence is greater than 50% in the population; intermediate where the prevalence is 15-50%; and low where the prevalence is less than 15% in the population (6,7). The second method categorizes the endemicity into: high (90% by 10 years of age); intermediate (50% by 15 years of age, with < 90% by 10 years of age); low (50% by 30 years of age, with < 50% by 15 years of age); and very low (< 50% by 30 years of age). The age-specific method is considered more accurate and provides a more precise seroprevalence estimation (8). HAV infection can be prevented through immunization and HAV vaccination can be used for prophylaxis pre- and post-exposure to the virus. Feasibility and cost are the two main barriers to implementation of a HAV vaccine programme. Preventive strategies are dependent on the epidemiological characteristics of HAV infection in any country as with other vaccine-preventable illnesses (9,10) . In Iraq, age-specific and periodic seroprevalence data countrywide are lacking, and the precise epidemiological features of HAV infection are not known. According to WHO, Iraq is hyperendemic for hepatitis A (96.4%) and the number of people infected with hepatitis A has increased. Many factors, such as inadequate hygiene, contaminated Abstract Background: Hepatitis A virus infection is widespread in Iraq, therefore, assessing its seroprevalence is important for infection control at the community level. Aims: To determine hepatitis A virus seroprevalence in a representative sample in Duhok Governorate, northern Iraq; evaluate changes in the epidemiological pattern; and assess factors associated with its seropositivity. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2020 to November 2021. Random cluster sampling was used to select participants aged 5-74 years. Hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) was determined among the participants and demographic data were collected on sex, residency (urban or rural), age, history of jaundice, number of family members ( five or > five), and sources of drinking water. Results: A total of 1052 participants (625 males and 427 females) were enrolled. The overall seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus IgG was 68.3%: 21-30; 95.3% in ages 31-40; and 89.2% in ages > 40 years. Factors significantly associated with hepatitis A virus IgG positivity were rural residence, male sex and family size greater than five (all P < 0.01). Conclusion: Hepatitis A virus seroprevalence in Iraq has been declining since the past decade, indicating intermediate- to-low endemicity of hepatitis A virus. However, people are still many susceptible, indicating the need for hepatitis A virus vaccination in the country.

We assessed the age-specific seroprevalence of HAV in individuals aged 5-74 years in Duhok Governorate, northern Iraq and determined the epidemiological characteristics of HAV infection and the most appropriate preventive strategies. Methods This was a cross-sectional seroepidemiological study in Duhok Governorate, conducted from July 2020 to November 2021. The target population was healthy individuals aged 5-74 years in Duhok. We used random cluster sampling to select participants from different areas of Duhok Province including blood banks, hospitals and premarital consultation department of the Directorate of Preventive Health Affairs. Based on an HAV prevalence of 0.2%, with a precision of 0.025 and 95% confidence intervals, the sample size was calculated to be 1052 individuals. Participants with self-reported co-morbidities were excluded from the study. The epidemiological data were collected using a questionnaire 5 for anti-HAV antibodies at the central public health laboratory in Duhok (immunoglobulin G [IgG]) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), following the recommendations of the manufacturer (HAV-IgG, DIA, ProDiagnostic, Milan, Italy). Results were reported as either negative or positive for HAV IgG. Statistical analysis SPSS version 28 was used for the statistical analyses. We used the chi-square test to compare HAV seropositivity by sociodemographic characteristics with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the risk factors associated HAV seropositivity. Ethical considerations Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Directorate-General of Health, Duhok Research Ethics Committee (no. 20072020-3). Written consent was obtained from all participants while children's consents were taken from the parents. Results A total of 1052 participants (625 males and 427 females) aged 5-74 years were enrolled in this study. The mean (standard deviation) age of the participants was 21.65 (11.89) years. The characteristics of the participants (age, sex, residence and family size) by HAV positivity are shown in Table 1. All the participants had the same source of drinking-water. In the urban and rural areas, most households had an enclosed system of defecation, but with no centralized system of wastewater and sewage disposal. The overall seroprevalence of the anti-HAV antibodies was 68.3%. Urban residents were significantly less likely to be seropositive for HAV than rural residents (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.51-0.89). HAV seroprevalence was 63.7% in females and 71.5% in males; males were significantly more likely to be seropositive for HAV (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.10-1.86). Seroprevalence was 72.4% where family size was more than five members compared with 60.6% where family size was fewer than five members; participants in larger families were significantly more likely to be seropositive for HAV (OR = 1.70, CI: 1.30-2.23). All participants were drinking tap water and none had a history of jaundice. Table 2 shows that seroprevalence of HAV positivity increased with the age: from 24.3% in the age group 5-10 years to a high of 95.3% in the age group 31-40 years ( P < 0.001).

EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022throughout a decade. HAV seroprevalence was 68.3% compared with 96.4% reported in 2011 (12). Our results show an intermediate-to-low endemicity of HAV in Iraq; which is different from the earlier report of a high endemicity of HAV, with a seroprevalence of 96.4% (12). This difference could be because 15 years ago Iraq was facing internal problems and poor socioeconomic status which could have resulted in a higher prevalence of HAV infection. However, with improved access to safe drinking-water and improved socioeconomic conditions in the following years, HAV seroprevalence decreased and a greater number of susceptible people have been protected from HAV infection. Our findings are similar to those of a Jordanian study that found HAV endemicity decreased to an intermediate level over time (13). A systematic review of Eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries reported an HAV seroprevalence of 62.6% and 61.6%, respectively (14). Cyprus had reported the lowest HAV prevalence rate (2.6%) and Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates reported a prevalence of less than 50.0%. The highest HAV seroprevalence rates were in Afghanistan (99.0%), Somalia (96.0%) and Palestine (93.7%) (14). Our IgG seropositivity assessment by age groups showed that IgG seropositivity was highest in the age group 31-40 years, followed by the age group of > 40 years. The most susceptible age group was children aged 5-10 years with only a 24.3% HAV positivity rate. This finding is in agreement with findings from a study in Turkey which reported a prevalence of anti-HAV IgG in children of 29.5% (15). In addition, a Jordanian study reported differing seroprevalence rates by age: 26% in children < 2 years, 32% in children 2-4 years, 44% in children 5-9 years, 63% in children 10-14 years, 78% in adolescents 15-19 years and 94% in those > 20 years (16). This low seropositivity in children younger than 16 years in our study suggests a reduction in faeco-oral transmission of HAV in Iraqi children, reflecting the possible impact of the enhancements in sanitary conditions, stability of the security situation and access to clean drinking-water in Duhok in the past decade. According to WHO, acute HAV infections are more common in children in the developing countries and in older age groups in developed ones (17). However, our results and those of other studies indicate that HAV infection in developing countries occurs in many different age groups, in childhood as well as in older ages (18). In general, the rate of HAV seropositivity does not differ by sex (19-21) , but higher HAV seropositivity in males has been reported (22). We found that the likelihood of HAV seropositivity was significantly higher in males ( P < 0.05). In contrast, a study in Turkey in the general population reported an HAV positivity rate of 73.0% in females and 69.3% in males (23). A study in Lisbon, Portugal reported that the prevalence of HAV IgG was 44.4% in females and 53.6% in males, but the difference was not significant (24). The higher rate of HAV positivity in males in our study may be mainly associated with them being more in contact with the external environment and consuming more unhygienic foods and beverages. Family contact is considered as a risk factor for the spread of HAV infection. We found HAV positivity was significantly higher where there were more than five family members, which concurs with a Turkish study (25). Vaccination is suggested for areas with a medium endemicity, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (26). Although scientific evidence suggests that two doses of the inactive hepatitis A vaccine may provide life-long protection (27), this vaccine has not been included in Iraq's schedule of immunization because of a lack of data on the epidemiological pattern of HAV infection in different cities. In conclusion, the decline in HAV endemicity in Duhok may result in increased vulnerability to symptomatic illness and outbreaks. Therefore, including the HAV vaccination in the national immunization programme and assessment of its benefits to public health are recommended. At the same time, efforts to improve socioeconomic conditions and access to safe drinking- water should continue, particularly in rural areas.

Vaccination of young children against COVID-19 would contribute to pandemic control and \"herd immunity\". Aims: This study aimed to assess the extent to which Moroccan parents were likely to vaccinate their under-12 children against COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the form of an anonymous and confidential electronic survey among parents visiting pediatric clinics in Meknes Prefecture in August and September 2021. Results: Our study shows that the majority of parents were vaccinated (67.2%), but refused to vaccinate their under-12 children (83.6%). But 72% of all parents were willing to vaccinate their children if COVID-19 mortality increased among children. Conclusion: Most parents who refused to have their children vaccinated were illiterate or had only primary education. There is therefore a need to increase awareness and information campaigns on the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine among adults and children. 19- 12 () - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022R\u00e9f\u00e9rences 1.

Introduction Hepatitis D virus is a hepatotropic virus with a circular ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome. This virus has at least eight genotypes, of which genotype 1 is the most frequent and is distributed worldwide (1). It uses the surface protein of hepatitis B virus as its coating, and hence, its replication and transmission are closely linked to those of the latter (2). In 2015, it was estimated that 257 million people were living with hepatitis B virus infection, defined as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive (3). At least 5% of those people are co-infected with hepatitis D virus, meaning 15-20 million people are infected with hepatitis D virus worldwide (4). A meta-analysis in 2019 showed that hepatitis D virus seroprevalence was 10.58% suggesting more people are infected with this virus (5). Most people with hepatitis D virus are in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Greenland, Middle East, Pacific Islands and South America (4). People with chronic hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus infection have a twofold higher risk of developing cirrhosis, a threefold higher risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma and a twofold increased mortality rate than individuals only infected with hepatitis B virus (monoinfection) (6,7). Current guidelines generally recommend treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha for at least 48 weeks for chronic hepatitis D virus infection, irrespective of response patterns while on treatment. This is because the overall rate of sustained virological response is low. However, newer drugs with novel mechanisms of action against hepatitis D virus are more promising. The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted fast-track designation to lonafarnib, a hepatitis D virus prenylation inhibitor, in combination with ritonavir for treatment of hepatitis D virus infection after a phase IIa study showed a decrease in hepatitis D virus RNA during 4 weeks of treatment (8). Another study explored the optimal regimen of lonafarnib and showed that the addition of ritonavir allowed for a lower dose and higher concentration of lonafarnib with better tolerance (9). The European Commission approved the entry inhibitor bulevirtide (also called myrcludex B) as the first drug for chronic hepatitis D virus treatment. An open-label, phase IIb clinical trial assessed the safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in combination with tenofovir in patients with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus co-infection (10). The study showed a dose-dependent decrease in hepatitis D virus RNA in parallel with a decrease in alanine aminotransferase (11). In Qatar, screening of 78 428 blood donors between January 1994 and December 2001 found that 0.98% were Abstract Background: Worldwide, 5-10% of people with chronic hepatitis B virus infection are co-infected with hepatitis D virus. In Qatar, there are no data on hepatitis D virus infection among patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Aims: To determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis D virus infection among patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Qatar and assess the characteristics of these patients. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of all HBsAg-positive individuals tested for hepatitis D virus between 1 January 2010 and 29 December 2019 within the Hamad Medical Corporation. Data were retrieved from electronic records and included demographic and clinical information of the patients. Results: Of the 2348 HBsAg-positive patients, 125 were positive for hepatitis D virus (seroprevalence 5.3%). The median age of hepatitis D positive patients was significantly higher than for hepatitis D negative patients (P = 0.001). Most of the patients with hepatitis D had a hepatitis B viral load < 2000 IU/mL (53.6%) and were negative for hepatitis B e antigen (93.6%). A significantly greater proportion of hepatitis D positive patients than hepatitis D negative patients were infected with hepatitis C virus (P < 0.001), and had liver cirrhosis (P < 0.001) and hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.006). Conclusions: Hepatitis D virus infection is associated with lower hepatitis B virus viraemia and more advanced liver disease in the study population.

EMHJ is an open access journal. This paper is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 3.0 IGO communication EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022HBsAg positive and 10.85% were hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive. Of 915 patients with chronic liver disease in Qatar, 2.5% were attributed to hepatitis B virus (12). However, data are lacking about the hepatitis D virus infection status among HBsAg-positive patients in the country. This study estimated the seroprevalence of hepatitis D virus antibody among HBsAg carriers in Qatar and assessed the clinical, laboratory and virological characteristics of those positive for hepatitis D virus antibody. Methods Study setting, design and population Hamad Medical Corporation comprises 12 hospitals and provides secondary and tertiary medical care for all the population of Qatar (2.8 million people). This was a retrospective, cohort study conducted in all Hamad Medical Corporation hospitals. The study population included all HBsAg-positive patients (older than 14 years) who were tested for hepatitis D virus antibodies (immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM)) at the time of the study. Study outcome and data collected The primary outcome was the seroprevalence of hepatitis D virus infection among HBsAg-positive individuals in Qatar. Data were collected on the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of those positive and negative for hepatitis D antibody. Study procedures The electronic laboratory system of Hamad Medical Corporation was used to identify HBsAg-positive patients who had also been tested for hepatitis D virus antibody between 1 January 2010 and 29 December 2019. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from all available electronic medical records of identified patients and transcribed into a standardized data collection sheet. Data extracted included: demographic information, hepatitis D virus antibody result, hepatitis D virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result, hepatitis B virus serology result, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, abdominal ultrasound and ultrasound elastography results, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index score, and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma status. Statistical analysis Demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals who were hepatitis D virus-positive and hepatitis D virus-negative were compared. Continuous data were presented as medians (interquartile ranges [IQR]) and compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. As appropriate, categorical data were summarized as numbers (percentages) and compared using the Fisher exact test or Pearson chi-squared test. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata , release 15 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA). A P-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ethical considerations This retrospective chart review study involving human participants was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The Institutional Review Board at Hamad Medical Corporation approved the study with a waiver of informed consent (MRC-01-19-519). Results Between 1 January 2010 and 29 December 2019, we found 2348 patients who were HBsAg positive and screened for hepatitis D virus antibodies; 125 of them tested positive for hepatitis D virus antibodies, giving a seroprevalence of 5.3%. Missing data were reported in the entire data set. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the patients by hepatitis D virus infection. The median age of patients positive for hepatitis D virus was 38 years (IQR 32-49), significantly higher than the patients negative for hepatitis D virus, 35 years (IQR 29-45), P = 0.001. There were more males in both groups: 73.6% hepatitis D virus positive and 74.0% hepatitis D virus negative. The patients were categorized by WHO region. The majority of hepatitis D virus positive and hepatitis D virus negative individuals were from the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. Within this region significantly more patients were hepatitis D virus positive (80.8%) than the hepatitis D virus negative (61.8%), P < 0.001. Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of the patients, by hepatitis D virus status. Most of the patients were negative for the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Of those who were negative for hepatitis D virus, a greater proportion were positive for HBeAg (10.6%) than those who were hepatitis D virus positive (6.4%) but the difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.170). No significant differences were seen between hepatitis D virus positive and hepatitis D virus negative groups for other hepatitis B virus markers (HBcAb, HBcIgM and HBeAb). Among hepatitis D virus negative patients, 1775 individuals had PCR results for hepatitis B virus; 46.6% had a result < 2000 IU/mL. A similar percentage was observed for hepatitis D virus positive individuals; 53.6% had hepatitis B virus PCR result < 2000 IU/mL. More patients in the hepatitis D virus positive group had negative hepatitis B virus PCR results (12.0%) than hepatitis D virus negative patients (7.8%) but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.210). From the hepatitis D virus positive individuals, 12/112 (9.6%) were positive for hepatitis C antibody, compared with 49/1798 (2.2%) in the hepatitis D virus negative group ( P < 0.001). Less than half of the patients had been tested for HIV , with only three being positive; all of them were in hepatitis D virus negative group. Book Vol 28-11.indb 841Book Vol 28-11.indb communication 28 No. 11 - 2022The median alanine aminotransferase level was 26 U/L (IQR 17-45) for hepatitis D virus negative patients and 34 U/L (IQR 21-63) for hepatitis D virus positive individuals (P = 0.004). There were no significant differences between hepatitis D virus positive and hepatitis D virus negative patients for platelets and international normalization ratio. The median AST to platelet ratio index for hepatitis D virus positive individuals was 0.34 (IQR 0.20-0.90) and 0.30 (IQR 0.2-0.46) for hepatitis D virus negative individuals (Table 2). A significantly higher percentage of individuals positive for hepatitis D virus had cirrhosis (33.6%) than those negative for hepatitis D virus (14.5%), P < 0.001 (Table 3). Similarly, a higher proportion of hepatitis D virus-positive individuals had hepatocellular carcinoma (4.8%) than hepatitis D virus-negative individuals (1.0%), P = 0.006. Splenomegaly and ascites were significantly more prevalent in hepatitis D virus-positive patients (19.2% and 8.8%, respectively) than hepatitis D virus- negative patients (5.4% and 2.5%, respectively); P < 0.001 for splenomegaly and P = 0.002 for ascites (Table 3). Ultrasound elastography was performed for 665 individuals, 623 were hepatitis D virus-negative, and 42 were positive. Normal to mild stiffness was found in 11.3% of hepatitis D virus-negative patients and 8.8% of positive patients. In comparison, mild to moderate stiffness was found in 16.1% hepatitis D virus-negative individuals and 22.4% of the hepatitis D virus-positive group. Of the patients who were negative for hepatitis D virus, 0.6% had moderate to severe stiffness compared to 2.4% in the hepatitis D virus-positive group, P = 0.038 (Table 3). Discussion This study is the first to examine the seroprevalence, demographics and clinical characteristics of hepatitis D virus infection in Qatar. The overall seroprevalence of hepatitis D virus in Qatar of 5.3% was similar to A WHO report (4). A systemic review in 2018 showed the overall prevalence of hepatitis D virus in North Africa to be 5.0%, similar to our figure (13). Another study showed a mean prevalence of hepatitis D virus of 14.7% in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (14). This discrepancy in the prevalence between Qatar and data for the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region can be explained by the fact that most of the residents in Qatar (more than 80%) are from other countries, mainly Asian countries (15), which are reported to have a lower prevalence of hepatitis D virus infection (16). Some previous reports have shown that hepatitis D virus co-infection results in a lower level of hepatitis B virus viraemia (17,18) . This was consistent with the findings in our study where almost half of the individuals in both groups had low hepatitis B virus PCR results (< 2000 IU/ mL) and lower rates of HBeAg. This can affect decisions on management in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection since hepatitis B virus viral load and HBeAg are part of the clinical evaluation. We could not find any previous reports on specific association between hepatitis B virus markers and hepatitis D virus infection apart from the previous mentioned association with HBeAg. Since hepatitis D virus PCR was not available in our institution, only 8 patients underwent testing for hepatitis D virus viral load as an outside test. This can be an area for improvement for patients with hepatitis D virus infection management. In previous experimental studies, it has been suggested that other viruses such as hepatitis C virus can enhance hepatitis D virus transmission (19), which can explain the higher percentage of hepatitis C virus-positive patients among individuals infected with hepatitis D virus than hepatitis D virus-negative patients (9.6% versus 2.2%) in our study. Another study supports this finding where a higher frequency of anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies was found in hepatitis D virus-positive than hepatitis D virus-negative individuals who were HBsAg positive (20). However, these findings are an area for further research to confirm the relationship between hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus and chronic liver disease.Table 1 Demographic characteristics of patients with hepatitis B, by hepatitis D virus infection, Qatar Variable Hepatitis D virus status P-value Negative ( n = 2223) Positive ( n = 125) Age in years, median (IQR) 35 (29-45) 38 (32-49) 0.001 Sex, no. 33 (26.4) Male 1646 (74.0) 92 (73.6) WHO region, no.

This was not the case in our study, most likely due to a large amount of missing data with our patients. The discrepancy between AST to platelet ratio index scores and percentage of patients with cirrhosis can be explained by the modest sensitivity of the AST to platelet ratio index to detect hepatitis B virus-related fibrosis as found in 2014 meta-analysis (21). Significantly more patients with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus co-infection developed cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as demonstrated in previous reports (7). Better management of patients with hepatitis D virus and hepatitis B virus co-infection is needed to address this issue. A limitation of our study is its retrospective nature. The large number of missing data for some factors may affect the significance of the results. The missing data did not allow us to do a logistic regression analysis to draw any conclusion about the association of hepatitis D virus infection with specific risk factors or markers. Despite these limitations, we believe that our results add to the existing knowledge on hepatitis D virus infection in the region.Table 2 Clinical characteristics of patients with hepatitis B, by hepatitis D virus infection, Qatar Variable Hepatitis D virus status P-value Negative ( n =2223) Positive ( n = 125) HBcAb, no.

Further research is needed on hepatitis D virus infection in Qatar and the region, especially the relation between hepatitis D virus and hepatitis C virus co-infection and their effect on outcomes. With the availability of lonafarnib and bulevirtide as potential effective antivirals for hepatitis D virus treatment, the treatment and outcome for such patients could be improved. This is to be confirmed with more studies. We recommend routine testing of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection for hepatitis D virus and, for those who are positive, testing of hepatitis D virus viral load, and evaluation with abdominal ultrasound and elastography.

Introduction Assistive technology is an aspect of health technology that helps maintain, improve and promote the well- being of individuals and empower them to live healthy, productive, independent and dignified lives (1). The lack of assistive products can exacerbate exclusion, isolation and poverty, and the impact of disease and disability. There is an increasing need for assistive technology and rehabilitation services in the EMR and globally, driven by an increase in the occurrence of noncommunicable diseases, injuries and aging (2). Assistive technology is very crucial for the achievement of the health-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (3). In October 2016, the 63rd Session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean endorsed resolution EM/RC63/R.31 on improving access to assistive technology (2), which was reinforced in 2018 by World Health Assembly resolution WHA71.82 (4). In January 2019, WHO and UNICEF began preparing a global report on effective access to assistive technology (GReAT), based on available scientific evidence (5). The report aimed to highlight the status of access to assistive technology, draw attention to its need and benefits, recommend actions to improve access, and facilitate implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (6). In October 2021, WHO/EMRO held a virtual regional consultation to review the GReAT, as part of global consultations to inform WHO and UNICEF Member States about key findings of the report, validate its contents based on regional perspectives, and discuss key recommendations and way forward. Summary of discussions As part of the GReAT, WHO/EMRO conducted country- specific rapid assessment of assisted technology in the EMR and published a regional report in 2018 (7), which was endorsed by the Regional Committee in 2020. The first section of the GReAT describes assistive technology and its human rights, those who need it, its benefits to individuals and communities, the international policy frameworks, the impact of an emergency on assistive technology, and access. The second section presents data on assistive technology, mainly progress indicators and reports of the rapid assistive technology assessment (rATA) conducted. The third section provides recommendation on how to tackle the barriers to assistive technology, including those relating to availability, accessibility, affordability, adaptability, and quality. The fourth section highlights factors that can help build an enabling environment for universal access to assistive technology. The fifth section presents recommendations to improve access to assistive technology based on six action areas: people, products, provision, personnel, policy (5Ps), and humanitarian crises. Participants discussed the different sections and how they apply to the situation in EMR countries. In the EMR, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Jordan, and Pakistan participated in and completed their rATA, and they made presentations on this during the meeting. Representatives of countries and other participants discussed and answered some key questions: Does your country collect data on access to assistive technology? Do the figures presented reflect the status of assistive technology access in your country? Does your country experience similar or other barriers in addition to what has been presented? Do you think the solutions and good practices presented are relevant to your country? Have any other solutions been practiced in your country to address the barriers? Are some of the aspects of the enabling environment presented being addressed by your country? Does your country have any initiatives on enabling the environment other than what has been presented? Barriers experienced by countries but not included in the report were: the fear of stigmatizing people using assistive technology, lack of assistive technology governance and fragmentation of efforts, absence of local manufacturing despite initiatives in some countries to improve assistive technology, inability to adapt imported assistive technology devices to local context, and non-recognition of assistive technologies related to communication and cognitive difficulties. Policies and regulations to create enabling environments for assistive technology vary among the countries. Some countries lack these, while others have national integrated programmes and initiatives to empower and enable persons with disabilities. Some of the countries that have national integrated programmes and initiatives also have legal frameworks to promote universal design for buildings, transport, etc. Book Vol 28-11.indb 847Book Vol 28-11.indb 847 08/12/2022 2:39 events addressing public health priorities EMHJ - Vol. 28 No. 11 - 2022Key recommendations To WHO and UNICEF Differentiate between digital assistive technology and supportive assistive technology, to increase cov - erage. Share international standards to guide local manufac - turing of assistive technology. Increase the awareness of people in need (and their families) on their rights to, and benefits of, assistive technology and where to get it, and unify the educa - tional materials to ensure equal access. Strengthen digital communication and feedback methods for assistive technology. Identify and develop an essential list of assistive tech - nology for primary care, such as the essential drug list, instead of having only a priority list. Encourage local manufacturing by sharing and trans - ferring technology, and ensure that locally manufac - tured products are of high-quality. To Member States Reduce customs duties and taxes on the importa - tion of assistive technology devices and shorten the regulatory process for the registration of assistive technology devices. Adopt the GReAT recommendations as soon as they are finalized and develop and implement national strategies on assistive technologies. Develop and implement updated national assistive technology surveillance systems at different levels of healthcare. References 1. World Health Organization.
