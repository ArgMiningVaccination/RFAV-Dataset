You could seal your house up tight and shut every door, window, nook and cranny - but that's no way to live right? The next best alternative? Spray your fly infested house with a bunch of nasty chemicals you can't even pronounce? , Spend your days swatting them with a wet tea towel or this mornings newspaper? We don't think so. We've got better things to do with our time (like go to the beach...) than spend our days chasing the little buggers around the house with a spray can, wet tea towel or newspaper, and we think you've got better things to do too... Give these natural, cheap and easy alternatives a go, and bid goodbye to those pesky little buggers before they even dare set a wing in your window. Basil - Flies hate the smell of basil. Place a few basil plants in your kitchen and watch them disappear. Plus, the basil doubles as a great on hand garnish, win win right? Cloves - Flies detest the smell of cloves. Place a bowl of dried cloves in each room where you are experiencing problems with flies, and watch them vanish! Despite its effectiveness, this is not a good solution if you dislike the smell of cloves yourself, as then you're bound to be vanishing from the room too, right? Mint, lavender and marigold - plant these in your garden and have pots in your house to deter them from entering your property before they even make it to the front door! Cinnamon - use cinnamon as an air freshner, as flies hate the smell! Lavender, eucalyptus, peppermint and lemongrass essential oils - Not only will spraying these oils around the house create a beautiful aroma, but they will also deter those pesky flies too. Apple cider vinegar - Flies love the smell of apples and vinegar. Create a homemade trap by mixing some apple cider vinegar with a natural liquid soap in a bowl. The flies will be attracted to the aroma, but will become trapped by the surface tension created by the soap in the liquid solution. Last but not least, always keep the kitchen bench clear and wiped clean. Flies are naturally attracted to rubbish and cut fruits, so make sure that all bins are concealed, and that cut fruits are well covered or stored in the fridge. Then throw out that fly spray, wash those tea towels, recycle that newspaper and head to the beach! Looking for award winning vegan, organic and raw health focused snacks?
