This ensures that we represent the best in the country. ANTA has been recognising natural therapy practitioners for 65 years, who aim to treat their patients holistically by widening their scope, and caring for the entire person rather than the specific illness or complaint. A natural therapist aims to discover the underlying cause of symptoms, and then treat them by stimulating the body's natural self-healing and regulating abilities. Natural therapists practice a range of traditional, complementary, and alternative medical techniques, which are used to treat physical illnesses. There's growing acceptance of natural therapy as a supplement to conventional medicine, reflected by the number of practices adopting a holistic approach to medical care. Modern medicine doesn't always have the answer, which in some cases, can be successfully filled by a natural therapy treatment such as acupuncture, shiatsu, remedial massage, or herbal medicine. ANTA members have free access to up-to-date scientific resources to strengthen and support their professional development. Stay in the loop with the latest news, including our upcoming events, webinars, and legislation/advocacy efforts. We are committed to quality assurance and public safety, which we achieve by recruiting the most highly-trained, ethical therapists.

However, despite the widespread availability of nutrient-rich food, nutritional deficiencies are still a common problem in Australia.

Channel 7's Sunrise aired a news segment last week that was focused on the use of Berberine, and this supplement's apparent rise in popularity within the wider public. The segment was predominantly focused on it's possible use as a \"weight loss drug\" and made strong comparisons with that of the pharmaceutical medication Ozempic, using strategic headlines such as \"Berberine vs Ozempic\", \"Berberine's Big Promises\" and \"Nature's Ozempic\" throughout. Recent news headlines have highlighted the launch of telehealth consultations via the HealthyLife wellness platform, with free 15-minute Naturopathy consultations as part of the service offerings. In light of this development by retail giant Woolworths, ANTA has felt it necessary to provide a response to the relevant parties in order to protect and uphold the integrity of our association members and the wider natural therapies "}
