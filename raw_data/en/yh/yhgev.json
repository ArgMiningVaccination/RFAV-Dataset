Since ancient times healers, medicine persons and shamans have understood that true healing is more than \"fixing\" a physical ailment. They knew that when dis-ease occurred the essence of a person was misaligned and that to be effective in a return to health one must reach into the core of the person to bring about a change toward balance. In these modern times this \"core essence\" of a person is understood in terms of energy. We know of meridians or \"pathways of light\" within our body through which energy flows, the auric field which is the energy body that surrounds our physical body and chakras which are energy vortexs that exchange energy with the external world. We now know that energy anatomy is just as real as our physical anatomy and is, in fact, the template for our physical body. Given this understanding, when the energy body becomes compromised it is best to heal at this level before the compromise reaches the physical level. True healing occurs by going beyond symptomatic treatment addressing the source of dis-ease. Energy exists everywhere, can neither be created nor destroyed and manifests as heat, light and movement but does not have sentience. In Plant Spirit Healing we work with the \"vital principle held to give life\" otherwise known as spirit. The conscious spirit of the plant directs the energy allowing healing to take place efficiently and effectively. Healing is a journey that engages our whole being of heart, soul and spirit and is not a linear process but instead follows a spiral pattern. As we spiral through life we periodically reach new understandings allowing healing to reach deeper levels each time filling ourselves more fully with our true essential nature. As we become more our self our unique path is revealed and that which doesn't serve us on our path falls away. This form of healing is not a quick fix but is instead a maintenance program. Since we are constantly surrounded by that which can disrupt our energy anatomy we must be vigilant always striving for balance physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. As we raise our consciousness we view healing not as medicine but as a way of life.
