The family alleged that the [MMR vaccine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine) Valentino received as part of his childhood immunizations caused his autism, and the court compensated them on that theory. The lower court's decision was never on very firm grounds: [it depended in part on testimony of an expert decision who relied](http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2013/08/09/court-rulings-dont-confirm-autism-vaccine-link/), in turn, on [Andrew Wakefield's debunked study](http://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/andrew-wakefield-you-sir-disgusting-vile-excuse-human/). [But it was used by anti-vaccine activists as part of their claims](http://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/vaccine-denialists-desperate-find-link-autism/). On February 13, 2015, a [Court of Appeals in Bologna overturned the decision](http://www.repubblica.it/salute/medicina/2015/03/01/news/autismo_i_giudici_assolvono_il_vaccino-108441541/)-a decision that apparently lead to a decline in MMR immunization rates in [Romagna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romagna), an historical district of Italy. The Court of Appeal accepted the appeal filed by the Ministry of Health (ministero della Sanit\u00e0). The expert appointed by the court of appeal highlighted that there is no scientific evidence supporting a link between vaccines and autism. The expert highlighted that the lower court expert was wrong to rely on the study by Andrew Wakefield, a study debunked and rejected by the scientific community. The expert also highlighted that while there is some temporal link between Valentino's MMR vaccine and autism, in the sense that the diagnosis of autism followed the vaccine, the temporal connection was not strong and does not itself support a causal connection. The expert, Dr. Lodi, stated that \"In the medical history of the child there is not an objective temporal correlation between the gradual emergence of autistic disorders and the MMR vaccine, there is only the fact that the two events occur one before the other, but as shown, this is not sufficient to relate the two events \". The Bocca's lawyer, Luca Ventaloro, claimed that he will appeal to the Supreme Court of Cassation (Corte Suprema di Cassazione), "}
