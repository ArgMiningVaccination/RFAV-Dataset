The Indian holistic medical system, which was developed more than 3,000 years ago, was based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Many natural healing systems that are now familiar in the West have their roots from Ayurveda. According to Ayurveda, creation expresses itself through the five elements: space, air, water, fire and earth. The five elements manifest in our bodies as governing energies called doshas. Vatta, Pitta and Kapha collectively known as doshas are one of the most foundational concepts in the tradition of Ayurveda. The three doshas define our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual states and control how your body works. Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. But one is usually stronger than the others. Each one controls a different body function. In Ayurveda, it is believed that an imbalance of your doshas is connected to health issues. Shanti will aid in balancing the three doshas and result in boosting immunity, improving skin and overall well-being. Ayurvedic medicine encourages whole-body healing, which includes physical, mental, and emotional health. This can include practices like yoga, meditation, healthy eating, regular sleep routine, and managing your work-life balance.
