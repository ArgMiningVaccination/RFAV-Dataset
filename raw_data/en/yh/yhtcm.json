Figueroa Street, Suite 212, Los Angeles CA 90012 213-240-7941 www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/index.htm ACDC 20 17 Summary Page 1 of 2 The Acute C ommunicable Disease Control Program (ACDC) serves a fundamental role in disease control and prevention in Los Angeles County (LAC) leading surveillance, investigation, and outbreak response for over 60 reportable communicable diseases . In 2017, ACDC managed and confirmed over 4,000 reports of communicable diseases , many of which required further investigation and response. ACDC's findings are often instrumental in the development of guidance and policy recommendations and inform prevention efforts for communicable diseases locally and nationally. ACDC staff also serve as local experts in these diseases, providing vital advice and instruction for medical and community partners. Additionally, ACDC is the designated public health program responder for emerging infectious diseases such as Zika virus , Ebola , pandemic influenza, antimicrobial resista nt , anthrax , and botulism ). ACDC regularly partners with local hospitals, healthcare and skilled nursing facilities to assist with infection control and outbreak response. ACDC physicians are available and on- call everyday (24/7) to ensure the health and safety of our communities. The following are some highlights from ACDC's activities and accomplishments occurring during 201 7. Health Information Systems To enhance local surveillance for reportable diseases, ACDC manages an electronic laboratory -based (ELR) reporting system , receiving reports from participating laboratories not only for ACDC but also other LAC Department of Public Health (DPH) programs including TB , . In 2017, ACDC alone received over 150,000 laboratory reports through this syste m. ACDC's case surveillance system, visual confidential morbidity reporting (vCMR) , serves as the enterprise surveillance and case management system for LAC DPH and has become a national model employed by other health agencies . Hepatitis A Outbreak In 2017, LAC DPH responded to an outbreak of hepatitis A virus primarily among persons experiencing homelessness or with illicit drug use. This outbreak occurred in the context of several other large outbreaks in California and nationally . The largest California outbreak occurred in San Diego Co unty result ing in 582 confirmed cases when the outbreak was eventually closed . Given LAC's proximity to San Diego County , ACDC closely monitored the spread of this disease and LAC DPH conducted comprehensive vaccination, hygiene and sanitation, and educational outreach campaign . Ultimately, only 17 outbreak - associated cases were identified in LAC . It is unclear why the outbreak remained contained locally , especially despite hav ing a larger population of persons experiencing homelessness and a lower number of vaccines distributed compared with San Diego. However, LAC DPH's early and extensive outreach likely contributed to disease containment . Table 1.

Foodborne outbreak investigations usually are initiated by a Foodborne Illness Report (FBIR) ; 2,348 FBIRs were received in 2017, a 14.2% increase from 2016. ACDC frequently partners with state and federal agencies to investigate foodborne disease situations. In 2017 staff assisted with 1 listeria, 63 Salmonella and 5 shiga toxin -producing E. coli cluster investigations. These required expanded efforts including specialized interviews, product tracebacks, and additional laboratory testing. West Nile Virus West Nile Virus (WNV) continues to inflict a substantial public health burden in our county (Table 2) . Over the previous six years, LAC has experienced yearly outbreaks of WNV infections , averag ing 213 cases, and comprising about 10% of the national burden. In 2017 a record number of W NV fatalities (27) were documented , the most since the virus emerged in LAC in 2004. Table 2. West Nile Virus Infections, Hospitalizations, and Deaths* LAC, 2004 -2017 Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Infections 309 43 16 43 170 25 4 63 174 165 218 300 153 268 Hospitalizations 179 30 5 31 125 15 3 49 133 122 180 262 131 224 Deaths 13 0 0 5 6 1 0 4 6 9 7 24 6 27 * Excludes reports from Long Beach and Pasadena. Despite the significant health risks, mosquito -borne disease knowledge, perceived risk, and preventative behaviors are low among residents in LAC . In response in September 2017, LAC D PH enacted an unprecedented weeklong county- wide boots - on-the-ground outreach campaign (titled: It's Not Just a Bite! ) to distribute educational materials , increase a wareness and knowledge, and promote preventive action s. This campaign was the largest door -to-door campaign ever implemented by LAC DPH to fight a communicable disease and will serve as a valuable model for enacting other large -scale health campaigns. Healthcare Outreach Unit ACDC's Healthcare Outreach Unit (HOU) continues to be a national leader in combating antimicrobial resistance and preventing and responding to healthcare -associated infections. Because antimicrobial resistance is a n increasing global concern , projects to address this issue are an ACDC priority. 2017 was the first year that the HOU assembled a regional antibiogram . This was accomplished by issuing a local Health Officer Order in January requiring all local acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities report carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections as well as to report a facility -speci fic annual antibiogram to LAC DPH. The regional antibiogram has become a vital tool for assessing and preventing antibiotic resistance infections and detecting trends in LAC . Because inappropriate antibiotic use is the primary contributor to antibiotic r esistance, a core outreach goal is improving testing and prescribing practices . During 2017, HOU staff partnered with the state to improve laboratory testing methods for CRE. One year after the campaign, nearly half (47%) of participating laboratories successfully updated their testing methods. In 2017 the HOU also initiated the Targeting Appropriate Prescribing in Outpatient settings (TAP OUT) project to assist outpatient clinics to implement an antimicrobial stewardship. Outpatient clinics are of particular concern si nce a large portion of antibiotics prescribed in these settings are unnecessary and therefore contribute to antibiotic resistance. The HOU recruited several clinics, representing over 200 providers, to participate. Using prescri ptions for upper respiratory infections as a measure, participants showed a significant 51% decrease in inappropriate prescriptions as a result of this project. Additional activities are detailed in ACDC's 2017 Annual Morbidity and Special Studies Report.

Information about our program is available on the ACDC website and past Annual Morbidity Reports and Special Studies are archived online . This report does not include information on tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections , or HIV and AIDS. Information regarding these diseases is available from their respective department programs : Tuberculosis Control Program and the Division of HIV and STD Programs . Select vaccine preventable disease are also included in this report as we work closely with the Vaccine Preventable Disease Control Program within LAC DPH. LAC DEMOGRAPHIC DATA The Los Angeles County population estimates used in this report were generated by LAC Urban Research and Hedderson Demographic Services, a contractual agent to the LAC Internal Services Department (ISD). Using city estimates from the California Department of Finance (DOF) Demographic Research Unit, Population estimates for July 1, 2017 were estimated by applying 7 years of birth, mortality, and migration rates to the July 1, 2010 census data. The input datasets included U.S. Census Bureau decennial census enumerations and annual population estimates, CA DOF city and county estimates, and administrative records from LAC on registered voters, housing units, births and deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Final 2017 Summary of Nationally Notifiable Infectious Diseases published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) provided the national counts of reportable diseases and formed the basis for calculated national rates included in this report. While part of LAC, the c ities of Long Beach and Pasadena are separate reporting health jurisdic tions, as recognized by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). As such, these two cities maintain their own disease reporting systems. LAC DPH morbidity data excludes disease episodes occurring among residents of Long Beach and Pasadena and sub tracts their populations from LAC population data. We note exceptions to this rule in the text when they occur. ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Acute Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Overview - Page 2 - DATA SOURCES In LAC, there are more than 80 diseases and conditions that are required to be reported as mandated by the Title 17, California Code of Regulations ( CCR) Section 2500. Of these, more than 40 also are nationally notifiable and reported to the CDC ( Table A ). In addition , LAC DPH has the authority to assign local reporting requirements to address the unique needs and surveillance projects of our jurisdiction. In 2017 , five diseases/conditions were -resistant ae coli, and Enterobacter sp. , in acute care hospitals or skilled nursing facilities ; Influenza deaths of all ages; confirmed cases only (CDCP and CDC only require reporting of pediatric deaths) ; Acute flaccid myelitis ; Invasive group A streptococcal infection, including streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis ; and Atypical or crusted cases of scabies. Because local and national reporting standards change regularly, it is prudent to periodically confirm the requirements. Additional reporting information is described on ACDC's disease reporting web page . Data on the occurrence of communicable diseases in LAC is obtained through passive and sometimes active surveillance. The CCR Section 2500 requires those knowing of a case or suspected case of a communicable disease report it to the local health department. Laboratories have separate requirements for reporting certain communicable diseases as detailed by CCR Section 2505 . The time required to report varies by disease and condition and ranges from reporting immediately by telephone to reporting within 7 calendar days by electronic transmission , or by telephone or mail. Th e CCR also require s immediate reporting by telephone for any outbreak or unusual incidence of infectious disease that may not be listed in Section 2500. DATA DESCRIPTION AND LIMITATIONS Data in this report utilizes the following data descriptions; however, the report should be interpreted with caution given the limitations. 1. Underreporting. The proportion of cases that are not reported is not well quantified and the amount of underreporting varies by disease. When noted, case definitions or surveillance system changes can also play a factor in underreporting. 2. Reliability of rates . All vital statistics rates, including morbidity rates, are subject to random variation. This variation is inversely related to the number of events (observations, cases) used to calculate the rate. The less frequent the event, the less stable its occurrenc e from observation to observation. Thus, diseases with only a few cases reported per year may have highly unstable rates. The observation and enumeration of these \"rare events\" is beset with uncertainty. The observation of zero events is particularly unreliable when based on passive surveillance systems. To account for these instabilities, all rates in the ACDC Annual Morbidity Report based on five or fewer events have been suppressed. Rates based on fewer than 20 events are considered unstable and should b e interpreted with caution ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Acute Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Overview - Page 3 - as it is almost impossible to distinguish random fluctuation from true changes in the underlying risk of disease. T hus, comparisons over time or between communities that are based on unstable rates can lead to spurious conclusion s about differences in risk which may or may not be valid. 3. Case definitions . To standardize surveillance, ACDC uses CDC's Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition for infectious diseases under public surveillance, with some exceptions as noted in the text of the individual diseases. Because some diseases include a laboratory test result as part of the case definition, cases reported without a laboratory result may only be probable and not confirmed cases. Consequently, determining a direct link between a communicable disease and a death or an outbreak is not always feasible. 4. Onset date ver sus report date. The discrepancy between onset date and report date might result in slight differences in the number of cases and rates of disease for the year in subsequent annual reports. However, any such disparities are likely to be small. 5. Population estimates . Estimates of the LAC population are subject to limitations. Furthermore, the population of LAC is in constant flux. Though not accounted for in census data, visitors and other non - residents are likely to have an impact on disease occurrences. 6. Place of acquisition of infections . Some cases of diseases reported in LAC may have been acquired outside of the county. Accordingly, some disease rates may not accurately reflect the location where an infection was acquired since data in this report are based on the home address of the case. 7. Health Districts and Service Planning Areas . To better serve the population, LAC is divided into eight Service Planning Areas (SPAs) for the purposes of healthcare planning and provision of health services. Some SPAs are further divided into health districts (HDs) as shown b y Map 1 at the end of this section. RACE/ETHNICITY CATEGORIES The Census Bureau defines race as a person's self -identification with one or more social groups. An individual can report as White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, or some other race. Survey respondents may report multiple races. Ethnicity determines whether a person is of Hispanic origin or not. For this reason, ethnicity is broken out in two categories, Hispanic o r Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino. Hispanics may report as any race. The 2017 ACDC Annual Morbidity Report modified previous race/ethnicity categories to standardized with the Census Bureau as follows : Hispanic/Latino - persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. Asian - persons person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Acute Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Overview - Page 4 - American Indian or Alaskan Native - person s having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central Americ a) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. Previously included i n the \"Other\" category. Black - persons having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander - having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. Previously this category was included in the category of Asian. White - A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. Other - perso ns that do not list themselves according to any of the above categories or those that note multiple race/ethnicity categories. Unknown - persons where race/ethnicity is unknown . Because population data is not available for unknown, other, or multiple race categories, rate calculations for these groups are not possible. Table A.

Disease Summaries Disease Summaries: Amebiasis - Page 27 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health AMEBIASIS SUMMARY DATA Number of Cases 57 Annual Incidence* LA County 0.59 California N/A United States N/A Age at Diagnosis Mean 39 Median 38 Range 1-77 years * Cases per 100,000 population. Data not available. Not nationally reportable. DESCRIPTION Amebiasis1 is a disease caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica . Cysts from this parasite shed in human feces and may contaminate food or drinking water. It also can be transmit ted person -to-person through fecal -oral spread. The incubation period for amebiasis is 1 -4 weeks. While this disease can affect anyone, it is more common among people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions. Infected people do not always b ecome sick. Cases of amebiasis are reportable at the state level. Surveillance is conducted through electronic laboratory reporting \u2014this captures EIA, microscopic, or serologically confirmed amebiasis cases from selected participating hospital and commerc ial laboratories. Proper hand hygiene before meals and after using the restroom is a primary method to prevent infection and transmission of amebiasis. Persons who care for diapered and/or incontinent children or adults should ensure that they properly wa sh their hands. Individuals with diarrheal illness should avoid swimming in recreational waters to prevent transmission of amebiasis and other diseases. Fecal exposure during sexual activity, anal intercourse, and oral-anal sexual practices should also be avoided to 1 www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/Amebiasis.htm 2 www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Amebiasis.aspx 3 www.cdc.gov/parasites/amebiasis/index.html prevent transmission of amebiasis. There is no vaccine available to prevent contracting amebiasis. For more information visit: LAC DPH1 CDPH2 CDC3 2017 TRENDS AND HIGHLIGHTS In 2013, the LAC DPH's protocol changed to count only symptomatic persons with suspected gastrointestinal and/or extra -intestinal amebiasis with laboratory evidence of E. histolytica . In 2017, LAC DPH continued to count only laboratory confirmed symptomatic infections as confirmed cases of E. histolytica . This year, the amebiasis disease incidence rate slightly decreased in LAC from 0.73 cases per 100,000 in 2016 to 0.59 cases per 100 ,000 (Figure 1). Consistent with previous years, males comprised the majority (80%) of reported cases. The incidence rate of males was five times greater than that of females with 1.0 and 0.2 cases per 100,000, respectively. The greatest incidence of a mebiasis was in the 35-44-year -old age group (0.9 cases per 100,000) followed by those 15 -34 years old (0.7 cases per 100,000) ( Table 1 . Data for Table 1 is available online .4). 4www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/2017Tables/Amebiasis .xlsx Disease Summaries: Amebiasis - Page 28 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Comparing race/ethnicity, the greatest incidence of amebiasis occurred among Whites (0.9 cases per 100,000) ( Table 1 ). The highest amebiasis incidence rates were documented within SPA 4 (1.6 cases per 100,000) and SPA 5 had the second highest incidence of cases (1.2 cases per 100,000). The high levels in these two SPAs have been consistent over the past five years and may be attributable to a higher number of men who have sex with men in both of those areas ( Figure 2 ). The number of cases peaked in January, which was inconsistent with the previous five -year average ( Figure 3 ).

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 + \"0\" refers to any age between birth and 1 year old , not including 1 year old DESCRIPTION Campylobacteriosis1 is a bacterial disease caused by several species of gram -negative bacilli including Campylobacter jejuni, C. upsaliensis, C. coli, and C. fetus . It is t ransmitted through ingestion of organisms in undercooked poultry or other meat, contaminated food, water, or raw milk or through contact with infected animals. The incubation period is 2 -5 days. Common symptoms include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abd ominal cramps, myalgia, and nausea. Sequelae include Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Reiter syndrome, both of which are rare. To reduce the likelihood of contracting campylobacteriosis, food derived from animal sources, particularly poultry, should be thoroug hly cooked . Cross contamination may be avoided by ensuring utensils, counter tops, cutting boards, and sponges are cleaned or do not touch raw poultry or meat or their juices. Hands should be thoroughly washed before, during, and after food preparation. It is important to wash hands and avoid cross contamination of infant foods, bottles, and eating utensils.

Environmental conditions that can increase the occurrence of coccidioidomycosis include: arid to semi - arid regions, dust storms, hot summers, warm winters, and sandy alkaline soil. This fungus is endemic in southwestern US (including Southern California) and parts of M exico and South America. Most infected people exhibit no symptoms or have mild respiratory illness, but a few individuals develop severe illness such as pneumonia, meningitis, or dissemination of the fungus to other parts of the body. Among the wide range of clinical presentations, only the most severe cases are usually diagnosed and reported to public health. Some races/ethnicities and others are at higher risk for severe disease (Blacks, Filipinos, pregnant women, those 5 years old and younger, the elder ly, and immunocompromised). Currently, there is no safe and effective vaccine or drug to prevent coccidioidomycosis. Prevention lies mainly in dust avoidance and control (e.g., planting grass in dusty areas, putting oil on roadways, wetting down soil, ai r conditioning homes, wearing masks or respirators). In addition, those at high risk for severe disease should avoid travel to endemic areas when conditions are most dangerous for exposure. 1 www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/ Cocci .htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Coccidioidomycosis.aspx Recovery from the disease confers lifelong immunity to reinfectio n, highlighting the importance of developing a vaccine for prevention of symptomatic or serious forms of the disease. Increasing exposure and risk associated with construction, a growing na\u00efve population in endemic areas, and antifungal treatments that have side effects and are not uniformly effective validate the need for prevention efforts.

This may be attributable to an increase in reporting due to more efficient electronic reporting systems and better awareness among providers and the community through education efforts including the annual conferences ACDC conducted in the Antelope Valley (SPA 1). Outreach materials are available on the ACDC coccidioidomycosis website .1 Most reported cases were among t hose >65 years old with an incidence rate of 20.3 cases per 100,000 followed by those 55 -64 years old (18.3 incidence cases per 100,000) ( Table 1 .

The incidence rate for NH/OPI at 41.9 per 100,000 (n=8) and for AI/AN at 29.7 per 100,000 (n=5) are also high; however, this rate is considered unreliable based on less than 19 cases. ( Table 1 ). SPA 1 has consistently reported the highest incidence rate of 54.5 per 100,000, which slightly increased from last year's rate of 53.8 per 100,000 ( Figure 2 ). In the past, seasonal trends have varied with recent peaks during the summer season. In 2017, higher numbers of cases occurred in the fall. (Figure 3 ).

Both the parasite and disease are commonly known as \"Crypto.\" There are many species of Cryptosporidium that infect animals, some of which also infect humans. The parasite is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods of time and makes it very tolerant to chlorine disinfection. Those wh o have a weakened immune system may experience prolonged illness. Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, and transplant patients), young children, and pregnant women are at risk for more severe illness. While this parasite can be spread in several different ways, water (drinking and recreational water) is the most common way to spread the parasite. Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of waterborne disease among humans in the US . For HIGHLIGHTS The incidence rate of cryptosporidiosis cases in LAC in 2017 was 1.53 cases per 100,000 people. This is an increase over previous years (Figure 1 ), which might be due to adoption of electronic laboratory reporting and new testing methods enacted among local pathology labs. The incidence rate among men (1.8 cases per 100,000) was higher than that among women (1.3 cases per 100,000) . The greatest incidence of cryptosporidiosis was in persons 15 -34 years old (2.4 cases per 100,000) followed by those 35- 44 years old (2.0 cases per 100,000) ( Table 1. Data for Table 1 is available online .4). Information on race and risk factors are incomplete since routine interviews of cryptosporidiosis cases were discontinued as of October 2015. However, surveillance mo nitor s for clusters and review of cryptosporidiosis with positive laboratory reports. SPA 5 had the highest incidence rate with 3.1 cases per 100,000. The second highest incidence rate was seen in SPA 4, with 2.9 cases per 100,000 ( Figure 2 ). There was no clear peak of cryptosporidiosis incidence in 2017. However, most cases occurred during the hot summer months of July, August, September, and October, which is consistent with risk factors such as exposure to recreational water, hiking, and travel ( Figure 3 ). 3www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/index.html 4publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/2017Tables/Crypto.xlsx Disease Summaries: Cryptosporidi Page 40 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Disease Summaries: Cryptosporidi osis - Page 41 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Disease Summaries: Cryptosporidi osis - Page 42 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Disease Summaries: Encephalitis - Page 43 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health ENCEPHALITIS SUMMARY DATA Number of Cases 129 Annual Incidence* LA County 1.3 California N/A United States N/A Age at Diagnosis Mean 64 Median 68 Range 0-96 years+ * Cases per 100,000 population.

This disease can be caused by infection from a number of different agents such as viral, parasitic, fungal, rickettsial, bacterial, and chemical. This disease can result in sympto ms such as headache, stiff neck, fever, and altered mental status . Arboviral, or mosquito -borne, encephalitis can be prevented by personal protection and mosquito control. Arboviruses are viruses that are maintained in nature through transmission between susceptible vertebrate hosts via blood feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and certain mites and gnats. Arbovir uses have a global distribution. There are five main types of encephalitis in the US: West Nile equine encephalitis encephalitis (SLE), and La Crosse (LAC) encephalitis . All of these diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes. Healthcare providers and diagnostic laboratories in LAC are required to r eport all suspected encephalitis cases including primary and post -infectious encephalitis to LAC DPH. This surveillance excludes individuals with underlying Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 1www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/Encephalitis.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/SLE.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/sle/ infection. Reporters are required to identify the cause as eithe r viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic. Encephalitis cases are categorized as unspecified if no pathogen is identified in the cerebrospinal fluid or blood and there is no evidence of a bacterial, viral , or fungal etiology. For the purpose of surveillanc e, LAC DPH requires a case to have clinically compatible illness. LAC DPH conducts passive surveillance of encephalitis cases. For more information visit: LAC DPH1 CDPH2 CDC3 2017 TRENDS AND HIGHLIGHTS This year, the encephalitis disease incidence rate decreased in LAC from 0.72 cases per 100,000 in 2016 to 1.34 cases per 100,000 ( Figure 1 ). The greatest incidence of encephalitis was among the 65+ age group ( 6.3 cases per 100,000) followed by those 55- 64-years old (2.1 cases per 100,000) (Table 1 . Data for Table 1 is available online .4). Comparing race/ethnicity, the greatest incidence of encephalitis occurred among Whites (2.4 cases per 100,000) (Table 1 ).

This bacillus is a specific serotype of STEC and the most common serotype in the US. Symptoms of Shiga toxins are abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea, often developing into bloody diarrhea. Hemolytic uremi c syndrome (HUS) is a clinical diagnosis and may or may not be associated with STEC. Children younger than five years old are at highest risk for HUS . E. coli are bacteria that live in the intestines of people and animals. Most E. coli are harmless and d o not cause illness. STEC make toxins that can cause severe illness. STEC is commonly heard about in the news in association with foodborne outbreaks. The most commonly recognized STEC strain is E. coli O157:H7. Other STEC strains are commonly referred to as non - O157 STEC and may also cause foodborne illnesses. Illnesses have been linked to consumption of food or drinks contaminated by animal feces including undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized apple juice/cider, raw milk, produce, and flour, and recreati onal exposure to contaminated water.

The parasite is found on surfaces or in soil, food, or water that has been contaminated with feces from infected humans or animals. Giardia is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods of time and makes it tolerant to chlorine disinfection. While the parasite can be spread in different ways, water (d rinking water and recreational water) is the most common mode of transmission. In the US, giardiasis is one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases in people. Outbreaks have been associated with contaminated municipal and recreational waters, day care centers, and among people who were exposed to feces during sex. For more information visit: 2017, only laboratory -confirmed symptomatic Giardia infections continued to be counted as confirmed cases of giardiasis in LAC. Giardiasis disease incidence slightly decreased in LAC from 4.7 cases per 100,000 in 2016 to 3.9 cases per 100,000 ( Figure 1 ). Males have consistently accounted for a larger proportion of cases. The incidence rate of giardiasis for males was 5.9 per 100,000 and for females was 1.8 cases per 100,000. The highest age -specific incidence rate occurred among adults 55- 64 years old with 5.3 cases per 100,000. The 15- 34 age category had the next highest incidence rate, at 5.1 cases per 100,000 (Table 1. Data for Table 1 is available online .4). Whites continue to have the highest race/ethnicity -specific incidence rates ( Table 1 ). The greatest proportion of cases were reported among Whites (n=203, 54.6%) and Hispanics (n=104, 28.0 %) (Table 1 ).

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Hepatitis A1 is a disease caused by the hepatitis A virus, which is a highly contagious virus that infects the liver. The hepatitis A virus is spread person -to- person via a fecal -oral rou te. People who are infected with hepatitis A can spread the infection for two weeks before they have symptoms. Some people may not have any symptoms of infection. After getting sick, patients can generally spread the virus for about a week. In rare cases, especially among the immunocompromised, infections can last longer. After patients fully recover, they can never get the infection again. Symptoms include f ever , weakness, fatigue , nausea , loss of appetite , jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) , stomach pain , and v omiting. Not everyone infected with hepatitis A will develop symptoms; however, some common indicators of infection include dark urine, pale stools, and diarrhea. Those at high risk of infection are homeless populations and illicit drug u sers. The hepatitis A v accin e is the best method to prevent infection with the virus . Cleaning contaminated surfaces is also critical for prevention. Lastly, proper hand hygiene is very important for prevention of this disease. Because the spread of hepat itis A is spread through the fecal -oral route, it is important to clean and sanitize surfaces that have vomit or feces. 1www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/HepA.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/He patitis -A.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/ Hepatitis A is a reportable disease, and physicians are required to report hepatitis A cases to LAC DPH. LAC DPH recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for vulnerable populations as well as for those who have frequent close contact with these populations. Suspect cases of hepatitis A should be reported immediately by phone, while the patient is still at the clinical facility, in order to facilitate an on -site interview by a public health investigator and prophylaxis of contacts . For more information visit: LAC DPH1 CDC3 2017 TRENDS AND HIGHLIGHTS In 2017, LAC DPH responded to an outbreak of hepatitis A4 occurring primarily among persons experienci ng homelessness or with illicit drug use. This is describ ed further in the 2017 Special Studies Report . This year, the hepatitis A disease incidence rate increased in LAC from 0.69 cases per 100,000 in 2016 to 0.90 cases per 100,000 (Figure 1 ). The greatest incidence of hepatitis A was among those 35 -44-years -old (1.7 cases per 100,000) followed by those 55- 64-year s-old (1.2 cases per 100,000) (Table 1 .

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Hepatitis B is a DNA virus transmitted through activities that involve percutaneous or mucosal contact with infectious blood or bodily fluids. This is often through injection drug use, sexual contact with an infected person, or contact from an infected mother to her infant during birth. Transm ission also occurs among household contacts of a person with hepatitis B. Healthcare -associated transmission of hepatitis B is documented in the US and should be considered in persons without tradi tional risk factors. Symptoms occur in less than half of those acutely infected and begin an average of 90 days (range: 60 - 150 days) after exposure. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay- colored bowel movements, joint pain, and jaundice. Approximate ly 2- 10% of adults infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are unable to clear the virus within six months and become chronic carriers. Death from cirrhosis or liver cancer occurs in an estimated 15- 25% of those with chronic infection. Overall, hepatitis B is more prevalent and infectious than HIV. 1www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/He patitis -B.aspx A comprehensive strategy to eliminate hepatitis B virus transmission was recommended in 1991. It includes prenatal testing of pregnant women for HBsAg to identify newborns who require immunoprophylaxis and to identify household contacts who should be vaccinated, routine vaccination of infants, vaccination of adolescents, and vaccination of adults at high risk for infection. Adult vaccination is recommended for high risk groups including: men who have sex with men (MSM), those with history of multiple sex partners, injection drug users, persons seeking treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, household and sex contacts of persons with chronic HBV infections, healthcare workers, persons with chronic liver disease, persons with HIV, hemodialysis patients, and unvaccinated adults with diabetes mellitus 19 -59 years old. For the purpose of surveillance, LAC DPH uses the 2012 CDC Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition for acute hepatitis B. The criteria include: 1) Discrete onset of symptoms, 2) Jaundice or elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels >100 IU/L, and 3) HBsAg positive and anti -HBc IgM positive, (if done). In 2012, the CDC CSTE modified the acute hepatitis B case definition to include documented seroconversion cases (documented negative HBV test result within six months prior to HBV diagnosis) without the acute clinical presentation.

The 2017 incidence rate was highest among those aged 45 -54-years -old (0.8 cases per 100,000) . This is followed by those in the 35 -44- years -old and 55 -64-years -old age groups (0.6 case s per 100,000). This is s imilar to 2016, where the highest incidence was also in those aged 45- 54-years -old (Table 1 . Data for Table 1 is available online .3). Males composed 69% of the cases and females 31%. The incidence rate in 2017 was highest in Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders (NH/OPI) (5.2 cases per 10 0,000) followed by Blacks (0.6 cases per 100.000) (Table 1 ). Beginning in 2017, NH/OPI is a new category in the Annual Morbidity report , and the number of cases of NHI/OPI (n=1) is much lower than the number of White (n=13) and Black cases (n=10). Three SP As had incidence rates greater than the overall county rate of 0.33 cases per 100,000: SPA 4 (0.6 cases per 100,000) and SPA's 2 and 6 (0.4 cases per 100,000) ( Figure 2 ). In 2017, risk factors were identified in 81% (n=25) of the 31 interviewed confirmed cases including some cases with multiple risk factors. Of those with identified risk factors, the most frequently reported risk factors were (28% , n=7). The next frequently reported risk factors in 2017 were patients who had manicures and/or illicit drug use (24% MSM ) (24% , n=6). Lastly, the next frequently reported risk factor was having multiple sexual partners (20% , n=5) and being hospitalized (20% , n=5). The number of cases peaked in January, which was inconsistent with the previous five -year average ( Figure 3 ). 3publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/2017Tables/Hep%20B%20ac ute.xlsx Disease Summaries: Acute Nonperinatal Hepatitis B - Page 61 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Disease Summaries: Acute Nonperinatal Hepatitis B - Page 62 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Disease Summaries: Perinatal Hepatitis B - Page 63 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B, PERINATAL SUMMARY DATA Infants Born to HBsAg+ Mothers 637 Incidence of Exposurea 4.9 HBsAg+ Infantc 0 Maternal Age at Diagnosis 33 years a Number of infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers per 1000 live births in 2017 . b Based on number of infants born per 100,000 live births in 2017 . c Based on number of infants that had post vaccine serology testing . DESCRIPTION Perinatal Hepatitis B1 is a vaccine -preventable disease transmitted through exposure to blood and other bodily fluids of individuals infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). A woman can transmit the HBV to her infant from exposure to cervical secretions and blood during the birthing process. National guidelines recommend universal screening of pregnant women for HBsAg during each pregnancy. Testing for HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA) is also recommended to identify infants at greatest risk for infection and guide the use of maternal antiviral therapy during pregnancy. Post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepa titis B vaccine and hepatitis B immun oglobulin (HBI g) administered within 12 hours of birth followed by completion of a three -dose vaccine series has demonstrated 85% -95% effectiveness in preventing HBV infection in infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive . However, even infants who received appropriate prophylaxis can become infected when the mother has a high HBV viral load during pregnancy. Post -vaccination serologic (PVS) testing is recommended at age 9- 12 months after completing PEP and the vacci ne series to verify vaccine success or failure.

The incidence of exposure decreased by 4% from 5.1 to 4.9 per 1000 infants compared to 2017 (Figure 1 ). Over half (58%, n=363) of women screened for HBsAg were 15 -34 year s old (Table 1 . Data for Table 1 is availabl e online .4). Most (84%, n=521) of HBsAg+ women were born outside of the US . Most of HBsAg+ women were Asian (78%, n=488). This followed Approximately 58% , n=362, of the HBsAg+ women reside in SPA 3, which has a large Asian population ( Figure 4 ). Nearly all (98%, n=610) infants received the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine and within 12 hours of birth, and nearly all (97% , n=605) received HBI g within 12 hours of birth ( Figure 5 ). The three -dose hepatitis B vaccination series and post -vaccination serology (PVS) testing to determine immunity to hepatitis B was completed by 32% , n=205, of infants. Nearly all (96% , n=197) of the infants were anti -HBs positive, suggesting immunity to hepatitis B. Only 3%, n=7, failed to develop antibodies and received additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine to develop immunity.

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Hepatitis C1 is a liver disease caused by the blood - borne hepatitis C virus (HCV). Infection is mostly spread by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. Hepatitis C can be a s hort -term illness, but the majority of those infected have chronic infections which is serious disease tha t can result in long- term health problems, even death. The majority of infected people might not be aware of their infection because they are not clin ically ill. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. Acute hepatitis C refers to the first several months after someone is infected which can range in severity from a very mild illness with few or no symptoms to a serious condition requiring hospitalization. For reasons that are not known, a minority of those infected are able to clear the virus without treatment in the first six months. Symp toms for acute infection can manifest anytime from two weeks to six months after infection and can include jaundice, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, or vomiting. Th ough most have mild or no symptoms and usually go undetected. Cases of a cute hepatitis C are reportable to LAC DPH and at the state level. ACDC uses the CDC and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) criteria for acute hepatitis C to standardize surveillance of this infection. The criteria include a discrete onset o f symptoms. Although there is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C, there are ways to reduce the risk of becoming infected. These include: a void ing sharing or reusing needles, syringes or any other equipment to prepare and inject drugs, steroids, hormones, or other substances ; not us ing personal items that may have come into contact with an infected person's blood such as razors, nail clippers, toothbrushes, or glucose monitors , and/or not get ting tattoos or body piercings from an unlicensed facilit y or in an informal setting.

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Legionellosis1 is a bacterial infection with two distinct clinical forms: 1) Legionnaires' disease (LD), the more severe form characterized by pneumonia, and 2) Pontiac fever, an acute, self-limited, influenza -like illness without pneumonia. Legionella bacteria are common inhabitants of aquatic systems that thrive in warm environments. While at least 46 Legionella species and 70 serogroups have been identified, the majority (90%) of LD c are caused by . Transmission occurs through inhalation of aerosolized water containing the bacteria or by aspiration of contaminated water. Person -to-person transmission does not occur. The case -fatality rate for LD ranges from 10 -15% but can be higher in outbreaks occurring in a hospital setting. People of any age may get LD. However, the disease most often affects older persons, particularly those who are heavy smokers, who have chronic underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, or lung disease, or who have immune systems that are suppressed by illness or medication. The implementation of water safety measures to control the risk of transmission of Legionella to susceptible hosts in hospitals, hotels, and public places with water -related amenities remains the primary means of reducing LD. Approaches include periodic inspection of water sources and distribution systems, heat exchangers, and cooling towers. Prevention strategies inc lude appropriate 1www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/ Legion .htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Legionellosis%28Legionella %29.aspx disinfection, monitoring, maintenance of both cold and hot water systems, and setting hot water temperatures to >50oC to limit bacterial growth. All healthcare - associated LD case reports are investigated to identify potential outbreak situations. Early recognition and investigation is crucial for timely implementation of control measures. For more information visit: LAC DPH1 CDPH2 CDC3 2017 TRENDS AND HIGHLIGHTS In 2017, there were 165 cases reported (1.7 per 100,000), which was 32. 9% lower than that in 2016 ( Figure 1 ). One case of Pontiac fever and one case diagnosed with a laboratory confirmed L. micdadei obtained by lower respiratory culture were reported. The case fatality rate slightly increased from 9.5% in 2016 to 9.7% in 2017. The most affected age group in LAC wa s persons >65 years old (Table 1. Data for Table 1 is available online .4), which is consistent over a five- year period. SPA 5 had the highest incidence this year followed by SPA 6 and SPA 8 ( Figure 2 ). In 2017, January had the greatest number of monthly cases reported, which is part of a trend that started in November 2016 (Figure 3 ). 3www.cdc.gov/legionella/index.html 4www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/2017Tables/Legionellosis.xlsx Disease Summaries: Legionellosis - Page 72 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Healthcare -associated (HA) legionellosis in acute care facilities decreased from 5.3% to 4.2% of all confirmed cases in 2017. HA legionellosis in skilled nursing facilities decreased from 6.9% to 3.0%. Possible exposures from both acute care settings and skilled nursing facility accounted 1.2% of all confirmed cases. HA legionellosis had total of three fatalities. Assisted l iving cases increased from 1.2% to 2.4% with no fatalities reported. A total of three outbreaks in healthcare facilities were reported including one skilled nursing facility. In all three outbreaks, environmental samples collected showed multiple findings of Legionella species -non- pneumophila (LP1) in the water systems. While two of the outbreaks did not find LP1, it is evident that conditions for legionella amplification were present and may have contributed to the infections. LP1 was found in the cooling towers in one of the outbreaks. Travel -associated cases staying overnight in commercial lodgings and or resid ences other than home during the incubation period increased significantly from 8.1% to 12.7% this year. A total of four LAC residents traveled to the same resort hotel were linked to an outbreak investigation reported by CDC. Two unrelated confirmed cases of medical travel abroad were reported this year. ACDC participated in one multistate cluster investigation at a theme park located out -of-county. We re -interviewed all closed confirmed cases that fell on the cluster dates by utilizing su pplemental questionnaires and review case history forms to identify additional cases. Interviews were also conducted to self -reported suspect individuals. One LAC resident was linked in the outbreak investigation.

Foods contaminated with L. monocytogenes such as raw fruits and vegetables, cold cuts, deli meats, and unpasteurized dairy products can lead to infection. The disease affects primarily persons of advanced age, pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised people. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, and sometimes nausea or diarrhea. If infection spreads, sepsis or meningitis can occur, which may be fatal. Infected pregnant women may experience only a mild, flu- like illness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarri age or stillbirth, premature delivery, or infection of the newborn. Nonperinatal listeriosis may be prevented by thoroughly cooking raw food from animal sources and avoiding unpasteurized milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk. Individuals at risk for severe outcomes from infection should also avoid soft cheeses and leftover foods or ready -to-eat foods such as deli meats and hot dogs. Deli meats should be cooked until steaming hot. The CDC has been conducting surveillance for listeriosis f or more t han 30 years . Its various systems provide a comprehensive view of listeriosis in the United States.

Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Listeriosis, Perinatal1 is a disease caused by the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes . This disease is a disease transmitted transplacentally from infected pregnant women. Foods contaminated with L. monocytogenes such as raw fruits and vegetables, cold cuts, deli meats, and unpasteurized dairy products can lead to infection. T hese women may experience only mild flu -like symptoms or may be asymp tomatic. A perinatal listeriosis case is defined as a mother -infant pair in which one or both persons has a positive L . monocytogenes culture from a normally sterile site. Neonatal/infant listeriosis is often divided into early onset (0 -6 days after birth) and late onset (7 -42 days after birth). Infection during pregnancy may lead to premature birth, stillbirth, or septicemia and/or meningitis in the neonate \u2014even if the mother is asymptomatic. There is no vaccine to prevent listeriosis . Perinatal listeriosis may be prevented by thoroughly cooking raw food from animal sources and avoiding unpasteurized milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk.

Rates calculated based on less than 19 cases or events are considered unreliable . DESCRIPTION Measle s1 is a disease caused by a virus . Transmission occurs from person -to-person by coughs or sneezes. This disease is highly contagious \u2014the measles virus can stay in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left. Thus, a person can get infected by being in a room where an infec ted person once was present. This disease is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of the people around his/her will also become infected if they are not protected. Symptoms of measles include cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash of tiny re d spots that starts at the head and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles cases are reported by states to the CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Both probable and confirmed cases should be reported nationally. Pro mpt recognition, reporting, and investigation of measles is important because the spread of the disease can be limited with early case identification and public health response including vaccination and quarantine of susceptible contacts without presumptiv e evidence of immunity. Laboratory confirmation is essential for all measles outbreaks. State and local health departments have the lead in investigating measles cases and outbreaks when they occur. The best way to prevent getting measles is by vaccination. The MMR vaccine can be used to prevent 1publichealth.lacounty.gov/ip/VPD_measles.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/me asles.aspx measles, mumps, and rubella. The MMR vaccine is given later than some other childhood vaccines because antibodies transferred from the mother to the baby can provide some protection from disease and make the MMR vaccine less effective until about 1 year of age.

Not nationally reportable. DESCRIPTION Meningitis1, or aseptic meningitis syndrome, is a term used to define any meningitis (infectious or noninfectious). This disease is most commonly caused by viruses , which is particularly true fo r one with a cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytic pleocytosis. The cause of these types of meningitis is not apparent after initial evaluation, and routine stains and cultures do not support a bacterial or fungal etiology. Viral meningitis can occur at any age but is most common among the very young. Symptoms can include sudden onset of fever, severe headache, stiff neck, photophobia, drowsiness, confusion, nausea, and vomiting and usually last from seven to ten days. The most common cause of viral meningitis is nonpolio enteroviruses, which are not vaccine - preventable and account for 85 -95% of all cases in which a pathogen is identified. Transmission of enteroviruses may be by the fecal -oral, respiratory, or another route specific to the etiologic agent. Other viral agents that can cause viral virus (HIV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus type 3, influenza virus, me asles virus, and arboviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV). All cases of viral meningitis are reportable to LAC DPH within one day. LAC DPH conducts passive 1publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Mening.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/me ningococcal.aspx surveillance of viral meningitis cases with suspected or confirmed viral etiologies. Cases include d in LAC DPH surveillance require, at minimum, a clinically compatible illness and may or may not include laboratory evidence. Antiviral agents are available for HSV and VZV; however, in most cases, only supportive measures are available for the treatment of viral meningitis. Recovery is usually complete and associated with low mortality rates. Several types of viral meningitis cases are vaccine - preventable including those caused by VZV, mumps, influenza, and measles. Good personal hygiene, especially han d washing and avoiding contact with oral secretions of others, is the most practical and effective preventive measure for non -vaccine preventable causes.

Data for Table 1 is available online .4). In 2017 and in prior years, the highest incidence rates by race/ethnicity occurred among Whites (3.0 cases per 100,000) followed by Hispanics (2.2 cases per 100, 000) (Table 1). SPA 1 reported the highest incidence of viral meningitis in LAC at 3.8 cases per 100,0 00 followed by SPA 8 at 3.7 cases per 100,000 (Figure 2 ).

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Invasive Meningococcal Di sease (IMD)1 is a disease that occurs most often as meningitis, an infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or meningococcemia, an infection of the bloodstream. Transmission o ccurs via direct or droplet contact with nose or throat secretions of persons colonized in the upper respiratory tract with Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, petechial rash, and lethargy, which can progress to overwhelming sepsis, shock, and death within hours. Despite effective antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate remains between 10 -15%. Long -term sequelae include significant neurologic or orthopedic complications such as deafness or amputation. Meningococcal disease affects all age groups but occurs most often in infants. Surveillance of IMD involves LAC DPH defin ing reports as confirmed when N. meningitidis has been isolated from or evidenced by polymerase chain rea ction (PCR) analysis in a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or CSF). In the absence of a positive culture, reports are defined as probable if the N. meningitidis antigen is detected by immunohistochemistry or latex agglutination. Reports are classified as suspected cases when they present with clinical diagnosis of purpura fulminans or demonstrate gram -negative diplococci by gram staining [ 1]. A total of four vaccines are available in the US that can prevent meningococcal disease . Two protect against serogroups A, C, Y, and W -135, and two protect against serogroup B. Two quadrivalent conjugate vaccines, MenACWY -D and MenACWY -CRM, are licensed for use in persons 2 -55-years -old. The quadrivalent polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine (MPSV4), which had been l icensed for persons >56-years -old, was discontinued in 2017. Persons in this age group should receive one of the quadrivalent conjugate vaccines. MenACWY -D is also licensed for use in children 9- 23- months -old. Lastly, two serogroup B vaccines, MenB - FHbp and MenB -4C, were approved for use in persons aged 10- 25-years -old [2]. Vaccination with meningococcal conjugate vaccine is routinely recommended for all persons 11 through 12-years -old with a booster dose at 16 -years -old and for those at increased risk for meningococcal disease [3]. In 2016, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of meningococcal vaccine for HIV positive persons >2-year s-old [ 4]. Serogroup B meningococcal vaccination is recommended in addition to quadrivalent conjugate vaccine for people > 10-years - old who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Within LAC, DPH recommended vaccination for men who have sex with men (MSM) in 2014 d ue to an increase of IMD among MSM in LAC that occurred from 2012 -2014. In 2016, this recommendation was expanded to all gay/MSM, regardless of other risk factors including HIV status due to a southern California regional outbreak that began in March 2016. Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of sporadic cases of IMD remains the primary means for prevention of IMD among close contacts. Because the rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest during the first few days after onset of disease in the primary patient, antimicrobi al chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible \u2014ideally within 24 hours after the case is identified.

This has been the trend in LAC for the previous five years. In a typical distribution curve depicting incidenc e by age group for IMD, the peak incidence occurs among infants <1-year-old. This trend is maintained nationally. There have been no cases of IMD in children <1 -year-old in LAC since 2010 (Table 1 . Data for Table 1 is available online .4). Due to the number of cases for IMD being less than 19 in 2017 and unreliable for rate The monthly onset of disease mirrored the typical seasonal trend where a peak occurs during the winter season. The highest number of cases occurred in February (n=4) (Figure 3 ). Two fatalities were documented this year. Both were serogroup C cases. In March 2016, an increase in IMD was detected among MSM in LAC and southern California . LAC DPH collaborated with the CDC to investigate cases and enhance vaccination uptake . A supplemental history form was used to collect data on unique risk factors among MSM . No direct geographic and social epidemiologic links were found between outbreak cases. By the end of 2016, there were 27 outbreak -associated cases across southern California, 11 of which were LAC residents (41%). In 2017, outbreak activity slowed down with only 6 out break - associated cases across southern California, 3 of which were LA C residents (50%). 1publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Mening.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/me ningococcal.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/ 4publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/2017Tables/Meningococcal. xlsx Disease Summaries: 90 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health REFERENCES 1.

Malaria4, which is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes , is another mosquito -borne disease that affects LAC residents . These diseases are typically found in the tropical and subtropical ar eas of the world. The mosquito vectors for all four diseases have been found in LAC; however, these diseases are not currently found in mosquitoes in LAC. The best methods to prevent infection from mosquito - borne diseases is to eliminate mosquito breeding sources and avoid mosquito bites. People visiting or residing in regions where there is risk of mosquito -borne disease should take precautions by using mosquito Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -approved repellants and wearing protective cloth ing. Travelers to countries where malaria is endemic should take additional precautions by taking the appropriate antimalarial prophylaxis as prescribed and utilizing bed nets. Unlike malaria, there is no prophylactic medicine or vaccine available to preve nt dengue, Chikungunya, or Zika. Dengue Dengue, a to the West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus, is the most common vector - borne viral disease in the world. Infection with dengue virus has a range of clinical presentations from asymptoma tic infection to severe systemic febrile illness. Treatment is supportive. No cases of dengue acquired within the continental US were reported between 1946 and 1980. Since 1980, locally -acquired outbreaks have been documented in Texas, Florida, and Hawaii . Concern for the reemergence of dengue in Florida, Texas, and Hawaii as well as increases in dengue among returning US travelers over the past 20 years has prompted heightened vigilance among the medical and public health communities. Dengue was added to the list of Nationally Notifiable Infectious Conditions in 2009; however, it has been a SUMMARY DATA Disease Dengue Chikungunya Zika Malaria Number of Cases 19 9 17 38 Annual Incidence * LA County N/A N/A N/A Age at Diagnosis Mean 38 38 36 38 Median 34 35 32 37 Range 9-71 years 15-70 years 19-70 years 0-82 years * Not applicable as there is no local transmission. Disease Summaries: Mosquito -Borne Diseases of Travelers - Page 93 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health notifiable condition in California and LAC for several decades. Confirmation of dengue requires that a clinically compatible case be laboratory confirmed with testing of paired serological specimens, a single positive serological specimen confirmed by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), or by molecular testing. Probable cases require only a single serologically positive specimen. Suspect cases are epidemiologically linked without laboratory evidence. Chikungunya The symptoms of chikungunya are similar to those of dengue and Zika ; the most common symptoms are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or ras h. Treatment is supportive. Outbreaks have occurred in countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In late 2013, the chikungunya virus was found for the first time i n the Americas on islands in the Caribbean. On July 16, 2014, the first locally -acquired cases in the continental US was identified in Florida. For purposes of surveillance, con firmation of chikungunya requires that a clinically compatible case be laboratory -confirmed with testing of paired serological specimens, a single positive serological specimen confirmed by PRNT, or by molecular testing. Probable cases require only a singl e serologically positive specimen. Zika Zika virus, a flavivirus related to Dengue and WNV , was first discovered in 1947, and the first human cases were detected in 1952. Since then, outbreaks of Zika have been reported in tropical Africa, Southeast Asi a, and the Pacific Islands. In 2014, an outbreak of Zika virus occurred in Brazil and rapidly spread to neighboring countries. The first LAC resident became ill with this virus after returning from El Salvador in late 2015. In 2017, local transmission of Z ika virus was reported in Florida and Texas. The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, diffuse macular papular rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, pain behind the eyes, and vomiting. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon. Most persons infected with Zika are asymptomatic. Only 20% of infected persons experience symptoms. Increased reports of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare post -infectious central nervous system condition, has been linked to previous infection s with Zika. Death from Zika is rare. Unlike the other flaviviruses, Zika can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. In addition, infected persons can also spread Zika to their sexual partn ers. However, this method of transmission accounts for only 1% of cases. Confirmed cases are those with clinically compatible illness, epidemiological risk factors, and either a single positive serological specimen confirmed by PRNT and negative for othe r arboviruses, or by molecular testing of urine or plasma specimen. Probable cases have a single serologically positive specimen with or without PRNT testing and are additionally serologically positive for other flaviviruses. Malaria About 1,700 cases of human malaria are diagnosed in the US each year. Local transmission has not occurred in Southern California since 1988- 89. Human malaria is an acute or subacute febrile illness caused by one or more protozoan parasites: vivax, P. falciparum, P. malariae, and P. ovale . The disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected Anopheles sp. mosquito and is characterized by episodes of chills and fever every 2 -3 days. The more severe symptoms of P. falciparum include jaundice, shock, renal failure, and coma. P. falciparum Disease Summaries: Mosquito -Borne Diseases of Travelers - Page 94 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health poses the greatest risk of death because it invades red blood cells of all stages and is often drug- resistant. For the purpose of surveillance, confirmation of malaria requires the demonstration of parasites in thick or thin blood smears or the detection of Plasmodium sp. by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test regardless of whether the person experienced previous episodes of malaria while outside the country. Cases of malaria identified by the det ection of malaria antibodies using rapid diagnostic test (RDT) are classified as suspected cases. 2017 TRENDS AND HIGHLIGHTS Dengue The number of dengue cases in 2017 decreased by 59% from 2016 (19 vs. 46, respectively) and comprised of 4 confirmed and 15 probable cases (Figure 1 ). The proportion of confirmed cases remained similar at 21% in 2017 compared to 26% in 2016. Prior to 2015, only 1 -2 cases were confirmed per year. The increase in confirmed cases can be attributed to the increase in laboratory evaluation for arboviral diseases due to the emergence of chikungunya and Zika in the Americas in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Because dengue is clinically and epidemiologically similar to both chikungunya and Zika, it is recommended that di agnostic tests for all three arboviruses be conducted together. All local cases identified in 2017 reported recent travel to regions endemic for dengue ( Table 1 ). The most frequent travel destinations were countries in Asia and the Pacific Islands (63% , n=12 ). Chikungunya The number of chikungunya cases documented in 2017 remained similar to that in 2016 (9 vs. 8 cases, respectively). All cases in 2017 reported travel to Asia (Table 1 ) including three to Bangladesh and three to India. Notably, an outbreak of chikungunya oc curred in South Asia in 2017 and is likely the source of most cases identified in LAC [1]. In both 2015 and 2016, the majority of cases reported travel to Mexico or Central America. Zika A total of 17 cases occurred in 2017, a dramatic decline from 100 in 2016. This reflect s the decline in Zika transmission occurring globally. Cases were either detected with Zika RNA (41%) or Zika acute phase antibodies (59%). Cases were primarily Latino (76%) ( Figure 2) with an average age of 35.8 years (range: 19 -70 years) . Also, cases resid ed throughout the county. Due to heightened concern for women of child -bearing age to be diagnosed and reported to public health, Zika infection was overwhelmingly reported among those 15 -34-years -old, accounting for 53% of cases ( Figure 3). Zika cases were primarily female (82%) for this reason. A total of e ight of the cases were asymptomatic (47%) ; however, none were detected among blood donors. None of the symptomatic cases were hospitalized. A total of 12 infants were born to Zika case s. All had negativ e Zika virus test result s and appeared healthy in follow -up assessments up to 12 months of age. Most cases traveled to a Zika endemic region prior to their illness (94%) ( Table 1 ). The majority of cases traveled to Mexico (58%) and Central America (29%). O ne instance of sexual transmission of Zika virus was identified (6%) where the spouse reported travel to Mexico. This was the first case of sexual transmission of Zika detected in LAC. Disease Summaries: Mosquito -Borne Diseases of Travelers - Page 95 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Malaria The number of reported malaria cases had been declining in LAC since it peaked in 2003 with 60 cases, but since 2013, there has been an increase of cases ( Figure 4 ). All cases had a known history of recent travel to a country where malaria is endemic ( Table 1 ). The majority of cases reported recent tr avel to countries in Africa (71% , n=27 ). Nigeria the most common African destination (67% , n=18 ). Over half of the malaria , n=24 ) were due to P. falciparum. Among the 36 cases who were not recent immigrants, eight (22%) used a CDC recommend ed prophylaxis during their travels (Figure 5 ). Only one case reported completing their regimen. The CDC recommends the following for use as chemoprophylaxis: atovaquone/proguanil, chloroquine, doxycycline, mefloquine, or primaquine . The CDC recommends taking these as prescribed and to completion. Summary Mosquito -borne diseases not found in local mosquitoes are documented among LAC residents returning from travel every year and in every month of the year. A majority of t hree quarters of cases occurred in the latter half of the year (Figure 6 ). Mosquito -borne diseases of travelers can affect persons of all ages. The age of cases ranged from 0 to 82 -years -old. The mean ages ranged from 35.8 to 37.9 -years -old in 2017. Overall, most cases occurred among those in the 15- 34-year - age group ( Figure 4 ). Travel -asso ciated mosquito -borne diseases affected mainly individuals of non- White race/ethnicities. This trend is likely due to current disease transmission rates at travel destinations and the frequency of travel of these race/ethnicity groups to areas from which t hey or their families originate. Notably, in 2016, 75% of chikungunya cases were Hispanic/Latino , and all traveled to Mexico and Central America . Whereas , in 2017, 67% of chikungunya cases were Asian , and 75% traveled to South Asia. Local infestations of A. aegypti have been detected in LAC since 2014 and A. albopictus since 2011 and have spread to many cities throughout LAC. With the vectors of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika present in the county, there is heightened concern and vigilance for possible local transmission of these diseases. Consequently, LAC DPH has enhanced collaboration with vector control districts in the county. Cases of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya are shared with vector control agencies in order to enhance surveillance of Aedes sp. mosquitos and to encourage local clean -up efforts by residents. In 2017, LAC DPH intensified educational outreach to promote awareness and prevention of Zika and other mosquito- borne diseases. A pilot approach to collaborate with two of the highest risk cities for Zika to amplify LAC DPH messaging was implemented. Additio nally, a weeklong countywide campaign was conducted to distribute campaign materials to over 14,000 public venues. Evaluation of the outreach efforts found that there was increased awareness and knowledge of Zika among residents who were exposed to campaig n materials. Materials in the form of news articles, posters , and social media posts were most effective at conveying prevention messages. REFERENCES 1.

Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Mump s1 is a viral infection caused by a paramyxovirus and is spread person- to-person via coughing and sneezing. Mumps is manifests mainly in puffy cheeks and tender, swollen jaws. This is a re sult of swollen salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides, often referred to as parotitis. An infected person can likely spread mumps from a few days before their salivary glands begin to swell to up to five days after the swelling begins. Other symptoms that might begin a few days before parotitis include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Symptoms can appear anytime from 16 -18 days after infection or 12 -25 days after infection. Some people who get mumps have very mil d symptoms, or no symptoms at all and may not know they have the disease. Most people with mumps recover completely within two weeks. Complications from mumps can include meningitis, inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, inflammation of the pancreas, and deafness. Anyone who is not immune from either previous mumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps. Children should get their first dose of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine at 12 months old or later. The second dose of the MMR vaccine is usually administered before the child begins 1publichealth.lacounty.gov/ip/VPD_mumps.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Mu mps.aspx kindergarten. Students (including college students), health care workers, and international travelers should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine. Mumps is a reportable disease to LAC DPH. An inter nationally imported case is defined as a case in which mumps results from exposure to mumps virus outside the U S. All other cases are considered US - acquired cases. For national reporting, cases will be classified as either internationally imported or US- acquired. Provisional notifications of all probable and confirmed mumps cases should be sent by the State Health Department to the CDC. Electronic reporting of case records should not be delayed because of incomplete information or lack of confirmation. Following completion of case investigations, case records should be updated with any new information and resubmitted to CDC. Final laboratory results may not be available for the initial report but should be submitted via NNDSS when available. The state in which the patient resides at the time of diagnosis should submit the case notification to CDC. A person with mumps should limit their contact with others during this time. This includes staying home from school and not attend ing social events. The MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. People who have received two doses of the MMR vaccine are about nine times less likely to get mumps than unvaccinated people who have the sa me exposure to mumps virus. However, some people who receive two doses of MMR can still get mumps, especially if they have prolonged, close contact with someone who has the disease. If a vaccinated person does get mumps, they will likely have less severe illness than an unvaccinated person.

The greatest incidence of mumps was in the 15- 34-year -old age group ( 1.4 cases per 100,000) followed by those 35- 44 years old ( 1.3 cases per 100,000) ( Table 3. Data for Table 3 is available online .4). Comparing race/ethnicity, the greatest incidence of amebiasis occurred among Whites ( 1.4 cases per 100,000) ( Table 3). The highest amebiasis incidence rates were documented within SPA 4 ( 3.7 per 100,000) and SPA 5 had the second highest incidence of cases (2.1 per 100,000).

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 + \"0\" refers to any age between birth and 1 year old , not including 1 year old DESCRIPTION Pertussis2 is a respiratory disease , commonly known as whooping cough and highly contagious, caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis . These bacteria release toxins that damage and cause respiratory airways to swell. Pertussis spreads via the p erson -to- person route. Infected people are most contagious for about two weeks after the cough begins. Antibiotics ma y shorten the amount of time someone is contagious. Early symptoms can last for one to two weeks and include runny nose , low-grade fever , mild/occasional cough , and a pnea (a pause in breathing typically in babies . As the disease progresses beyond this time frame, the traditional symptoms of pertussis may appear and include paroxysms (fits) of many, rapid coughs followed by a high -pitched \"whoop\" sound, v omiting during or after coughing fits , and e xhaustion after coughing fits . Cases of pertussis are reportable to LAC DPH and nationally -notifiable . State health departments report confirmed and probable pertussis cases to the CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).4 Although m any pertussis cases are not diagnosed and therefore not reported, the surveillance system is useful for monitoring epidemiologic trends. The limitations of laboratory diagnostics make the clinical case 1publichealth.lacounty.gov/ip/VPD_pertussis.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/pertussis.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/pertussis/ 4wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/ definition essential to pertussis surveillance. The clinical case definition for pertussis is a cough lasting at least two weeks with paroxysms of coughing, a n inspiratory \"whoop,\" or post -tussive vomiting, without other apparent causes. Complications include pneumonia, seizures, and encephalopathy. Infants under one year of age are at highest risk for developing severe complications. Pertussis is confirmed by either positive Bordetella pertussis culture or PCR. While pertussis vaccines are the most effective tool to prevent this disease, no vaccine is 100% effective. It is possible for a fully vaccinated person at any age can catch this disease. If a person has received the pertussis vaccine but still get s sick, the infection is usually not severe . There are t wo vaccines in the U S that help prevent this disease : DTaP and Tdap. These vaccines also provide protection against tetanus and diphtheria. Children should receive the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus , and pertussis) vaccine , and adolescents should receive a Tdap vaccine booster. Pregnant women should receive a Tdap vaccine booster during the third trimester of every pregnancy. A nyone who will be in contact with their baby should be up- to-date with their whooping cough vaccine. Early treatment of pertussis is critical, especially an infant. Clinicians should strongly consider treating prior to test results if clinical history is strongly suggestive or patient is at risk for severe or complicated disease (e.g., infants). If a clin ician diagnoses the patient late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness , and without antibiotics, the patient will no longer spread pertussis. A reasonable guideline is to treat persons older than one year of age within three weeks of cough onset and infants younger than one year of age and For more information visit: LAC DPH1 CDPH2 CDC3 Disease Summaries: Pertussis - Page 106 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health pregnant women (especially near term) within six weeks of cough onset. Clinicians should a dminister a course of antibiotics to close contacts within three weeks of exposure, especially in high -risk settings. 2017 TRENDS AND HIGHLIGHTS This year, the pertussis disease incidence rate increased in LAC from 2.26 cases per 100,000 in 2016 to 4.94 cases per 100,000 ( Figure 1 ). 5publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/2017Tables/Pertussis.xlsx The greatest incidence of pertussis was in the <1 - year -old age group ( 53.5 cases per 100,000) followed by those in the 1 -4-year -old age group (15.4 cases per 100,000) ( Table 2. Data for Table 1 is available online .5). Comparing race/ethnicity, the greatest incidence of pertussis occurred among Whites ( 8.7 cases per 100,000) (Table 2). The highest pertussis incidence rates were documented within SPA 2 (9.3 per 100,000) and SPA 5 had the second highest incidence of cases (6.0 per 100,000) (Figure 2 ).

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD)1 is a disease caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. This disease is spread by direct and indirect contact with respiratory secretion s and can cause pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and death. S. pneumoniae is one of the most common bacterial causes of community acquired pneumonia and otitis media (ear infections). However, these non -invasive forms of infection (except bacteremic comm unity acquired pneumonia) are not counted in LAC surveillance. Therefore, the data presented in this report underestimate all disease caused by S. pneumoniae in LAC. IPD is a leading cause of illness in young children and causes considerable illness and de ath in the elderly. ACDC has been tracking IPD as part of a special antibiotic resistance surveillance project since late 1995 and added IPD to its list of reportable diseases in October 2002. Cases are defined as LAC residents with a positive S. pneumoniae isolate collected from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid). ACDC began evalu ating the effectiveness of the 13 - valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar13\u00ae) among children 2 -59-months -old since 2010. This led to substantial improvements in IPD surveillance data quality for surveillance years 2010- 2014. Data quality declined fo r surveillance year 2015. 1publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/pneumococcal.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Pne umococcal- Disease.aspx Pneumococcal isolates from persons with IPD are sent to the LAC PHL to assess antimicrobial susceptibility determined by disk or dilution diffusion. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints used by participating laborat ories are based on standards developed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. For this report, an isolate of S. pneumoniae is considered non- susceptible to an antibiotic if the results indicate intermediate or high - level resistance. Two effective vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal disease. First, Prevnar13\u00ae is recommended for all children 2 -59-months -old, children 6 -years -old with certain risk factors for invasive pneumococcal infections, and adults > 65- years -old. Second, the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (Pnu -Imune\u00ae23 and Pneumovax\u00ae23) are recommended for all adults > 65- years -old and those <2 -years -old who are at high risk for IPD.

Data for Table 1 is available online .4). Similar to previous years, SPA 6 had the highest incidence rate of IPD (8.0 cases per 100,000) ( Figure 2). Compared to the rest of LAC, SPA 6 historically has had a high number of Hispanics and Blacks in addition to high numbers of individuals with low income and lack of access to care. This may a contributing factor for the high number of cases in this SPA. More data is needed to study this [1, 2]. SPA 8 had the second highest incidence rate of 6.8 cases per 100,000. Consistent with previous years, the 2017 incidence rate in Blacks was substantially higher than rates among all other race/ethnic groups ( Table 1 ). The pe ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and TMP -SMZ was fairly consistent with the previous five years ( Figure 4 ). REFERENCES 1.

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Salmonellosis1 is a disease caused by the bacteria Salmonella. This disease is transmitted from person - to-person through fecal -oral spread. Salmonella can be found in many foods, including sprouts and other vegetables, eggs, chicken, pork, fruits, and even processed foods, such as nut butters, frozen pot pies, chicken nuggets, and stuffed chicken entrees. Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal, which is why it is importa nt to know how to prevent infection . The incubation period is usually 12 -36 hours for gastroenteritis, longer and variable for other manifestations. Communicability lasts as long as organisms are excreted, usually from 2 -5 weeks, but may last for months t o years. Salmonella illness can be serious and is more dangerous for certain people such as children younger than 5 -years old, older adults, and people with immune systems weakened from a medical condition. Warmer weather and unrefrigerated foods create ideal conditions for Salmonella to grow . Infected people do not always become sick. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 d ays, and most individuals recover without treatment. Cases of salmonellosis are reportable at the state level. Surveillance is conducted through electronic laboratory reporting . Currently , data are collected in the Laboratory -based Enteric Disease Survei llance (LEDS) 3www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases (DFWED) in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases maintains the national Salmonella surveillance data in LEDS. Proper hand hygiene after con tact with animals is important to prevent this disease . Also, washing hands with soap after using the restroom, changing diapers, or helping someone with diarrhea clean up after using the toilet is critical. Those who have Salmonella infection, should not prepare food or drinks for others until they no longer ha ve diarrheal symptoms.

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Shigellosis1 is a disease caused by the bacteria Shigella . This disease is transmitted from person -to- person through fecal -oral spread. Some people who are infected may have no symptoms at all, but may still pass the Shigella bacteria to others. Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal, which is why it is important to know how to prevent infection . Shigella affects certain populations more than others such as young children, travelers, gay and bisexual men, men who have sex with other men (MSM), and immunocompromised people. Shigellosis symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after a person is exposed to the bacteria. People who have shigellosis usually get better without antibiotic treatment in 5 to 7 days. People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest. Health care providers may prescribe antibiotics for people with severe cases of shigellosis to help them get better faster. Cases of shigellosis are reportable at the state level. Surveillance is conducted through electronic laboratory reporting . Data are collec ted in the Laboratory -based Enteric Disease Surveillance (LEDS) system. The Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases maintains the national Shigella surveillance data in LEDS. 1www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/ Shigellosis .htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Shigellosis.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/shigella/index.html Proper hand hygiene before eating or preparing food for others is a key factor in prevention of shigellosis. Also, washing hands with soap after changing diapers or helping to clean another person who went to the bathroom is important. Prevention measures also include avoiding swallowing water from ponds, lakes, or untreated swimming pools. When traveling internationally, follow safe food and water guidelines and wash hands often with soap and water.

DESCRIPTION Group A Streptococcal Disease1 is a disease caused by the bacteria the group A beta -hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes . Transmission is by direct or, rarely, indirect contact. Illness manifests as various overlapping clinical syndromes including bacteremia without focus, sepsis, cutaneous wound or deep soft - tissue infection, septic arthritis, and pneumonia. Infection can result in severe illness, including death . IGAS occurs in all age groups but more frequently among the very old. Strep throat and scarlet fever are most common in children between 5-15 years old. Group A strep infections can occur any time during the year. However, some infections are more common in the U S in cer tain seasons . For example, strep throat and scarlet fever are more common in the winter and spring. Healthcare providers and laboratories should report cases to the appropriate health department. States then report these cases to the CDC through the Nation al Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS ). The CDC tracks invasive group A strep infections through Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs), a population -based, active - and laboratory - based surveillance system. This means local and state 1www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/Strepto.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Group -A- Streptococcus.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/ health departments routinely contact laboratories to identify all cases, then report those cases to the CDC. Proper hand hygiene is the best way to protect oneself from group A strep infections. T here is currently no vaccine to prevent group A strep infect ions, although several vaccines are in development. Prophylaxis is when providers give antibiotics to someone to prevent them from getting sick. Most people who are exposed to someone with a group A strep infection should not receive prophylaxis. However, in some situations, providers may recommend prophylaxis for someone exposed to an invasive group A strep infection.

DESCRIPTION Typhoid1 or \"enteric fever,\" is an acute systemic disease caused by the Gram -negative bacillus Salmonella typhi . This disease is transmitted from person -to-person through fecal -oral spread. Common symptoms include insidious onset of persistent fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, constipation (more commonly than diarrhea), bradycardia, enlargement of the spleen, and rose spots on the trunk. Humans are the only known reservoir for S. typhi . State and local health officials use a standard report form to report detailed epidemiologic information on laboratory -confirmed cases, including patient demographic and clinical in formation, typhoid vaccination status, and travel history. A case of typhoid fever is defined as an acute illness compatible with typhoid fever in which Salmonella serotype Typhi was isolated from a normally sterile site or from stool or urine. Travel -asso ciated typhoid fever is defined as illness in a person who traveled outside of the US in the 30 days before illness began, and domestically acquired typhoid fever is defined as illness in a person without such a travel history. The best way to prevent and protect oneself from acute typhoid fever is to get vaccinated. Carefully selecting what food and drink while travel ing is important. This is because the typhoid fever vaccines 1www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/TyphoidCase.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Typhoidfever.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/typhoid- fever/index.html do not work 100% of the time. When traveling to areas of risk, it is critical t o drink bottled or boiled water. It is important to eat foods that have been thoroughly cooked and are still hot while eating. Avoid raw vegetables and fruits that cannot be peeled. It is best to avoid foods and beverages from street vendors.

DESCRIPTION Typhus , Flea -Borne1 or murine typhus, is a disease caused by a bacteria called Rickettsia typhi . This disease is transmitted from person -to-person through contact with infected fleas. People get sick with flea-borne typhus when infected flea feces are rubbed into cuts or scrapes in the skin. In most areas of the world, rats are the main animal host for fleas infected with flea-borne typhus. Flea-borne typhus occurs in tropical and subtropical climates around the world where rats and their fleas live. Cat fleas found on domestic cats and opossums have been associated with cases of flea -borne typhus in the United States. Most cases of flea-borne typhus in the U S are reported from California, Hawaii, and Texas. Symptoms of flea -borne typhus begin within two weeks after contact with infected fleas. Signs and symptoms may include fever and chills , body aches and muscle pain , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting, stomach pain , cough , and r ash. Most people will recover without treatment, but some cases may be severe. When left untreated, severe illness can cause damage to one or more organs including the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain. There is no vaccine to prevent flea -borne typhus. The best way to reduce one's risk is by avoiding contact with infected fleas. It is important to k eep rodents and animals away from one's home, workplace, and recreational areas. Additionally, r emove brush, rock 1www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/VectorTyphus.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Typhus.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/typhus/murine/index.html piles, junk, cluttered firewood, and food supplies, especially pet food. Always wear gloves when handling sick or dead animals. Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -registered insect repellent labeled for use against fleas if exposed to fleas during activities such as camping, hiking, or working outdoors. One can t reat clothing and gear with permethrin or purchase permethrin- treated items. Lastly, k eep fleas off pets. Use veteri narian -approved flea control products for cats and dogs such as flea collars. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for suspected scrub typhus in persons of all ages.

CDC. Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites States 2017 DESCRIPTION Vibriosis1 is a disease caused by about a dozen different Vibrio bacteria species . The most common species causing human illness in the US are is transmitted through raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters. The main symptom of this disease is a skin infection when an open wound is exposed to salt or brackish water . Brackish water is a mixture of fresh and salt water. People with compromised immune systems, especially those with chronic liver disease, are more likely to get vibriosis. Most people with a mild case of vibriosis recover after about three days with no lasting effects. However, people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation . About 1 in 5 people with this type of infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill. Vibriosis has been a nationally notifiable disease since 2007. Health departments report cases to the Cholera and Other Vibrio Illness Surveillance (COVIS) system. COVIS was initiated by the CDC, FDA, and four Gulf Coast states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas) in 1989. By the early 2000s, almost all states were voluntarily reporting. Because Vibrio bacteria are not easily identified with routine testing, many cases are not reported. 1www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/Vibrio.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Vibriosis.aspx Prevention of vibriosis can be accomplished by not eating raw or undercooked oysters or other shellfish. These foods should be cooked thoroughly before eating. It is important to a lways wash hands with soap and water after handing raw shellfish. Additionally, avoid contaminating cooked shellfish with raw shellfish and its juices. Lastly, stay ing out of salt water or brackish water if one has a wound (including cuts and scrapes), or cover ing one's wounds with a waterproof bandage if there is a possibility it could come in contact with salt water or brackish water, raw seafood, or raw seafood ju ices is critical for prevention . Wash wounds and cuts thoroughly with soap and water if they have been exposed to seawater or raw seafood or its juices. It is helpful to wear clothes and shoes that can protect from cuts and scrapes when in salt water or br ackish water. Also, w earing protective gloves when handling raw seafood is helpful for prevention.

Notional Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions: Unites S tates 2017 DESCRIPTION West Nile Virus1 (WNV) is a disease caused by a virus that is spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds. While most people infected with WNV do not develop symptoms , symptoms can include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people with mild WNV disease recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months. A few people develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system such as encephalitis or meningitis. Symptom s of severe illness include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness , and paralysis. Severe illness can occur in people of any age , but those 60-years and older are at greater risk. People with certain medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, and people who have received organ transplants are also at greater risk. Recovery from severe illness might take several weeks or months and some effects to the central nervous system might be permanent. Some with severe illness affecting the central nervous system die. 1www. publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/VectorWestNile.htm 2www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/WestNileVirus.aspx 3www.cdc.gov/westnile/ There is n o vaccine or specific antiviral treatments for WNV infection. Over -the-counter pain relievers can be used to re lieve some symptoms . Severe cases often need to be hospitalized to receive supportive treatment . The incubation period for WNV disease is typically 2 to 6 days but ranges from 2 to 14 days and can be several weeks in immunocompromised people. Avoiding mosquito bites is central to preventing infection. WNV disease is a nationally -notifiable condition . Most cases are reported to public health authorities from public health or commercial laboratories. Healthcare providers also submit reports of suspected cases. State and local health departments are responsible for ensuring that reported human disease cases meet the national case definitions. All identified WNV disease cases and presumptive viremic blood donors should be investigated promptly. Jur isdictions may choose to interview the patient's health care provider, the patient, or both depending on information needs and resources.

To be considered a foodborne illness outbreak, both the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) require the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food.1 The surveillance system used by LAC DPH for detection of foodborne illness outbreaks typically begins with a Foodborne Illness Report (FBIR) . FBIRs can be submitted by calling the LAC DPH Communicable Disease Reporting System Hotline (888 -397-3993) or via the internet1. The FBIR system monitors complaints from residents, illness reports associated with commercial food facilities, and foodborne exposures uncovered during disease - specific case investigations such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, and toxigenic E. coli includ ing shiga toxin - producing E. coli (STEC ). LAC Environmental Health Service's (EHS) Wholesale Food and Safety Program (WFS) investigates each FBIR by contacting the reporting individual and assessing the public health importance and need for expanded follow -up. When warranted, a thorough inspection of the facility is conducted. This public health action is often sufficient to prevent additional foodborne illnesses. ACDC's Food Safety Unit also reviews all FBIRs. Joint investigations are conducted on possibl e foodborne illness outbreaks of public health importance. Typically, an epidemiologic investigation will be initiated when there are illnesses in multiple households, multiple reports against the same establishment in a short period of time, or there are ill individuals who attended a large event with the potential for others to become ill. The objective of each investigation is to determine the extent of the outbreak, identify a food vehicle or processing error, determine the agent of infection, and take actions to protect the public's health. 1www.visualcmr.net/webvcmr/pages/public/pub_FBI_Report.aspx RESULTS A total of 2,348 FBIRs were received in 2017, which is a 14.2% increase in reports compared to the 2,056 FBIRs received in 2016. Public reporting via the web accounted for 54% of FBIRs this year. WFS contacte d each person making the FBIR complaint. Nineteen percent of FBIR reports were deemed high priority and therefore inspected by a WFS inspector. The majority (66%) of the complaints were referred to district EHS offices for inspection, and 7% were referred to other EHS specialty programs (Vehicle Inspection, Street Vending Compliance, Drinking Water, etc.), other LAC departments (Department of Weights and Measures), or agencies outside LAC (other local health jurisdictions, state agencies, federal agencies). There were 217 FBIRs (9%) on which WFS did not take action or were duplicates. The ACDC Food Safety Unit conducted 29 outbreak investigations this year. Of these, 27 outbreaks were initiated by FBIR complaints, and 2 were initiated through other surveill ance activities. Of the 29 investigations, 3 (10%) were not considered to be foodborne because the evidence collected during the investigation did not support a foodborne source (Data not shown). These outbreaks were due to norovirus, which can easily be s pread person- to- person in a food setting if one guest is sick when attending. Another reason for these investigations not being considered to be a foodborne illness outbreak were because the illness patterns (epidemic curve) were consistent with person -to-person spread rather than point source infection. Determining whether a food item was the source in such outbreaks can be challenging as well as time and resource consuming. The 26 foodborne illness outbreaks are listed in Table 1 and summarized below. These foodborne illness outbreaks represent 292 cases of foodborne illness Disease Outbreaks: Foodborne Illness - Page 141 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Figure 1), 1 hospitalization, and no deaths. Outbreaks occurred throughout the year (Figure 2). FOODBORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAK : ETIOLOGY Cooked food items Of the eight outbreaks where a food item was found to be associated with illness, two involved a food item that contained primarily cooked ingredients. One of these (Outbreak 266) was a confimed Campylobacter jejuni outbreak. The implicated food item was u ndercooked chicken liver. The second (Outbreak 308) was a confirmed salmonella outbreak. The implicated food item, mango sticky rice, included cooked rice and raw mangoes. Although mangoes have been a cause of salmonellosis outbreaks, the serotype found in outbreak 308 has been more commonly associated with reptiles. It is possible that a food handler owns or had handled a reptile before showing up to work (Figure 1). Uncooked food items The other six outbreaks in which a food item was identified involved uncooked food items (Outbreaks 25, 92, 228, 248, 273, and 434). In four of these, the etiologic agent was caused by norovirus. This was confirmed in two (Outbreaks 92 and 434). The implicated food items were raw oysters (Outbreaks 228 and 434), fruit (Outbreak 92), and vegetable salad (Outbreak 273). For outbreaks 228 and 434, the oysters appeared to have been contaminated prior to retail. The mode of contamination is less clear with outbreaks 92 and 273. The most likely explanation is that a foodhandler contaminated the fruit and salads during preparation. Another outbreak involving uncooked food items was outbreak 25. This outbreak was caused by intoxication due to ciguatera fish poisoning where the case ate raw mackerel at a sushi restaurant. The final outbreak involving uncooked food was outbreak 248. This was a confirmed outbreak of Campylobacter jejuni . Two events used the same caterer during the same weekend. The health i nspector found multiple violations. It is most likely that the guacamole implicated in this outbreak was cross -contaminated during the food preparation. FOODBORNE AGENTS An etiological agent was identified in 24 of the 26 outbreak investigations this ye ar and confirmed in 38% (n=10) (Table 1). A viral agent was responsible for 18 outbreaks, bacterial agents for 5 outbreaks, and fish toxins for 1 outbreak (Figure 3). 01002003004005006007008009001000 0510152025303540 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Number of Cases of Illness YearNumber of OutbreaksFigure 1.

The number of outbreaks is on the high end than for the past 10 years (range: 5 -18). There was one large, laboratory -confirmed foodborne norovirus outbreak this year. This outbreak (Outbreak 92) involved a hotel that sponsored a college -level sporting competition occurring over four days. The incubation times were consistent with a point -source outbreak, and fruit was significantly associated with illness. Four of seven cases tested were positive for norovirus. BACTERIAL OUTBREAKS Salmonella was confirmed in two outbreaks this year (Outbreaks 171 and 256). The first salmonellosis outbreak ( Outbreak 171) was caused by S. Newport and occurred in persons eating at a restaurant that serves Chinese -style food. A total of five confirmed cases ate at the restaurant during the same time period. Two restaurant employees tested positive for S. Newport. However , it is unclear whether those employees are the source or are part of the outbreak. Unfortunately, no common food item was identified. The second salmonellosis outbreak was due to S. Enteriditis. This outbreak occurred in employees of the same restaurant . No other employees were ill or tested positive for S. Enteriditis and no patrons reported illness after eating at this restaurant. No food item was implicated. There were two outbreaks due to Campylobacter jejuni . Both were confirmed. In the first C. jejuni outbreak, the implicated food was guacamole. The guacamole was probably cross -contaminted as the caterer was cited for many violation s upon its inspection. The second C. jejuni was caused by undercooked chicken liver. Per the chef, this preparation of chicken liver should not be served fully cooked. OTHER FOODBORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAKS There was one outbreak in which a fish toxin (Ciguatera) was identified as the likely etiology (Outbreak 25). In this outbreak thr ee cases ate together at a sushi restaurant. The implicated food source was raw mackerel. OUTBREAK LOCATIONS Exposure locations for reported foodborne illness outbreaks included restaurants (16), hotels (4), banquet halls (2), schools (2), private homes (1), and an office. This year SPA 5 reported t he largest number of outbreaks (27%) (Table 2). This is a change from SPA 2 reporting the largest proportion of foodborne illness outbreaks since 2010, except in 2014 and 2016.

An outbr eak in such settings is defined as a cluster of infections or colonizations related in time and place or occurring above a baseline or threshold level for a defined area of a facility, including the entire facility, specific unit, or ward. Baseline is rela tive to what is normally observed in a particular setting . A situation event is defined as a cluster of infections or colonizations in the setting of a general acute care hospital that may not clearly meet all outbreak criteria defined above or that requires additional information to determine if an outbreak has occurred (Figure 1 ). ABSTRACT There were 15 confirmed outbreaks reported in acute care hospitals in 2017 ( Table 1). Most (n= 10, 66.7%) occurred in a unit providing intensive or focused specialized care (long -term acute care, oncology, cardiology, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU )). Two -thirds of acute care hospital outbreaks (n=12, 80.0%) were of bacterial etiology, often from a multi - drug -resistant organism (MDRO) ( Table 2, Figure 2 ). Scabies accounted for the greatest number event was investigated in acute care hospitals in 2017. Table 1.

Three were caused by an MDRO, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Neonates in the NICU are uniquely vulnerable to colonization and infection with pathogens such as emerging multi - drug -resistant pathogens due to their immature immune system.1 Infections among neonates continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, thus continued improvement and adherence to infection control practices is needed to increase patient safety. Elizabethkingia anophelis (E. anophelis) was identified among 19 ventilator -dependent patient s of a subacute long -term care unit, including 4 infected and 15 colonized patients. Multiple on -site investigations conducted by ACDC revealed significant lapses in infection control practices including insufficient reprocessing of reusable ventilator par ts, cleaning and storage of ventilator machine, and hand hygiene during tracheostomy care. Test results of the water samples and swabs collected by ACDC did not identify Elizabethkingia but found a high burden of other pathogenic bacteria including Pseudomonas , Acinetobacter , and Stenotrophomonas . Research shows that Elizabethkingia is difficult to culture from the environment, however the high number of other bacteria likely further limited the recovery of the E. anophelis from the facility's water supply. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) performed by the CDC on nine available clinical isolates revealed that eight of the isolates strongly suggested a common source. There were five reported waterborne pathogen outbreaks in acute care hospitals with underlying conditions, immunosuppression, and the presence of invasive devices are at risk of waterborne infections , that may cause sign ificant morbidity and mortality, due to several possible transmission pathways and sources of contamination of the water supply in a hospital.2 It is better to prevent than to remediate the water supply of healthcare facilities, with adherence to optimal healthcare hygiene practices to decrease the risk of introducing waterborne pathogens to patients. [2] On June 2, 2017 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a policy memorandum mandating the development and adherence to water managem ent policies and procedures that inhibit microbial growth in building water systems that reduce the risk of growth and spread of Legionella and other opportunistic pathogens in water.3 REFERENCES 1.

Baseline is defined as what is normally obs erved in that specific setting. Sub-acute care facilities include skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), intermediate care facilities, and psychiatric care facilities. SNFs provide continuous skilled nursing care and supportive care to patients whose primary need is for availability of expert nursing on an extended basis. Intermediate care facilities also provide inpatient care to patients who have need for adept nursing supervision and need supportive care, but who do not require continuous nursing care. Psy chiatric care facilities provide 24- hour inpatient care for patients with psychiatric care needs. ABSTRACT The total number of all confirmed sub -acute care associated outbreaks in 2017 increased by 37% (from 91 to 125 outbreaks) from the previous year. In 2017, the number of SNF -specific outbreaks reported in LAC increased by 43% (from 84 to 120 outbreaks) fro m the previous year (Table 1). Table 1.

This included: two outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness, one influenza out break with five cases, one hepatitis A outbreak, and one head lice outbreak. Skilled Nursing Facilities (N=120) : A total of 120 SNF outbreaks were confirmed during 2017. Respiratory illness outbreaks were the most frequently reported and confirmed outbrea k category, with 58 (46%) outbreaks affecting 1,186 cases. Rash illness outbreaks were the next most frequently confirmed with 34 (27%) outbreaks affecting 243 cases. Gastroenteritis Illness outbreaks were the third most frequently confirmed with 29 (23%) outbreaks affecting 587 cases. In 2017, two outbreaks of carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were reported by SNFs with 34 cases.

The majority (120 out of 125, 96%) of these outbreaks were reported from SNFs. The total number of reported respiratory outbreaks increased by 53% (from 31 to 58 outbreaks) as compared to the previous year. In 2017, influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant viral strain , and this strain is especially likely to result in severe illness among those over 65 years old . Of the 58 outbreaks, 54 (93.2%) were caused by influenza virus, 2 (3.4%) were due to unknown etiologies, 1 (1.7%) was due to Rhino Virus, and 1 (1.7%) was caused by Legionella. Respiratory outbreaks were classified as influenza if there was at least one case of laboratory - confirmed influenza in the setting of a cluster of ILI within a 48 to 72- hour period. Service Planning Area (SPA) 3 reported the most number of respiratory illness outbreaks (15, 26%) in 2017, followed by SPA 2 (13, 22%). The total number of reported rash illness outbreaks decreased by 5% in 2017 compared to 2016 from 36 to 34 outbreaks. Thirty -four rash illness outbreaks were investigated with a total of 243 cases. Of 34 rash illness outbreaks, 10 (29%) outbreaks were atypical scabi es, 15 (44%) outbreaks were scabies, 8 (24%) outbreaks were unknown rash, and 1 (3%) outbreak was ring worms. SPA 2 reported the most Disease Outbreak Summaries: Healthcare Associated Outbreaks \u2014Sub-Acute Care Facilities - Page 149 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health number of rash illness outbreaks (12, 35%), followed by SPA 3 (7, 21%). The total number of reported GE illness outbreaks remained same (from 29 to 29 outbreaks) as compared to the previous year. Twenty -nine GE illness outbreaks were investigated causing 587 cases of outbreak- associated illness. Of the 29 outbreaks, 15 (52%) w ere caused by laboratory - confirmed norovirus, 11 (38%) unknown GE, and 3 (10%) Clostridium difficile outbreak. SPA 3 reported the most GE illness outbreaks of any Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) SPA since 2008 with 11 (38%). Per th e Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), health care facilities, including nursing homes and hospitals, are the most commonly reported settings for norovirus outbreaks in the US and other industrialized countries. Over half of all norovirus outb reaks reported in the US occur in long -term care facilities. The virus can be introduced into healthcare facilities by infected patients \u2014who may or may not be showing symptoms \u2014or by staff, visitors, or contaminated foods. The duration of outbreaks in these settings can be quite long, sometimes lasting months. Illness can be more severe, occasionally even fatal, in hospitalized or nursing home patients compared with otherwise healthy people [1]. Sub-acute facility outbreaks were investigated and documented from all LAC SPAs. The greatest proportion of outbreaks were investigated within SPA 2 with 34 (27%) followed by SPA 3 with 33 (26%). PREVENTION Most outbreaks in sub -acute care facilities are caused by agents spread by person- to-person contact. Thus, ap propriate hand hygiene practice by staff and residents, and visitors is a crucial infection control measure. The ACDC's Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Outreach Program (OP) continues to engage in collaborations with stakeholders and provide assistance and health education, and develop resources to prevent infections, strengthen outbreak detection and response, and address other acute communicable disease issues in SNFs. The ACDC's SNF OP created SNF webpage \"Skilled Nursing Facilities: Infection Prevention Resources and Guidance central guide to education and events relevant to improving infection prevention at your SNF\" (http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/SNF.htm ) at ACDC's website to provide r esources on -line. As part of influenza prevention efforts, ACDC SNF OP sent an annual reminder letter to SNFs prior to the 2016- 2017 influenza season to comply with the Health Officer Order (HOO), issued October 2, 2013, which mandates that healthcare per sonnel in acute care hospitals, long term care facilities, and intermediate care facilities in LAC be vaccinated against influenza or wear a protective mask. In addition to influenza vaccination for sub- acute facility staff and residents, proper hand washi ng, administrative controls, utilization of appropriate antiviral treatment and prophylaxis for facility residents and staff, and isolation are essential for prevention of seasonal influenza. A toolkit for influenza vaccination programs in SNFs (www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/SNFToolKit.ht m) and the Influenza Outbreak Prevention and Control Guidelines for Skilled Nursing Facilities (www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/InfluenzaOBGu idelines.htm ) are availabl e to provide a standardized guidance for CHS when conducting influenza and respiratory outbreak investigations in SNFs, and to provide guidance to SNFs an effective approach to the prevention and control of influenza. The printed guidelines are available a nd they were distributed to Community Health Services (CHS) Public Health Nurses (PHNs), and staff at SNFs during outreach activities. To assist sub -acute care facilities with management of scabies outbreaks, LAC DPH's Scabies Prevention and Control Guidelines Acute and Long- Term Care Facilities updated 2015 (www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/Diseases/Scabi esToolkit.htm ) is available to provide a rational approach to the prevention and control of scabies in LAC healthcare facilities. The printed guidelines are available and they were distributed to CHS PHNs a nd staff at SNFs during outreach activities. The \"Norovirus Outbreak Prevention Toolkit\", which was developed in 2012 by ACDC in collaboration with CHS, Health Facilities Inspection Division, Licensing and Certification Program, and Environmental Health in response to an increasing number of GE outbreaks reported by sub- acute facilities. The printed guidelines were distributed to CHS PHNs and SNFs Disease Outbreak Summaries: Healthcare Associated Outbreaks \u2014Sub-Acute Care Facilities - Page 150 - ANNUAL MORBIDITY REPORT 2017 Communicable Disease Control Los Angeles County Department of Public Health during outreach activities and is available at: www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/Norovirus /NoroToolkit2012.pdf . On September 27, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) Acute Communicable Disease Control (ACDC) held a symposium for key LA C ounty SNF staff responsible for infectious disease outbreak prevention and control. Representatives from SNFs included directors of nursing, administrators, and infection preventionists. The goals of the symposium were to improve partnerships between SNFs and LAC DPH as well as to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases in the SNF setting, antimicrobial stewardship programs, and management of MDROs. The course covered requirements for Antimicrobial Stewardship programs in SNFs and how to colla borate across the continuum of care. Other topics that will be covered in the symposium include: Immunizations recommendations for healthcare personnel and residents, reporting requirements for Carbapenem - resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and protecting employees from blood -borne pathogens and aerosol transmissible diseases.

The majority of CRE infections are associated with patients in an acute care hospital or skilled nursing facility (SNF) who are immunocompromised or have invasive devices such as intravenous catheters or are ventilator dependent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is concerned about the rapid spread of CRE and has recommended aggressive approaches for identifying and preventing further spread [1]. Using data from 2010 -2012 , the Los Angeles County Department of Publi c Health ( LAC DPH ) assessed the prevalence of CRE in LAC2 and received over 2,000 laboratory report s of carbapenem -resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae , one type of CRE . Prior work by the C DC suggested only sporadic cases of CRE were identified in LAC hospitals and prevalence was unknown . The large number of cases received was substantially higher than anticipated , providing justification for further surveillance. CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN )3 is an electronic healthcare -associated infection (HAI) tracking system . In California, all acute care hospitals are mandated to report select HAIs to the California Department of Public Health via this system. The NHSN includes an option to report the three most common CRE infections (Escherichia coli , Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp.) as part of the system's LabID Event module. In April 2010, LAC DPH requested and received voluntary conferral of rights to the NHSN data submitted to California Department of Public Health . On January 19, 2017 a Health Officer Order (HOO)4 was issued requiring all acute care hospitals and SNFs report CRE infections as well as a facility - specific annual antibiogram to LAC DPH. Antibiogram data provide a comprehensive summary of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in healt hcare facilities. LAC DPH will use data submitted from healthcare facilities to compile a regional antibiogram to assess resistanc e and detect new trends in LAC. METHODS In California, general acute care hospitals (GACH ) and long term acute care hospitals (LTACH ) mandatorily report HAI data into NHSN . LAC DPH decided to build CRE reporting into this already established system and expand the data captured by creating a LAC CRE Group which added patient information and key variables needed to assess and describe the epi demiology of CRE in LAC. For surveillance purposes in this study , CRE infections were defined using the NHSN Safety Component Manual 5 as Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp.) resistant to carbapenem antibiotics or that produce carbapenemases. 1 https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/definition.html 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/CRKP_ICHE.pdf 3 https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html 4 http://public health.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/CREorder.pdf 5 https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/pscmanual/pcsmanual_current.pdf The First The First Year of Mandated CRE Antibiogram Reporting Page 2 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report LAC DPH sent detailed instructions for this new reporting requirement to all LAC facilities mandated to report. In addition, a webinar was created to provide step by step guidance on how to join the LAC CRE Group, as well as how to confer rights to LAC DPH and create custom variables. In contrast to GACHs and LTACHs, b ecause most SNFs are not enrolled in the NHSN, a paper reporting form was created for these locations . The NHSN LAC CRE group was used as the data source for analysis to calculate hospital and community onset rates as well as for descriptive epidemiology statistics. All SNF reports were submitted via paper case report forms and were entered into an Access d atabase by ACDC staff. For GACH s and LTACH s, CRE rates were analyzed using NHSN calculations of number of infections reported for the numerator and admissions for community -onset (CO) and patient da ys for healthcare -onset (HO) for the denominator. CO infections were identified within 3 days of admission and HO after 3 days of admission in both GACHs and LTACH s. Stratification of data by onset type in SNFs was not possible since most admission date in formation was either mis sing or filled out incorrectly. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services ( CMS) requirements, GACHs and LTACHs submitted final reports to NHSN by May 15, 2018. Data analysis was performed in May and June 2018 . Additional analysis was done comparing CRE case counts between the two NHSN LAC g roups; the gen eral LAC group and the LAC CRE G roup containing patient in formation and custom variables. RESULTS Out of 83 GACH s and 8 LTACH s in LAC, 72 (86.7%) GACHs and all LTACHs reported at least one CRE event. Pooled LTACH HO rates were higher than GACHs at 1.22 (range 0.50 -2.18) infectio ns compared to 0.66 Figure 1.

The pooled CO CRE rates reported from LTACH s were also higher than GACHs, 2.11 (range 1.04-7.97) infections and 0.3 5 per 100 admissions , respectively (Figure 2) . GACH In GACHs, t he majority of healthcare -onset CRE reported was Klebsiella (64.9%), followed by E nterobacter and E. coli (12.7%) (Table 1 ). Klebsiella (75.6%) was also the most commonly reported community onset CRE followed by E. coli (13.5%) and Enterobacter (10.9%) . Table 1.

Communication addressing the specific issue identified for each hospital was generated and sent via email to the hospital infection preventionist by the respective LAC DPH liaison public health nurse and an epidemiologist. If additional troubleshooting or technical assistance was required, the assigned epidemiologist would follow -up with the infection preventionist . By May 2018, all 19 with reporting issues had corrected the problems . In addition, 2018 reporting plans were checked to ensure the corrections ha d carried over to the new year. Forty duplicates were identified within NHSN data. Efforts were made to reach out to NHSN to troubleshoot how this occurred and make appropriate corrections to avoid future duplicate even t entry. The First The First Year of Mandated CRE Antibiogram Reporting Page 8 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report SNF data was merged with the GACH and LTACH data to check for duplicate reporting. Multiple errors were identified including CRE reported by a SNF that should have or had already been reported by the ordering acute care hospital, incorrect date of current admission to the SNF, reporting a history of CRE (no current lab), and reporting on different organisms (i.e. Pseudomonas ) not covered by the HOO. Analysis of SNF reports resulted in identification of two CRE reports that should have been reported by the acute care hospital but were missed. Five cases had already been reported in NHSN by the acute care hospital. These errors were communicated to the appropr iate facilities . Antibiogram All 92 acute care hospitals (including LTACH s) in LAC submitted antibiograms during the first year of the HOO. With this information, t he first LAC regional antibiogram6 was completed, published , and distributed in January 2018 and is posted on the ACDC website. Data entry and analysis is currently underway for 2017 data. DISCUSSION Overall the first year of CRE reporting in LAC generated valuable data and identified high rates of CRE in healthca re facilities, especially among LTACH s. This information will help guide targeted prevention efforts moving forward. Reporting errors were identified from GACHs, LTACH s, and SNFs and efforts have been made to correct discrepancies both ret rospectively and going forward. LIMITATIONS All the custom variables that LAC DPH requested in NHSN reporting plans exhibited low response rates resulting in missing data. We plan to address these reporting gaps by identifying facilities that did not complete the custom variable fields and reaching out to them to notify them and provide additional assistance as needed. There was no NHSN data validation done to ensure that hospitals are reporting CRE accurately and thoroughly. Historically, the California Department of Public Health has performed hospital data entry validation for other diseases, however this verification has not been conducted as CRE is no t reportable at the state level . Currently , data validation in SNFs is not feasible as there are over 300 SNFs in LAC. REFERENCES 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Marquez P, Terashita D, Dassey D, Mascola -based incidence enem -resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae along the c ontinuum (2):144 A ntimicrobial Resistance Testing Page 9 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report ACTIVATING VITAL ADVANCES IN ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE TESTING AMONG LOS ANGELES COUNTY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES BACKGROUND Antibiotic resistance (AR) and multi- drug resistant organisms (MDRO) are an intensifying public health threat. Carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are especially concerning. CRE mortality rates are often as high as 30 -40% [1-5] due to limited treatment options . In addition, many CRE can spread AR to other bacteria via plasmid -encoded genetic resistance mechanisms , called carbapenemases [6]. Given this, it is not surprising that CRE has been classified as a critically important and urgent global threat by the Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization [7-8]. While CRE has been steadily increasing in the United States [9-10], Los Angeles County (LAC) has been identified as a hotspot for CRE infections because of its large number of healthcare facilities and its internati onal patient population [11], which create a complex system within which CRE and other MDROs can readily spread. Early administration of microbiologically active antimicrobial therapy can reduce morbidity and mortality from CRE infections [5, 12-14]. This depends on accurate determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the infecting organism to antibiotics. Interpretation of the MIC results is conducted using breakpoints , which categorize whether an antibiotic is resistant or susceptib le to any given antibiotic and determine the probability of treatment success. The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) provides guidance on what methodologies clinical laboratories should use to detect CRE and other nosocomial pathogens. The CLSI updated the carbapenem MIC breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae in 2010 based on data from multiple clinical studies demonstrating that ongoing use of the previous breakpoints resulted in higher patient mortality [3, 4]. Failure to update breakpoint s also impacted infection control measures, w hich is estimated to contribute to a 3-5% annual spread of CRE [15]. Ongoing use of outdated CLSI breakpoints will result in the failure to recognize clinically and epidemiologically concerning MDROs such as CRE . It is thus imperative that clinical laboratories are up -to-date on their CRE detection methods . To assess CRE detection practices amongst clinical laboratories, the Acute Communicable Disease Control Healthcare Outreach Unit (HOU) partnered with California Department of Public Health and academic investigators to conduct the California Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network Assessment (CARLA) survey in 2015. The CARLA survey identified that 42% of hospital laboratories in LAC used outdated carbapenem breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae [16]. Furthermore, many laboratories did not perform carbapenemase testing, as recommended by CLSI to ensure detection of carbapenemase -producing Enterobacteriaceae with use of outdated breakpoints [16]. Clinical laboratories must take manual steps to ensure their antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) instruments are up -to-date. However, the HOU theorized that lack of awareness of the problem s Activating Advances in A ntimicrobial Resistance Testing Page 10 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report surrounding use of outdated breakpoints and/or techni cal knowledge of how to update breakpoints caused the delayed uptake of revised breakpoints. This prompted our initiative to better understand why laboratories failed to update breakpoints and, in turn, assist them in implement ing up-to-date CRE detection methods. OBJECTIVE This report describes the HOU 's efforts to update carbapenem breakpoints amongst targeted clinical laboratories in LAC to improve detection of CRE. METHODS HOU established the antimicrobial resistance/antimicrobial stewardship (AR/AS) team, composed of five HOU liaison public health nurses (LPHNs), an epidemiologist, and an infectious disease physician serving as the HOU's AR expert. Targeted hospitals were c hosen based upon their responses to the question of using outdated CRE breakpoints in the CARLA survey. To be included in our target list, the labs had to respond with i or ii to the following question: What breakpoints does your laboratory use for carbape nems testing Enterobacteriaceae? i. Pre-2010 breakpoints only ii. Pre-2010 breakpoints combined production iii. Current CLSI M100 S25 breakpoints iv. Other The AR/AS team collaborated with CDC and local microbiology experts to devel op a protocol that guide s clinical laboratories through the process of updating CRE detection methods , which includes: 1. ordering verification panels from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/CDC AR Isolate Bank; 2. updating breakpoints in the AST instrument , which may involve scheduling a visit with the local service technician of their AST device manufacturer; and 3. conducting a verification study to ensure accurate results. The team first conducted in -person visits with each hospital's laboratory director, microbiology supervisor, antimicrobial stewardship chair, and infection preventionist to discuss unique issues that were impacting their CRE detection methods and provide initial recommendations . Following the initial visit, the AR/AS team provided each hospital with the CRE breakpoint update protocol, sample verification study protocol , and template to document the results o f the verification studies. During follow -up consultations, the AR expert provided additional support, which included facilitating communication with the CDC, FDA, and local laboratory equipment representatives. The AR/AS team also checked in with each hospital regularly to encourage progress, and that their methods were thorou ghly implemented . RESULTS Between July to August 2017, the AR/AS team conducted outreach to 41 hospitals who responded with i or ii to the question above . The survey was sent out to all hospitals in California in 2015, including 97 in Los Angeles (at the time of the survey). All 41 laboratories had in person AR/AS team visits. At the time of Activating Advances in A ntimicrobial Resistance Testing Page 11 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report the initial AR/AS visit, 7 (17%) had updated to the current CLSI breakpoint following the CARLA survey, and were not targeted for further follow -up. Of the remaining 34 laboratories, 27 (79.4%) assumed their AST instruments were using current breakpoints. Half of laboratories (17, 50%) were uncertain of how to approach changing breakpoints on their AST instrument, and 10 (29.4%) indicated they lacked the resources to p erform a verification study. Only 7 (20.5%) facilities were familiar with the FDA/CDC AR Isolate Bank as a resource for verification studies. All 34 laboratories using historical breakpoints were accredited, most were accredited by the College of American Pathologists (29, 85%) , the others by the Joint Commission (5, 15%). Laboratory staffing included dedicated microbiology staff in 28 (82%) laboratories , a laboratory director with a specialization in microbiology (MD or PhD) in 5 (15%) , and a clinical laboratory scientist in 29 (85%) . All 34 hospital laboratories agreed to work toward updating carbapenem breakpoints following the AR/AS team visit. After one year of follow -up, 15 laboratories (47%) s uccessfully updated breakpoints; 12 (35%) received isolates but did not update ; and 6 (18%) are planning to complete the update in 2018. Common barriers for the 19 laboratories failing to update the breakpoint included: too much clinical work and/or not enough staffing ( 12, 63% ) and inability to update the laboratory information systems or electronic medical record (5, 26% ). Other less common reasons included waiting on new testing platforms (n=2) and change s in laboratory staff (n=3). DISCUSSION Ongoing use of outdated carbapenem breakpoints by clinical laboratories is a public health problem. Failure to update breakpoints hampers infection control initiatives, hinders CRE treatment success, and helps fuel spread of CRE [2-5, 15]. Prior to the AR/AS visit, most microbiology laboratory personn el did not feel empowered to make changes, even when they were aware of the problem. However, with the cooperation of antimicrobial stewardship an d infection control leadership \u2014in conjunction with ongoi ng follow -up by the AR/AS team \u2014the laboratories gained vital support for the breakpoint update initiative. The AR/AS team visits allowed HOU to use existing resources for targeted outreach to engage hospital laboratories in updating carbapenem breakpoints. The key to success of the project was developing a strong system of collaborations with our CDC partners, local experts, representatives of AST device manufacturers, and individual hospital staff\u2014 especially the clinical laboratory scientist who typically leads the laboratory methodology validation efforts. The process of verifying new MIC breakpoints is outside the scope of typical laboratory work -flow, so many facilities needed encouragement and administrative support to complete the process. Thanks to the AR/AS team visits, all ( 100% ) of targeted hospitals began the process of updating breakpoints and nearly half of the hospital laboratories completed the update within one year. Physicians and other healthcare staff depend on the assurance that the results provided by their laboratory are accurate, significant, and clinically relevant. By improving laboratory detection methods, CRE will now be correctly classified in LAC hospital laboratories. This will decrease inappropriate antibiotic therapy and in turn decrease the risk of death fr om CRE infection. Now that CRE can be accurately Activating Advances in A ntimicrobial Resistance Testing Page 12 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report detected and reported, HOU can also improve our efforts to contain the spread of CRE within LAC. In addition, because LAC has a large international patient population, this project likely will also decrease the spread of CRE globally. There are several limitations to this intervention . While the AR/AS team was successful with improving updated carbapenem MIC breakpoint usage in LAC, the HOU experience may not be generalizable to other public health jurisdic tions. The AR/AS team includes academic investigators in infectious disease and microbiology. However, we hope that making our resources available to other jurisdictions will make our initiative more wide ly adoptable. To date, the FDA \u2014which dictates which breakp oints AST instruments must use \u2014has officially recognized many but not all CLSI breakpoints, which complicates the process of updating AST systems in a timely manner. Additionally, HOU did not collect information on how the breakpoint initiative impac ted patient outcomes, infection prevention practices, antimicrobial prescribing, or the incidence rate of CRE in LAC . Despite the large number of hospital laboratorie s in LAC using outdated CRE detection methods and limited st aff resources, this project w as a success. The AR/AS team's findings informed a need to do further broad education to improve AR detection practices across LAC . This project also greatly improved HOU's rapport with hospital laboratories, which is critical to detect and contain CRE and other AR bacteria of epidemiological concern. Now that these partnerships have been established, HOU will be able to continue to improve laboratory capabilities in our jurisdiction in the global fight against AR. REFERENCES 1.

To date, most efforts by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health ( LAC DPH) to build antimicrobial stewardship capacity has focused on inpatient settings. However, estimates are that more than 3 0 percent of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings are unnecessary [1]. Primary care clinics and clinicians prescribe approximately half of all outpatient antibiotics in the United States [2]. Outpatient antibiotic prescribing , in particular, has b een demonstrated to be directly associated with antimicrobial resistance [3]. Antimicrobial stewardship efforts have been demonstrated antimicrobial prescribing, microbial resistance, and costs. Antimicrobial stewardship has become a current standard of care in medical practice and interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing are supported by the California Medical Foundation, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [4]. Unf ortunately, outpatient antimicrobial stewardship is neither uniform nor widely adopted across LAC. The CDC Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship note four key areas of stewardship: commitment, action for policy and practice, tracking and repo rting, and education and expertise [5]. A review of the literature demonstrated that individual interventions targeting these four areas had varying degrees of effectiveness; however, no outpatient antimicrobial stewardship program meeting all Core Elements has been assessed for effectiveness no r implementation characteristics studied [6] . The objective of Targeting Appropriate Prescribing in Outpatient settings (TAP OUT) is to assist outpatient clinics to implement an antimicrobial stewardship program. The outcome of interest is inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute upper respiratory infections (URI). METHODS LAC DPH recruited 20 primary care and 3 urgent care clinics, representing 208 providers , to participate in the TAP OUT project. The clinics are all part of the same medical network. LAC DPH staff partnered with the clinics' stewardship team, which included the medical director, infection preventionist, and two physician stewardship champions, to develop an antimicrobial stewardship program that met all the CDC Core Elements of Outp atient Stewardship. The stewardship program implemented includes public commitment, communication skills training, clinical treatment education, and prescribing audits. LAC DPH and the clinic stewardship team adapted evidence -based strategies to meet the n eeds and preferences of the clinic providers and patients. To measure the effectiveness of the program, patient encounter data were analyzed for changes in inappropriate antibiotic presc ribing for URI between the 2016 -17 and 2017 - 18 influenza seasons. Inap propriate antibiotic prescribing was defined using California Medical Outpatient Stewardship to Improve A ntibiotic Prescribing Practices Page 16 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Association Foundation Alliance Working for Antibiotic Resistance Education1 guidelines. The definition of URI was based on analysis of International Classification of Diseases2 Tenth Edition encounter codes. Patient s currently on immunomodulatory therapy were excluded from the analysis. To evaluate implementation process characteristics, a key inf ormant interview was conducted. RESULTS A total of 20 primary care and 3 urgent care clinics, representing 208 providers, participated in TAP OUT (see Methods) . The baseline estimated inappropriate antibiotic prescribing rate for URI was 15.5% amongst all prescribers (range: 0-100%). During the intervention period, the estimated inappropriate prescribing rate decreased to 7.6% (51% reduction, p<0.0001) . Monthly rates during both period s are described in Figure 1 . Several key implementation elements of implementation were identified, such as leadership buy -in and on-site peer champions. Visible and recurring prescribing reminders were useful. To improve adoption, the ASP was integrated into existing workflow. Costs were limited and related to information technology resources to analyze prescribing data and create feedback reports. DISCUSSION The TAP OUT antimicrobial stewardship program was shown to successfully decrease inappropriat e antibiotic prescribing for acute upper respiratory infection diagnoses. The program compiled low -cost, highly effective interventions into a program that met all CDC Core Elements of Outpatient Stewardship. Further, the program focused on interventions a imed at altering prescriber behavior, rather than patient 1 Physicians for a Healthy California (PHC).

Interventions targeting prescribing behavior change of healthcare providers have been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing overall and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing [7] . This project adds to the scant literature on how antibiotic stewardship programs can be implemented in outpatient settings. When planning and implementing the stewardship program, many barriers were identified to changing healthcare providers' prescribing behaviors. Concerns regarding patient satisfaction and competing priorities were discussed with the clinics' medical director. In addition, obtaining patient encounter data to measure the effectiveness of the program involved lengthy discussions with the clinic information technology staff. However, buy -in from clinic champions was key in deciding which stewardship strategies would work in their unique setting. The clinics were motivated to lower their antibiotic prescribing rate for URI as it is tied to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement. There are some limitations of the project. First, all sites were part of the same medical network; thus, certain implementation results may not be generalizable to the general primary and urgent care population. Second , because each patient visit was de -identified, we could not link patient visits to understand the full medical history . It is possible that subsequent visits indica te a bacterial etiology, but this would not have been able to be assessed through a single visit record. Lastly, results were dependent on electronic health record and billing data, which are imperfect for performance measurement, though have demonstrated validity [8]. Having demonstrated effective implementation of the stewardship program , LAC DPH will disseminate best practices to outpatient providers county -wide. We hope to study the effects of the stewardship program on other infection types, including urinary tract infections. REFERENCES 1. Fleming -Dutra KE, Hersh AL, Shapiro DJ, et al.

SNF Symposium Page 19 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report 2017 SYMPOSIUM ON INFECT ION PREVENTION CONTR OL IN SKILLED NURSING FACI LITIES OVERVIEW On September 28, 2017 , the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) Acute Communicable Disease Control (ACDC) program held a symposium for key county skilled nursing facility (SNF) staff responsible for infectious disease outbreak prevention and control . This is the second annual SNF symposium ACDC has held. For information on the first symposium, see ACDC's 2016 Special Report .1 Presentations and related materials for both the 2016 and 2017 symposiums are archived on the ACDC SNF webpage .2 During the 2017 symposium, r epresentatives from local SNFs included directors of nursing, administrators, and infection preventionists . Due to the large number of SNFs in LAC , over 315, attendance was limited to two representatives per facility. The goals of the symposium were to improve partnerships between SNFs and LAC DPH as well as to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases in SNF setting s. The symposium also strived to implement antimicrobial stewardship programs and better management resistant organisms ( MDROs ) in SNFs . Other topics covered include d: immunization recommendations for healthcare personnel and residents, reporting requirements for Carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and how to protect employees from blood -borne pathogens and aerosol transmissible diseases. SUMMARY A total of 108 attendees from 65 local SNFs attended the day -long event. In addition, the event included 23 attendees from ACDC, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Ep idemiology ( APIC ) Greater LA Chapter, representatives from several nursing home consulting compan ies, nursing home corporate consultants , laboratory serving SNFs , and partnering agencies . The topics for the 2017 symposium focused primarily on the preventi on and control of infectious diseases that are common in SNF settings and greatly impact the vulnerable population cared for in these settings. The presenters were representatives from ACDC , LAC DPH's Vaccine Preventable Disease Control (VPDC) Program, guest speakers from UCLA, and other organizations .

ACDC plans to hold another symposium in 201 8 as these trainings have become an annual event. SNF Symposium Page 22 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 23 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report OUTBREAK OF EPIDEMIC KERATOCONJUNCTIVITI S CAUSED BY HUMAN ADENOVIRUS TYPE D53 IN AN OPTOMETRY CLINIC , 2017 BACKGROUND On June 22, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) was notified by a medical epidemiologist at Hospital X of seven patients seen at an optometry clinic (Clinic A) on June 8, 2017 who later developed symptoms of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC ).1 This report prompted a cluster investigation by ACDC . EKC is caused by adenovirus .2 It is a contagious , severe form of conjunctivitis that can cause pain and blurry vision for up to four weeks [1]. EKC associated with adenovirus is a frequent cause of outbreaks in eye care settings. Adenovirus is concerning as a healthcare -associated infection due to its high transmission rate, significant ocular morbidity, and hardiness in healthcare environments [2]. Prior outbreaks have been associated with breakdowns in infection prevention practice, including eye drop administration, glove use, and instrument disinfec tion [3]. This report describes ACDC's outbreak investigation and the measures taken to prevent future infections and enhance patient safety. METHODS For this investigation, a case was defined as an individual who had symptom onset between June 5 -July 3, 2017, and had either : 1) a diagnosis by an ophthalmologist or optometrist of EKC, adenoviral conjunctivit is, or viral conjunctivitis; or 2) laboratory confirmation of adenovirus from a specimen collected by conjunctival swab . A healthcare -linked case was defined as a person with a diagnosis or laboratory confirmation (as described in 1 and 2 above) who had visited the optometry clinic (Clinic A) between June 5-July 3, 2017 and had symptom onset within 21 days of that visit. A household case was defi ned as a household and/or family contact of another case , with a diagnosis or laboratory confirmation (as described in 1 and 2 above) and did not visit the clinic prior to symptom onset. Case finding was conducted by phone and medical record review. Medical records from Clinic A were surveyed for all patients with an EKC diagnosis between June 7 -July 3 . To better understand if healthcare - linked transmission possibly occurred during the period when symptomatic EKC case patients presented at the clinic , all p atients who visited the clinic during June 7-21 were called and asked if they were 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis 2 https://www.cdc.gov/adenovirus/index.html Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 24 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report experiencing symptoms of EKC . Case characteristics and exposures were ascertained during medical record review. On June 23rd, ACDC conducted an announced site visit to walk through the premises, observe infection prevention practices, interview staff members, and review infection prevention policies. Cell culture isolates or conjunctival swab specimens from case patients were sent to the LAC DPH Public Health Laboratory (PHL) for conventional and shell vial culture and detection by fluorescent monoclonal antibody stain ing. Specimens from additional case patients were tested by viral culture at the laboratory of H ospital X. Specimens were then subm itted to the California Department of Public Health Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory (CDPH -VRDL) by P HL for adenovirus detection and molecular typing by sequence analysis of the hypervariable region of the adenovirus hexon gene and the adenovirus group - specific region of the fiber gene [4, 5]. RESULTS Medical record review identified 17 cases. Among 805 patients contacted by phone, none reported EKC symptoms . Fourteen patients met the case definition of a healthcare -linked case , and one patient appeared to be the source of introduction into the clinic (hereafter called the primary case ). Two additional cases met the household case definition \u2014both reported a symptomatic spouse prior to their illness . The median patient age of cases was 62 years ( range: 43 -78 years), and 12 cases (70.6%) were women. No hospitalizations resulted from infection, though seven cases (41.2%) had more than one symptomatic visit to the clinic, a hospital emergency department, or an urgent care center. Cases presented with symptoms consistent with EKC, including redness ( 14, 82.3%) and discharge (13, 76.5 %). The mean incubation period was 9 days (range: 5 -19 days). Review of healthcare -linked case -patient clinic visit dates prior to symptom onset revealed two apparent clusters. The primary case visited the clinic on June 7 th with symptoms consistent with EKC , before the initial visits of seven additional case -patients on June 7th and June 8th. On June 20th, one of the case - patient s from the first cluster visited the clinic with EKC symptoms. Another seven case -patients visited the clinic after this case -patient on June 20th and June 21st, prior to the onset of their EKC symptoms (Figure 1). Medical chart review indicated common exposures among the 14 healthcare -linked case -patients \u2014all were seen by the same optometrist in the same exam room following the primary case . No healthcare personnel reported EKC symptoms before or during the outbreak period. Among the 14 healthcare -linked case -patients, o ther exposures include d slit lamp contact (13, 92.3%), tonometry (12, 85.7%), and multi - dose dilating eye drops (10, 66.7%). Use of multi -dose sodium fluorescein eye drops was noted for 6 (86% ) cases in the first cluster and none in the second cluster. During the primary case's initial clinic visit on June 7th, the primary case received sodium fluorescein drops from a multi- use vial and had a slit lamp examination; the slit lamp is connected to the tonometer. Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 25 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report The clinic closed on June 22nd for intensive environmental cleaning of clinic surfaces and equipment , instrument cleaning and disinfection, and providing staff training on infection prevention. The clinic reopened the following day. Several observations were made during the site visit to the clinic. Optometry Clinic A is part of H ospital X's medical network. Staff who provide care at the clinic include three optometrists, one ophthalmologist, and three optometric assistants. The clinic has three exam rooms and averages 1,300 patients per month. Clinic patients begin in the waiting area, then proceed to one of three exam rooms , each with its own slit lamp with tonometer. Site visit observations and staff interviews indicated gaps in infection prevention practices including: using multi -dose eye drops on multiple patients ; occasionally touching the eye or surrounding area; and reprocessing tonometers with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe rather than the recommended 5 -10-minute disinfecting soak with chlorine or ethyl alcohol [2].

Cases of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis by Date of Symptom Onset Optometry Clinic, LAC, June 3 -July 6, 2017 (N=17) Number of Cases Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 26 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Conjunctival swab specimens from four case patients , all symptomatic with conjunctivitis, were sent to the PHL culture \u2014adenovirus was detected in two . Specimens from an additional 11 case -patients were tested at the laboratory of Hospital X , and adenovirus was identified in 6 by viral culture. Of the eight case -patients positive upon culture , specimens were then submitted for human adenovirus (HAdV ) detection and molecular typing\u2014 all 8 HAdV from one patient sample , which was nearly identical to a recently reported WGS of HAdV -D53 from Japan (GenBank sequence LC215428 ). DISCUSSION This report describes an investigation of a cluster of 17 patients in a n optometry center infected with EKC. All cases had either visited the optometry clinic or were household contacts of clinic patients . In conjunction with ACDC's infection prevention assessment s, analysis of the molecular testing for adenovirus indicate that a common source likely served as the mode o f transmission between patients. HAdV -D53 has been recognized as an agent of EKC outbreaks in Japan since 1980 [6, 7, 8] and in Germany since 2005 [9] . However , HAdV -D53 has not previously been reported to the United States National Adenovirus Type Reportin g System and, to our knowledge, this is the first reported EKC outbreak associated with HAdV -D53 in the United States . We asked the index case about travel only. No travel was reported. As the first documented EKC outbreak associated with HAdV -D53 in the United States , this outbreak highlights the need for rigorous implementation of recommended infection prevention practices in eye care settings. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that the virus was introduced to surfaces in the exam room by a sympt omatic patient , and subsequent lapses in infection prevention practice s led to transmission. Prior studies have demonstrated that adenovirus es may persist on environmental surfaces for several weeks [10]. Previous EKC outbreaks in eye care clinics have bee n linked to improper disinfection practices and lapses in hygienic protocols [3] . Observations found deficiencies in tonometer disinfection and multi- use eye drop administration. Enhanced infection prevention practices, including staff education on eye dro p administration and longer slit lamp and tonometer disinfection times were implemented. No further cases were reported after July 3, 2017. To prevent EKC transmission in e ye care settings, recommended practices include the use of disposable tonometer tips, disinfectants efficacious against adenoviruses for tonometers and slit lamp s, and single - use eye drops when available [2,11] . Adherence to r ecommended infection prevention practices is critical to avoid EKC and other healthcare -associated infections. LAC DPH plans to outreach to the optometry and ophthalmology provider community to educate regarding infection prevention. REFERENCES 1. Lu X, Joshi A, Flomenb erg P. Adenoviruses.

Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 28 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Hip and Knee Replacement Post -Operative Page 29 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report INVESTIGATION OF SUR GICA L SITE INFECTIONS IN ORTHOPEDIC HIP AND KNEE REPLACE MENT POST -OPERATIVE AT AN ACUTE CARE HOS PITAL SETTING BACKGROUND Surgical site infections ( SSIs) following orthopedic procedures, including joint repla cement , are significantly rare since evidence -based infection prevention practices related to skin preparation, surgical technique , and prophylaxis of antibiotics are currently the standard of care in orthopedic surgery . In the most recent Nation al Healthcare Safety Network1 report which included data from 2006 to 2008, reported knee replacement posto perative infection rates ranged from 0.68% to 1.60% and hip replacement infection rates ranged from 0.67% to 2.4% [1]. While these infections are extremely uncommon , the ir impact can be significant. SSIs related to orthopedic surgical procedures are associated with increased healthcare costs, morbidity , and even mortality. Moreover, orthopedic SSIs can significantly impact a patient 's quality of life including requiring a prolonged hospital stay and lead ing to physical limitations. On December 15, 2016, a local hospital's infection preventionist (IP) notified the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) Morbidity Unit of a cluster of six cases of SSIs at an acute care hospital (Hospital A) occurring after orthopedic surgeries (knee and hip) from Octobe r to November 2016. The LAC DPH 's Acute Communicable Disease Control Program (ACDC) reviewed the case information . Of the six SSIs, three resulted from knee surgeries and three from hip surgeries. T wo of the six SSIs were classified as deep incisional and four were prosthetic joint infections . Onset of symptoms occurred between 24 to 41 days post -surgery. Cultures from wound sites grew different organisms for each patient . Subsequently, additional cases were reported to ACDC by the hospital's IP. METHODS Case Finding and Definition For this investigation, a case was defined as a patient with an SSI following orthopedic surgery of knee or hip replacement at Hospital A from Octo ber 2016 through January 2017. ACDC reviewed patient medical records , including o perating room (OR) records , as well as patient 's laboratory and microbiology reports. In addition, the IP was instructed to call patients who had ortho pedic surgery of the hip or knee within the time- period to inquire if they had experienced any signs and symptoms of in fection or complications at their surgical site . Investigation and Assessment of Risk Factors : Site Visits Over the course of six months f rom February through June 2017 , ACDC partnered with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Licensing and Certification program to conduct eight unannounced site visits at Hospital A . The site visits consisted of observations in the OR, OR storage area, and the central processing decontamination ( CPD) room . During the visits, several significant lapses in infection control practices were noted and recommendations for control measures were provided. 1 https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Hip and Knee Replacement Post -Operative Page 30 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Case Control Study A 1-to-3 matched case control study was conducted assessing a total of 8 cases and 24 controls . Cases were matched to controls by ag e and surgical site (hip or knee). Medical records were reviewed, including: preoperative history , nursing perioperative notes, the anesthesia report, operative notes, laboratory records , and discharge notes. Standardized c hart abstractions were performed for all cases and controls . RESULTS Case Characterization A total of eight patients met the case definition. Initially, there was a cluster of six cases of SSIs post - orthopedic surgery of knee and hip replacement that occurred between October 20, 2016 th rough November 23, 2016 based on the surgery date . During this time -period, the attack rate was up to 4.4%. Two additional cases occurred after procedures on January 10, 2017 and January 30, 2017. Of the eight case patients , the average age was 68 years old (range : 54 to 86 years old ); seven had multiple comorbidities, including history of osteoarthritis, hypertension , hyperlipidemia, diabetes , and obesity ; five case patients had a BMI above 30. The case patients had an average American Society of Anesthesiologists score2 of 3.1. The overall attack rate for this outbreak was 3.4% for the eight cases . Of the eight SSIs, five were knee surg eries and three were hip surgeries . Cultures from wound sites grew different organisms for each patient, including methicillin -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermi The r eview of cases did not identify a single surgeon or staff member common to all cases. There was no single common skin preparation solution or irrigation solution identified. Case Finding All p atients who underwent orthopedic surgery between October 2016 through January 2017 were either followed up at their post -operative appointment or contacted by the pre -operative staff to identify if they manifested signs and symptoms of infection at their s urgical site. There were 181 patients with hip and knee surgeries between October to December 2016 who were followed up through post -op appointments or phone calls. From January to March 2017, 179 patients with hip and knee surgeries followed up through post-op appointments or phone calls. No additional cases were identified from the follow up post -op appointment or phone calls. Background Surveillance Rate In 2016, there were 2 ,073 surger ies performed at H ospital A and the total number of SSIs w as 18 with an annual SSI rate of 0.86% (0.0086). There were 640 hip and knee orthopedic surgeries performed in 2016 with nine SSIs of knee and hip replacement an annual rate of 1.41% (0.0141). According to t he National Healthcare Safety Network report with data from 2006 to 2008, knee replacement postoperative infection 2 http://www.anzjsurg.com/view/0/ASAscore.html Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Hip and Knee Replacement Post -Operative Page 31 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report rates range from 0.68% to 1.60% and hip replacement infection rates from 0.67% to 2.4%. During the peak of this investigation, there were six cases with in 34 days (October 20, 2016 through Nov emb er 23, 2016), with an attack rate of 4.4% and a total attack rate of 3.4 % from October 2016 through January 2017 (Figure 1). Case Control Study To identify possible risk factors associated with infection , ACDC conducted a case control study. A total of 24 controls were selected from patients who had undergone hip or knee arthroplasty during the outbreak period. A comprehensive medical record revie w was performed using a standardized chart abstraction tool, which included information on the patient's demographics, hospitali zation, and surgical procedure. The study found that patient demographics were similar between cases and controls . Cases and controls did not differ significantly with respect to American Society of Anesthesiologists score, length of hospitalization, day of week on which procedure was performed, anatomical site of procedure, or whether a tourniquet was placed. No s ignificant commonalities among cases versus controls were found with respect to surgeon, other staff, instruments used , or prosthetics used . Overall, we were unable to identify significant patient risk factors from the case control study. Scientific literature suggested that the utiliza tion of immediate -use steam sterilization during a procedure may play a role in surgical site infections [2]. However, we were unable to inspect the role of immediate -use steam sterilization in this outbreak due to incomplete logs and printouts. Figure 1. Surgical Site Infections among Post -Orthopedic Surgery Patients Hospital A, 2016 -2017 Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Hip and Knee Replacement Post -Operative Page 32 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Final Recommendations In addition to interim recommendations provided throughout this investigation, ACDC issued the following final recommendations to prevent or limit future infections: Ensure the early identification of new SSIs associated with hip and knee replacements through surveillance with immediate reporting of new cases to ACDC. Update policies and procedures in CPD and OR on an annual basis. Ensure the comprehensive documentation of immedi ate-use steam sterilization in the OR logs. Continue to monitor adherence to the policies and procedures in the CPD and ensure the y are being followed by CPD staff. DISCUSSION AND CONCL USIONS ACDC investigated e ight cases of SSIs from multiple organisms f ollowing associated orthopedic (knee and hip replacement) surgeries . Cases were identified among patients during October 2 016 through January 2017. The overall attack rate for this out break was 3.4% during this time -period. Despite multiple site visits by ACDC and CDPH Licensing and Certification as well as an outside consultant, we continued to observe lapses in infection control practices among the staff who worked in the CPD and OR core area. Following our recommendation s, the facility improved competenc ies among their CPD staff by providing trainings on cleaning and sterilizing of the surgical instruments and documented the staff training. The overall cleanliness of the CPD and OR core area improved throughout the investigation and infection control prac tices also improved among the associated staff. Based on our investigation, we hypothesized that multiple factors may have contributed to the outbreak of SSIs among the orthopedic patients, including improper cleaning and sterilization of the surgical instruments in the CPD and OR core area, use of imme diate -use steam sterilization during procedures, staffing changes in CPD, and an increase in census of orthopedic surgeries. A case control study was conducted, but no signi ficant risk factors were identified. During the outbreak investigation, the facility's i nfection control staff, hospital administration, OR and CPD staff all contributed to the overall improvement of the conditions and infection control practices to reduce SSIs in the facility. The IP continued to be in contact with ACDC until December 1, 2017, to provide status on any new possible cases. No addition al associated positive cultures reported since March 22, 2017.

Th is outbreak occurred in the context of several other large outbreaks in California1 and nationally .2 The largest hepatitis A outbreak in California occurred in San Diego County, where the outbreak began in March of 2017 and resulted in 582 confirmed cases by the time the local health emergency ended in January 2018 and mostly involved persons experiencing homelessness or IDU. Given the proximity to San Diego County and the extensive travel between LA C and San Diego, the LA C Department of Public Health (DPH) closely monitored for potential HAV introduction and spread in LA C. In July 2017, hepatitis A illness was identified in two homeless persons in LAC who had lived in San Diego at the time of acquiring the virus. A health advisory was released to inform healthcare professionals. 3 In September 2017 , HAV also was identified in two LA C residents experiencing homelessness who did not have any links to an outbreak -associated region . Because this possibly indicated local HAV transmission LAC DPH declared a local outbreak of hepatitis A and a health alert was issued.4 Subsequently, LAC DPH held a webinar5 in Nov ember and issued a health alert update in March 2018.6 The Incident Command System ( ICS) was activated to coordinate the LAC DPH hepatitis A outbreak response. The ICS leadership identified 4 strategies for controlling the outbreak: 1. Enhancing surveillance and case containment 2. Increasing vaccination 3. Improving sanitation 4. Educating community and stakeholders The primary objective of this report is to describe the epidemiology of the hepatitis A outbreak cases identified through enhanced surveillance in LAC in 2017. Secondarily, the re port will briefly summarize results of the activities to increase vaccination , sanitation, and education. METHODS Enhanced Surveillance The Acute Communicable Disease Control Program of LAC DPH initiated enhanced surveillance to identify acute HAV cases among the homeless and drug using populations from Ju ne through December 2017. 1 https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Hepatitis -A-Outbreak.aspx 6 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eprp/Health%20Alerts/HAV%20outbreak%20update%203.15.18%20final.pdf Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 36 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Case Definition s Minimal Criteria : Confirmed acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection meets the Counsel of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definitions for an acute case of hepatitis A :7 (1) discrete onset of any sign or symptom consistent with acute viral hepatitis (fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) , and (2) jaundice and/or elevated serum amin otransferase levels, and (3) immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti- HAV) positive. Confirmed Outbreak Case : A person who meets the CSTE clinical case definition and is laboratory confirmed, OR, a case that meets the clinical case definition and occurs in a person who has an epidemiologic link with a person who has laboratory -confirmed hepatitis A. Cases were either identified as homeless, homeless and using illicit drugs, men who have sex with men (MSM) and using illicit drugs, using illicit drugs or homeless secondary cases. Cases were counted if they were exposed in another county but had onset in LAC. Case Identification The California Code of Regulations (Title 17, Section 2500) requires healthcare providers to report acute hepatitis A cases within one working day of identification .8 In addition, most LAC clinical laboratories automatically report positive hepatitis A IgM antibody tests via the electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) system. In response to the outbreak , providers were requested to immediately report suspected/confirmed hepatitis A in a pers on experiencing homeless to facilitate: - timely interview by LAC DPH staff before cases are discharged to the street and potentially lost to follow -up, - identification of contacts who could benefit from preventive therapy, and - case placement in a recuperativ e care facility during the infectious period to prevent further disease transmission. Case Investigation A supplemental form was created for interviewing persons experiencing homelessness or using illicit drugs. It was expected that data from the suppleme ntal forms could guide the ICS leadership response to the outbreak by better defining the epidemiology of outbreak -associated cases and characterizing risk factors for disease. Laboratory Testing Clinical laboratorie s were contacted to determine if serum samples were available for all confirmed cases identified as homeless and/or using illicit drugs. If available, specimens were submitted to the LAC Public Health Laboratory (PHL ) for shipment to the California Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory ( VRDL ) for confirmation 7 https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis -a-acute/case -definition/2012/ 8 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/ReportableDiseaseListSept2018.pdf Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 37 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Vaccination Outreach Increasing the proportion of the at -risk population immune to hepatitis A through vaccination was identified as the best tool for preventing hepatitis A illness and decreasing HAV transmission. Vaccinations were included as a service provided by LAC DPH supported street outreach teams targeting homeless persons. Vaccination was also promoted to persons who had close frequent contact with homeless people including first responders, persons who serve food to the homeless, and sanitation personnel. The LAC jail systems offered vaccine to new inmates . LAC DPH community c linics offered vaccines at no charge to those at risk. Health insurance plans and community providers were engaged in the campaign, with the larger health plans offering h epatitis A vaccine to at -risk members at no c harge through walk -in clinics. Vaccines were also distributed by LAC DPH to community providers that serve at-risk populations. Hygiene and Sanitation Outreach LAC includes 88 cities as well as large unincorporated areas. LAC DPH coordinated with all cities and other county departments such as the Departments of Public Works, Parks and Recreation , and the Sheriff to improve sanitation conditions for per sons experiencing homelessness. Many homeless persons in LAC have created makeshift structures and dwellings which serve as their homes, often creating these in clusters in a small area which is then recognized as a homeless encampment. Due to poor access to h ygiene facilities, living in a homeless encampment can serve as a major risk factor to acquire and transmit HAV . LAC DPH, in partnership with Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority ( LAHSA) and Department of Public Works, conducted surveys of homeless enca mpments throughout LAC to assess where additional toilets, showers, and hand washing facilities were most needed, and developed plans with cities to increase toilet, shower and hand washing facilities in these areas. In close partnership with the LAHSA, LAC DPH Environmental Health (EH) , inspected and provided educational materials to homeless shelters across LAC. The educational materials provided guidance on the proper cleaning of facilities and laundering of bedding to protect homeless residents from ac quiring and transmitting HAV . A toolkit was developed with template resources and policies for staff at homeless shelters to support their efforts to improve sanitation conditions in their shelters. Additionally, teleconference calls were held to address r eal life questions and co ncerns among shelter providers. Finally, since transmission of HAV among food handlers is of heightened concern, there was a concerted effort to assure that restaurants across LAC were aware of the outbreak and taking measures to reduce the risk of transmission among their workers . Educational Outreach The educational outreach efforts aimed to educate key community groups and stakeholders as quickly as possible. The outreaches consisted of holding in -person group meetings, sending informational letters, stakeholder targeted teleconferences, and targeted education of healthcare professionals. A major public awareness campaign was launched, including strategic engagement with the media to support broad dissemi nation of information, and print media advertisement throughout various public transportation Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 38 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report bus and rail lines to promote awareness, hand -washing and vaccination. The countywide 211 information line staff were trained, and the 211 -line was used as a prim ary source for answering questions from the public . The engagement with media included various press briefings, teleconferences, and press releases. Educational materials targeting specific at -risk populations were prepared in English, Spanish, and other threshold languages. Examples of health education materials developed include those targeting first responders, employees with direct contact with homeless people, food handlers, and men who have sex with men. Our educational outreach materials were posted on our webpages .9 RESULTS Epidemiology of Outbreak Cases From May 1 to December 31, 2017, 17 total outbreak cases were identified that met the confirmed case definition ( Table 1). The first identified outbreak -associated case had symptom onset during the week of May 28 and the last case had symptom onset during the week of December 17. Of the 17 outbreak - associated cases that developed symptoms while in LA C, 13 were LA C residents with three being secondary cases identified as part of outbreak at a mental health hospital (Table 1 ). Three IDU cases also identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). The median age of all cases was 36 years ( minimum - maximum : 24-64 years ); 15 (88% ) were male; 14 (82%) cases were white (Table 2 ). Most cases were from SPA 4 (n= 7, 41%) and SPA 7 (n =5, 29%) , 11 (65%) cases were hospitalized , and there were no deaths. Table 1.

Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 40 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Vaccination Outreach LAC DPH conducted 486 vaccination outreaches, including 297 that targeted homeless populations, 28 at substance use treatment centers, 82 for first responders, and 14 at the jails. A total of 33,866 hepatitis A vaccine doses were either administered by LAC DPH (12,393 doses) or distributed to community partners (14,800 doses) to administer to at -risk persons. During the outbreak response, hepatitis A doses were administered for 7,395 for homeless persons, 777 for persons at substance use treatment centers, 10,964 for jail inmates and parolees, and 6,160 for first responders. Hygiene and Sanitation Outreach As part of the outbreak response, EH distributed hepatitis A educational flyer s to over 37,000 food facilities . All homeless shelters are regularly inspected through the EH Housing and Institutions Program. A total of 52 homeless shelters were inspected during the outbreak and provided with information on hepatitis A including the importance of proper hand washing by food handlers. Education Outreach Immediately after declaring a local outbreak, LAC DPH engaged 17 distinct stakeholder groups, including city leaders, homeless service providers, healthcare providers, substance user disorder treatment providers, firs t responders including police and fire agencies, veteran's affairs agencies, schools and colleges, mental health service providers, and LGBTQ providers. Over 100,000 individual stakeholders received letters and educational information and were invited to p articipate in targeted teleconference calls. Additionally, over the course of the next 4 months, over 500 in -person educational training outreach sessions were conducted at various community settings, including with homeless service providers, substance us e disorder providers, jails, and first responder agencies. Within the first two weeks of the response efforts, there were over 80 news print articles and 14 televised segments covering the Hepatitis A outbreak and response efforts in LAC . DISCUSSION The number of hepatitis A cases in persons experiencing homeless or using illicit drugs in LAC was substantially lower than the number of cases observed in San Diego. It is unclear why the hepatitis A outbreak remained contained in LAC , despite having a la rger population of persons experiencing homelessness and a lower number of vaccines distributed compared with San Diego. One possible reason for the successful containment of the outbreak in LAC could be the activation of ICS early in the outbreak. The ICS structure facilitated improved coordination of the outbreak response across all relevant LAC DPH Programs , and it assisted with recruiting and targeting additional resources towards t he outbreak control activities. According to CDC, the incidence of hepa titis A among adults in the United States has increased since 2014. Paradoxically, the increased hepatitis A incidence might be a consequence of the US childhood vaccination policy. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , the per centage of U.S. adults immune to hepatitis A infection has declined from 1999 -2006 to 2009 -2012. Prior to the licensure of the hepatitis A vaccine in 1995, there were regular large hepatitis A outbreaks that resulted in immunity among exposed adults. Those outbreaks ceased with universal vaccination of children for hepatitis A. As Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 41 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report a result, there is now a large population of adults who are not immune to hepatitis A because they were too old to benefit from the changes in childhood hepatitis A vaccine policy , but they are not old enough to have been exposed to the historic hepatitis A epidemics. The growing population of adults not immune to hepatitis A represents a population susceptible t o future hepatitis A outbreaks. Although the hepatitis A outbreak of 2017 appears to have ended, the conditions that predisposed the outbreak persist in LAC, such as the large population of persons experiencing homelessness who are not immune to hepatitis A and who do not have access adequate hygiene and sanitation services. Therefore, LAC DPH will remain vigilan t for acute HAV cases and respond immediately to control potential outbreaks . Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 42 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 43 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report NOROVIRUS SUSPECT FOODBORNE OUTBREAK AT A LOS ANGELES COU NTY RESTAURANT BACKGROUND On December 18, 2017 the Los Angeles County D epartment of Public Health (LAC DPH) received a Foodborne Illness Report (FBIR )1 from the Corporate Wellness Coordinator of a fast food chain restaurant. One of their restaurants, restaurant A (RA), identified gastrointestinal illness in 11 employees. Most of the cases occurred during the week of December 10, 2017 with symptoms including diarrhea, weakness, vomiting , and body aches. Between December 13th to December 21st, LAC DPH received 1 2 more FBIRs describin g 17 additional persons with similar gastrointestinal illness . Three ill employees of R A were also employees of a neighboring restaurant, r estaurant B (RB). The LAC DPH Acute Communicable Disease Control program (ACDC) launched an investigation to explore the scope of the outbreak, identify possible risk factors, and determine the necessary procedures to prevent further spread of illness. METHODS ACDC coordinated the investigation of illness at both restau rants . First, ACDC partnered with the Corporate Wellness Coordinator for RA to assemble a line list for all employees. ACDC then gathered information on menu items offered for consumption at RA and developed three types of questionnaires. The first was a s tandard questionnaire for patrons of RA to gather information on date and foods consumed at RA, plus symptom type, onset , and illness histories. These interviews were conducted by telephone and the contact information (for both cases and controls) was obtained from the multiple FBIRs submitted to ACDC . The second standard questionnaire was drafted for employees of RA to gather information on job duties, foods consumed during a typical work s hift, symptom type, onset, and illness histories. These interviews were also conducted by telephone. The third standardized questionnaire was drafted for employees of RB to gather job duty, food and symptom histories . These questionnaires were emailed to t he RB manager for distribution to all employees of that restaurant. In addition, ACDC staff conducted a site visit and dropped off stool collection kits to staff of RA. The LAC DPH Environmenta l Health Services (EHS) 2 Wholesale Food and Safety (WFS) conducted a n inspection of RA to observe food handling, cooking, and cleanliness practices . WFS contacted RB to collect employee illness information considering that there were employees that worked in both places . Management from RA cooperated with the investigation, made employees available for interviews , and coordinated the distribution , pick -up, and recollection of stool kits from employees for delivery to Community Health Services (CHS) .3 Service Planning Area 4 served as the collection point for stool specimens collected from RA employees by RA management. These samples were then picked up by courier and delivered to the Public Health Laboratory ( PHL). The PHL tested all submitted http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/EH/SSE/FoodMilk/reportillness.htm 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eh/index.htm 3 http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/chs/index.htm Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 44 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report using a BioFire FilmArrayTM Gastrointestinal Panel and a norovirus reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).4 ACDC d efined a case as any individual who ate at RA anytime between December 10 -15, 2017 and: a) tested positive for norovirus , or b) was symptomatic with diarrhea and vomiting , or c ) was symptomatic with diarrhea or vomiting plus two of the following symptoms : nausea, fatigue, headache, body aches, chills, and fever . If cases reported an incubation time of less than 12 hours or greater than 48 hours , they were excluded from analyses , as this did not fit the known incubation period for norovirus . A control was defined as any asymptomatic individual who ate at RA between December 10 -15, 2017 and did not have a positive lab oratory result for norovirus . RESULTS RA is a fast food establishment that prepares fresh food orders for the public in an assembly line fashion with each grouping of ingredients, chosen by the patron, placed into the meal by separate line staff , and are not heated after preparation . Food can be eaten in the restaurant or taken to -go. There is one restroom in the restaurant for both employees and restaurant patrons to s hare. ACDC interviewed all 29 RA employees , and s tool was collected on 2 5 of the employees ( 86%). Three employees of RA also worked next door at RB. In view of this connection, the employees of RB were interviewed for illness history \u201416 of the 21 RB -only e mployees were interviewed (76%). All told, A CDC interviewed 61 persons , which included employees from R A and RB, as well as RA patrons. Of these 61 interviews, 23 (38%) met the case definition , and 11 were included as controls. The remaining 27 were excluded from the analysis because they did not meet the case definition. The dates of onset for the 23 people who met case definition ranged from December 12 -17, 2017 (Figure 1 ). 4 https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22766 Figure 1. Norovi rus Epidemic Curve at Restaurant A by Onset Date LAC, 2017 (n=20) Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 45 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Cases A total of 23 individuals met the case definition. This included 13 RA employees, 1 RB employee, and 9 RA patrons. Laboratory confirmation for norovirus was obtained for 16 of the 23 cases (69%). Of the 23 cases, 61% were female (Table 1 ). Case age s ranged from 14 to 48 years with a median of 2 3 years. Most c ases were between the ages of 20 to 49 years . The three most common s ymptoms were : nausea (87%), vomiting (78%), and fatigue (74%) . Only t wo cases had a f ever 102\u00b0 F ( 9%). The median incubation was 28 hours with a range of 12 to 48 hours . The median duration was 2 days with a range of 8 hours to 5 days (Table 2 ). Table 1. Case Demographics (N=23) Table 2.

Foods from RA were analyzed by arrangement (i.e. burrito, bowl, quesadilla, taco) as well as by individual ingredients available for inclusion into these arrangements. No food items were statistically associated with illness at the p 0.05 level . Inspection The EHS WFS inspection of RA revealed the following violations: 1) inadequate immersion times for sanitizing food use utensils , and 2) p otentially hazardous foods held at unapproved temperatures . All violations were addressed and corrected immediately by restaurant management during the inspection. Food items held at unapproved temperatures were disposed of at the time of inspection.

The PHL reported that all the confirmed norovirus samples from this outbreak belong to the same genotype, GII.P16 -GII.2. Norovirus is part of the family Caliciviridae. It is highly contagious and can transmit disease with as few as 18 viral particles [1]. Infected individuals can even shed the virus before they know they are ill [1]. Norovirus is most often transmitted via a fecal o ral route with illness onset 12 -48 hours after ingestion of contaminated food, direct person -to-person contact, or contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus can be spread to the environment via the stool or vomitus of infected people [1]. It is the most co mmonly Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 47 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report reported cause of gastrointestinal (GI) illness in the United States and worldwide [1]. Norovirus infections can occur year- round, but about half of all cases occur between December and February in the northern hemisphere [2]. CaliciNet, a database designed to collect surveillance data about this family of viruses, reported that California had the highest number of confirmed norovirus outbreaks (44) between the months of September 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017 [2]. Surveillance data collected by LAC DPH fo r non - foodborne GI illness in LAC showed that the month of December 2017 had the second highest occurrence of GI illness outbreaks in the community for the last six years (Figure 2). The method by which this outbreak spread is unclear. The most likely means of transmission is through a food item contaminated by an ill employee. This theory is supported by the finding that the first few persons to become symptomatic in this outbreak were food preparation employees for RA. Most RA employees reported eating at the restaurant during every shift. Another possibility is that this illness was passed from person to person as infected individuals could have touched potentially contaminated common surfaces while dining, working or living together, or sharing the same bathroom with infected individuals. This web of work, home, social, and public connections among RA and RB employees prevented ACDC from bei ng able to identify a definitive source of this outbreak. PREVENTION AND EDUCATION To prevent the spread of illness in their facility, RA management implemented an in -house norovirus protocol which, in part, included : disposing of all ready to eat foods in the kitchen, enacting employee hand washing monitoring every 30 minutes , providing employee education on the spread of norovirus , and implementing a complete disinfection of the kitchen. RA also i mmediately removed i ll employees Figure 2 . Number of Non -Food GI Outbreaks For the Month of December LAC, 2012 -2017 Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 48 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report from work with three days paid leave per policy and c alled all other employees due to arrive at work to check for symptoms of illness. ACDC provides education on norovirus during and/or after interviewing both patrons and employees. In additi on to the inspection, EHS WFS provides the restaurant with literature about norovirus and how to prevent its spread in a restaurant setting. LIMITATIONS One limitation of this investigation was that all the RA employees reported eating at the restaurant d uring every shift worked. With norovirus having an incubation range of 12-48 hours, it was difficult to know which meal likely exposed individuals to norovirus . Employees reported when they last worked prior to illness , and this was verified by the electronic time- keeping report provided by RA. Some cases could recall exactly what they ate. Others had a more general recall, such as being able to name the types of foods they might typi cally eat during the work week ; howev er, they were unable to specify which days specifi c food items were eaten . These limitations made it difficult to determine accurate incubation times as measured from specific meals consumed as well as the ability to ascertain which if any foods might be implicated in the outbreak . CONCLUSION This was an outbreak of n orovirus with no specific source identified . There have been no further complaints against RA at this specific location beyond December 29, 2017. ACDC , in conjunction with EHS WFS , will continue to monitor for future reports of illnesses. REFERENCES 1. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .

Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 49 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report FIRST PROBABLE LOCALLY -ACQUIRED CHAGAS DISEASE CASE LOS ANGELES COUNTY, 201 7 INTRODUCTION Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis ,1 is a parasitic infection that is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi found only in the Americas where approximately 8 million people are infected [1] . The estimated 300,000 infections in the United States (U S) are mainly attributed to residents who have migrated from Latin American countries [1-3]. Transmission is usually linked to poor housing conditions in which the insect vector , triatomine bugs ,2 thrives and is commo nly associated with rural areas of Latin America [1]. Less than 50 locally transmitted human infections have been documented in the US since the first case was identified in 1955 [4,5] . Of the two known locally transmitted cases in California, only one experienced acute disease. This case was a resident of Tuolumne County who was diagnosed with Chagas disease in 1982 [6-8]. The other case was an asymptomatic infection in a resident of Ventura County. This report describes the first documented case of acute Chagas disease with probable local transmission in Los Angeles County (LAC) . BACKGROUND Trypanosoma cruzi is transmitted to humans primarily through contact with the feces of infected blood - feeding triatomine bugs (family Reduviidae), also called \"kissing\" or \"conenose\" bugs. In California, the primary reservoir is the woodrat ( Neotoma sp ) 3 [9]. At least 23 additional species of mammalian wildlife also have been documented as animal reservoirs for the parasite in US [6]. Other modes of transmission include blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and v ertical (mother -to-child) transmission [1]. Chagas disease has an acute and chronic phase. Acute disease can be mild or asymptomatic and parasites may be found in the circulating blood. Symptoms may consist of fever, malaise, and swelling around the site where the parasite entered the skin or mucous membranes. The chronic phase of Chagas disease may also be asymptomatic, and during this time few or no parasites are found in the blood. An estimated 20 - 30% of chronic cases will develop debilitating or life -threatening dysfunction of the heart and/or digestive 1 https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/epi.html 2 https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/gen_info/vectors/index.html 3 https://www.britannica.com/animal/woodrat Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 50 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report tract. People who are immunosuppressed may experience reactivation of Chagas disease, with a corresponding resurgence of parasitemia [1]. CASE INVESTIGATION In September 2017, a patient with travel histo ry to a Latin American country approximately 18 months prior, was reported to the LAC Department of Public Health ( DPH) with a positive rapid diagnostic test for malaria. The patient was admitted to an acute care hospital with ongoing fever and rash. Blood smears did not detect malaria parasites but instead revealed T. cruzi parasites. Commercially available IgG antibody testing for T. cruzi also returned positive. Smear review and molecular testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed at the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed T. cruzi infection. Though only one of two serological tests at CDC routinely performed for confirmation were initially reactive, additional testing by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) later confirmed th e infection (Table 1 ). Table 1. Diagnostic Blood Tests of Chagas Case LAC, 2017 Date of Collection Type of Test Result of Test Laboratory 9/12/17 Parasite Blood Exam Detected Hospital 9/13/17 T. (IFA) Reactive (1:256) CDC The patient had no pertinent past medical history. Thirty -five days prior to admission he was treated with trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole for a lesion on his shoulder, diagnosed as cellulitis. Five days later he developed fever to 39.4 \u00b0C with an erythematous, non -pruritic rash over the trunk and limbs, headache, and a dry cough. He was seen by several physicians during multiple emergency room visits and was treated with antibiotics and steroids, including prednisone and hydroxychloroquine. Upon CDC confirmation of Chagas dise ase, the patient initiated benznidazole therapy that was provided as part of an expanded access investigational new drug (IND) protocol operated by the CDC. Results of PCR testing performed six weeks after completion of therapy were negative. Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 51 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report The patient was born and raised in southern California and had been residing in a rural area of western LAC for the past 17 years. The patient reported occasionally seeing triatomine bugs in his home in recent years . He also reported ticks on his pet dogs and a neighb or who kept sheep. He described a current rat infestation in his home and had been handling dead rodents to dispose of them after trapping. The patient also previously lived in other domestic and international locations where Chagas disease is not endemic. Approximately 20 to 25 years prior, he took frequent short trips to Baja California, Mexico. Earlier in 2017, he traveled to other parts of California, but reported staying in well- built structures and denied insect exposures. His most recent foreign travel occurred 18 months prior to admission. On this trip, he visited a Latin American country in which Chagas disease is endemic, but stayed in an enclosed, air- conditioned dwelling with doors and screens. He denied insect bites or exposures there and was well between the time of his return and the presenting illness. The LAC DPH and California Dep artment of Public Health (CDPH) conducted an environmental investigation at the patient's residence and surrounding areas. Inspection of the property revealed evidence of rodents inside the home (i.e., droppings) and openings on the exterior that were large enough to allow rodent entry into the walls of the house. Rockwork around the house and climbing ivy provided attractive harborage for triatomines. An attempt to collect triatomine bugs in late September was unsuccessful. However, CDPH i nvestigators were able to trap five rodents in late October: two Peromyscus boylii (brush mice) and three Neotoma macrotis (wood rats). Rodent blood and tissue specimens that were sent to the University of Georgia for analysis did not yield positive results for T. cruzi infection. DISCUSSION This is the first confirmed case of Chagas disease documented in LAC that was acquired via probable local vector transmission. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive blood smear and PCR indicative of acute infection with T. cruzi and supported by an appropriate clinical presentation. The rural environmental setting of the patient's home residence, where triatomine bugs are common, in addition to the patient's recollection of triatomine bugs inside his home, support the plausibility o f vector -borne transmission. Environmental studies have shown that up to 36% of Triatoma protracta, California's most widespread and common triatomine bug, collected in LAC are infected with T. cruzi [10,11] . In homes, the bugs can find refuge in beds, uph olstered furniture, and animal bedding, emerging nightly to feed upon people and their pets [12]. Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 52 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Confirmation of the location where the patient acquired his infection, either locally or abroad, is complicated by his travel history, medical history, and ambiguous serological testing results conducted at CDC. Because Chagas disease is often asymptomatic, it can be many years before the infection is recognized or chronic symptoms manifest. Recrudescence of a previously acquired infection is possible in the s etting of steroid therapy. However, experts at the CDC believe that the level of immunosuppression that the patient received likely was not sufficient for such a response. Additional serological testing that was performed at the conclusion of the case inve stigation could not definitively define the timing of his infection. Additional serological testing in the following years may provide that evidence; however, even that is uncertain. Locally transmitted vector- borne transmission of Chagas disease in the US is rare. However, human cases may not be well documented given variability in patient testing and reporting to local and state health departments. Only six states in the US mandate Chagas disease reporting, and it is not a reportable condition in Califo rnia [13]. Without comprehensive human case surveillance, epidemiology and transmission risk of Chagas disease in LAC is not well known or defined. Though this is the first documented case of probable locally transmitted Chagas disease in LAC, there may ha ve been prior cases that were missed due to underdetection of Chagas disease. Experts have postulated that the low incidence of vector -borne transmission in the US may be explained by delayed defecation exhibited by local triatomine bugs (which would reduce transmission efficacy), by limited exposure to the vectors, and by low T. cruzi infection rates among triatomine bugs [11]. However , experimental studies have demonstrated that some triatomine bugs may defecate immediately upon feeding [14]. As construction, development, and suburbanization in LAC and the US encroaches upon woodrat and triatomine bug habitat, there will be increasing opportunities for residents to become exposed to T. cruzi and local prevalence studies indicate that vector infection rates are not insignificant in southern California [10,11] . Additionally, molecular studies show that local strains of T. cruzi are genetically similar to those in Latin America, suggesting that no differences in infectivity or virulence should be observed [10]. This case serves as an important reminder that local transmission of Chagas disease may occur more frequently than presumed in LAC. Local providers should include acute T. cruzi infection in the differential Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 53 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report diagnosis of fever o f unknown origin in patients with appropriate environmental exposure, even without travel to traditionally endemic areas. Similarly, providers should consider chronic Chagas infection in rural area residents of LAC with unexplained heart disease or symptom s consistent with gastrointestinal Chagas disease. REFERENCES 1.

Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 54 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Botulism Summary Page 55 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report BOTULISM CASE REPORT SUMMARY LOS ANGELES COUNTY, 2017 Botulism is a rare but serious and potentially fatal paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum . The bacterial spores that cause botulism are common in both soil and water and produce botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. There are five main kinds of botulism: 1) Foodborne botulism can be triggered by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, storebought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin; 2) Wound botulism can be triggered by spores of the bacteria getting into a wound and making toxin. People who inject drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism in Los Angeles County (LAC) . Wound botulism has also occurred in people after a traumatic injury such as a motorcycle accident or surgery; 3) Infant botulism can be triggered by the spores of the bacteria getting into an infant's intestines. The spores grow and produce the toxin, which causes illness; 4) Adult intestinal toxemia (also known as adult intestinal toxemia) botulism is a very rare kind of botulism that can be triggered by spores of the bacteria getting into an adult's intestines, growing, and producing the toxin (similar to infant botulism). Although the cause of this kind of botulism is unknown , people who have serious health conditions that affect the gut may be more likely to get sick; 5) Latrogenic botulism can occur if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons such as for wrinkles or medical reasons such as for migraine headaches or cervical dystonia. Because botulism infections may be fatal, they are considered medical emergencies ; accordingly, reporting of suspected cases is mandated by the LAC Department of Public Health (DPH) immediately by telephone. Specialized antitoxin is used to treat botulism, which can only be released when authorized by LAC DPH or the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Testing for case confirmation by mouse bioassay can be conducted at the LAC DPH Public Health Laboratory and matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time offlight (MALDITOF) is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Clinically compatible cases with botulinum toxin detected by either mouse bioassay or MALDI TOF are considered confirmed cases. The CDPH Division of Communicable Disease Control is responsible for the investigation and surveillance of infant botulism cases identified in the county and across the state. LAC DPH is responsible for reporting suspected cases of infant botulism to CDPH's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program1 for their investigation. The number of confirmed botulism cases (noninfant botulism) in LAC fluctuates from year to year. For the past five years, an average of three cases were confirmed annually. The botulism cases in LAC usually have injection drug use as a risk factor. Foodborne botulism in LAC is rare, in the past 10 years only one instance of foodborne botulism was reported with two associated cases confirmed (2012). 1 https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/InfantBotulism.aspx Botulism Summary Page 56 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report In 2017, nine cases of suspected botulism were reported in LAC including four out ofcounty cases who received medical care at hospitals in LAC . These four outofcounty suspected cases were referred to the health department in the patient's county of residence . Upon notification and review of case history and symptoms, ACDC physicians authorized the release and use of botulism antitoxin for six suspected botulism cases, and the state released three antitoxins. Ultimately, two were classified as confirmed cases (laboratoryconfirmed by MALDI TOF, with negative mouse bioassay), and one was classified as a probable case (due to negative laboratory testing but with clinically compatible findings and history of injection drug use). Only t wo suspected cases were determined not to be botulism based on absence of risk factors, negative botulism testing, and an alternate diagnosis of acute flaccid myelitis and lithium toxicity. A botulism outbreak was also investigated during 2017. In April 2017, public health authorities at the LAC DPH, the Orange County Healthcare Agency, and CDPH investigated an outbreak of botulism consisting of two cases , both adult residents of Orange Count y, and associated with an herbal tea product produced by a facility in LAC. LAC DPH released a press release ,2 health alerts3 were disseminated to healthcare providers , warnings were issue d to consumers in LAC , Orange County , and California, and the product was recalled .4 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=1652 3 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/hccp/alerts.htm 4 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eh/recall/2017/recallList_May.htm Influenza 2017- 2018 Season Summary Page 57 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE OVERVIEW : 2017-2018 SEASON SUMMARY OVERVIEW The traditional influenza surveillance season begins in October and ends mid -May of th e following year, covering a 32-week period. Los Angeles County (LAC) uses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR)1 weeks to refer to surveillance weeks, with week 1 correspon ding to the first week in January. The 2017 -18 season (October 1, 2017 -May 13, 2018) in LAC had higher influenza activity than the previous 5 influenza seasons. Peak activity occurred during week 52 (December 24 -30, 2017) when 50% of respiratory specimens tested by sentinel labs were positive for influenza ( Table 1 ). In addition, syndromic surveillance detected the highest proportion of visits to emergency departments for influenza -like-illness (ILI) during that same week ( Figure 1 ). This season also saw the greatest number of influenza -associated deaths reported since these deaths became reportable in LAC in 2010. The greatest weekly number of influenza -associated deaths ( N=54) occurred during week 1 (December 31, 2017 -January 6, 2 018).

Although individual cases of influenza are not reportable to LAC DPH, analyzing data from these sentinel labs provides information on influenza and other respiratory virus es circulating in the county. This season, a total of 107,199 respiratory isolate tests were reported to LAC DPH ( Table 1 ). This season, influenza activity began to increase at the beginning of December, peaked at the during Week 52 (Dec 24-30, 2017) and stayed high through March. There was a decline in influenza activity in January and February, b ut activity trended upwards again in March corresponding with increased influenza B activity. Other viruses co-circulated with influenza, contributing to the overall impact of respiratory illness in LAC. During this season, the majority of influenza positi ve sp ecimens were influenza A (66%). Figure 1 .

A total of 278 influenza -associated deaths (IADs) have been confirmed in LAC this season .3 There were more deaths reported this season than any season since LAC DPH initiated mandatory reporting. The majority of deaths (79%) occurred in those 65 years of age and older ( N=219), which is consistent with other influenza A H3N2 predominant seasons that more severely affect the 65 and older population (Figure 3). During i nfluenza A H3N2 seasons, the 65+ age group accounts for a greater proportion of IADs compared to influenza A H1N1 predominant seasons (Table 2). 2 LAC DPH.

The majority of respiratory outbreaks this season occurred in schools or pre -schools (46%), followed by skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) (29%) (Table 3 ). Respiratory outbreak definitions vary by setting ; however , in general, clusters of ILI (fever >100\u00b0 F with cough and /or sore throat) is cause for investigation. Thirty -two respiratory outbreaks were confirmed in schools, daycare, and assisted living facilities. Of those, influenza was identified as the responsible pathogen in 11 outbreaks, with flu B accounting for the majority of them. In SNFs, influenza was identified in 11 of 14 respiratory outbreaks. SYNDROMIC SURVEILLAN CE ACDC's Syndromic Surveillance Project monitors initial self- reported symptoms from patients presenting to participating emergency departments throughout LAC. These symptoms are categorized into different clinical syndromes according to specific code words. LAC's influenza surveillance looks at the syndrome of Influenza -like illness and includes symptoms such as: fever, congestion, sneezing, sore th roat, runny nose, and cough. Similar to other indicators, there were more ILI emergency department visits this season than were reported in any of the last 5 seasons.

LAC has also had a high number of West Nile Virus (WNV ) cases compared to the population and relative to the United States over the past six years. Over the last 5 years, LAC has experienced yearly outbreaks of W NV1 with an average of 221 cases per year, approximately 10% of the national burden ( Table 1 ). Additionally, the significant spread and increased detection of Aedes mosquitoes in new local areas, coupled with the high volume of international travel and our dense population, provide the id eal elements for a potential local outbreak of dengue, Chikungunya, or Zika if these viruses are introduced into the environment by an infected traveler (Map 1). Despite these significant health risks, mosquito -borne disease knowledge, perceived risk, and prevention behaviors are low among residents in the county. In September 2017, the LAC Department of Public Health ( DPH ) organized and coordinated an unprecedente d weeklong county -wide boots -on-the-ground outreach campaign (titled : It's Not Just a Bite! )2 to distribute educational materials aimed to increase WNV and Zika awareness and knowledge as well as promote preventive action . This campaign was the largest door -to-door campaign ever implemented by LAC DPH to fight a communicable disease . Table 1.

Locations of Zika Cases & Aedes Mosquitoes Community Outreach to Fight Mosquito- Borne Diseases Page 64 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report METHODS Under the emergency response structure, a central command center was organized with four area command centers to coordinate and monitor the event. Several materials were developed including: 1) educational materials for WNV, Zika, and general mosquito -borne disease knowledge , which were translated into multiple languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog , and Korean) ; 2) just-in-time training materials; and 3) scripts for outreac h volunteers as well as staff answering the phones. Over 300 County of Los Angeles staff volunteers were recruited from all departments and programs , most of who m did not routinely work with arboviral diseases. DPH deployed 100 two -person teams for 5 days to distribute posters and flyers to public venues across the county including city council halls, libraries, schools, parks and places of worship. The campaign led to the distribution of approximately 55,000 educational materials to over 14,000 venues ( Table 2 ). Environmental Health inspectors further distributed materials during routine site visits at permitted facilities. A digital tool kit was disseminated to city contacts and partners throughout LAC to be used, distributed and printed according to local nee ds and resources. The on - the-ground effort was complemented by a social media campaign through online platforms such as Twitter, Instagram , and Facebook , which further increased reach of campaign and engaged residents online. The campaign attracted considerable press coverage and media attention which also amplified the reach of these important messages. RESULTS To assess the reach and impact of the outreach campaign, in November 2017 , DPH conducted a 27 - question two -stage cluster community survey in four LAC cities . This was enacted in partnership wi th Department of Mental Health P romotores and public health students from the University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, Califo rnia State University Northridge, and University of Southern California. The survey questions assessed exposure to and recall of campaign messages and attempted to identify attitudes and behaviors regarding mosquitoes and mosquito -borne diseases. A total o f 464 surveys were completed over two days. Approximately 60% of respondents reported exposure to the campaign through at least one of the following: posters, flyers, community meetings, social media , or news articles. Analyse s showed that exposure to the materials was associated with a significant increase in awareness and knowledge of both WNV and Zika (Table 3 ). Table 4 shows modes of exposure that were significantly associated with increased awareness and/or knowledge of WNV and Zika. Those who Table 2. Venues Reached in Countywide Campaign Community Outreach to Fight Mosquito- Borne Diseases Page 65 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report reported exposure to campaign through posters, social media, or news articles had increased Zika awareness and /or knowledge. However, exposure to flyers or community meetings was not found to be associated with a similar increase . Exposure to posters was a ssociated with increased WNV awareness and knowledge, but exposure to flyers, social media, news articles, and community meetings was not. The data did not reveal an increase in mosquito prevention behavior linked to the campaign among those surveyed . Mult iple in terventions sustained over time, part icularly in specific types of materials , may be required to change habits, beliefs and actions regarding prevention of mosquito -borne diseases. Table 3. Impact of exposure to the campaign Exposed Non -exposed P-value Zika Awareness 213 129 79 (38%) in mosquito prevention 222 (60%) 151 (40%) 0.240 DISCUSSION Overall, the It's Not Just a Bite! campaign was an extraordinary effort to reach and engage the diverse communities in LAC about mosquito -borne disease prevention. In an era where emerging and re -emerging pathogens are increasingly being identified and can spread at record speed through gl obal trade and travel, it is essential for health departments to not only be able to detect these threats but to also be able to rapidly organize and mobilize staff to communicate and engage with the community.

Capturing a Record Num ber of Deaths Due to WNV in LAC Page 67 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report BEYOND CASE COUNTS \u2014CAPTURING A RECORD NUMBER OF DEA THS DUE TO WEST NILE VIRUS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY BY ENHANCING MONITORING OF PATIEN TS BACKGROUND In 2017, Los Angeles County (LAC) experienced a record -breaking 27 deaths due to West Nile v irus (WNV ).1 That year 11% of the 254 known symptomatic patients stricken with this disease died . Even d uring the five previous years with unusually high average case counts of 202 cases per year , the number of deaths from WNV peaked at 24 (5-year average of 10.4 deaths per year, 5 .3% of those ill ).2 The deaths occurred across racial and geographic boundaries, and had an age range of 59 to 96 years with half being above 75 years of age . Because WNV can often lead to long -term illness or death after a patient leaves the hospital, deaths from WNV infection can be missed with routine monitoring leading to an underestimate of the true impact of this disease. In the last five years, LAC Department of Public Health ( DPH ) has received an average of 670 mosquito - borne disease reports per year. The LAC DPH had previously relied upon one investigator to follow up on these reports . Investigations were usually completed before discharge from hospitals and deaths were only captured through informal reporting from providers and family members. Without evidenc e of death, patients with unknown outcomes were assumed to have survived the disease . Through enhanced monitoring of patients , LAC DPH was able to identify a more accurate number of deaths, and a record number of fatalities from WNV therefore was identifie d in 2017 . FINDINGS Grant funding for a new position enabled LAC DPH to conduct additional follow -up of WNV patients where survival was not known . From June through December 2017 , a mosquito -borne disease investigator worked with hospital staff to ensure all ( 100% ) discharge information reporting death or survival for hospitalized patie nts were reported and documented . If discharge information was not available due to prolonged hospital stays , the patient was flagged for additional follow -up in two weeks, at which time, the investigator again requested and reviewed patient discharge information . Repeated requests were often necessary due to lengthy hospitalizations that frequently occur with WNV . This process took a substantial amount of time and ef fort and increase d the estimated hour that is required per case for initial review and confirmation by another hour, essentially doubling the work time for flagged cases . The investigator took on this additional workload while managing the investigation s of over 30 cases of WNV a week , which resulted in the addition of 9 reported deaths out of approximately 80 patients . Without grant funding to support another investigator for Zika monitoring , it would have been necessary for the existing investigator to take on Zika investigation responsibilities and we might not have been able to identify the additional fatalities due to this disease . Additional follow -up of WNV survival would have become a lower priority, as it has been in the past, and c ould not have been completed. 1 LAC DPH. ACDC. West Nile Virus and Other Arboviral Diseases: 2017. Los Angeles County Epidemiology Final Report. http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/Arbo2017.pdf 2 LAC DPH. ACDC. West Nile virus data LAC. http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/WNVData.htm Capturing a Record Num ber of Deaths Due to WNV in LAC Page 68 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report DISCUSSION The enhanced monitoring of deaths carried out in 2017 highlights the health impact of WNV that was previously under -estimated in LAC. Many residents of our county become severely sick with WNV disease every year since LAC DPH first discovered the virus in the area in 2002 . It has been difficult to bring attention and resources to a public health issue that is no longer a new problem and has been portrayed as mild to the majority of those infected , a perception that was supporte d by lower numbers of deaths . The high number of deaths in the 2017 season brought much needed attention to the severity of WNV and broader recognition that this disease is a dangerous and significant threat in LAC. Awareness has increased not only among p ublic health o fficials but also among local government s and policy makers. Continuation of improved investigation procedures for WNV deaths will raise the level of concern , provoke new conversations on prevention and promote coordinated action to address the persistent threat of WNV i n LAC . LESSONS LEARNED Considering the impact of a high number of deaths on the perception of WNV among health officials and the public , LAC DPH is prioritizing the thorough investigation of WNV survival . While LAC DPH still retains the additional investigator supported by grant funding for Zika and other infections f or the 2018 season, we will continue to conduct follow -up of our WNV patients without known hospital discharge information and report deaths in a timely manner to boost awareness and promote WNV prevention and control efforts. It was challenging for a single investigator to conduct enhanced monitoring of patients while conducting routine case investigations of over 250 WNV cases over the six -month WNV season in LAC. As this was the first time this follow up was conducted, there was no precedent and no estimate of additional workload this would entail. Going forward, it will be helpful to establish a protocol for follow up that others can easily follow step by step. In addition, we can explore documenting and reporting other serious effects of WNV illness such as long hospitalization stays and the need for rehabilit ation . Without the support of the grant funding source, improved investigations of the effects of WNV could not be carried out and the additional vital information about the true and serious impact of this disease would not be fully recognized . Expansion of LAC Web- Based Disease Surveillance System Page 69 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report THE EXPANSION OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY WEB -BASED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO AN ENTERPRISE INTEGRATED REPORTING, IN VESTI GATION, AND SURVEILL ANCE SYSTEM BACKGROUND Brief History of web- Visual Confidential Morbidity Reporting System Prior to 1999 , the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health ( LAC DPH) Acute Communicable Disease Control (ACDC) Program relied on telephone reports or paper -based reporting, via fax and mail. These reports were then subsequently manual ly entered for data collection of disease incidents . This l ow- tech nology reporting and tracking me thod require d a significant amount of paperwork and person hours and potentially could cause reporting delays and quality control issues. Beginning in 2000, ACDC enacted a web -based, centralized repository for disease reports, lab oratory reports, foodborne illness reports and outbreaks . The system is called the visual Confidential Morbidity Reporting (vCMR)1 system . vCMR serves as primary disease surveillance system for ACDC and as a disease repository for several LAC DPH programs . vCMR supports the rapid exchange of electronic public health information between community practitioners (through the web Community Reporting Module) and electronic laboratory reporting (ELR ). The system provides ACDC with a cohesive surveillance system to rapidly detect , identif y, and investigate reportable communi cable diseases. Over the years, ACDC implemented key configurations and modifications to support LAC DPH's unique needs including maintenance of historical data and images, electronic laboratory reporting of national, state, and local disease. vCMR also capably support s various workflows which allow public health nurses, investigators, and health services to cooperatively share information and manage cases and outbreaks . LAC DPH 's ability to develop vCMR with differing key configurations and modifications is reflective of the unique needs of a large local jurisdiction . Although vCMR supported some of the data management needs of these programs, there are several other LAC DPH programs that primarily use respective legacy database systems and paper -based fo rms. These programs include the Division of STD and HIV Programs (DHSP)2, the Tuberculosis Control Program (TBCP)3, and Veterinary Public Health (VPH )4. LAC DPH Evaluates an Electronic Enterprise Solution for Disease Surveillance and Investigation In November 2013 , an LAC DPH Executive Team formed the Share Disease Surveillance and Control System (SDSCD) Project . Participants collaborated with the LAC DPH Chief Information Office to develop a strategy and approach to implement a shared system for disease surveillance for DPH . Subsequently, in 2014, SDSCS Staff Committee evaluated health information and operational needs across DPH programs. From both a local and national perspective, it was determined that LAC DPH needed to unify its disease programs and provide an integrated enterprise solution that promotes information sharing and digitizing paper -based workflows . 1 http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/vcmr/Index.htm 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/dhsp/ 3 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/tb/index.htm 4 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/index.htm Expansion of LAC Web- Based Disease Surveillance System Page 70 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report LAC DPH programs including Community Health Services (CHS)5, DHSP, Public Health Nursing Administration (NA)6, Public Health Investigation (PHI)7, TBCP, VPH, Vaccine Preventable Disease Control Program (VPDC)8, Public Health Lab oratory (LAPHL)9, and Environmental Health10 found that functions of vCMR can effectively meet many of their data needs. In April 2 016, SDSCS Staff Committee detailed their findings and recommendations in the SCSCS Executive Report. After extensive internal analysis of health information systems, workflow, organizational and IT infrastructure, and data and information needs along with external analysis of other public health information system vendors , the SDSCS Staff Committee recommended expansion of vCMR to migrate LAC DPH disease programs on to a common platform. vCMR proved to be the most efficient and economical solution for LAC DPH programs because it was originally designed for LAC and previous investments will be leveraged for future developments. Significant product upgrades and enhancements of vCMR will enable LAC DPH programs to retire legacy systems . RESULTS Decision to Upgrade vCMR to be the Enterprise Solution for LAC DPH Programs In November 2016, the Interim Health Officer and SDSCS Executive Workgroup accepted the SDSCS Staff Committee's recommendation to expand vCMR . Accordingly, vCMR received a new name to reflect its new purpose \u2014The Integrated Reporting, Investigation, a nd Surveillance System (IRIS).

The IRIS project team adopted a participatory approach to bring TBCP, DHSP, and VPH programs into IRIS. Other programs ( CHS, NA, and PHI ) will be given expanded access to and use of IRIS to conduct field work. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from each department are included in the planning and development of the IRIS project. The goal of this participatory approach is to ensure all programs have an opportunity to voice respective programmatic needs and establish realistic expectations of IRIS's capabilities for both current and future needs. The expected expansion of IRIS is displayed in Figure 1 below. In November 2017, staff conducted a Joint Application Development (JAD) Session under the existing contract. The JAD sessions provided the basic IRIS system requirements and solutions and established regular meetings with each programs' SMEs. The IRIS project is now well underway to become the first integrated disease surveillance system for LAC DPH. Figure 1. IRIS Current and Future State Expansion of LAC Web- Based Disease Surveillance System Page 72 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance in Detecting Hepatitis A in LAC Page 73 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report EVALUATION OF SYNDRO MIC SURVEILLANCE IN DETECTING HEPATITIS A IN LOS ANGELES COUNT Y OVERVIEW Beginning in November 2016, a hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) outbreak1 was identified in San Diego County which subsequently spread to Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, and Monterey Counties. Infecti ons primarily occurred among homeless individuals and those who use illicit drug s. Due to the proximity of Los Angeles County (LAC) to San Diego County and its own large homeless population, on September 19, 2017, the LAC Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) declared an outbreak of HAV2 among persons who are homeless and/or use illicit (injection and non -injection ) drugs. By October 10, 2017, LAC DPH identified 12 local outbreak -related HAV cases. T o monitor the impact of the outbreak, LAC DPH's syndromic surveillance team created a n HAV syndrome category and began querying local emergency department (ED) data to identify any increase s in HAV -related visits. METHODS From January 1, 2017 through October 10, 2017, which corresponds to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) weeks 1 -41, ED data from all participating syndromic EDs in LAC were queried for patients who reported sy mptoms and signs of HAV infection . For comparison, ED data from the full 2016 calendar year also was queried. The query consisted of key word searches primarily within the chief complaint field, and if available, from the diagnosis and triage note fields. Based on the CDC clinical description of hepatitis A ,3 the HAV syndrome category was defined as: jaundice (or elevated liver function tests) with nausea or vomiting. Any ED visit that mentioned a diagnosis of hepatitis A also met the syndrome criteria. The resulting line lists were reviewed , and the query parameters were periodically refined to exclude visits unrelated to hepatitis A . For instance , analyses excluded : patients with a previous history of HAV infection or vaccination for hepatitis A, those diagnosed with other types of hepatitis, and patients diagnosed with neonatal jaundice. The syndromic system also was queried for records that matched the 12 initial outbreak -related LAC cases by hospital and admission date. In addition, the chief complaint, diagnosis, and triage note fields were reviewed for any mention of homelessness or illicit drug use (IDU) . RESULTS For the 2017 time -period (weeks 1 -41), the LAC DPH syndromic system detected 158 ED patients meeting the HAV syndrome category criteria. Of these, 12.7% had a diagnosis of HAV, 53.8% had jaundice, 36.7% had elevated liver enzymes, 65.2% had nausea, and 65.8% had v omiting. In 2016, 170 ED patients who met the syndrome criteria were detected: 8.2% had a diagnosis of HAV, 64.1% had jaundice, 32.4% had elevated liver enzymes, 63.5% had nausea, and 71.2% had vomiting. In both years, no indications of homelessness or IDU were identified . 1 https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Hepatitis -A-Outbreak.aspx 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eprp/Health%20Alerts/DPH%20HAN%20Hep%20A%20Outbreak%20091917.pdf 3 https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis -a-acute/case- definition/2012/ Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance in Detecting Hepatitis A in LAC Page 74 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Of the 12 initial and confirmed HAV outbreak -related cases in LAC , one-fourth (n=3) did not go to a hospital, thus did not have any syndromic data. Only t wo cases went to EDs that do not participate in LAC DPH syndromic surveillance , but a medical chart review showed that they would not have met the syndrome criteria. Of the remaining cases (n=7) , all went to a participating syndromic ED, 43% (n=3) met the syndrome criteria, but none of their records included any mention of homelessness or IDU. DISCUSSION In 2017, a large hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County, primarily among individuals who were homeless and/or illicit drug us ers, prompted the LAC DPH to create a HAV syndrome category and begin querying local participating ED data to monitor for any increase s in HAV -related visits. In the end, no major outbreak of HAV occurred in LAC, and n o major change was seen in the trend of HAV syndrome visits in 2017 as compared to 2016 ( Figure 1 ). Us e of a stricter syndrome definition, such as r equiring a specific diagnosis of HAV, may result in underreporting, but may also provide a more accurate baseline for detecting increases and monitoring trends. While the query relied primarily on ED chief complaint, diagnosis and triage notes also proved useful in detecting HAV syndrome visits. Figure 1. Proportion of ED Visits Meeting Hepatitis A Syndrome Category Criteria Los Angeles County, 2016 -2017 Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance in Detecting Hepatitis A in LAC Page 75 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report LIMITATIONS One of the challenges in monitoring HAV incidence is that the clinical signs and s ymptoms are very general and may be comparable with many other conditions. An emerging outbreak may not be detected above background levels unless the increase in ED patients with HAV is large or consolidated over time. In addition, v ariability in data quality in the free text fields such as chief complaint and triage notes may be problematic. Cases will be missed if data fields are not fully and accurately documented, if patients didn't go to a participating syndromic hospital, or if they don't go to a hospital at all. In addition, while many syndromic hospitals now report diagnosis information, this information may be delayed due to the time required for complete laboratory results. Further complicating these findings, no ne of the con firmed HAV cases that were known to be homeless included any mention of homelessness in their charts . This omission, as well as the omission of IDU status , indicate that these conditions are not currently reliably captured in the syndromic extract ion of ED patient records. CONCLUSIONS Syndromic surveillance, despite its limitations, remains a valuable complement to electronic lab oratory reporting and other traditional reporting mechanisms. Accordingly, LAC DPH will continue to employ syndromic surveillance to facilitate monitoring health issues and disease trends in our county.

The majority of CRE infections are associated with patients in an acute care hospital or skilled nursing facility (SNF) who are immunocompromised or have invasive devices such as intravenous catheters or are ventilator dependent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is concerned about the rapid spread of CRE and has recommended aggressive approaches for identifying and preventing further spread [1]. Using data from 2010 -2012 , the Los Angeles County Department of Publi c Health ( LAC DPH ) assessed the prevalence of CRE in LAC2 and received over 2,000 laboratory report s of carbapenem -resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae , one type of CRE . Prior work by the C DC suggested only sporadic cases of CRE were identified in LAC hospitals and prevalence was unknown . The large number of cases received was substantially higher than anticipated , providing justification for further surveillance. CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN )3 is an electronic healthcare -associated infection (HAI) tracking system . In California, all acute care hospitals are mandated to report select HAIs to the California Department of Public Health via this system. The NHSN includes an option to report the three most common CRE infections (Escherichia coli , Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp.) as part of the system's LabID Event module. In April 2010, LAC DPH requested and received voluntary conferral of rights to the NHSN data submitted to California Department of Public Health . On January 19, 2017 a Health Officer Order (HOO)4 was issued requiring all acute care hospitals and SNFs report CRE infections as well as a facility - specific annual antibiogram to LAC DPH. Antibiogram data provide a comprehensive summary of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in healt hcare facilities. LAC DPH will use data submitted from healthcare facilities to compile a regional antibiogram to assess resistanc e and detect new trends in LAC. METHODS In California, general acute care hospitals (GACH ) and long term acute care hospitals (LTACH ) mandatorily report HAI data into NHSN . LAC DPH decided to build CRE reporting into this already established system and expand the data captured by creating a LAC CRE Group which added patient information and key variables needed to assess and describe the epi demiology of CRE in LAC. For surveillance purposes in this study , CRE infections were defined using the NHSN Safety Component Manual 5 as Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp.) resistant to carbapenem antibiotics or that produce carbapenemases. 1 https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/definition.html 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/CRKP_ICHE.pdf 3 https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html 4 http://public health.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/CREorder.pdf 5 https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/pscmanual/pcsmanual_current.pdf The First The First Year of Mandated CRE Antibiogram Reporting Page 2 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report LAC DPH sent detailed instructions for this new reporting requirement to all LAC facilities mandated to report. In addition, a webinar was created to provide step by step guidance on how to join the LAC CRE Group, as well as how to confer rights to LAC DPH and create custom variables. In contrast to GACHs and LTACHs, b ecause most SNFs are not enrolled in the NHSN, a paper reporting form was created for these locations . The NHSN LAC CRE group was used as the data source for analysis to calculate hospital and community onset rates as well as for descriptive epidemiology statistics. All SNF reports were submitted via paper case report forms and were entered into an Access d atabase by ACDC staff. For GACH s and LTACH s, CRE rates were analyzed using NHSN calculations of number of infections reported for the numerator and admissions for community -onset (CO) and patient da ys for healthcare -onset (HO) for the denominator. CO infections were identified within 3 days of admission and HO after 3 days of admission in both GACHs and LTACH s. Stratification of data by onset type in SNFs was not possible since most admission date in formation was either mis sing or filled out incorrectly. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services ( CMS) requirements, GACHs and LTACHs submitted final reports to NHSN by May 15, 2018. Data analysis was performed in May and June 2018 . Additional analysis was done comparing CRE case counts between the two NHSN LAC g roups; the gen eral LAC group and the LAC CRE G roup containing patient in formation and custom variables. RESULTS Out of 83 GACH s and 8 LTACH s in LAC, 72 (86.7%) GACHs and all LTACHs reported at least one CRE event. Pooled LTACH HO rates were higher than GACHs at 1.22 (range 0.50 -2.18) infectio ns compared to 0.66 Figure 1.

The pooled CO CRE rates reported from LTACH s were also higher than GACHs, 2.11 (range 1.04-7.97) infections and 0.3 5 per 100 admissions , respectively (Figure 2) . GACH In GACHs, t he majority of healthcare -onset CRE reported was Klebsiella (64.9%), followed by E nterobacter and E. coli (12.7%) (Table 1 ). Klebsiella (75.6%) was also the most commonly reported community onset CRE followed by E. coli (13.5%) and Enterobacter (10.9%) . Table 1.

Communication addressing the specific issue identified for each hospital was generated and sent via email to the hospital infection preventionist by the respective LAC DPH liaison public health nurse and an epidemiologist. If additional troubleshooting or technical assistance was required, the assigned epidemiologist would follow -up with the infection preventionist . By May 2018, all 19 with reporting issues had corrected the problems . In addition, 2018 reporting plans were checked to ensure the corrections ha d carried over to the new year. Forty duplicates were identified within NHSN data. Efforts were made to reach out to NHSN to troubleshoot how this occurred and make appropriate corrections to avoid future duplicate even t entry. The First The First Year of Mandated CRE Antibiogram Reporting Page 8 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report SNF data was merged with the GACH and LTACH data to check for duplicate reporting. Multiple errors were identified including CRE reported by a SNF that should have or had already been reported by the ordering acute care hospital, incorrect date of current admission to the SNF, reporting a history of CRE (no current lab), and reporting on different organisms (i.e. Pseudomonas ) not covered by the HOO. Analysis of SNF reports resulted in identification of two CRE reports that should have been reported by the acute care hospital but were missed. Five cases had already been reported in NHSN by the acute care hospital. These errors were communicated to the appropr iate facilities . Antibiogram All 92 acute care hospitals (including LTACH s) in LAC submitted antibiograms during the first year of the HOO. With this information, t he first LAC regional antibiogram6 was completed, published , and distributed in January 2018 and is posted on the ACDC website. Data entry and analysis is currently underway for 2017 data. DISCUSSION Overall the first year of CRE reporting in LAC generated valuable data and identified high rates of CRE in healthca re facilities, especially among LTACH s. This information will help guide targeted prevention efforts moving forward. Reporting errors were identified from GACHs, LTACH s, and SNFs and efforts have been made to correct discrepancies both ret rospectively and going forward. LIMITATIONS All the custom variables that LAC DPH requested in NHSN reporting plans exhibited low response rates resulting in missing data. We plan to address these reporting gaps by identifying facilities that did not complete the custom variable fields and reaching out to them to notify them and provide additional assistance as needed. There was no NHSN data validation done to ensure that hospitals are reporting CRE accurately and thoroughly. Historically, the California Department of Public Health has performed hospital data entry validation for other diseases, however this verification has not been conducted as CRE is no t reportable at the state level . Currently , data validation in SNFs is not feasible as there are over 300 SNFs in LAC. REFERENCES 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Marquez P, Terashita D, Dassey D, Mascola -based incidence enem -resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae along the c ontinuum (2):144 A ntimicrobial Resistance Testing Page 9 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report ACTIVATING VITAL ADVANCES IN ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE TESTING AMONG LOS ANGELES COUNTY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES BACKGROUND Antibiotic resistance (AR) and multi- drug resistant organisms (MDRO) are an intensifying public health threat. Carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are especially concerning. CRE mortality rates are often as high as 30 -40% [1-5] due to limited treatment options . In addition, many CRE can spread AR to other bacteria via plasmid -encoded genetic resistance mechanisms , called carbapenemases [6]. Given this, it is not surprising that CRE has been classified as a critically important and urgent global threat by the Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization [7-8]. While CRE has been steadily increasing in the United States [9-10], Los Angeles County (LAC) has been identified as a hotspot for CRE infections because of its large number of healthcare facilities and its internati onal patient population [11], which create a complex system within which CRE and other MDROs can readily spread. Early administration of microbiologically active antimicrobial therapy can reduce morbidity and mortality from CRE infections [5, 12-14]. This depends on accurate determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the infecting organism to antibiotics. Interpretation of the MIC results is conducted using breakpoints , which categorize whether an antibiotic is resistant or susceptib le to any given antibiotic and determine the probability of treatment success. The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) provides guidance on what methodologies clinical laboratories should use to detect CRE and other nosocomial pathogens. The CLSI updated the carbapenem MIC breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae in 2010 based on data from multiple clinical studies demonstrating that ongoing use of the previous breakpoints resulted in higher patient mortality [3, 4]. Failure to update breakpoint s also impacted infection control measures, w hich is estimated to contribute to a 3-5% annual spread of CRE [15]. Ongoing use of outdated CLSI breakpoints will result in the failure to recognize clinically and epidemiologically concerning MDROs such as CRE . It is thus imperative that clinical laboratories are up -to-date on their CRE detection methods . To assess CRE detection practices amongst clinical laboratories, the Acute Communicable Disease Control Healthcare Outreach Unit (HOU) partnered with California Department of Public Health and academic investigators to conduct the California Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network Assessment (CARLA) survey in 2015. The CARLA survey identified that 42% of hospital laboratories in LAC used outdated carbapenem breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae [16]. Furthermore, many laboratories did not perform carbapenemase testing, as recommended by CLSI to ensure detection of carbapenemase -producing Enterobacteriaceae with use of outdated breakpoints [16]. Clinical laboratories must take manual steps to ensure their antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) instruments are up -to-date. However, the HOU theorized that lack of awareness of the problem s Activating Advances in A ntimicrobial Resistance Testing Page 10 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report surrounding use of outdated breakpoints and/or techni cal knowledge of how to update breakpoints caused the delayed uptake of revised breakpoints. This prompted our initiative to better understand why laboratories failed to update breakpoints and, in turn, assist them in implement ing up-to-date CRE detection methods. OBJECTIVE This report describes the HOU 's efforts to update carbapenem breakpoints amongst targeted clinical laboratories in LAC to improve detection of CRE. METHODS HOU established the antimicrobial resistance/antimicrobial stewardship (AR/AS) team, composed of five HOU liaison public health nurses (LPHNs), an epidemiologist, and an infectious disease physician serving as the HOU's AR expert. Targeted hospitals were c hosen based upon their responses to the question of using outdated CRE breakpoints in the CARLA survey. To be included in our target list, the labs had to respond with i or ii to the following question: What breakpoints does your laboratory use for carbape nems testing Enterobacteriaceae? i. Pre-2010 breakpoints only ii. Pre-2010 breakpoints combined production iii. Current CLSI M100 S25 breakpoints iv. Other The AR/AS team collaborated with CDC and local microbiology experts to devel op a protocol that guide s clinical laboratories through the process of updating CRE detection methods , which includes: 1. ordering verification panels from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/CDC AR Isolate Bank; 2. updating breakpoints in the AST instrument , which may involve scheduling a visit with the local service technician of their AST device manufacturer; and 3. conducting a verification study to ensure accurate results. The team first conducted in -person visits with each hospital's laboratory director, microbiology supervisor, antimicrobial stewardship chair, and infection preventionist to discuss unique issues that were impacting their CRE detection methods and provide initial recommendations . Following the initial visit, the AR/AS team provided each hospital with the CRE breakpoint update protocol, sample verification study protocol , and template to document the results o f the verification studies. During follow -up consultations, the AR expert provided additional support, which included facilitating communication with the CDC, FDA, and local laboratory equipment representatives. The AR/AS team also checked in with each hospital regularly to encourage progress, and that their methods were thorou ghly implemented . RESULTS Between July to August 2017, the AR/AS team conducted outreach to 41 hospitals who responded with i or ii to the question above . The survey was sent out to all hospitals in California in 2015, including 97 in Los Angeles (at the time of the survey). All 41 laboratories had in person AR/AS team visits. At the time of Activating Advances in A ntimicrobial Resistance Testing Page 11 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report the initial AR/AS visit, 7 (17%) had updated to the current CLSI breakpoint following the CARLA survey, and were not targeted for further follow -up. Of the remaining 34 laboratories, 27 (79.4%) assumed their AST instruments were using current breakpoints. Half of laboratories (17, 50%) were uncertain of how to approach changing breakpoints on their AST instrument, and 10 (29.4%) indicated they lacked the resources to p erform a verification study. Only 7 (20.5%) facilities were familiar with the FDA/CDC AR Isolate Bank as a resource for verification studies. All 34 laboratories using historical breakpoints were accredited, most were accredited by the College of American Pathologists (29, 85%) , the others by the Joint Commission (5, 15%). Laboratory staffing included dedicated microbiology staff in 28 (82%) laboratories , a laboratory director with a specialization in microbiology (MD or PhD) in 5 (15%) , and a clinical laboratory scientist in 29 (85%) . All 34 hospital laboratories agreed to work toward updating carbapenem breakpoints following the AR/AS team visit. After one year of follow -up, 15 laboratories (47%) s uccessfully updated breakpoints; 12 (35%) received isolates but did not update ; and 6 (18%) are planning to complete the update in 2018. Common barriers for the 19 laboratories failing to update the breakpoint included: too much clinical work and/or not enough staffing ( 12, 63% ) and inability to update the laboratory information systems or electronic medical record (5, 26% ). Other less common reasons included waiting on new testing platforms (n=2) and change s in laboratory staff (n=3). DISCUSSION Ongoing use of outdated carbapenem breakpoints by clinical laboratories is a public health problem. Failure to update breakpoints hampers infection control initiatives, hinders CRE treatment success, and helps fuel spread of CRE [2-5, 15]. Prior to the AR/AS visit, most microbiology laboratory personn el did not feel empowered to make changes, even when they were aware of the problem. However, with the cooperation of antimicrobial stewardship an d infection control leadership \u2014in conjunction with ongoi ng follow -up by the AR/AS team \u2014the laboratories gained vital support for the breakpoint update initiative. The AR/AS team visits allowed HOU to use existing resources for targeted outreach to engage hospital laboratories in updating carbapenem breakpoints. The key to success of the project was developing a strong system of collaborations with our CDC partners, local experts, representatives of AST device manufacturers, and individual hospital staff\u2014 especially the clinical laboratory scientist who typically leads the laboratory methodology validation efforts. The process of verifying new MIC breakpoints is outside the scope of typical laboratory work -flow, so many facilities needed encouragement and administrative support to complete the process. Thanks to the AR/AS team visits, all ( 100% ) of targeted hospitals began the process of updating breakpoints and nearly half of the hospital laboratories completed the update within one year. Physicians and other healthcare staff depend on the assurance that the results provided by their laboratory are accurate, significant, and clinically relevant. By improving laboratory detection methods, CRE will now be correctly classified in LAC hospital laboratories. This will decrease inappropriate antibiotic therapy and in turn decrease the risk of death fr om CRE infection. Now that CRE can be accurately Activating Advances in A ntimicrobial Resistance Testing Page 12 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report detected and reported, HOU can also improve our efforts to contain the spread of CRE within LAC. In addition, because LAC has a large international patient population, this project likely will also decrease the spread of CRE globally. There are several limitations to this intervention . While the AR/AS team was successful with improving updated carbapenem MIC breakpoint usage in LAC, the HOU experience may not be generalizable to other public health jurisdic tions. The AR/AS team includes academic investigators in infectious disease and microbiology. However, we hope that making our resources available to other jurisdictions will make our initiative more wide ly adoptable. To date, the FDA \u2014which dictates which breakp oints AST instruments must use \u2014has officially recognized many but not all CLSI breakpoints, which complicates the process of updating AST systems in a timely manner. Additionally, HOU did not collect information on how the breakpoint initiative impac ted patient outcomes, infection prevention practices, antimicrobial prescribing, or the incidence rate of CRE in LAC . Despite the large number of hospital laboratorie s in LAC using outdated CRE detection methods and limited st aff resources, this project w as a success. The AR/AS team's findings informed a need to do further broad education to improve AR detection practices across LAC . This project also greatly improved HOU's rapport with hospital laboratories, which is critical to detect and contain CRE and other AR bacteria of epidemiological concern. Now that these partnerships have been established, HOU will be able to continue to improve laboratory capabilities in our jurisdiction in the global fight against AR. REFERENCES 1.

To date, most efforts by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health ( LAC DPH) to build antimicrobial stewardship capacity has focused on inpatient settings. However, estimates are that more than 3 0 percent of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings are unnecessary [1]. Primary care clinics and clinicians prescribe approximately half of all outpatient antibiotics in the United States [2]. Outpatient antibiotic prescribing , in particular, has b een demonstrated to be directly associated with antimicrobial resistance [3]. Antimicrobial stewardship efforts have been demonstrated antimicrobial prescribing, microbial resistance, and costs. Antimicrobial stewardship has become a current standard of care in medical practice and interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing are supported by the California Medical Foundation, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [4]. Unf ortunately, outpatient antimicrobial stewardship is neither uniform nor widely adopted across LAC. The CDC Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship note four key areas of stewardship: commitment, action for policy and practice, tracking and repo rting, and education and expertise [5]. A review of the literature demonstrated that individual interventions targeting these four areas had varying degrees of effectiveness; however, no outpatient antimicrobial stewardship program meeting all Core Elements has been assessed for effectiveness no r implementation characteristics studied [6] . The objective of Targeting Appropriate Prescribing in Outpatient settings (TAP OUT) is to assist outpatient clinics to implement an antimicrobial stewardship program. The outcome of interest is inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute upper respiratory infections (URI). METHODS LAC DPH recruited 20 primary care and 3 urgent care clinics, representing 208 providers , to participate in the TAP OUT project. The clinics are all part of the same medical network. LAC DPH staff partnered with the clinics' stewardship team, which included the medical director, infection preventionist, and two physician stewardship champions, to develop an antimicrobial stewardship program that met all the CDC Core Elements of Outp atient Stewardship. The stewardship program implemented includes public commitment, communication skills training, clinical treatment education, and prescribing audits. LAC DPH and the clinic stewardship team adapted evidence -based strategies to meet the n eeds and preferences of the clinic providers and patients. To measure the effectiveness of the program, patient encounter data were analyzed for changes in inappropriate antibiotic presc ribing for URI between the 2016 -17 and 2017 - 18 influenza seasons. Inap propriate antibiotic prescribing was defined using California Medical Outpatient Stewardship to Improve A ntibiotic Prescribing Practices Page 16 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Association Foundation Alliance Working for Antibiotic Resistance Education1 guidelines. The definition of URI was based on analysis of International Classification of Diseases2 Tenth Edition encounter codes. Patient s currently on immunomodulatory therapy were excluded from the analysis. To evaluate implementation process characteristics, a key inf ormant interview was conducted. RESULTS A total of 20 primary care and 3 urgent care clinics, representing 208 providers, participated in TAP OUT (see Methods) . The baseline estimated inappropriate antibiotic prescribing rate for URI was 15.5% amongst all prescribers (range: 0-100%). During the intervention period, the estimated inappropriate prescribing rate decreased to 7.6% (51% reduction, p<0.0001) . Monthly rates during both period s are described in Figure 1 . Several key implementation elements of implementation were identified, such as leadership buy -in and on-site peer champions. Visible and recurring prescribing reminders were useful. To improve adoption, the ASP was integrated into existing workflow. Costs were limited and related to information technology resources to analyze prescribing data and create feedback reports. DISCUSSION The TAP OUT antimicrobial stewardship program was shown to successfully decrease inappropriat e antibiotic prescribing for acute upper respiratory infection diagnoses. The program compiled low -cost, highly effective interventions into a program that met all CDC Core Elements of Outpatient Stewardship. Further, the program focused on interventions a imed at altering prescriber behavior, rather than patient 1 Physicians for a Healthy California (PHC).

Interventions targeting prescribing behavior change of healthcare providers have been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing overall and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing [7] . This project adds to the scant literature on how antibiotic stewardship programs can be implemented in outpatient settings. When planning and implementing the stewardship program, many barriers were identified to changing healthcare providers' prescribing behaviors. Concerns regarding patient satisfaction and competing priorities were discussed with the clinics' medical director. In addition, obtaining patient encounter data to measure the effectiveness of the program involved lengthy discussions with the clinic information technology staff. However, buy -in from clinic champions was key in deciding which stewardship strategies would work in their unique setting. The clinics were motivated to lower their antibiotic prescribing rate for URI as it is tied to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement. There are some limitations of the project. First, all sites were part of the same medical network; thus, certain implementation results may not be generalizable to the general primary and urgent care population. Second , because each patient visit was de -identified, we could not link patient visits to understand the full medical history . It is possible that subsequent visits indica te a bacterial etiology, but this would not have been able to be assessed through a single visit record. Lastly, results were dependent on electronic health record and billing data, which are imperfect for performance measurement, though have demonstrated validity [8]. Having demonstrated effective implementation of the stewardship program , LAC DPH will disseminate best practices to outpatient providers county -wide. We hope to study the effects of the stewardship program on other infection types, including urinary tract infections. REFERENCES 1. Fleming -Dutra KE, Hersh AL, Shapiro DJ, et al.

SNF Symposium Page 19 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report 2017 SYMPOSIUM ON INFECT ION PREVENTION CONTR OL IN SKILLED NURSING FACI LITIES OVERVIEW On September 28, 2017 , the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) Acute Communicable Disease Control (ACDC) program held a symposium for key county skilled nursing facility (SNF) staff responsible for infectious disease outbreak prevention and control . This is the second annual SNF symposium ACDC has held. For information on the first symposium, see ACDC's 2016 Special Report .1 Presentations and related materials for both the 2016 and 2017 symposiums are archived on the ACDC SNF webpage .2 During the 2017 symposium, r epresentatives from local SNFs included directors of nursing, administrators, and infection preventionists . Due to the large number of SNFs in LAC , over 315, attendance was limited to two representatives per facility. The goals of the symposium were to improve partnerships between SNFs and LAC DPH as well as to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases in SNF setting s. The symposium also strived to implement antimicrobial stewardship programs and better management resistant organisms ( MDROs ) in SNFs . Other topics covered include d: immunization recommendations for healthcare personnel and residents, reporting requirements for Carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and how to protect employees from blood -borne pathogens and aerosol transmissible diseases. SUMMARY A total of 108 attendees from 65 local SNFs attended the day -long event. In addition, the event included 23 attendees from ACDC, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Ep idemiology ( APIC ) Greater LA Chapter, representatives from several nursing home consulting compan ies, nursing home corporate consultants , laboratory serving SNFs , and partnering agencies . The topics for the 2017 symposium focused primarily on the preventi on and control of infectious diseases that are common in SNF settings and greatly impact the vulnerable population cared for in these settings. The presenters were representatives from ACDC , LAC DPH's Vaccine Preventable Disease Control (VPDC) Program, guest speakers from UCLA, and other organizations .

SNF Symposium Page 22 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 23 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report OUTBREAK OF EPIDEMIC KERATOCONJUNCTIVITI S CAUSED BY HUMAN ADENOVIRUS TYPE D53 IN AN OPTOMETRY CLINIC , 2017 BACKGROUND On June 22, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) was notified by a medical epidemiologist at Hospital X of seven patients seen at an optometry clinic (Clinic A) on June 8, 2017 who later developed symptoms of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC ).1 This report prompted a cluster investigation by ACDC . EKC is caused by adenovirus .2 It is a contagious , severe form of conjunctivitis that can cause pain and blurry vision for up to four weeks [1]. EKC associated with adenovirus is a frequent cause of outbreaks in eye care settings. Adenovirus is concerning as a healthcare -associated infection due to its high transmission rate, significant ocular morbidity, and hardiness in healthcare environments [2]. Prior outbreaks have been associated with breakdowns in infection prevention practice, including eye drop administration, glove use, and instrument disinfec tion [3]. This report describes ACDC's outbreak investigation and the measures taken to prevent future infections and enhance patient safety. METHODS For this investigation, a case was defined as an individual who had symptom onset between June 5 -July 3, 2017, and had either : 1) a diagnosis by an ophthalmologist or optometrist of EKC, adenoviral conjunctivit is, or viral conjunctivitis; or 2) laboratory confirmation of adenovirus from a specimen collected by conjunctival swab . A healthcare -linked case was defined as a person with a diagnosis or laboratory confirmation (as described in 1 and 2 above) who had visited the optometry clinic (Clinic A) between June 5-July 3, 2017 and had symptom onset within 21 days of that visit. A household case was defi ned as a household and/or family contact of another case , with a diagnosis or laboratory confirmation (as described in 1 and 2 above) and did not visit the clinic prior to symptom onset. Case finding was conducted by phone and medical record review. Medical records from Clinic A were surveyed for all patients with an EKC diagnosis between June 7 -July 3 . To better understand if healthcare - linked transmission possibly occurred during the period when symptomatic EKC case patients presented at the clinic , all p atients who visited the clinic during June 7-21 were called and asked if they were 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis 2 https://www.cdc.gov/adenovirus/index.html Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 24 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report experiencing symptoms of EKC . Case characteristics and exposures were ascertained during medical record review. On June 23rd, ACDC conducted an announced site visit to walk through the premises, observe infection prevention practices, interview staff members, and review infection prevention policies. Cell culture isolates or conjunctival swab specimens from case patients were sent to the LAC DPH Public Health Laboratory (PHL) for conventional and shell vial culture and detection by fluorescent monoclonal antibody stain ing. Specimens from additional case patients were tested by viral culture at the laboratory of H ospital X. Specimens were then subm itted to the California Department of Public Health Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory (CDPH -VRDL) by P HL for adenovirus detection and molecular typing by sequence analysis of the hypervariable region of the adenovirus hexon gene and the adenovirus group - specific region of the fiber gene [4, 5]. RESULTS Medical record review identified 17 cases. Among 805 patients contacted by phone, none reported EKC symptoms . Fourteen patients met the case definition of a healthcare -linked case , and one patient appeared to be the source of introduction into the clinic (hereafter called the primary case ). Two additional cases met the household case definition \u2014both reported a symptomatic spouse prior to their illness . The median patient age of cases was 62 years ( range: 43 -78 years), and 12 cases (70.6%) were women. No hospitalizations resulted from infection, though seven cases (41.2%) had more than one symptomatic visit to the clinic, a hospital emergency department, or an urgent care center. Cases presented with symptoms consistent with EKC, including redness ( 14, 82.3%) and discharge (13, 76.5 %). The mean incubation period was 9 days (range: 5 -19 days). Review of healthcare -linked case -patient clinic visit dates prior to symptom onset revealed two apparent clusters. The primary case visited the clinic on June 7 th with symptoms consistent with EKC , before the initial visits of seven additional case -patients on June 7th and June 8th. On June 20th, one of the case - patient s from the first cluster visited the clinic with EKC symptoms. Another seven case -patients visited the clinic after this case -patient on June 20th and June 21st, prior to the onset of their EKC symptoms (Figure 1). Medical chart review indicated common exposures among the 14 healthcare -linked case -patients \u2014all were seen by the same optometrist in the same exam room following the primary case . No healthcare personnel reported EKC symptoms before or during the outbreak period. Among the 14 healthcare -linked case -patients, o ther exposures include d slit lamp contact (13, 92.3%), tonometry (12, 85.7%), and multi - dose dilating eye drops (10, 66.7%). Use of multi -dose sodium fluorescein eye drops was noted for 6 (86% ) cases in the first cluster and none in the second cluster. During the primary case's initial clinic visit on June 7th, the primary case received sodium fluorescein drops from a multi- use vial and had a slit lamp examination; the slit lamp is connected to the tonometer. Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 25 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report The clinic closed on June 22nd for intensive environmental cleaning of clinic surfaces and equipment , instrument cleaning and disinfection, and providing staff training on infection prevention. The clinic reopened the following day. Several observations were made during the site visit to the clinic. Optometry Clinic A is part of H ospital X's medical network. Staff who provide care at the clinic include three optometrists, one ophthalmologist, and three optometric assistants. The clinic has three exam rooms and averages 1,300 patients per month. Clinic patients begin in the waiting area, then proceed to one of three exam rooms , each with its own slit lamp with tonometer. Site visit observations and staff interviews indicated gaps in infection prevention practices including: using multi -dose eye drops on multiple patients ; occasionally touching the eye or surrounding area; and reprocessing tonometers with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe rather than the recommended 5 -10-minute disinfecting soak with chlorine or ethyl alcohol [2]. Figure 1. Cases of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis by Date of Symptom Onset Optometry Clinic, LAC, June 3 -July 6, 2017 (N=17) Number of Cases Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 26 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Conjunctival swab specimens from four case patients , all symptomatic with conjunctivitis, were sent to the PHL culture \u2014adenovirus was detected in two . Specimens from an additional 11 case -patients were tested at the laboratory of Hospital X , and adenovirus was identified in 6 by viral culture. Of the eight case -patients positive upon culture , specimens were then submitted for human adenovirus (HAdV ) detection and molecular typing\u2014 all 8 HAdV from one patient sample , which was nearly identical to a recently reported WGS of HAdV -D53 from Japan (GenBank sequence LC215428 ). DISCUSSION This report describes an investigation of a cluster of 17 patients in a n optometry center infected with EKC. All cases had either visited the optometry clinic or were household contacts of clinic patients . In conjunction with ACDC's infection prevention assessment s, analysis of the molecular testing for adenovirus indicate that a common source likely served as the mode o f transmission between patients. HAdV -D53 has been recognized as an agent of EKC outbreaks in Japan since 1980 [6, 7, 8] and in Germany since 2005 [9] . However , HAdV -D53 has not previously been reported to the United States National Adenovirus Type Reportin g System and, to our knowledge, this is the first reported EKC outbreak associated with HAdV -D53 in the United States . We asked the index case about travel only. No travel was reported. As the first documented EKC outbreak associated with HAdV -D53 in the United States , this outbreak highlights the need for rigorous implementation of recommended infection prevention practices in eye care settings. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that the virus was introduced to surfaces in the exam room by a sympt omatic patient , and subsequent lapses in infection prevention practice s led to transmission. Prior studies have demonstrated that adenovirus es may persist on environmental surfaces for several weeks [10]. Previous EKC outbreaks in eye care clinics have bee n linked to improper disinfection practices and lapses in hygienic protocols [3] . Observations found deficiencies in tonometer disinfection and multi- use eye drop administration. Enhanced infection prevention practices, including staff education on eye dro p administration and longer slit lamp and tonometer disinfection times were implemented. No further cases were reported after July 3, 2017. To prevent EKC transmission in e ye care settings, recommended practices include the use of disposable tonometer tips, disinfectants efficacious against adenoviruses for tonometers and slit lamp s, and single - use eye drops when available [2,11] . Adherence to r ecommended infection prevention practices is critical to avoid EKC and other healthcare -associated infections. LAC DPH plans to outreach to the optometry and ophthalmology provider community to educate regarding infection prevention. REFERENCES 1. Lu X, Joshi A, Flomenb erg P. Adenoviruses.

Outbreak of Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in an Optometry Clinic Page 28 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Hip and Knee Replacement Post -Operative Page 29 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report INVESTIGATION OF SUR GICA L SITE INFECTIONS IN ORTHOPEDIC HIP AND KNEE REPLACE MENT POST -OPERATIVE AT AN ACUTE CARE HOS PITAL SETTING BACKGROUND Surgical site infections ( SSIs) following orthopedic procedures, including joint repla cement , are significantly rare since evidence -based infection prevention practices related to skin preparation, surgical technique , and prophylaxis of antibiotics are currently the standard of care in orthopedic surgery . In the most recent Nation al Healthcare Safety Network1 report which included data from 2006 to 2008, reported knee replacement posto perative infection rates ranged from 0.68% to 1.60% and hip replacement infection rates ranged from 0.67% to 2.4% [1]. While these infections are extremely uncommon , the ir impact can be significant. SSIs related to orthopedic surgical procedures are associated with increased healthcare costs, morbidity , and even mortality. Moreover, orthopedic SSIs can significantly impact a patient 's quality of life including requiring a prolonged hospital stay and lead ing to physical limitations. On December 15, 2016, a local hospital's infection preventionist (IP) notified the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) Morbidity Unit of a cluster of six cases of SSIs at an acute care hospital (Hospital A) occurring after orthopedic surgeries (knee and hip) from Octobe r to November 2016. The LAC DPH 's Acute Communicable Disease Control Program (ACDC) reviewed the case information . Of the six SSIs, three resulted from knee surgeries and three from hip surgeries. T wo of the six SSIs were classified as deep incisional and four were prosthetic joint infections . Onset of symptoms occurred between 24 to 41 days post -surgery. Cultures from wound sites grew different organisms for each patient . Subsequently, additional cases were reported to ACDC by the hospital's IP. METHODS Case Finding and Definition For this investigation, a case was defined as a patient with an SSI following orthopedic surgery of knee or hip replacement at Hospital A from Octo ber 2016 through January 2017. ACDC reviewed patient medical records , including o perating room (OR) records , as well as patient 's laboratory and microbiology reports. In addition, the IP was instructed to call patients who had ortho pedic surgery of the hip or knee within the time- period to inquire if they had experienced any signs and symptoms of in fection or complications at their surgical site . Investigation and Assessment of Risk Factors : Site Visits Over the course of six months f rom February through June 2017 , ACDC partnered with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Licensing and Certification program to conduct eight unannounced site visits at Hospital A . The site visits consisted of observations in the OR, OR storage area, and the central processing decontamination ( CPD) room . During the visits, several significant lapses in infection control practices were noted and recommendations for control measures were provided. 1 https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Hip and Knee Replacement Post -Operative Page 30 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Case Control Study A 1-to-3 matched case control study was conducted assessing a total of 8 cases and 24 controls . Cases were matched to controls by ag e and surgical site (hip or knee). Medical records were reviewed, including: preoperative history , nursing perioperative notes, the anesthesia report, operative notes, laboratory records , and discharge notes. Standardized c hart abstractions were performed for all cases and controls . RESULTS Case Characterization A total of eight patients met the case definition. Initially, there was a cluster of six cases of SSIs post - orthopedic surgery of knee and hip replacement that occurred between October 20, 2016 th rough November 23, 2016 based on the surgery date . During this time -period, the attack rate was up to 4.4%. Two additional cases occurred after procedures on January 10, 2017 and January 30, 2017. Of the eight case patients , the average age was 68 years old (range : 54 to 86 years old ); seven had multiple comorbidities, including history of osteoarthritis, hypertension , hyperlipidemia, diabetes , and obesity ; five case patients had a BMI above 30. The case patients had an average American Society of Anesthesiologists score2 of 3.1. The overall attack rate for this outbreak was 3.4% for the eight cases . Of the eight SSIs, five were knee surg eries and three were hip surgeries . Cultures from wound sites grew different organisms for each patient, including methicillin -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermi The r eview of cases did not identify a single surgeon or staff member common to all cases. There was no single common skin preparation solution or irrigation solution identified. Case Finding All p atients who underwent orthopedic surgery between October 2016 through January 2017 were either followed up at their post -operative appointment or contacted by the pre -operative staff to identify if they manifested signs and symptoms of infection at their s urgical site. There were 181 patients with hip and knee surgeries between October to December 2016 who were followed up through post -op appointments or phone calls. From January to March 2017, 179 patients with hip and knee surgeries followed up through post-op appointments or phone calls. No additional cases were identified from the follow up post -op appointment or phone calls. Background Surveillance Rate In 2016, there were 2 ,073 surger ies performed at H ospital A and the total number of SSIs w as 18 with an annual SSI rate of 0.86% (0.0086). There were 640 hip and knee orthopedic surgeries performed in 2016 with nine SSIs of knee and hip replacement an annual rate of 1.41% (0.0141). According to t he National Healthcare Safety Network report with data from 2006 to 2008, knee replacement postoperative infection 2 http://www.anzjsurg.com/view/0/ASAscore.html Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Hip and Knee Replacement Post -Operative Page 31 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report rates range from 0.68% to 1.60% and hip replacement infection rates from 0.67% to 2.4%. During the peak of this investigation, there were six cases with in 34 days (October 20, 2016 through Nov emb er 23, 2016), with an attack rate of 4.4% and a total attack rate of 3.4 % from October 2016 through January 2017 (Figure 1). Case Control Study To identify possible risk factors associated with infection , ACDC conducted a case control study. A total of 24 controls were selected from patients who had undergone hip or knee arthroplasty during the outbreak period. A comprehensive medical record revie w was performed using a standardized chart abstraction tool, which included information on the patient's demographics, hospitali zation, and surgical procedure. The study found that patient demographics were similar between cases and controls . Cases and controls did not differ significantly with respect to American Society of Anesthesiologists score, length of hospitalization, day of week on which procedure was performed, anatomical site of procedure, or whether a tourniquet was placed. No s ignificant commonalities among cases versus controls were found with respect to surgeon, other staff, instruments used , or prosthetics used . Overall, we were unable to identify significant patient risk factors from the case control study. Scientific literature suggested that the utiliza tion of immediate -use steam sterilization during a procedure may play a role in surgical site infections [2]. However, we were unable to inspect the role of immediate -use steam sterilization in this outbreak due to incomplete logs and printouts. Figure 1. Surgical Site Infections among Post -Orthopedic Surgery Patients Hospital A, 2016 -2017 Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Hip and Knee Replacement Post -Operative Page 32 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Final Recommendations In addition to interim recommendations provided throughout this investigation, ACDC issued the following final recommendations to prevent or limit future infections: Ensure the early identification of new SSIs associated with hip and knee replacements through surveillance with immediate reporting of new cases to ACDC. Update policies and procedures in CPD and OR on an annual basis. Ensure the comprehensive documentation of immedi ate-use steam sterilization in the OR logs. Continue to monitor adherence to the policies and procedures in the CPD and ensure the y are being followed by CPD staff. DISCUSSION AND CONCL USIONS ACDC investigated e ight cases of SSIs from multiple organisms f ollowing associated orthopedic (knee and hip replacement) surgeries . Cases were identified among patients during October 2 016 through January 2017. The overall attack rate for this out break was 3.4% during this time -period. Despite multiple site visits by ACDC and CDPH Licensing and Certification as well as an outside consultant, we continued to observe lapses in infection control practices among the staff who worked in the CPD and OR core area. Following our recommendation s, the facility improved competenc ies among their CPD staff by providing trainings on cleaning and sterilizing of the surgical instruments and documented the staff training. The overall cleanliness of the CPD and OR core area improved throughout the investigation and infection control prac tices also improved among the associated staff. Based on our investigation, we hypothesized that multiple factors may have contributed to the outbreak of SSIs among the orthopedic patients, including improper cleaning and sterilization of the surgical instruments in the CPD and OR core area, use of imme diate -use steam sterilization during procedures, staffing changes in CPD, and an increase in census of orthopedic surgeries. A case control study was conducted, but no signi ficant risk factors were identified. During the outbreak investigation, the facility's i nfection control staff, hospital administration, OR and CPD staff all contributed to the overall improvement of the conditions and infection control practices to reduce SSIs in the facility. The IP continued to be in contact with ACDC until December 1, 2017, to provide status on any new possible cases. No addition al associated positive cultures reported since March 22, 2017.

Th is outbreak occurred in the context of several other large outbreaks in California1 and nationally .2 The largest hepatitis A outbreak in California occurred in San Diego County, where the outbreak began in March of 2017 and resulted in 582 confirmed cases by the time the local health emergency ended in January 2018 and mostly involved persons experiencing homelessness or IDU. Given the proximity to San Diego County and the extensive travel between LA C and San Diego, the LA C Department of Public Health (DPH) closely monitored for potential HAV introduction and spread in LA C. In July 2017, hepatitis A illness was identified in two homeless persons in LAC who had lived in San Diego at the time of acquiring the virus. A health advisory was released to inform healthcare professionals. 3 In September 2017 , HAV also was identified in two LA C residents experiencing homelessness who did not have any links to an outbreak -associated region . Because this possibly indicated local HAV transmission LAC DPH declared a local outbreak of hepatitis A and a health alert was issued.4 Subsequently, LAC DPH held a webinar5 in Nov ember and issued a health alert update in March 2018.6 The Incident Command System ( ICS) was activated to coordinate the LAC DPH hepatitis A outbreak response. The ICS leadership identified 4 strategies for controlling the outbreak: 1. Enhancing surveillance and case containment 2. Increasing vaccination 3. Improving sanitation 4. Educating community and stakeholders The primary objective of this report is to describe the epidemiology of the hepatitis A outbreak cases identified through enhanced surveillance in LAC in 2017. Secondarily, the re port will briefly summarize results of the activities to increase vaccination , sanitation, and education. METHODS Enhanced Surveillance The Acute Communicable Disease Control Program of LAC DPH initiated enhanced surveillance to identify acute HAV cases among the homeless and drug using populations from Ju ne through December 2017. 1 https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Hepatitis -A-Outbreak.aspx 6 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eprp/Health%20Alerts/HAV%20outbreak%20update%203.15.18%20final.pdf Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 36 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Case Definition s Minimal Criteria : Confirmed acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection meets the Counsel of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definitions for an acute case of hepatitis A :7 (1) discrete onset of any sign or symptom consistent with acute viral hepatitis (fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) , and (2) jaundice and/or elevated serum amin otransferase levels, and (3) immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti- HAV) positive. Confirmed Outbreak Case : A person who meets the CSTE clinical case definition and is laboratory confirmed, OR, a case that meets the clinical case definition and occurs in a person who has an epidemiologic link with a person who has laboratory -confirmed hepatitis A. Cases were either identified as homeless, homeless and using illicit drugs, men who have sex with men (MSM) and using illicit drugs, using illicit drugs or homeless secondary cases. Cases were counted if they were exposed in another county but had onset in LAC. Case Identification The California Code of Regulations (Title 17, Section 2500) requires healthcare providers to report acute hepatitis A cases within one working day of identification .8 In addition, most LAC clinical laboratories automatically report positive hepatitis A IgM antibody tests via the electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) system. In response to the outbreak , providers were requested to immediately report suspected/confirmed hepatitis A in a pers on experiencing homeless to facilitate: - timely interview by LAC DPH staff before cases are discharged to the street and potentially lost to follow -up, - identification of contacts who could benefit from preventive therapy, and - case placement in a recuperativ e care facility during the infectious period to prevent further disease transmission. Case Investigation A supplemental form was created for interviewing persons experiencing homelessness or using illicit drugs. It was expected that data from the suppleme ntal forms could guide the ICS leadership response to the outbreak by better defining the epidemiology of outbreak -associated cases and characterizing risk factors for disease. Laboratory Testing Clinical laboratorie s were contacted to determine if serum samples were available for all confirmed cases identified as homeless and/or using illicit drugs. If available, specimens were submitted to the LAC Public Health Laboratory (PHL ) for shipment to the California Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory ( VRDL ) for confirmation 7 https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis -a-acute/case -definition/2012/ 8 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/ReportableDiseaseListSept2018.pdf Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 37 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Vaccination Outreach Increasing the proportion of the at -risk population immune to hepatitis A through vaccination was identified as the best tool for preventing hepatitis A illness and decreasing HAV transmission. Vaccinations were included as a service provided by LAC DPH supported street outreach teams targeting homeless persons. Vaccination was also promoted to persons who had close frequent contact with homeless people including first responders, persons who serve food to the homeless, and sanitation personnel. The LAC jail systems offered vaccine to new inmates . LAC DPH community c linics offered vaccines at no charge to those at risk. Health insurance plans and community providers were engaged in the campaign, with the larger health plans offering h epatitis A vaccine to at -risk members at no c harge through walk -in clinics. Vaccines were also distributed by LAC DPH to community providers that serve at-risk populations. Hygiene and Sanitation Outreach LAC includes 88 cities as well as large unincorporated areas. LAC DPH coordinated with all cities and other county departments such as the Departments of Public Works, Parks and Recreation , and the Sheriff to improve sanitation conditions for per sons experiencing homelessness. Many homeless persons in LAC have created makeshift structures and dwellings which serve as their homes, often creating these in clusters in a small area which is then recognized as a homeless encampment. Due to poor access to h ygiene facilities, living in a homeless encampment can serve as a major risk factor to acquire and transmit HAV . LAC DPH, in partnership with Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority ( LAHSA) and Department of Public Works, conducted surveys of homeless enca mpments throughout LAC to assess where additional toilets, showers, and hand washing facilities were most needed, and developed plans with cities to increase toilet, shower and hand washing facilities in these areas. In close partnership with the LAHSA, LAC DPH Environmental Health (EH) , inspected and provided educational materials to homeless shelters across LAC. The educational materials provided guidance on the proper cleaning of facilities and laundering of bedding to protect homeless residents from ac quiring and transmitting HAV . A toolkit was developed with template resources and policies for staff at homeless shelters to support their efforts to improve sanitation conditions in their shelters. Additionally, teleconference calls were held to address r eal life questions and co ncerns among shelter providers. Finally, since transmission of HAV among food handlers is of heightened concern, there was a concerted effort to assure that restaurants across LAC were aware of the outbreak and taking measures to reduce the risk of transmission among their workers . Educational Outreach The educational outreach efforts aimed to educate key community groups and stakeholders as quickly as possible. The outreaches consisted of holding in -person group meetings, sending informational letters, stakeholder targeted teleconferences, and targeted education of healthcare professionals. A major public awareness campaign was launched, including strategic engagement with the media to support broad dissemi nation of information, and print media advertisement throughout various public transportation Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 38 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report bus and rail lines to promote awareness, hand -washing and vaccination. The countywide 211 information line staff were trained, and the 211 -line was used as a prim ary source for answering questions from the public . The engagement with media included various press briefings, teleconferences, and press releases. Educational materials targeting specific at -risk populations were prepared in English, Spanish, and other threshold languages. Examples of health education materials developed include those targeting first responders, employees with direct contact with homeless people, food handlers, and men who have sex with men. Our educational outreach materials were posted on our webpages .9 RESULTS Epidemiology of Outbreak Cases From May 1 to December 31, 2017, 17 total outbreak cases were identified that met the confirmed case definition ( Table 1). The first identified outbreak -associated case had symptom onset during the week of May 28 and the last case had symptom onset during the week of December 17. Of the 17 outbreak - associated cases that developed symptoms while in LA C, 13 were LA C residents with three being secondary cases identified as part of outbreak at a mental health hospital (Table 1 ). Three IDU cases also identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). The median age of all cases was 36 years ( minimum - maximum : 24-64 years ); 15 (88% ) were male; 14 (82%) cases were white (Table 2 ). Most cases were from SPA 4 (n= 7, 41%) and SPA 7 (n =5, 29%) , 11 (65%) cases were hospitalized , and there were no deaths. Table 1.

Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 40 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Vaccination Outreach LAC DPH conducted 486 vaccination outreaches, including 297 that targeted homeless populations, 28 at substance use treatment centers, 82 for first responders, and 14 at the jails. A total of 33,866 hepatitis A vaccine doses were either administered by LAC DPH (12,393 doses) or distributed to community partners (14,800 doses) to administer to at -risk persons. During the outbreak response, hepatitis A doses were administered for 7,395 for homeless persons, 777 for persons at substance use treatment centers, 10,964 for jail inmates and parolees, and 6,160 for first responders. Hygiene and Sanitation Outreach As part of the outbreak response, EH distributed hepatitis A educational flyer s to over 37,000 food facilities . All homeless shelters are regularly inspected through the EH Housing and Institutions Program. A total of 52 homeless shelters were inspected during the outbreak and provided with information on hepatitis A including the importance of proper hand washing by food handlers. Education Outreach Immediately after declaring a local outbreak, LAC DPH engaged 17 distinct stakeholder groups, including city leaders, homeless service providers, healthcare providers, substance user disorder treatment providers, firs t responders including police and fire agencies, veteran's affairs agencies, schools and colleges, mental health service providers, and LGBTQ providers. Over 100,000 individual stakeholders received letters and educational information and were invited to p articipate in targeted teleconference calls. Additionally, over the course of the next 4 months, over 500 in -person educational training outreach sessions were conducted at various community settings, including with homeless service providers, substance us e disorder providers, jails, and first responder agencies. Within the first two weeks of the response efforts, there were over 80 news print articles and 14 televised segments covering the Hepatitis A outbreak and response efforts in LAC . DISCUSSION The number of hepatitis A cases in persons experiencing homeless or using illicit drugs in LAC was substantially lower than the number of cases observed in San Diego. It is unclear why the hepatitis A outbreak remained contained in LAC , despite having a la rger population of persons experiencing homelessness and a lower number of vaccines distributed compared with San Diego. One possible reason for the successful containment of the outbreak in LAC could be the activation of ICS early in the outbreak. The ICS structure facilitated improved coordination of the outbreak response across all relevant LAC DPH Programs , and it assisted with recruiting and targeting additional resources towards t he outbreak control activities. According to CDC, the incidence of hepa titis A among adults in the United States has increased since 2014. Paradoxically, the increased hepatitis A incidence might be a consequence of the US childhood vaccination policy. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , the per centage of U.S. adults immune to hepatitis A infection has declined from 1999 -2006 to 2009 -2012. Prior to the licensure of the hepatitis A vaccine in 1995, there were regular large hepatitis A outbreaks that resulted in immunity among exposed adults. Those outbreaks ceased with universal vaccination of children for hepatitis A. As Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 41 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report a result, there is now a large population of adults who are not immune to hepatitis A because they were too old to benefit from the changes in childhood hepatitis A vaccine policy , but they are not old enough to have been exposed to the historic hepatitis A epidemics. The growing population of adults not immune to hepatitis A represents a population susceptible t o future hepatitis A outbreaks. Although the hepatitis A outbreak of 2017 appears to have ended, the conditions that predisposed the outbreak persist in LAC, such as the large population of persons experiencing homelessness who are not immune to hepatitis A and who do not have access adequate hygiene and sanitation services. Therefore, LAC DPH will remain vigilan t for acute HAV cases and respond immediately to control potential outbreaks . Hepatitis A Outbreak Page 42 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 43 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report NOROVIRUS SUSPECT FOODBORNE OUTBREAK AT A LOS ANGELES COU NTY RESTAURANT BACKGROUND On December 18, 2017 the Los Angeles County D epartment of Public Health (LAC DPH) received a Foodborne Illness Report (FBIR )1 from the Corporate Wellness Coordinator of a fast food chain restaurant. One of their restaurants, restaurant A (RA), identified gastrointestinal illness in 11 employees. Most of the cases occurred during the week of December 10, 2017 with symptoms including diarrhea, weakness, vomiting , and body aches. Between December 13th to December 21st, LAC DPH received 1 2 more FBIRs describin g 17 additional persons with similar gastrointestinal illness . Three ill employees of R A were also employees of a neighboring restaurant, r estaurant B (RB). The LAC DPH Acute Communicable Disease Control program (ACDC) launched an investigation to explore the scope of the outbreak, identify possible risk factors, and determine the necessary procedures to prevent further spread of illness. METHODS ACDC coordinated the investigation of illness at both restau rants . First, ACDC partnered with the Corporate Wellness Coordinator for RA to assemble a line list for all employees. ACDC then gathered information on menu items offered for consumption at RA and developed three types of questionnaires. The first was a s tandard questionnaire for patrons of RA to gather information on date and foods consumed at RA, plus symptom type, onset , and illness histories. These interviews were conducted by telephone and the contact information (for both cases and controls) was obtained from the multiple FBIRs submitted to ACDC . The second standard questionnaire was drafted for employees of RA to gather information on job duties, foods consumed during a typical work s hift, symptom type, onset, and illness histories. These interviews were also conducted by telephone. The third standardized questionnaire was drafted for employees of RB to gather job duty, food and symptom histories . These questionnaires were emailed to t he RB manager for distribution to all employees of that restaurant. In addition, ACDC staff conducted a site visit and dropped off stool collection kits to staff of RA. The LAC DPH Environmenta l Health Services (EHS) 2 Wholesale Food and Safety (WFS) conducted a n inspection of RA to observe food handling, cooking, and cleanliness practices . WFS contacted RB to collect employee illness information considering that there were employees that worked in both places . Management from RA cooperated with the investigation, made employees available for interviews , and coordinated the distribution , pick -up, and recollection of stool kits from employees for delivery to Community Health Services (CHS) .3 Service Planning Area 4 served as the collection point for stool specimens collected from RA employees by RA management. These samples were then picked up by courier and delivered to the Public Health Laboratory ( PHL). The PHL tested all submitted http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/EH/SSE/FoodMilk/reportillness.htm 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eh/index.htm 3 http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/chs/index.htm Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 44 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report using a BioFire FilmArrayTM Gastrointestinal Panel and a norovirus reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).4 ACDC d efined a case as any individual who ate at RA anytime between December 10 -15, 2017 and: a) tested positive for norovirus , or b) was symptomatic with diarrhea and vomiting , or c ) was symptomatic with diarrhea or vomiting plus two of the following symptoms : nausea, fatigue, headache, body aches, chills, and fever . If cases reported an incubation time of less than 12 hours or greater than 48 hours , they were excluded from analyses , as this did not fit the known incubation period for norovirus . A control was defined as any asymptomatic individual who ate at RA between December 10 -15, 2017 and did not have a positive lab oratory result for norovirus . RESULTS RA is a fast food establishment that prepares fresh food orders for the public in an assembly line fashion with each grouping of ingredients, chosen by the patron, placed into the meal by separate line staff , and are not heated after preparation . Food can be eaten in the restaurant or taken to -go. There is one restroom in the restaurant for both employees and restaurant patrons to s hare. ACDC interviewed all 29 RA employees , and s tool was collected on 2 5 of the employees ( 86%). Three employees of RA also worked next door at RB. In view of this connection, the employees of RB were interviewed for illness history \u201416 of the 21 RB -only e mployees were interviewed (76%). All told, A CDC interviewed 61 persons , which included employees from R A and RB, as well as RA patrons. Of these 61 interviews, 23 (38%) met the case definition , and 11 were included as controls. The remaining 27 were excluded from the analysis because they did not meet the case definition. The dates of onset for the 23 people who met case definition ranged from December 12 -17, 2017 (Figure 1 ). 4 https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22766 Figure 1. Norovi rus Epidemic Curve at Restaurant A by Onset Date LAC, 2017 (n=20) Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 45 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Cases A total of 23 individuals met the case definition. This included 13 RA employees, 1 RB employee, and 9 RA patrons. Laboratory confirmation for norovirus was obtained for 16 of the 23 cases (69%). Of the 23 cases, 61% were female (Table 1 ). Case age s ranged from 14 to 48 years with a median of 2 3 years. Most c ases were between the ages of 20 to 49 years . The three most common s ymptoms were : nausea (87%), vomiting (78%), and fatigue (74%) . Only t wo cases had a f ever 102\u00b0 F ( 9%). The median incubation was 28 hours with a range of 12 to 48 hours . The median duration was 2 days with a range of 8 hours to 5 days (Table 2 ). Table 1. Case Demographics (N=23) Table 2.

Foods from RA were analyzed by arrangement (i.e. burrito, bowl, quesadilla, taco) as well as by individual ingredients available for inclusion into these arrangements. No food items were statistically associated with illness at the p 0.05 level . Inspection The EHS WFS inspection of RA revealed the following violations: 1) inadequate immersion times for sanitizing food use utensils , and 2) p otentially hazardous foods held at unapproved temperatures . All violations were addressed and corrected immediately by restaurant management during the inspection. Food items held at unapproved temperatures were disposed of at the time of inspection.

The PHL reported that all the confirmed norovirus samples from this outbreak belong to the same genotype, GII.P16 -GII.2. Norovirus is part of the family Caliciviridae. It is highly contagious and can transmit disease with as few as 18 viral particles [1]. Infected individuals can even shed the virus before they know they are ill [1]. Norovirus is most often transmitted via a fecal o ral route with illness onset 12 -48 hours after ingestion of contaminated food, direct person -to-person contact, or contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus can be spread to the environment via the stool or vomitus of infected people [1]. It is the most co mmonly Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 47 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report reported cause of gastrointestinal (GI) illness in the United States and worldwide [1]. Norovirus infections can occur year- round, but about half of all cases occur between December and February in the northern hemisphere [2]. CaliciNet, a database designed to collect surveillance data about this family of viruses, reported that California had the highest number of confirmed norovirus outbreaks (44) between the months of September 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017 [2]. Surveillance data collected by LAC DPH fo r non - foodborne GI illness in LAC showed that the month of December 2017 had the second highest occurrence of GI illness outbreaks in the community for the last six years (Figure 2). The method by which this outbreak spread is unclear. The most likely means of transmission is through a food item contaminated by an ill employee. This theory is supported by the finding that the first few persons to become symptomatic in this outbreak were food preparation employees for RA. Most RA employees reported eating at the restaurant during every shift. Another possibility is that this illness was passed from person to person as infected individuals could have touched potentially contaminated common surfaces while dining, working or living together, or sharing the same bathroom with infected individuals. This web of work, home, social, and public connections among RA and RB employees prevented ACDC from bei ng able to identify a definitive source of this outbreak. PREVENTION AND EDUCATION To prevent the spread of illness in their facility, RA management implemented an in -house norovirus protocol which, in part, included : disposing of all ready to eat foods in the kitchen, enacting employee hand washing monitoring every 30 minutes , providing employee education on the spread of norovirus , and implementing a complete disinfection of the kitchen. RA also i mmediately removed i ll employees Figure 2 . Number of Non -Food GI Outbreaks For the Month of December LAC, 2012 -2017 Norovirus Outbreak at an LAC Restaurant Page 48 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report from work with three days paid leave per policy and c alled all other employees due to arrive at work to check for symptoms of illness. ACDC provides education on norovirus during and/or after interviewing both patrons and employees. In additi on to the inspection, EHS WFS provides the restaurant with literature about norovirus and how to prevent its spread in a restaurant setting. LIMITATIONS One limitation of this investigation was that all the RA employees reported eating at the restaurant d uring every shift worked. With norovirus having an incubation range of 12-48 hours, it was difficult to know which meal likely exposed individuals to norovirus . Employees reported when they last worked prior to illness , and this was verified by the electronic time- keeping report provided by RA. Some cases could recall exactly what they ate. Others had a more general recall, such as being able to name the types of foods they might typi cally eat during the work week ; howev er, they were unable to specify which days specifi c food items were eaten . These limitations made it difficult to determine accurate incubation times as measured from specific meals consumed as well as the ability to ascertain which if any foods might be implicated in the outbreak . CONCLUSION This was an outbreak of n orovirus with no specific source identified . There have been no further complaints against RA at this specific location beyond December 29, 2017. ACDC , in conjunction with EHS WFS , will continue to monitor for future reports of illnesses. REFERENCES 1. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .

Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 49 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report FIRST PROBABLE LOCALLY -ACQUIRED CHAGAS DISEASE CASE LOS ANGELES COUNTY, 201 7 INTRODUCTION Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis ,1 is a parasitic infection that is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi found only in the Americas where approximately 8 million people are infected [1] . The estimated 300,000 infections in the United States (U S) are mainly attributed to residents who have migrated from Latin American countries [1-3]. Transmission is usually linked to poor housing conditions in which the insect vector , triatomine bugs ,2 thrives and is commo nly associated with rural areas of Latin America [1]. Less than 50 locally transmitted human infections have been documented in the US since the first case was identified in 1955 [4,5] . Of the two known locally transmitted cases in California, only one experienced acute disease. This case was a resident of Tuolumne County who was diagnosed with Chagas disease in 1982 [6-8]. The other case was an asymptomatic infection in a resident of Ventura County. This report describes the first documented case of acute Chagas disease with probable local transmission in Los Angeles County (LAC) . BACKGROUND Trypanosoma cruzi is transmitted to humans primarily through contact with the feces of infected blood - feeding triatomine bugs (family Reduviidae), also called \"kissing\" or \"conenose\" bugs. In California, the primary reservoir is the woodrat ( Neotoma sp ) 3 [9]. At least 23 additional species of mammalian wildlife also have been documented as animal reservoirs for the parasite in US [6]. Other modes of transmission include blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and v ertical (mother -to-child) transmission [1]. Chagas disease has an acute and chronic phase. Acute disease can be mild or asymptomatic and parasites may be found in the circulating blood. Symptoms may consist of fever, malaise, and swelling around the site where the parasite entered the skin or mucous membranes. The chronic phase of Chagas disease may also be asymptomatic, and during this time few or no parasites are found in the blood. An estimated 20 - 30% of chronic cases will develop debilitating or life -threatening dysfunction of the heart and/or digestive 1 https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/epi.html 2 https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/gen_info/vectors/index.html 3 https://www.britannica.com/animal/woodrat Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 50 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report tract. People who are immunosuppressed may experience reactivation of Chagas disease, with a corresponding resurgence of parasitemia [1]. CASE INVESTIGATION In September 2017, a patient with travel histo ry to a Latin American country approximately 18 months prior, was reported to the LAC Department of Public Health ( DPH) with a positive rapid diagnostic test for malaria. The patient was admitted to an acute care hospital with ongoing fever and rash. Blood smears did not detect malaria parasites but instead revealed T. cruzi parasites. Commercially available IgG antibody testing for T. cruzi also returned positive. Smear review and molecular testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed at the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed T. cruzi infection. Though only one of two serological tests at CDC routinely performed for confirmation were initially reactive, additional testing by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) later confirmed th e infection (Table 1 ). Table 1. Diagnostic Blood Tests of Chagas Case LAC, 2017 Date of Collection Type of Test Result of Test Laboratory 9/12/17 Parasite Blood Exam Detected Hospital 9/13/17 T. (IFA) Reactive (1:256) CDC The patient had no pertinent past medical history. Thirty -five days prior to admission he was treated with trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole for a lesion on his shoulder, diagnosed as cellulitis. Five days later he developed fever to 39.4 \u00b0C with an erythematous, non -pruritic rash over the trunk and limbs, headache, and a dry cough. He was seen by several physicians during multiple emergency room visits and was treated with antibiotics and steroids, including prednisone and hydroxychloroquine. Upon CDC confirmation of Chagas dise ase, the patient initiated benznidazole therapy that was provided as part of an expanded access investigational new drug (IND) protocol operated by the CDC. Results of PCR testing performed six weeks after completion of therapy were negative. Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 51 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report The patient was born and raised in southern California and had been residing in a rural area of western LAC for the past 17 years. The patient reported occasionally seeing triatomine bugs in his home in recent years . He also reported ticks on his pet dogs and a neighb or who kept sheep. He described a current rat infestation in his home and had been handling dead rodents to dispose of them after trapping. The patient also previously lived in other domestic and international locations where Chagas disease is not endemic. Approximately 20 to 25 years prior, he took frequent short trips to Baja California, Mexico. Earlier in 2017, he traveled to other parts of California, but reported staying in well- built structures and denied insect exposures. His most recent foreign travel occurred 18 months prior to admission. On this trip, he visited a Latin American country in which Chagas disease is endemic, but stayed in an enclosed, air- conditioned dwelling with doors and screens. He denied insect bites or exposures there and was well between the time of his return and the presenting illness. The LAC DPH and California Dep artment of Public Health (CDPH) conducted an environmental investigation at the patient's residence and surrounding areas. Inspection of the property revealed evidence of rodents inside the home (i.e., droppings) and openings on the exterior that were large enough to allow rodent entry into the walls of the house. Rockwork around the house and climbing ivy provided attractive harborage for triatomines. An attempt to collect triatomine bugs in late September was unsuccessful. However, CDPH i nvestigators were able to trap five rodents in late October: two Peromyscus boylii (brush mice) and three Neotoma macrotis (wood rats). Rodent blood and tissue specimens that were sent to the University of Georgia for analysis did not yield positive results for T. cruzi infection. DISCUSSION This is the first confirmed case of Chagas disease documented in LAC that was acquired via probable local vector transmission. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive blood smear and PCR indicative of acute infection with T. cruzi and supported by an appropriate clinical presentation. The rural environmental setting of the patient's home residence, where triatomine bugs are common, in addition to the patient's recollection of triatomine bugs inside his home, support the plausibility o f vector -borne transmission. Environmental studies have shown that up to 36% of Triatoma protracta, California's most widespread and common triatomine bug, collected in LAC are infected with T. cruzi [10,11] . In homes, the bugs can find refuge in beds, uph olstered furniture, and animal bedding, emerging nightly to feed upon people and their pets [12]. Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 52 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Confirmation of the location where the patient acquired his infection, either locally or abroad, is complicated by his travel history, medical history, and ambiguous serological testing results conducted at CDC. Because Chagas disease is often asymptomatic, it can be many years before the infection is recognized or chronic symptoms manifest. Recrudescence of a previously acquired infection is possible in the s etting of steroid therapy. However, experts at the CDC believe that the level of immunosuppression that the patient received likely was not sufficient for such a response. Additional serological testing that was performed at the conclusion of the case inve stigation could not definitively define the timing of his infection. Additional serological testing in the following years may provide that evidence; however, even that is uncertain. Locally transmitted vector- borne transmission of Chagas disease in the US is rare. However, human cases may not be well documented given variability in patient testing and reporting to local and state health departments. Only six states in the US mandate Chagas disease reporting, and it is not a reportable condition in Califo rnia [13]. Without comprehensive human case surveillance, epidemiology and transmission risk of Chagas disease in LAC is not well known or defined. Though this is the first documented case of probable locally transmitted Chagas disease in LAC, there may ha ve been prior cases that were missed due to underdetection of Chagas disease. Experts have postulated that the low incidence of vector -borne transmission in the US may be explained by delayed defecation exhibited by local triatomine bugs (which would reduce transmission efficacy), by limited exposure to the vectors, and by low T. cruzi infection rates among triatomine bugs [11]. However , experimental studies have demonstrated that some triatomine bugs may defecate immediately upon feeding [14]. As construction, development, and suburbanization in LAC and the US encroaches upon woodrat and triatomine bug habitat, there will be increasing opportunities for residents to become exposed to T. cruzi and local prevalence studies indicate that vector infection rates are not insignificant in southern California [10,11] . Additionally, molecular studies show that local strains of T. cruzi are genetically similar to those in Latin America, suggesting that no differences in infectivity or virulence should be observed [10]. This case serves as an important reminder that local transmission of Chagas disease may occur more frequently than presumed in LAC. Local providers should include acute T. cruzi infection in the differential Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 53 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report diagnosis of fever o f unknown origin in patients with appropriate environmental exposure, even without travel to traditionally endemic areas. Similarly, providers should consider chronic Chagas infection in rural area residents of LAC with unexplained heart disease or symptom s consistent with gastrointestinal Chagas disease. REFERENCES 1.

Locally Acquired Chagas Disease Case Page 54 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Botulism Summary Page 55 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report BOTULISM CASE REPORT SUMMARY LOS ANGELES COUNTY, 2017 Botulism is a rare but serious and potentially fatal paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum . The bacterial spores that cause botulism are common in both soil and water and produce botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. There are five main kinds of botulism: 1) Foodborne botulism can be triggered by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, storebought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin; 2) Wound botulism can be triggered by spores of the bacteria getting into a wound and making toxin. People who inject drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism in Los Angeles County (LAC) . Wound botulism has also occurred in people after a traumatic injury such as a motorcycle accident or surgery; 3) Infant botulism can be triggered by the spores of the bacteria getting into an infant's intestines. The spores grow and produce the toxin, which causes illness; 4) Adult intestinal toxemia (also known as adult intestinal toxemia) botulism is a very rare kind of botulism that can be triggered by spores of the bacteria getting into an adult's intestines, growing, and producing the toxin (similar to infant botulism). Although the cause of this kind of botulism is unknown , people who have serious health conditions that affect the gut may be more likely to get sick; 5) Latrogenic botulism can occur if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons such as for wrinkles or medical reasons such as for migraine headaches or cervical dystonia. Because botulism infections may be fatal, they are considered medical emergencies ; accordingly, reporting of suspected cases is mandated by the LAC Department of Public Health (DPH) immediately by telephone. Specialized antitoxin is used to treat botulism, which can only be released when authorized by LAC DPH or the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Testing for case confirmation by mouse bioassay can be conducted at the LAC DPH Public Health Laboratory and matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time offlight (MALDITOF) is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Clinically compatible cases with botulinum toxin detected by either mouse bioassay or MALDI TOF are considered confirmed cases. The CDPH Division of Communicable Disease Control is responsible for the investigation and surveillance of infant botulism cases identified in the county and across the state. LAC DPH is responsible for reporting suspected cases of infant botulism to CDPH's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program1 for their investigation. The number of confirmed botulism cases (noninfant botulism) in LAC fluctuates from year to year. For the past five years, an average of three cases were confirmed annually. The botulism cases in LAC usually have injection drug use as a risk factor. Foodborne botulism in LAC is rare, in the past 10 years only one instance of foodborne botulism was reported with two associated cases confirmed (2012). 1 https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/InfantBotulism.aspx Botulism Summary Page 56 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report In 2017, nine cases of suspected botulism were reported in LAC including four out ofcounty cases who received medical care at hospitals in LAC . These four outofcounty suspected cases were referred to the health department in the patient's county of residence . Upon notification and review of case history and symptoms, ACDC physicians authorized the release and use of botulism antitoxin for six suspected botulism cases, and the state released three antitoxins. Ultimately, two were classified as confirmed cases (laboratoryconfirmed by MALDI TOF, with negative mouse bioassay), and one was classified as a probable case (due to negative laboratory testing but with clinically compatible findings and history of injection drug use). Only t wo suspected cases were determined not to be botulism based on absence of risk factors, negative botulism testing, and an alternate diagnosis of acute flaccid myelitis and lithium toxicity. A botulism outbreak was also investigated during 2017. In April 2017, public health authorities at the LAC DPH, the Orange County Healthcare Agency, and CDPH investigated an outbreak of botulism consisting of two cases , both adult residents of Orange Count y, and associated with an herbal tea product produced by a facility in LAC. LAC DPH released a press release ,2 health alerts3 were disseminated to healthcare providers , warnings were issue d to consumers in LAC , Orange County , and California, and the product was recalled .4 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=1652 3 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/hccp/alerts.htm 4 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eh/recall/2017/recallList_May.htm Influenza 2017- 2018 Season Summary Page 57 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE OVERVIEW : 2017-2018 SEASON SUMMARY OVERVIEW The traditional influenza surveillance season begins in October and ends mid -May of th e following year, covering a 32-week period. Los Angeles County (LAC) uses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR)1 weeks to refer to surveillance weeks, with week 1 correspon ding to the first week in January. The 2017 -18 season (October 1, 2017 -May 13, 2018) in LAC had higher influenza activity than the previous 5 influenza seasons. Peak activity occurred during week 52 (December 24 -30, 2017) when 50% of respiratory specimens tested by sentinel labs were positive for influenza ( Table 1 ). In addition, syndromic surveillance detected the highest proportion of visits to emergency departments for influenza -like-illness (ILI) during that same week ( Figure 1 ). This season also saw the greatest number of influenza -associated deaths reported since these deaths became reportable in LAC in 2010. The greatest weekly number of influenza -associated deaths ( N=54) occurred during week 1 (December 31, 2017 -January 6, 2 018). Of confirmed deaths with positive influenza test results received during the 2017 -18 season, 66% were influenza A viruses ( Table 1 ). 2016-17 Peak Week 52* YTD** Data Positive Flu Tests/Total Tests 2971/5926 6,855/107,199 6,855/68,732 (Percent Positive Flu A/B 87/13 66/34 92/8 Outbreaks Community Respiratory Outbreaks 6 67 35 Influenza Confirmed Outbreaks 5 77 30 Total 11 144 65 Influenza-Associated Deaths Pediatric Flu Deaths 0 2 1 Adult Flu Deaths 61 276 76 Total 61 278 77 Conf irmed inf luenza death is def ined by a posit ive lab test, ILI symptoms, and clear progression from illness to death2017-18Table 1.

MMWR. www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html Influenza 2017- 2018 Season Summary Page 58 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report SENTINEL LABORATORY DATA Nine sentinel laboratories serving healthcare providers and institutions across LAC reported weekly influenza and other respiratory virus data to the LAC Department of Public Health (DPH) this season (Figure 2) . Although individual cases of influenza are not reportable to LAC DPH, analyzing data from these sentinel labs provides information on influenza and other respiratory virus es circulating in the county. This season, a total of 107,199 respiratory isolate tests were reported to LAC DPH ( Table 1 ). This season, influenza activity began to increase at the beginning of December, peaked at the during Week 52 (Dec 24-30, 2017) and stayed high through March. There was a decline in influenza activity in January and February, b ut activity trended upwards again in March corresponding with increased influenza B activity. Other viruses co-circulated with influenza, contributing to the overall impact of respiratory illness in LAC. During this season, the majority of influenza positi ve sp ecimens were influenza A (66%). Figure 1 .

A total of 278 influenza -associated deaths (IADs) have been confirmed in LAC this season .3 There were more deaths reported this season than any season since LAC DPH initiated mandatory reporting. The majority of deaths (79%) occurred in those 65 years of age and older ( N=219), which is consistent with other influenza A H3N2 predominant seasons that more severely affect the 65 and older population (Figure 3). During i nfluenza A H3N2 seasons, the 65+ age group accounts for a greater proportion of IADs compared to influenza A H1N1 predominant seasons (Table 2). 2 LAC DPH.

Demographic Characteristics of Influenza Fatalities LAC 2012-2018 Age (years) Gender Race RESPIRATORY OUTBREAK S The total number of respiratory outbreaks confirmed in LAC decreased to 48, compared with 58 during the previous season. The majority of respiratory outbreaks this season occurred in schools or pre -schools (46%), followed by skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) (29%) (Table 3 ). Respiratory outbreak definitions vary by setting ; however , in general, clusters of ILI (fever >100\u00b0 F with cough and /or sore throat) is cause for investigation. Thirty -two respiratory outbreaks were confirmed in schools, daycare, and assisted living facilities. Of those, influenza was identified as the responsible pathogen in 11 outbreaks, with flu B accounting for the majority of them. In SNFs, influenza was identified in 11 of 14 respiratory outbreaks. SYNDROMIC SURVEILLAN CE ACDC's Syndromic Surveillance Project monitors initial self- reported symptoms from patients presenting to participating emergency departments throughout LAC. These symptoms are categorized into different clinical syndromes according to specific code words. LAC's influenza surveillance looks at the syndrome of Influenza -like illness and includes symptoms such as: fever, congestion, sneezing, sore th roat, runny nose, and cough. Similar to other indicators, there were more ILI emergency department visits this season than were reported in any of the last 5 seasons.

LAC has also had a high number of West Nile Virus (WNV ) cases compared to the population and relative to the United States over the past six years. Over the last 5 years, LAC has experienced yearly outbreaks of W NV1 with an average of 221 cases per year, approximately 10% of the national burden ( Table 1 ). Additionally, the significant spread and increased detection of Aedes mosquitoes in new local areas, coupled with the high volume of international travel and our dense population, provide the id eal elements for a potential local outbreak of dengue, Chikungunya, or Zika if these viruses are introduced into the environment by an infected traveler (Map 1). Despite these significant health risks, mosquito -borne disease knowledge, perceived risk, and prevention behaviors are low among residents in the county. In September 2017, the LAC Department of Public Health ( DPH ) organized and coordinated an unprecedente d weeklong county -wide boots -on-the-ground outreach campaign (titled : It's Not Just a Bite! )2 to distribute educational materials aimed to increase WNV and Zika awareness and knowledge as well as promote preventive action . This campaign was the largest door -to-door campaign ever implemented by LAC DPH to fight a communicable disease . Table 1.

Locations of Zika Cases & Aedes Mosquitoes Community Outreach to Fight Mosquito- Borne Diseases Page 64 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report METHODS Under the emergency response structure, a central command center was organized with four area command centers to coordinate and monitor the event. Several materials were developed including: 1) educational materials for WNV, Zika, and general mosquito -borne disease knowledge , which were translated into multiple languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog , and Korean) ; 2) just-in-time training materials; and 3) scripts for outreac h volunteers as well as staff answering the phones. Over 300 County of Los Angeles staff volunteers were recruited from all departments and programs , most of who m did not routinely work with arboviral diseases. DPH deployed 100 two -person teams for 5 days to distribute posters and flyers to public venues across the county including city council halls, libraries, schools, parks and places of worship. The campaign led to the distribution of approximately 55,000 educational materials to over 14,000 venues ( Table 2 ). Environmental Health inspectors further distributed materials during routine site visits at permitted facilities. A digital tool kit was disseminated to city contacts and partners throughout LAC to be used, distributed and printed according to local nee ds and resources. The on - the-ground effort was complemented by a social media campaign through online platforms such as Twitter, Instagram , and Facebook , which further increased reach of campaign and engaged residents online. The campaign attracted considerable press coverage and media attention which also amplified the reach of these important messages. RESULTS To assess the reach and impact of the outreach campaign, in November 2017 , DPH conducted a 27 - question two -stage cluster community survey in four LAC cities . This was enacted in partnership wi th Department of Mental Health P romotores and public health students from the University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, Califo rnia State University Northridge, and University of Southern California. The survey questions assessed exposure to and recall of campaign messages and attempted to identify attitudes and behaviors regarding mosquitoes and mosquito -borne diseases. A total o f 464 surveys were completed over two days. Approximately 60% of respondents reported exposure to the campaign through at least one of the following: posters, flyers, community meetings, social media , or news articles. Analyse s showed that exposure to the materials was associated with a significant increase in awareness and knowledge of both WNV and Zika (Table 3 ). Table 4 shows modes of exposure that were significantly associated with increased awareness and/or knowledge of WNV and Zika. Those who Table 2. Venues Reached in Countywide Campaign Community Outreach to Fight Mosquito- Borne Diseases Page 65 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report reported exposure to campaign through posters, social media, or news articles had increased Zika awareness and /or knowledge. However, exposure to flyers or community meetings was not found to be associated with a similar increase . Exposure to posters was a ssociated with increased WNV awareness and knowledge, but exposure to flyers, social media, news articles, and community meetings was not. The data did not reveal an increase in mosquito prevention behavior linked to the campaign among those surveyed . Mult iple in terventions sustained over time, part icularly in specific types of materials , may be required to change habits, beliefs and actions regarding prevention of mosquito -borne diseases. Table 3. Impact of exposure to the campaign Exposed Non -exposed P-value Zika Awareness 213 129 79 (38%) in mosquito prevention 222 (60%) 151 (40%) 0.240 DISCUSSION Overall, the It's Not Just a Bite! campaign was an extraordinary effort to reach and engage the diverse communities in LAC about mosquito -borne disease prevention. In an era where emerging and re -emerging pathogens are increasingly being identified and can spread at record speed through gl obal trade and travel, it is essential for health departments to not only be able to detect these threats but to also be able to rapidly organize and mobilize staff to communicate and engage with the community.

Capturing a Record Num ber of Deaths Due to WNV in LAC Page 67 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report BEYOND CASE COUNTS \u2014CAPTURING A RECORD NUMBER OF DEA THS DUE TO WEST NILE VIRUS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY BY ENHANCING MONITORING OF PATIEN TS BACKGROUND In 2017, Los Angeles County (LAC) experienced a record -breaking 27 deaths due to West Nile v irus (WNV ).1 That year 11% of the 254 known symptomatic patients stricken with this disease died . Even d uring the five previous years with unusually high average case counts of 202 cases per year , the number of deaths from WNV peaked at 24 (5-year average of 10.4 deaths per year, 5 .3% of those ill ).2 The deaths occurred across racial and geographic boundaries, and had an age range of 59 to 96 years with half being above 75 years of age . Because WNV can often lead to long -term illness or death after a patient leaves the hospital, deaths from WNV infection can be missed with routine monitoring leading to an underestimate of the true impact of this disease. In the last five years, LAC Department of Public Health ( DPH ) has received an average of 670 mosquito - borne disease reports per year. The LAC DPH had previously relied upon one investigator to follow up on these reports . Investigations were usually completed before discharge from hospitals and deaths were only captured through informal reporting from providers and family members. Without evidenc e of death, patients with unknown outcomes were assumed to have survived the disease . Through enhanced monitoring of patients , LAC DPH was able to identify a more accurate number of deaths, and a record number of fatalities from WNV therefore was identifie d in 2017 . FINDINGS Grant funding for a new position enabled LAC DPH to conduct additional follow -up of WNV patients where survival was not known . From June through December 2017 , a mosquito -borne disease investigator worked with hospital staff to ensure all ( 100% ) discharge information reporting death or survival for hospitalized patie nts were reported and documented . If discharge information was not available due to prolonged hospital stays , the patient was flagged for additional follow -up in two weeks, at which time, the investigator again requested and reviewed patient discharge information . Repeated requests were often necessary due to lengthy hospitalizations that frequently occur with WNV . This process took a substantial amount of time and ef fort and increase d the estimated hour that is required per case for initial review and confirmation by another hour, essentially doubling the work time for flagged cases . The investigator took on this additional workload while managing the investigation s of over 30 cases of WNV a week , which resulted in the addition of 9 reported deaths out of approximately 80 patients . Without grant funding to support another investigator for Zika monitoring , it would have been necessary for the existing investigator to take on Zika investigation responsibilities and we might not have been able to identify the additional fatalities due to this disease . Additional follow -up of WNV survival would have become a lower priority, as it has been in the past, and c ould not have been completed. 1 LAC DPH. ACDC. West Nile Virus and Other Arboviral Diseases: 2017. Los Angeles County Epidemiology Final Report. http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/Arbo2017.pdf 2 LAC DPH. ACDC. West Nile virus data LAC. http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/WNVData.htm Capturing a Record Num ber of Deaths Due to WNV in LAC Page 68 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report DISCUSSION The enhanced monitoring of deaths carried out in 2017 highlights the health impact of WNV that was previously under -estimated in LAC. Many residents of our county become severely sick with WNV disease every year since LAC DPH first discovered the virus in the area in 2002 . It has been difficult to bring attention and resources to a public health issue that is no longer a new problem and has been portrayed as mild to the majority of those infected , a perception that was supporte d by lower numbers of deaths . The high number of deaths in the 2017 season brought much needed attention to the severity of WNV and broader recognition that this disease is a dangerous and significant threat in LAC. Awareness has increased not only among p ublic health o fficials but also among local government s and policy makers. Continuation of improved investigation procedures for WNV deaths will raise the level of concern , provoke new conversations on prevention and promote coordinated action to address the persistent threat of WNV i n LAC . LESSONS LEARNED Considering the impact of a high number of deaths on the perception of WNV among health officials and the public , LAC DPH is prioritizing the thorough investigation of WNV survival . While LAC DPH still retains the additional investigator supported by grant funding for Zika and other infections f or the 2018 season, we will continue to conduct follow -up of our WNV patients without known hospital discharge information and report deaths in a timely manner to boost awareness and promote WNV prevention and control efforts. It was challenging for a single investigator to conduct enhanced monitoring of patients while conducting routine case investigations of over 250 WNV cases over the six -month WNV season in LAC. As this was the first time this follow up was conducted, there was no precedent and no estimate of additional workload this would entail. Going forward, it will be helpful to establish a protocol for follow up that others can easily follow step by step. In addition, we can explore documenting and reporting other serious effects of WNV illness such as long hospitalization stays and the need for rehabilit ation . Without the support of the grant funding source, improved investigations of the effects of WNV could not be carried out and the additional vital information about the true and serious impact of this disease would not be fully recognized . Expansion of LAC Web- Based Disease Surveillance System Page 69 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report THE EXPANSION OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY WEB -BASED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO AN ENTERPRISE INTEGRATED REPORTING, IN VESTI GATION, AND SURVEILL ANCE SYSTEM BACKGROUND Brief History of web- Visual Confidential Morbidity Reporting System Prior to 1999 , the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health ( LAC DPH) Acute Communicable Disease Control (ACDC) Program relied on telephone reports or paper -based reporting, via fax and mail. These reports were then subsequently manual ly entered for data collection of disease incidents . This l ow- tech nology reporting and tracking me thod require d a significant amount of paperwork and person hours and potentially could cause reporting delays and quality control issues. Beginning in 2000, ACDC enacted a web -based, centralized repository for disease reports, lab oratory reports, foodborne illness reports and outbreaks . The system is called the visual Confidential Morbidity Reporting (vCMR)1 system . vCMR serves as primary disease surveillance system for ACDC and as a disease repository for several LAC DPH programs . vCMR supports the rapid exchange of electronic public health information between community practitioners (through the web Community Reporting Module) and electronic laboratory reporting (ELR ). The system provides ACDC with a cohesive surveillance system to rapidly detect , identif y, and investigate reportable communi cable diseases. Over the years, ACDC implemented key configurations and modifications to support LAC DPH's unique needs including maintenance of historical data and images, electronic laboratory reporting of national, state, and local disease. vCMR also capably support s various workflows which allow public health nurses, investigators, and health services to cooperatively share information and manage cases and outbreaks . LAC DPH 's ability to develop vCMR with differing key configurations and modifications is reflective of the unique needs of a large local jurisdiction . Although vCMR supported some of the data management needs of these programs, there are several other LAC DPH programs that primarily use respective legacy database systems and paper -based fo rms. These programs include the Division of STD and HIV Programs (DHSP)2, the Tuberculosis Control Program (TBCP)3, and Veterinary Public Health (VPH )4. LAC DPH Evaluates an Electronic Enterprise Solution for Disease Surveillance and Investigation In November 2013 , an LAC DPH Executive Team formed the Share Disease Surveillance and Control System (SDSCD) Project . Participants collaborated with the LAC DPH Chief Information Office to develop a strategy and approach to implement a shared system for disease surveillance for DPH . Subsequently, in 2014, SDSCS Staff Committee evaluated health information and operational needs across DPH programs. From both a local and national perspective, it was determined that LAC DPH needed to unify its disease programs and provide an integrated enterprise solution that promotes information sharing and digitizing paper -based workflows . 1 http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/vcmr/Index.htm 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/dhsp/ 3 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/tb/index.htm 4 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/index.htm Expansion of LAC Web- Based Disease Surveillance System Page 70 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report LAC DPH programs including Community Health Services (CHS)5, DHSP, Public Health Nursing Administration (NA)6, Public Health Investigation (PHI)7, TBCP, VPH, Vaccine Preventable Disease Control Program (VPDC)8, Public Health Lab oratory (LAPHL)9, and Environmental Health10 found that functions of vCMR can effectively meet many of their data needs. In April 2 016, SDSCS Staff Committee detailed their findings and recommendations in the SCSCS Executive Report. After extensive internal analysis of health information systems, workflow, organizational and IT infrastructure, and data and information needs along with external analysis of other public health information system vendors , the SDSCS Staff Committee recommended expansion of vCMR to migrate LAC DPH disease programs on to a common platform. vCMR proved to be the most efficient and economical solution for LAC DPH programs because it was originally designed for LAC and previous investments will be leveraged for future developments. Significant product upgrades and enhancements of vCMR will enable LAC DPH programs to retire legacy systems . RESULTS Decision to Upgrade vCMR to be the Enterprise Solution for LAC DPH Programs In November 2016, the Interim Health Officer and SDSCS Executive Workgroup accepted the SDSCS Staff Committee's recommendation to expand vCMR . Accordingly, vCMR received a new name to reflect its new purpose \u2014The Integrated Reporting, Investigation, a nd Surveillance System (IRIS). The IRIS Project includes: Migration to c loud -based computing technology Interfaces with Health Agency, State and partner systems: o LAC Department of Health Services ' Online Real- time Central Health Information Database ORCHID o Electronic Case Reporting ( eCR) o Electronic initial Case Reporting (EiCR) Additional enhancements o Improved security (e.g., multi- factor authentication) o Physician Port al (e.g., PHL orders) The IRIS Project Team picks up where the SDSCS Staff Committee concluded and will plan, develop , test , and implement IRIS. Collaboration among LAC DPH Programs and the F uture of IRIS The IRIS Project Team includ es staff from Public Health Information Systems (PHIS) , Internal Services Department (ISD), Project Management Office (PMO) , County Council, Communicable Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), and ACDC . The Team will begin meeting and collaborating with DPH programs to 5 http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/chs/index.htm 6 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phn/index.htm 7 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phi/ 8 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/ip/index.htm 9 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/lab/index.htm 10 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eh/index.htm Expansion of LAC Web- Based Disease Surveillance System Page 71 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report gather business and functional requirements. The IRIS project team adopted a participatory approach to bring TBCP, DHSP, and VPH programs into IRIS. Other programs ( CHS, NA, and PHI ) will be given expanded access to and use of IRIS to conduct field work. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from each department are included in the planning and development of the IRIS project. The goal of this participatory approach is to ensure all programs have an opportunity to voice respective programmatic needs and establish realistic expectations of IRIS's capabilities for both current and future needs. The expected expansion of IRIS is displayed in Figure 1 below. In November 2017, staff conducted a Joint Application Development (JAD) Session under the existing contract. The JAD sessions provided the basic IRIS system requirements and solutions and established regular meetings with each programs' SMEs. The IRIS project is now well underway to become the first integrated disease surveillance system for LAC DPH. Figure 1. IRIS Current and Future State Expansion of LAC Web- Based Disease Surveillance System Page 72 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance in Detecting Hepatitis A in LAC Page 73 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report EVALUATION OF SYNDRO MIC SURVEILLANCE IN DETECTING HEPATITIS A IN LOS ANGELES COUNT Y OVERVIEW Beginning in November 2016, a hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) outbreak1 was identified in San Diego County which subsequently spread to Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, and Monterey Counties. Infecti ons primarily occurred among homeless individuals and those who use illicit drug s. Due to the proximity of Los Angeles County (LAC) to San Diego County and its own large homeless population, on September 19, 2017, the LAC Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) declared an outbreak of HAV2 among persons who are homeless and/or use illicit (injection and non -injection ) drugs. By October 10, 2017, LAC DPH identified 12 local outbreak -related HAV cases. T o monitor the impact of the outbreak, LAC DPH's syndromic surveillance team created a n HAV syndrome category and began querying local emergency department (ED) data to identify any increase s in HAV -related visits. METHODS From January 1, 2017 through October 10, 2017, which corresponds to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) weeks 1 -41, ED data from all participating syndromic EDs in LAC were queried for patients who reported sy mptoms and signs of HAV infection . For comparison, ED data from the full 2016 calendar year also was queried. The query consisted of key word searches primarily within the chief complaint field, and if available, from the diagnosis and triage note fields. Based on the CDC clinical description of hepatitis A ,3 the HAV syndrome category was defined as: jaundice (or elevated liver function tests) with nausea or vomiting. Any ED visit that mentioned a diagnosis of hepatitis A also met the syndrome criteria. The resulting line lists were reviewed , and the query parameters were periodically refined to exclude visits unrelated to hepatitis A . For instance , analyses excluded : patients with a previous history of HAV infection or vaccination for hepatitis A, those diagnosed with other types of hepatitis, and patients diagnosed with neonatal jaundice. The syndromic system also was queried for records that matched the 12 initial outbreak -related LAC cases by hospital and admission date. In addition, the chief complaint, diagnosis, and triage note fields were reviewed for any mention of homelessness or illicit drug use (IDU) . RESULTS For the 2017 time -period (weeks 1 -41), the LAC DPH syndromic system detected 158 ED patients meeting the HAV syndrome category criteria. Of these, 12.7% had a diagnosis of HAV, 53.8% had jaundice, 36.7% had elevated liver enzymes, 65.2% had nausea, and 65.8% had v omiting. In 2016, 170 ED patients who met the syndrome criteria were detected: 8.2% had a diagnosis of HAV, 64.1% had jaundice, 32.4% had elevated liver enzymes, 63.5% had nausea, and 71.2% had vomiting. In both years, no indications of homelessness or IDU were identified . 1 https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Hepatitis -A-Outbreak.aspx 2 http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eprp/Health%20Alerts/DPH%20HAN%20Hep%20A%20Outbreak%20091917.pdf 3 https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis -a-acute/case- definition/2012/ Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance in Detecting Hepatitis A in LAC Page 74 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report Of the 12 initial and confirmed HAV outbreak -related cases in LAC , one-fourth (n=3) did not go to a hospital, thus did not have any syndromic data. Only t wo cases went to EDs that do not participate in LAC DPH syndromic surveillance , but a medical chart review showed that they would not have met the syndrome criteria. Of the remaining cases (n=7) , all went to a participating syndromic ED, 43% (n=3) met the syndrome criteria, but none of their records included any mention of homelessness or IDU. DISCUSSION In 2017, a large hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County, primarily among individuals who were homeless and/or illicit drug us ers, prompted the LAC DPH to create a HAV syndrome category and begin querying local participating ED data to monitor for any increase s in HAV -related visits. In the end, no major outbreak of HAV occurred in LAC, and n o major change was seen in the trend of HAV syndrome visits in 2017 as compared to 2016 ( Figure 1 ). Us e of a stricter syndrome definition, such as r equiring a specific diagnosis of HAV, may result in underreporting, but may also provide a more accurate baseline for detecting increases and monitoring trends. While the query relied primarily on ED chief complaint, diagnosis and triage notes also proved useful in detecting HAV syndrome visits. Figure 1. Proportion of ED Visits Meeting Hepatitis A Syndrome Category Criteria Los Angeles County, 2016 -2017 Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance in Detecting Hepatitis A in LAC Page 75 Acute Communicable Disease Control 2017 Special Studies Report LIMITATIONS One of the challenges in monitoring HAV incidence is that the clinical signs and s ymptoms are very general and may be comparable with many other conditions. An emerging outbreak may not be detected above background levels unless the increase in ED patients with HAV is large or consolidated over time. In addition, v ariability in data quality in the free text fields such as chief complaint and triage notes may be problematic. Cases will be missed if data fields are not fully and accurately documented, if patients didn't go to a participating syndromic hospital, or if they don't go to a hospital at all. In addition, while many syndromic hospitals now report diagnosis information, this information may be delayed due to the time required for complete laboratory results. Further complicating these findings, no ne of the con firmed HAV cases that were known to be homeless included any mention of homelessness in their charts . This omission, as well as the omission of IDU status , indicate that these conditions are not currently reliably captured in the syndromic extract ion of ED patient records. CONCLUSIONS Syndromic surveillance, despite its limitations, remains a valuable complement to electronic lab oratory reporting and other traditional reporting mechanisms. Accordingly, LAC DPH will continue to employ syndromic surveillance to facilitate monitoring health issues and disease trends in our county.
