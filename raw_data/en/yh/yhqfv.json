JYNNEOS Vaccine Efficacy 2023 Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by vaccination were offered during the mpox outbreak in May 2022. On September 4, 2023, The Lancet Infectious Disease published a [Commentary](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00518-2/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_aip_email) that confirmed both vaccine breakthrough infections and reinfections of MSM were reported in 2022. Aniruddha Hazra and colleagues [presented](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00492-9/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_aip_email) a global case series of eight hMPXV reinfections and 30 vaccine breakthrough infections, constituting the most extensive description of such cases to date. Their findings confirm that neither natural immunity from a previous infection nor immunity conferred by vaccination offers complete protection against hMPXV reinfection or infection. On July 17, 2023, The Lancet published results from a study that concluded although real-world data estimate vaccine effectiveness to be around 85%, immunological correlates of protection are still [unknown](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00369-9/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_aip_email).

The journal Eurosurveillance published [research](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.24.2200883) on June 15, 2023, which reported of the 230 vaccinated, eight had a breakthrough infection (3.5%), while 49 of the 254 unvaccinated contacts developed an infection (19.3%) during the early stages of the current mpox outbreak (May 17 to August 15, 2022). The effectiveness of PEP, controlling for type of close contact, sex, age, HIV infection, and HIV-PrEP use, is 88.8% (95% CI: 76.0-94.7) in preventing the development of mpox in close contact with mpox cases, or equivalently, unvaccinated close contacts of mpox cases post-exposure have an 8.9 times higher risk of developing the disease than vaccinated close contacts (95% CI: 4.2-19.1). These researchers stated vaccination against the mpox virus seems to be an effective measure for up to 7 weeks after vaccination, and vaccinated contacts had a lower risk of developing the disease than unvaccinated contacts. Additionally, if they got the disease, they had fewer symptoms. On May 18, 2023, the [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2215201) published a case-control study based on data from Cosmos, a nationwide Epic EHR database, to assess the effectiveness of JYNNEOS vaccination in preventing medically attended mpox disease among adults; those who received two doses among whom the estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.4 to 78.1), and those who received one dose, among whom the estimated adjusted VE was 35.8% (95% CI, 22.1 to 47.1). The U.K. Health Security Agency ( [UKHSA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency)) announced on November 22, 2022, its estimate of Mpox vaccine effectiveness for a dose of [78%](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukhsa-finds-vaccination-offers-strong-protection-against-monkeypox) 14 or more days after vaccination. The journal [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02229-3) reported on January 31, 2023, that the real-world effectiveness of a single dose of JYNNEOS in males adjusted VE was estimated at 86% (95% confidence interval, 59-95%). The [U.S. CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/cases-data/JYNNEOS-vaccine-effectiveness.html) published results from a [Multijurisdictional Case-Control Study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7220a3.htm?s_cid=mm7220a3_x) \u2014 United States, August 19, 2022-March 31, 2023; the adjusted VE was 75% for one dose and 86% for two doses of JYNNEOS vaccine, indicating substantial protection against mpox, irrespective of the route of administration or immunocompromise status. [Data](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/cases-data/mpx-JYENNOS-vaccine-effectiveness.html) posted by the CDC on December 8, 2022, indicated the effectiveness of one Jynneos vaccine dose was [37%](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/cases-data/mpx-JYENNOS-vaccine-effectiveness.html), and two doses were 69%, the duration of immunity is [unknown](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/interim-considerations/jynneos-vaccine.html#duration).

On December 1, 2022, Eurosurveillance published a [Rapid Communication](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.48.2200894) detailing five post-vaccine mpox breakthrough cases on January 3, 2023. BMJ Journal published results from a [study](https://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/03/sextrans-2022-055698.info) that found (0.15%) of vaccinated people developed Mpox subsequently. A non-peer-reviewed [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.03.22278233v1) based in France reported on August 4, 2022, that among the 276 vaccinated individuals, 12 (4%) had a confirmed Mpox breakthrough infection with no severe infection. Ten out of 12 patients developed a Mpox infection in the five days following vaccination, and two had a breakthrough infection at 22 and 25 days. JYNNEOS HIV Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recently described the clinical and immunological features of a woman [living with HIV](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/niaid-study-describes-immune-response-to-mpox-in-woman-living-with-hiv/) who acquired mpox while participating in a long-term [NIAID study](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/immune-response-mpox) at the NIH Clinical Center. In the reported case, the study participant presented with lesions consistent with mpox in August 2022, and laboratory results confirmed mpox infection. Her HIV viral load was suppressed on antiretroviral therapy, and she experienced a mild mpox case with lesions on her face, wrist, and forearm. She did not receive any mpox treatment due to her mild case. Despite these minor symptoms, laboratory results showed the study participant experienced dramatic changes in several types of immune cells, suggesting her body mounted a robust immune response to mpox infection: data showed increased levels of B cells (associated with antibody production) and changes in some types of T cells (which trigger other immune functions and destroy viruses). Of interest, laboratory findings showed no significant difference in the size of the participant's HIV reservoirs, which suggests that mpox infection did not affect the clinical HIV status of this participant. The study authors indicate more research is needed to understand the impact of mpox on people living with HIV. On August 5, 2022, the [early release](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7132e4.htm) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report - Interim Guidance for Prevention and Treatment of mpox in [people with HIV](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7132e4.htm) Infection \u2014 United States, August 2022. Prompt diagnosis, treatment, and enhanced prevention efforts might reduce the risk of severe outcomes. The JYNNEOS vaccine can be safely given to people who are living with HIV infection and those who are taking preexposure prophylaxis ( [PrEP](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/prevention/)), says the [UK the U.S. CDC, [myocarditis and pericarditis](https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/understanding-myocarditis-pericarditis-and-endocarditis/) have [occurred](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2023-02/slides-02-22/Mpox-03-Duffy-508.pdf) following either primary vaccination or revaccination with live vaccinia virus smallpox vaccines and is a known health risk for military forces ( [2003](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/196808)). Since 2002, approximately 2 million US armed service members have been vaccinated against smallpox. The incidence of confirmed myocarditis secondary to smallpox vaccination is estimated to be [16.1 per](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118283) 100,000 service members. A recent Department of Defense study ( [2009](https://sma.org/southern-medical-journal/article/cardiac-complications-after-smallpox-vaccination/)) estimates 12 per 100,000 in a review of 730,000 service members. In addition, vaccine-associated myocarditis should be on the differential for patients who exhibit cardiopulmonary symptoms after recent vaccinations ( [2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5878341/pdf/bcr-2017-223523.pdf)). The [FDA disclosed](https://www.fda.gov/media/131870/download) up to 2.1% of recipients had a cardiac event of particular interest, compared to 0.2% of placebo subjects. JYNNEOS COVID-19 Vaccination As of 2023, the [CDC says](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/cases-data/technical-report/report-2.html#US) there is [limited](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/interim-considerations/jynneos-vaccine.html#duration) clinical trial data on administering the Jynneos vaccine simultaneously with other vaccines. However, there are additional considerations if administering a COVID-19 vaccine. ( [Interim Clinical Considerations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fclinical-considerations.html) for the Use of COVID-19 Vaccines). People, particularly young adult males, might consider waiting four weeks after JYNNEOS or ACAM2000 vaccination before receiving a specific COVID-19 vaccine because of the observed risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis after receipt of ACAM2000 and mRNA (i.e., and vaccines pericarditis after Jynneos vaccination. JYNNEOS Brands The [MVA-BN\u00ae](https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/pipeline/technology/mva-bn.aspx) vaccine is marketed under the brand names IMVANEX in the European Union and IMVAMUNE in [Canada](https://pdf.hres.ca/dpd_pm/00058622.PDF).

In addition, the approval for mpox use is based on survival data obtained in lethal monkeypox virus challenge studies ( [FDA's Animal Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/nda-and-bla-approvals/animal-rule-approvals#:~:text=The%20regulations%20commonly%20known%20as,effectiveness%20of%20drugs%20or%20biological)) in non-human primates. Overall survival in various models ranged from 80% to 100% of JYNNEOS-vaccinated animals compared to 0-40% in control animals. The U.S. FDA's emergency use authorization (EUA) for Jynneos for mpox was issued by [Peter Marks, MD, Ph.D.,](https://www.fda.gov/media/160785/download) in EUA Application Number: 28801, on August 9, 2022. The U.S. government believes up to five Jynneos doses could be available for [intradermal vaccination](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/08/us/politics/monkeypox-vaccine.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes) per vial. However, on September 28, 2022, the [CDC reported](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/cases-data/mpx-vaccine-effectiveness.html) most Jynneos vaccinations had been administered as post-exposure prophylaxis, and unvaccinated people had 14 times the risk of monkeypox disease compared to those vaccinated. JYNNEOS Dosage In the U.S., the standard U.S. FDA regimen for Jynneos involves a subcutaneous (subcutaneous) route of administration with an injection volume of 0.5mL. Since August 9, 2022, the standard regimen has been authorized for people aged <18 years under an FDA-issued EUA. In the national Public Health Emergency context, the [FDA authorized](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply) an alternative regimen that may be used for adults aged 18 [under an EUA](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/interim-considerations/jynneos-vaccine.html) beginning August 9, 2022. The [U.S. FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply) confirmed on August 9, 2022, that the second vaccine dose of Jynneos should be given 28 days after the first dose. [New York City](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/monkeypox-vaccination.page) began offering people second doses of Jynneos in September 2022. Oregon Health Authority figures show that, as of Oct. 17, 4,332 people had completed the two-dose series. The U.K. Health Security Agency [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/second-vaccine-doses-to-be-offered-to-those-at-highest-risk-from-monkeypox) on September 23, 2022, that second doses of the Jynneos vaccine would be offered to people at the highest risk from monkeypox. JYNNEOS Post-Exposure Vaccination The [WHO's SAGE](https://www.who.int/news-room) 2022, that post-exposure vaccination ( [PEPV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159179/)) is recommended for close contact with MPX cases, ideally within four days of first exposure and up to 14 days without symptoms. The Lancet Infectious Disease published a [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00662-4/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_aip_email#seccestitle10) on November 7, 2022, that showed the immunological signature of monkeypox virus infection, characterized by an early expansion of activated effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that persisted over time. In addition, almost all patients, regardless of HIV infection, developed a poxvirus-specific Th1 cell response. These results might have implications on the expected immunogenicity of monkeypox vaccination, suggesting that it might not be necessary to vaccinate people who have already been infected. Reports from the 2003 monkeypox outbreak in the midwestern USA indicate that T-cell responses last at least one year following infection. JYNNEOS (MVA) Fractional Formulation Study The U.S. CDC reported on July 28, 2023, that California residents who received their first dose of mpox vaccine by intradermal or subcutaneous administration had comparable [2-dose series completion rates](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7230a4.htm?s_cid=mm7230a4_w) (60.2% and 58.8%, respectively). Similar series completion rates by route of administration were observed across all race and ethnicity groups. The NEJM published a [Correspondence](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2215846) regarding a reanalysis of these trial results using the contemporaneous FDA Toxicity Grading Scale on April 14, 2023, that showed that the intradermal route was safe and did not lead to unacceptable local reactions. Although there was a higher incidence of moderate or severe erythema after the second vaccine dose than after the first dose, the median duration of erythema was shorter by one day in the intradermal-administration group than in the subcutaneous-administration group. An [alternative](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15008762?via%3Dihub) vaccination dosage study was published on September 22, 2015, in the journal Vaccine / Science Direct ( [Frey SE et al., Vaccine, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003177/); 33(39):5225-5234) - Comparison of lyophilized versus liquid MVA (Jynneos) formulations and subcutaneous versus intradermal routes of administration in 524 healthy vaccinia-na\u00efve subjects who were randomized to receive either a full dose of Lyophilized-SC, a full dose of Liquid-SC or 20% (2 \u00d7 107 TCID50 in 0.1 mL) of a full dose Liquid-ID MVA on Days 0 and 28. At 180 days after the second vaccination, geometric mean neutralization titers declined to 11.7, 10.2, and 10.4, with only 54.3%, 39.2%, and 35.2% of subjects remaining seropositive for the Lyophilized-SC, Liquid-SC, and Liquid-ID groups, respectively. Both the Lyophilized-SC and Liquid-ID groups were considered non-inferior (primary objective) to the Liquid-SC group. JYNNEOS Booster The U.S. CDC vaccine committee stated, 'Regarding [booster doses](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7122e1.htm?s_cid=mm7122e1_w), a systematic review identified one randomized controlled trial and 17 observational studies that included 6,417 subjects. After considering geometric mean titer and seroconversion rate together, the Vaccine Work Group estimated with very low (level 4) certainty that a slight increase in disease prevention occurs after the JYNNEOS booster versus the JYNNEOS 2-dose primary series only. Therefore, the ACIP unanimously recommended JYNNEOS boosters as [an alternative](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/JYNNEOS-orthopoxvirus-primary-pq1-2.html) to ACAM2000 boosters in persons who received ACAM2000 as the primary vaccine. JYNNEOS Cell Line JYNNEOS (MVA-BN) Vaccine (IMVANEX, [IMVAMUNE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7565152/)) utilizes Fibroblast](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/jynneos) cells to produce the vaccine. [Replication-competent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3676094/) poxvirus strains can cause clinical infection in humans and have an infectious virus that can be transmitted to others. However, replication-deficient poxvirus strains, including modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), do not produce contagious viruses in humans and therefore do not cause clinical infection. As such, replication-deficient poxvirus strains pose a substantially [lower risk](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7122e1.htm?s_cid=mm7122e1_w) of adverse events than replication-competent strains. JYNNEOS For Children A peer-reviewed [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00270-0/fulltext) funded by the UK Health Security Agency and published on June 15, 2023, concluded a single dose of MVA-BN for post-exposure prophylaxis was well-tolerated in children and induced robust antibody and cellular immune responses up to 15 weeks after vaccination. More extensive studies are needed to fully assess the safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of the MVA-BN vaccine in children. On September 15, 2022, the [U.S. CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/clinical-guidance.html) confirmed [children and adolescents](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/pediatric.html) with exposure to people with suspected or confirmed mpox infections may be eligible for [post-exposure prophylaxis](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/pediatric.html?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_1052-DM86528&ACSTrackingLabel=COCA%20Now%3A%20Clinical%20Considerations%20for%20Monkeypox%20in%20Children%20and%20Adolescents&deliveryName=USCDC_1052-DM86528) with vaccination. In addition, the CDC published interim [Clinical guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/interim-considerations/jynneos-vaccine.html) for Healthcare Providers in September 2022. JYNNEOS For Women As of October 27, 2022, the CDC [confirmed](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/ppt/2022/102722_slides.pdf) [no clinical efficacy data](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/considerations-for-monkeypox-vaccination.html) regarding pregnant or breastfeeding women. However, the [CDC stated](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/cases-data/technical-report/report-2.html#US) on September 1, 2022, that pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis could be offered to pregnant or breastfeeding women. When pre- or post-exposure prevention by vaccination is chosen, JYNNEOS, a live, non-replicating viral vaccine, can be used. The virus in the vaccine does not grow and multiply in the human body, so it should not spread to an unborn child, says the [UK NHS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-vaccination-resources/protecting-you-from-monkeypox-information-on-the-smallpox-vaccination). However, if a pregnant woman contracts monkeypox, she may pass the virus to the baby. JYNNEOS U.S. CDC Presentations Pablo Sanchez, MD, led the U.S. CDC's ACIP Monkeypox Vaccine on October 20, 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2023-02/slides-02-22/Mpox-01-Sanchez-508.pdf). JYNNEOS Side Effects A [Research Letter](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2804849) on May 5, 2023, reviewed a phase 4 clinical study of adverse events following Jynneos vaccination and found that local adverse event rates were highest following intradermal administration. The adverse event rate was highest following dose 1 of intradermal vaccination (53%) and lowest following dose 2 of subcutaneous vaccination (31%). The most common adverse events were local redness, itching, and swelling following intradermal vaccination and local pain, swelling, and redness following subcutaneous vaccination. Jonathan Duffy, MD, MPH Immunization Safety Office CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, presented [JYNNEOS Vaccine Safety](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2023-02/slides-02-22/Mpox-03-Duffy-508.pdf) Monitoring During the 2022 Mpox Outbreak on February 22, 2023. According to VAERS: serious adverse events were reported after JYNNEOS was 26. The [CDC reported](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7149a4.htm?s_cid=mm7149a4_w) on December 8, 2022, that the vaccine safety profile was consistent with prelicensure studies. The most common adverse health events reported were nonserious and included injection site reactions. Serious adverse events were rare among adults. [Severe adverse reactions](https://www.fda.gov/media/131078/download) known for replicating vaccinia virus strains, such as myocarditis, encephalitis, generalized vaccinia, or eczema vaccinatum, were not observed during Jynneos's clinical development program. The [U.S. FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/131078/download) reports in smallpox vaccine-na\u00efve healthy adults, the most common (> 10%) solicited injection site reactions were pain (84.9%), redness (60.8%), swelling (51.6%), induration (45.4%), and itching (43.1%); the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were muscle pain (42.8%), headache (34.8%), fatigue (30.4%), nausea (17.3%) and chills Contraindication According to CDC, JYNNEOS is contraindicated in persons with [serious allergies](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7122e1.htm?s_cid=mm7122e1_w) to any / IMVANEX Production Nordic A/S [received approvals](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/07/27/2487043/0/en/Bavarian-Nordic-Receives-U-S-and-EU-Approvals-of-its-Fill-and-Finish-Vaccine-Manufacturing-Facility.html) from the U.S. and E.U. regulatory authorities on July 27, 2022, to manufacture JYNNEOS\u00ae/IMVANEX\u00ae smallpox and mpox vaccine at the Company's fill and finish facility in [Denmark](https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/manufacturing/manufacturing.aspx#:~:text=Bavarian%20Nordic%20operates%20its%20own,with%20full%20EU%20cGMP%20requirements.). In addition, on August 18, 2022, Bavarian Nordic announced that the Company had agreed with Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing to fill and finish [2.5 million](https://aspr.hhs.gov/SNS/Pages/JYNNEOS-Distribution.aspx) JYNNEOS vaccines/vials. JYNNEOS U.S. Government Contracts Since 2003, Bavarian Nordic has worked with the [U.S. government](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/08/18/hhs-facilitates-agreement-accelerate-delivery-additional-smallpox-monkeypox-vaccines-using-new-us-production-line.html) on developing, manufacturing, and supplying a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. On August 29, 2022, [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/08/29/hhs-funds-us-based-production-of-smallpox-and-monkeypox-vaccine.html) announced it would provide approximately $11 million to support the manufacturing of Jynneos in [Grand FDA-approved JYNNEOS vaccine manufactured by Bavarian Nordic to prevent smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection. JYNNEOS Vaccine Price The Jynneos vaccine is not sold commercially in the U.S. as of April 2023. JYNNEOS Vaccine News 2008 - 2023 [July 28, 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7230a4.htm) - Demographic Disparities in Mpox Vaccination Series Completion, by Route of Vaccine Administration \u2014 California.

JYNNEOS Smallpox Vaccine Clinical Trial A [phase 2 study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00686582) results posted as a [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.07.22279689v1.full-text) on September 9, 2022, concluded priming with either 1 or 2 doses of MVA-BN induced a durable immune memory, similar to that of older generation replicating smallpox vaccines. When the MVA-BN vaccine was administered as a booster to individuals either primed two years earlier with MVA-BN or an older generation replicating smallpox vaccine in the distant past, it elicited a similarly rapid and durable immune response that was generally safe and well-tolerated. One-dose priming with MVA induced a long-term B-cell memory that resulted in robust anamnestic responses following an MVA booster two years later, suggesting that a single dose may offer protection against future exposure. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( [NIAID](https://twitter.com/NIAIDNews/status/1561703498424717313)) [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/JScholar/status/1561764484058071040/photo/1) on August 22, 2022, that it was launching a clinical trial for Jynneos in September 2022. The [FDA approval](https://www.fda.gov/media/131078/download) of JYNNEOS for smallpox comes from a development program comprising [22 clinical trials](https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/investor/news/news.aspx?news=5871), including two phase III trials. The program enrolled 7,871 individuals aged between 18 and 80 years who received at least one dose of the vaccine. Approval for monkeypox indication comes from survival data from studies conducted in non-human primates. The survival rate ranged from 80%-100% in animals vaccinated with JYNNEOS compared to 0%-40% in the control group. Upon successful completion of the current study, expected in 2021, the [Company](https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/what-we-do/pipeline/smallpox.aspx) plans to submit a supplement to the BLA to extend the approval for both formulations of MVA-BN, "}
