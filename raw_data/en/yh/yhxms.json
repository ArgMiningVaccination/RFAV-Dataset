Naturopathic doctors are taught to go deeper than a superficial symptom to find the root cause of illness and disease. Small symptoms can often be indicators of a bigger, chronic disease process in the future. For example, if a patient is diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), the allopathic medical model may dismiss the symptoms, or give the patient a prescription that simply suppresses the cramping, pain and diarrhea. As a Naturopathic Doctor, I will strive to find the root cause of why there is discomfort and diarrhea in the GI tract, and not simply suppress or mask the symptom with a pharmaceutical. By discovering the cause of the individual patient's IBS, this can help the body come back into balance and ultimately prevent chronic disease processes from developing. Naturopathic Medicine utilizes traditional and specialty lab work as diagnostic tools. Treatments options are vast with this type of medicine. Philosophically, Naturopathic Doctors are trained to use the most gentle, natural treatment modalities. It is my goal to help patients reach their maximum potential in health and vitality. THE TRAINING Naturopathic Doctors (N.D.) are Primary Care Physicians trained in utilizing modern diagnostic skills combined with holistic treatment options. The required education includes a four-year Bachelor's degree with Pre-Med course work and then the completion of four years of graduate level medical didactic and clinical training at at accredited Naturopathic Medical School. These schools are modeled after traditional Medical Schools, where the first two years are focused on the basic sciences (anatomy, physiology, microbiology, biochemistry & pathology) and the last two are on clinical training. However, in addition to learning pharmacology, students learn natural treatments for disease processes and conditions, such as botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, intravenous nutrient therapy, environmental medicine, physical medicine, homeopathy, and acupuncture. As in conventional Medical Schools, Naturopathic Medical Students are required to sit for two sets of national boards during their four years of training. In the state of Arizona, Naturopathic Physicians are able to write prescriptions, however the goal of this medicinal paradigm is to use modalities of treatment that are the least invasive and most in sync with nature before turning to the prescription pad.
