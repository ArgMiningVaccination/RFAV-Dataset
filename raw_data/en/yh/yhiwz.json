Here's how to tell if you're getting too much of the \"sunshine vitamin\" and how to lower your levels if you are.", "sitename": "Greatist", "date": "2021-03-30", "cleaned_text": "Sunshine triggers your skin to make vitamin D (among other important things). Your body is a fine-tuned system that can regulate how much it produces from these signals. But if you're taking high doses of a vitamin D supplement it's possible to overload your system. What if you get too much vitamin D? Getting more than [4,000 international units (IU)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) \u2014 100 micrograms (mcg) \u2014 of vitamin D per day could cause a rare but serious condition known as vitamin D toxicity. There's no quick fix to flush vitamin D out of your system, but staying hydrated and staying away from more vitamin D and calcium can help lower your levels. Call your doctor right away if you experience confusion, vomiting, [dizziness](/health/dizziness-and-fatigue), or other symptoms of a vitamin D overdose. Vitamin D is a [fat-soluble vitamin](/health/best-time-to-take-vitamins#types-of-vitamins). That means your body uses fat to absorb its goodness. If you get too much, your body stores the excess in fatty tissues like your [liver](/health/liver-cleanse). How much vitamin D is too much? In general, toxicity is when your blood level goes over [150 ng/ml](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30294301/). (That's about five times more than a healthy level.) Vitamin D obtained from sunshine and food probably won't put you at risk, but overdoing it on [supplements](/health/best-vitamin-d-supplement) or the tanning bed could max out these levels. Because these high levels can hang around in your fat, you should get medical help ASAP if you have signs of vitamin D toxicity, like [dehydration](/health/dehydrated-skin) or [diarrhea](/health/what-to-eat-when-you-have-diarrhea). If vitamin D toxicity isn't a concern, but you're looking to speed up your bodily processing of excess vitamin D, there are a few things you can do. 1. Stop taking vitamin D If you've been overdoing it in the vitamin D supplement department, stop taking it. You can also cut back on other sources of vitamin D by [staying out of the sun](/health/how-to-tan-safely) and eating fewer foods like fatty fish, [cheese](/eat/cheese-101), or eggs that are high in vitamin D. 2. Get less calcium Steer clear of calcium-rich foods like [dark green veggies](/eat/leafy-greens-guide-how-to-cook-and-store), dairy, and fish until your vitamin D levels are back on target. Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium your body absorbs. That's why [milk](/eat/recipe/i-love-my-electric-milk-frother) (an awesome calcium source) is usually fortified with vitamin D. However, if you're getting too much vitamin D, you could experience hypercalcemia (too much [calcium](/health/surprising-dairy-free-sources-of-calcium) in your blood). 3. Stay hydrated This is good advice in general, but regularly [drinking water](/health/reasons-to-drink-water) will help dilute the calcium levels in your blood. 4. Increase your vitamin K2 Having higher levels of vitamin D leads to lower [vitamin K2 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17145139/), which can cause brittle bones. One way to offset this is to eat a lot of foods that are rich in vitamin K2, such as grass-fed dairy or meat. 5. Take a diuretic In mild cases of vitamin D toxicity, diuretics like furosemide may be prescribed to keep fluids from accumulating in the body, allowing excess vitamin D to be flushed from your bloodstream. Vitamin D toxicity is rare. It typically only happens if you're taking [more than 10,000 IU](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional) (250mcg) at one time. You could also be at risk if you've been taking high doses (more than 4,000 IU per day) consistently. Vitamin D toxicity can [cause a number of symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6158375/), but the most common include: - confusion [apathy](/health/morning-depression) - fatigue - dizziness - vomiting [abdominal pain](/health/cramps-after-period) - dehydration - peeing more often - increased thirst [constipation](/health/travel-constipation) - diarrhea As mentioned above, having too much vitamin D in your body can lead to a buildup of calcium in your blood (aka hypercalcemia). Symptoms of this separate but related condition include: [nausea](/health/nausea-during-period) - vomiting - constipation - bone pain [depression](/health/physical-symptoms-of-depression) - memory loss [kidney stones](/health/lower-left-back-pain) In severe cases, [excessive Vitamin D](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26053339/) can result in life-threatening kidney injury or [kidney failure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22043417/). To treat vitamin D toxicity, a doctor will prescribe intravenous fluids and medications, such as [corticosteroids](https://www.healthline.com/health/corticosteroids-what-are-they#:~:text=Corticosteroids%20are%20a%20class%20of,asthma) or [bisphosphonates](https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/bisphosphonates.html#:~:text=Bisphosphonates%20are%20a%20group%20of,is%20known%20as%20bone%20resorption).). If you're showing signs of kidney failure, you'll be treated with intravenous hydration and medications \u2014 and in severe cases, dialysis. Can I take vitamin D supplements safely? You need about [600 IU](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) (15mcg) of vitamin D to support important functions like calcium absorption, [immune health](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20219962), and bone health. While it's possible to overdo it, vitamin D deficiency is actually more common than toxicity. Certain groups have a higher risk of deficiency; if you're over 65, have a higher body weight, have more melanin in your skin (as with darker skin tones), or if you're indoors a lot, your doctor might prescribe a vitamin D supplement. A simple blood test can confirm your vitamin D levels are at a healthy level. - You need 600 IU of vitamin D every day. - Getting more than 4000 IU of vitamin D per day can cause vitamin D toxicity. - Vitamin D toxicity is rare, but it can damage your kidneys if untreated. - You can lower your vitamin D levels by avoiding vitamin D and calcium, ramping up your vitamin K intake, and staying super hydrated. - If needed, your doctor can use IV fluids or dialysis to treat a vitamin "}
