Randomised Controlled Trial TGA Therapeutic Goods Association VaD Vascular dementia WHO World Health Organisation vi Abstract Lava ndul a Angustifolia and Melissa Officinalis for agitation management in older adults: A mixed method study Purpose: This study was completed to provide evidence of effect for Lavender Angustifolia (Lavender) and Melissa Officinalis (Lemon Balm ) essential oils as agitation managements for older people with and without a dementia diagnosis living in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACF s). This research further sought to explore nurse understanding of agitation management and the viability for nurse administered essential oils for behaviour management in residents living in RACFs. Method : The research was a three -phase sequential design consisting of two phases of semi -structured nurse interviews and a single blind randomised controlled trial [RCT]. Phase I invo lved semi -structured interviews conducted with 11 nurse participant s, focusing on their understanding of agitation management, including the use of essential oils, and their understanding of and attitudes toward the conduct of research in the RACF environm ent. Findings influenced pre -trial nurse education, timing of intervention and data collection procedures of the Phase II RCT to best support the nurse and the success of the research . Phase II consisted of a 2x3 factorial design single blind RCT that inve stigated 49 residents with a history of agitation. Parti cipants were allocated to group 1 residents with a dementia diagnosis or group 2 r esidents without dementia, as determined by their MMSE score or dementia diagnosis. Each resident was randomised withi n the group to a treatment sequence of Lavender, Lemon Balm or placebo Sunflower oil using a computerised random number generator. All resident s received all treatments and as such acted as their own control. The trial was conducted over a 10 - week period w ith resident s receiving two drops of the assigned treatment oil daily for two weeks followed by a two -week washout period before commencing the consecutive treatment. Post trial, Phase III , involved semi structured interviews conducted with 10 nurses to id entify perceived changes in agitation identified on their ward and influencing factors that effecting the conduct of this research conducted in the RACF. Behavioural and quality of life data were collected using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Coh en-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Quality of Life -Alzheimer's Disease (QoL -AD) et al. Thorgrimsen et al., 2014a) . Content analysis used word and phrase frequency to organise qualitative data into key concepts and themes in Phases I and III. While SPSS statistical software version vii 23 (IBM Corp, 2015) was used to conduct within group and a between groups ANOVA in Phase II. Result s: This research identified differences in essential oils effect on ag itation in residents with dementia and without dementia. Further this study provided evidence for the factors that influence nurse compliance to research as well as the practicality for nurse administration of essential oils as agitation managements for residents in the RACF environment. Phase I : Nurse's identified various approaches t o managing agitation in RACFs, the most frequently identified interventions being distraction (91%), providing space (64%) and medication (45%). More than two -thirds of nurs es acknowledged agitation was managed differently in residents with and without a dementia diagnosis due to impaired communication (55%) or comprehension (55%). Nurses ( 50% ) were supportive of research with barriers to compliance identified as demanding wo rkload ( 50% ), fear of reprisal ( 30% insufficient education on the research ( 20% ). The provision of pre - trial nurse education (70%) was considered to facilitate compliance to research . Phase II: Despite reductions in agitation behaviours, Lavender or Lemon Balm did not significantly reduce agitation when compared independently to placebo. However, clinically significant difference was shown when Lavender and Lemon Balm treatments were compared in the effect difference between the with and without deme ntia groups on the significantly opposing difference is supported in the CMAI domain of physical aggressive behaviours Fc=4.11. A post hoc analyses demonstrates Lemon Balm to reduce NPI total agitation score P=0.02 DF35 Tc=2.05 in residents without dementia when compared to Lavender and placebo . Lavender reduced physical non -aggressive behaviour in residents with dementia when compared to Lavender and placebo on post hoc analysis P=0.4 DF114 F(1,5.84) Tc=2.05. Lemon Balm was significantly less effective in reducing irritab ility in residents with dementia when compared to Lavender and placebo on post hoc analysis P=0.01 DF113 (1,7.75) Tc=1.98. Further a clinically significant reduction of physical non aggressive behaviour on the CMAI was demonstrated when the Lavender and Le mon Balm scores were combined in comparison to the placebo P=0.02 DF47 F(1,6.38) Fc=4.5. A clinically significant lower viii quality of life was reported in residents without dementia when compared to those with dementia independent of essential oil treatment Q oL-AD P=0.03 DF34.23 F(1, 5.07) Fc=4.13. Phase III : The majority of nurses (90%) perceived essential oils had been effective in reducing agitation in the resident s despite results of the single blind RCT revealing no significant effect. Half the nurses ( 50%) reported the oils were effective for some resident s. This phase of the study also asked nurses to reflect on the process used to conduct this research proje ct. The majority considered research process to be unobtrusive (60%), routinely timed (60%) wit h effective communication (40%) between researcher and nurses as positively support the research process in RACFs. Conclusion : These findings support a clinically significant opposing effect of the essential oils Lavender when compared to Lemon Balm in re sidents with dementia and without dementia. These results indicate that Lemon Balm may be effective in reducing agitation in residents without dementia and less effective in reducing irritability in residents with dementia . Further Lavender may be effectiv e in reducing physical non - aggressive behaviours. Despite a reduction in the resident behaviour with treatment there was no clinically significant decline in agitation when Lavender or Lemon Balm was independently compared to placebo. Nurses maintained str ong belief throughout the trial in the ability of the essential oils to reduce agitation in some residents. Facilitators of nurse complia nce to research were identified as projects that provided research education were unobtrusive in the RACF environment, routinely timed with effective communication between researcher s and nurse s.

Nurses are frequently challenged t o manage agitation in residential aged care facilities [RACF] with available interventions often proving ineffective or hazardous to the residents (Dombeck, 2015; -phase, sequential design, m ixed method study explored the effectiveness and practicality of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils as a nurse initiated agitation management for older adults living in RACFs. A 2x3 factorial design, single blind , randomised controlled trial [RCT] incl uded 49 residents with and without dementia. Semi -structured interviews with nursing staff prior to and following the single blind RCT informed the researcher of the practicalities for conducting essenti al oil research for agitation management in the RACF setting . This introductory chapter presents the significance, aims, and research questions that drove this research. Finally, the structure of the thesis is presented outlining the content of the eight chapters deemed necessary to answer the research que stions. 1.2 Agitation in Residential Aged Care Facilities Agitation is recognised by aged care literature as the most common behavioural problem in RACFs (AIHW, 2012; DoHA, 2012). The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2015 a) reports that over two -thirds of older people living in RACFs require high -level nursing care for their behaviour alone. Agitation is indicated by observable non - purposeful physical or verbal behaviours that are widely considered to have origins of internal turmoil (Grose & Schub, 2013 ; Kovach & Noonan, 2005 ; Pritchard & Brighty, 2015 ). While best practice management promotes the identification of causative factors through detailed assessment and the resolving of these factors to reduce resident 2 distress , agitation is not well managed in RACFs (NSW DoH, 2014). Older people living in RACFs are susceptible to agitation due to com plex medical diagnos es, cognitive decline, mental illness or reliance on multiple medications (Pritchard & Brighty, 2015 ), although agitation is most frequentl y reported in residents with dementia. Australian statistics report 81.8% of residents with dementia and 45.6% of residents who do not have dementia require high -level nursing care for their behaviours (AIHW, 2015b ). The literature acknowledges agitation as the most intractable behavioural and psychological symptom of dementia [BPSD] (Ballard & Corbett, 2010 ) that is observed in up to 90% of presentations (Agronin, 2014 ; DeYoung, Just, & Harrison, 2002 ; Drouillard, Mithani, & Chan, 2013 ). Agitated behaviours commonly related to dementia include wandering, resistance to care and verbal di sruption. The complication of a dementia diagnosis often impairs a resident's communication or insight making identification of causative factors difficult. Agitation in dementia is often recurrent and the causative factors are unresolved . Agitation is common in the dementia disease trajectory however it is also noticed in the conditions of anxiety or depression (Drageset, Eide, & Ranhoff, 2013 ; Pritchard & Brighty, 2015 ). Anxiety and depression are considered to be the most common mental health conditions for older people living in Australian RACFs, and in 2011, 78% of residents were conside red to have a mental health condition (ABS, 2013). Anxiety or depression are associated with the agitated behaviours such as hand -wringing, restlessness, pacing, irritability and (Beyond Blue, 2015; Drageset , Espehaug & Kirkevold, 2012). Despite the high reported prevalence of anxiety and depression , the conditions are underreported in RACFs (AIHW, 2013 ). The high frequency of agitation in facilities coupled with increased frailty of reside nts and the complexity of care needs, in addition to disproportionately low nurse to resident ratio can prove challenging for the aged care nurse (NSW NMA, 2016 ). 3 Nurses in RACFs are frequently required to manage residents with agitation while prioritising competing demands of an already ambitious workload. Agitation is unp redictable, distressing for the person exhibiting the behaviour and disruptive for those within the vicinity of the behaviour (NSW DoH, 2014 ; NSW NMA, 2016 ). An agitated person can feel intense fear, is often disorientated and may not fully compr ehend their immediate surround s. Safety is a concern, requiring an immediate response from the nurse to manage the situation (King, 2012 ). Pressing care priorities are often postponed as the nurse attempts to calm the residents and identify caus es for the behaviour. W here agitation is managed effectively in the RACF environment, the nurse can subdue the situation expediently and return to their routine tasks. However agitation is not well managed generally in the RACF environment , with a lack of effective or safe management available to the nurse (DoHA, 2012; NSW DoH, 2014 ). Nurses in RACFs use a variety of strategies to manage agitation when causative factors are not forthcoming. Distraction or restraint are frequently used to manage behaviours in RACFs, and there is developing i nterest in the use of complementary therapies to manage agitation ( Abermain , Vander, Van Bortel & Elseviers, 2014). Distraction is achieved by diverting the resident's attention to another activity or topic. This strategy is considered to shift the residen t's attention from the distressing subject to a more agreeable topic or activity resulting in modifying behaviour. However, distraction is a short term remedy and once the diversion ceases the agitation often returns (NSW DoH, 2014 ). Time poor work schedules and reoccurring agitation in a resident can leave nurses frustrated at their inability to resolve the situation, a frustration that often re sults in the use of chemical or physical restraint to manage behaviour (Edberg et al., 2008 ; Hofmann & Hahn, 2 014 ; Lesser & Hughes, 2006 ; Poole & Mott, 2003 ). Nurses use restraints to contain agitation for an interim period, however restraints are often humili ating and carry detrimental side effects for the resident. Restraints are the 4 intentional restriction of a person's movement through device or force, or intentional use of medication for the sole purpose of controlling a person's behaviour (NSW DoH, 2014 ). Research reports that using restraint is demoralising for an older person and is often interpreted as punishment, increasing the agitation (DoHA, 2012). Restraints increase the risk of physical injuries including falls and negatively impact an older persons quality of life. Further, restraints carry side effects that contribute to increased cognitive decline, morbidity and mortality (Cohen -Mansfield, Libin, & Marx, 2007 ; DoHA, 2014 ; NSW DoH, 2014 ). Effective agitation management techniques are required for residents living in RACFs with some research promoting the use of essential oils Lavender or Lemon Balm as a possible solution. 1.3 Lavender and Lemon Balm Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils can have calmative benefit s with minimal side effects or interactions with concur rent medications (Kayne, 2009). Further essential oils delivered by aromatherapy are often enjoyable for residents and come at a low cost to the facility. Essential oils are proc ured from plants and administered by aromatherapy through inhalation, ingestion or absorption (Thorgrimsen et al., 2014b). Essential oils when inhaled are believed to act upon the limbic system, principally the amygdala and hippocampus to elicit a response representative of the oils therapeutic benefit (Cavanagh & Wilkinson, 2002; Elisabetsky, Marschner, & Souza, 1995 ; Huang et al., 2008), however the mechanism of action is largely uncertain. Lavender and Lemon Balm 's chemical profile is similar to pharmac eutical medications used to minimise agitation in older adults ( Burns et al., 2011 ). Both essential oils mediate serotonin in the body by inhibiting the main neuronal transmitter in the central nervous syst em to reduce neuronal excitability and regulate muscle tone (Abdou et al., 2006 ). Lemon Balm is classified as a GABA transaminase inhibitor with broad -spectrum activity in addition to potency for 5 -hydroxy -tryptamine and y -aminobutyric acid receptors 5 (Burns et al., 2011), as such it was conside red to be potentially more effective in reducing agitation than Lavender. A change in agitation management to include essential oils requires nurses to understand the detrimental effects of agitation and the ability of essential oils to assist in managing the behaviour. 1.4 Theoretical Framework - Health Belief Model [HBM] The Health Belief Model [HBM] originally developed by the social psychologists Hochbaum, Rosenstock and Kegels is the theoretical framework used in this study, as it predicts and explains h ealth behaviours that lead to the adoption of new practice The HBM assumes that people are rational in their thinking and actions, that they will take appropriate steps to accept practices that best support health improvement under the right circumstances (Hayden, 2014 ; Mikhail, 1981). The HBM explains an individual's actions or lack of actions relating to their personal health , often observed in the practices they adopt or dismiss to support their he alth. The HBM applies concepts of individual perception, modifying factors in addition to the likelihood of change (Cheung et al., 2015) to demonstrate how health behaviour influences the adoption of new health practices. The HBM was developed in the 1950 s by researchers at the US Public Health Service to understand better why people use preventative screening programs (Rosenstock, 1974a ; Katasky, 1977 ). In an era where Tuberculosis and Polio were common conditions, researchers were challenged to explain w hy people were not attending the low -cost screening and vaccination programs to avoid disease. Early investigations of population attitudes towards preventative health technology and screening identified six constructs that are thought to influence health behaviour. They include 1) perceived susceptibility, how likely an individual believed they were to contract the condition 2) perceived seriousness being the level of difficulty contracting the condition would create to their life 3) Perceived benefits of taking action, will the action reduce the risk of susceptibility or seriousness of the condition 4) Perceived barriers to taking action, negative aspects 6 or action such as inconvenience, expense or pain can result in avoidance 5) Readiness to act, is achie ved when barriers are weak and the benefits to action strong and finally 6) cue to action, is a trigger to appropriate action such as a health crisis that can change trigger the decision -making process (Rosenstock 1974b ; Rosenstock, Stretcher & Becker, 198 8). The HBM has its origin in Le winian 's theory that contends behaviour to be guided by two variables; the first, \"the value of the outcome to the individual and the second, the estimated probability that the action will result in their expected outcome\" (Maiman & Becker 1977, p336). The HBM adopts a phemonomological approach that contends the individual alone is responsible for decision making with the environment having little influence on this choice (Rosenstock, 1974). The HBM model today acknowledges societal influences on decision making process to explain psychosocial choices in the context of health. This model has been employed to assist in changing behaviours for patients with coronary artery bypass grafts, osteoporosis, smoking addiction, breast examination, asthma, sexual health and obesity issues among others (King, Kaighobadi & Winecoff, 2016; Jeihooni et & Spencer, 2015). The HBM is used to explain why a person selects a health practice to support or maintain their own health (Rosenstock, 1974) . The six constructs of the HBM are applied in this study to understand what influences a nurses management of agitation in RACFs. Agitation is widesp read in Australian RACFs (Australian Institute of Health, 2015c) with legislation preventing older people from self -administering medications that can alleviate symptoms (Australian Government, 2012) . Nurses are therefore well positioned to select manageme nts that influence agitation outcomes for older people. Nurses must be able to identify which older persons are susceptible to having an agitated episode and understand the seriousness that this behavioural episode poses to the older 7 person, their families , staff and all those within the vicinity of the behaviour. Nurses need to be aware of the benefits to managing agitation well and knowledgeable of the barriers that need to be overcome in providing effective agitation management in the RACF setting. Also, RACF nurses need to feel confident in their ability to manage and minimise the risk of recurrent agitative episode in an older person. A nurses knowledge of agitation and their attitudes towards agitation can influence their perceptions of susceptibility, seriousness, benefits and barriers that contribute to their choice in agitation management strategy. This HBM has been successfully employed by other researchers to explain a healthcare professionals behaviour in managing other person conditions. Quarant a and Spencer (2015) used the HBM to understand school nurse management of student asthma. Their results found that nurses who believed asthma management was important illustrating perceived susceptibility and seriousness of students with asthma. Also, nur ses with higher self -efficacy or confidence in their ability to manage the asthma were more likely to perform the behaviour. Smith et al. (2011) investigated reasons why parents delay or refuse to vaccinate their 24 -month children using the HBM. Their resu lts show that parents that delayed immunisation are less likely to believe their child is susceptible, less likely to believe vaccinations are an important health initiative, less likely to believe that vaccinating can reduce the threat of disease, more li kely to be concerned with vaccination efficacy and safety. Brinsley, Sinkowitz -Cochran and Cardo (2005) investigated low levels of compliance to the guidelines that prevent antimicrobial resistance for patients . Their findings indicated that medical offic ers did not perceive patients to be highly susceptible to antimicrobial resistance perceiving other hospital problems to be a more serious issues. This thesis adapts the HBM as a theoretical framework to explain the actions or lack of actions by the nurse in adopting new health practices, such as essential oils to manage 8 the agitation of the older people in their care. The study applied the six constructs of the HBM to nurses to understand better the management strategies employed to support an older perso n with agitation in an RACF. Semi structured interviews with nurses informed researchers of their understanding and attitude towards agitation, agitation management, essential oils and the research that was conducted in their facility. Interview questions were designed to understand susceptibility focused on a nurses ability to understand agitation to identify the agitative needs of the people they care for and to nurse susceptibility to the effects of agitation on the environment in which they work. Nurse perception of how serious a problem they considered the agitation to be was explored concerning the resident, staff and all those within the environment. The benefits and barriers of different agitation management strategies for people with and without dem entia were examined encouraging deliberation. A randomised controlled trial was conducted to establish a scientific evidence of effect for essential oils in the management of older person agitation for nurse reference. The trial was conducted in the facil ity to identify any potential barriers that may contend with nurse initiated administration of essential oils in the RACF setting. Nurse self - efficacy level for the potential administration of nurse initiated essential oils for agitation management was exp lored in staff attitude and knowledge of essential oils. The researchers anticipated that nurses speaking of their knowledge and attitudes toward agitation and its management would increase awareness and deliberation among nurses resulting in a 'readiness to act'. In the understanding that a 'readiness to act' would occur if the benefits to adopting an agitation management were greater than the practical barriers to the strategies implementation. The researchers presence and focus on agitation management wa s also considered a encourage a 'cue to action', or trigger, among staff to take action to mindfully select the most appropriate, effective and safe agitation management to older people in their care. 9 INDIVIDUAL MODIFYING LIKLIHOOD PERCEPTION FACTOR S OF ACTION Adapted from National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (2013). Figure 1 Health Belief Model [HBM] flow diagram 1.4.1 Individual perception The HBM concept of individual percepti on indicates that the nurse's belief about agitation, as well as their belief in the management strategies that are available to reduce the behaviour, will influence their choice in the management method they employ. Among the four constructs of individual perception are include d two categories being perceived susceptibility and seriousness that can be applied to a nurses experience of managing agitation in the workplace. The remaining two categories of perceived barriers and benefits can be applied to a n urses selection of management strategy to address resident agitation in the RACF environment . A more detailed discussion of the concepts and their related constructs follows. Demographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity) Sociopyschological variables (personality, social class) Structural variables (knowledge of agitation, prior contact with agitation) Perceived benefit Minus Perceived barrier s Perceived threat of agitation in RACF environment Cues to action Education, advocating essential oils, agitation interfering with RACF residents, staff and visitors, evidence of essential oil effect Self -Efficacy - Perceived ability to implement essential oils for the management of agitation management in RACFs Perceived susceptibility to agitation in RACFs Perceived seriousness of the consequences of agitation Perceived benefit of essential oil administration Perceived barriers to essential oil administration 10 1.4.1.1 Perceived susceptibility The construct of perceived susceptibility refers to the individual's belief in the level of personal risk they bear in contracting or being indirectly affected by a health condition (Rosenstock, 1974) . Nurses are directly responsible for the care and provisions of health regimes to residents within RACFs. Whil e the nurse is not directly susceptible to contracting agitation, the prevalence of agitation on the ward renders them acutely aware of the susceptibility of the residents and makes them indirectly susceptible to the behaviour. Nurses are often subjected t o constant repetitive verbal responses, verbal abuse or physical violence while also responsible for the safety of numerous vulnerable older adults. Many nurses find the agitation of others distressing and the restraint management barbaric and ineffective. Nurses understand that the older adults in their care deserve better management methods than those currently provided in many RACFs (Cheung et al., 2015; Gray & Rutledge, 2013). Perceived susceptibility is subjective and when an individual perceives they are at increased risk of being indirectly affected by agitation , they are often motivated to seek health regimes to prevent or reduce this risk (Rosenstock , 1974 ). However the HBM model postulates that susceptibility to a condition alone does not always le ad to the adoption of new health practices to mitigate risk (Gray & Rutledge, 2013). When perceived susceptibility combines with the seriousness, it results in a perceived threat to a person 's health status and current lifestyle (Cheung et al., 2015). For example, an individual may perceive themselves susceptible to agitation , however if this condition does not seriously affect their current lifestyle , the individual is less likely to take preventative action. 1.4.1.2 Perceived seriousness The HBM states the cons truct of perceived seriousness is informed by an individual's knowledge of the health condition and the degree of difficulty they perceive the health 11 status would create to their current lifestyle (Rosenstock , 1974 ). Detrimental effects of of agitation suc h as physical, psychological, and communicative impairments on an older person 's lifestyle are well documented; however, perceived seriousness remains subjective. When a nurse cannot manage agitation in one resident , this can adversely affect their work an d create a stressful environment for other residents, family and staff on the ward. Similarly, nurses who are frustrated by the intractable nature of agitation and its time -consuming management that interfere s with the routine tasks required to care for ot hers , are more likely to deem agitation as seriously affect ing their daily routine. In contrast, a RACF nurse who considers agitation to be a natural part of the ageing process will be less likely to feel the situation can be changed or to view the conditi on as serious. A high perceived seriousness combined with susceptibility to a health condition is enough to be recognised as a health threa t for many individuals, however it may or may not be sufficient to action the adoption of new health practices (Gray & Rutledge, 2013) . An individual must be able to see definite benefits associated with health behaviour change to incorporate the new practice into their lives. 1.4.1.3 Perceived benefits The HBM construct of perceived benefits refers to the degree to which the person believes that adopting the new practice will cure, prevent or manage the symptoms of the health condition (Rosenstock, 1974 ). Health promotion research suggests the availability of a health practice correlates strongly with benefits, as people are m ore likely to adopt and comply with a new health practice if it is readily available, and they believe the recommended action is effective in preventing or reducing the threat of a health condition (Mikhail, 1981) . A new health practice can only be adopted if the individual believes that the benefits of the practice outweigh the barriers (Gray & Rutledge, 2013; Wu et al., 2012) . 12 1.4.1.4 Perceived Barriers Research shows that perceived barriers are the most important construct in determining whether a person will t ake on a new health practice . Perceived barriers are the physical and psychological difficulties a person believes they will encounter when adopti ng the proposed health action (Rosenstock, 1974) . Physical barriers include lack of access due to cost or avai lability (Sharifirad, Pirzadeh, & Azadbakht, 2011; Wu et al., 2012) . Psychological barriers may include disbelief that the treatment will be effective in preventing or reducing the condition. The complexity of adopting a new health practice contains both p hysical and psychological characteristic s. Difficulties associated with starting a new health regime are developing a habit of compliance, fear of noncompliance to health regime, the inconvenience of having to give up current lifestyle choices and the emba rrassment created by the change (Rosenstock, 1974; Hayden, 2014) Cheung 's (2007) findings show that a major barrier to complementary and alternative medicine use is the limited evidence of effect and education sur rounding the use of therapies. Clearly a pe rson is more likely to adopt a new health practice if they believe the recommended action to be effective in preventing or reducing the complication of a health problem. Further research of Lavender or Lemon Balm effect as an agitation management, with strict adherence to research methodological procedure is needed to provide the scientific community with the evidence they require and the consumer confidence in the efficacy of the health practioners with the evidence to take the required action (Gray & Rutl edge, 2013) . 1.4.2 Modifying factors The second HBM concept , modifying factors suggests health behaviours are amended and enabled by variables such as demographics, personality, attitudes towards the health procedure, advice and social pressures, level of educat ion, motivations as well as past experiences and skills (Rosenstock, 1974 ). A person's age, genetic history and 13 personality can influence their perception of susceptibility to a health condition or how serious the health condition could potentially impact on their lifestyle (Hayden, 2014) . In addition, the structural variable of knowledge and past experiences can influence a person's health management preferences. A nurse who has been unsuccessful in resolving agitation in the past and has tried essential o ils with some success , is more likely to use essential oil management for agitation. In contrast , a nurse who has found complementary therapies to be ineffective as a management previously is less likely to adopt the practice. Cues to action are also consi dered a construct of modifying factors; they include any stimuli that trigger a person's decision to change behaviour (Rosenstock 1974; Hayden, 2014) . 1.4.2.1 Cues to action Cues to action are internal or external motivators that trigger a person to change their health behaviour positively through the adoption of healt hier practices ( Rosenstock , 1974 ). A cue to action can be a consequence of the concern created by personal analysis of perceived susceptibility and seriousness of contracting a particular health con dition that in turn elicits a positive health change. External motivators are often the outcome of recommendations from health professionals or as a result of media exposure (Gray & Rutledge, 2013; Mikhail, 1981) . Cues to action motivate people to take con trol of their health condition by prompting them to accept advice and comply with the adopted health practice. Nurses continue to comply with the adopted practices of chemical restraint to reduce older person agitation in the knowledge that the medications are often ineffective and expose residents to side effects that can create a worse problem than the initial agitation (Jeste & Maglione, 2013) . Often this knowledge is enough to warrant a cue to action to adopt less invasive and efficient methods to manag e agitation (Chaudrue, 2013) . However some nurses continue to ask for chemical restraints for their residents, this resistance to adopting safer , less invasive management may be attributed to low levels of self -efficacy, or belief that administering the in tervention will elicit 14 positive change . A lack of evidence of effect and practicality of essential oil use in the clinical environment often influences the likelihood of change in health management. 1.4.3 Likelihood of action Self-efficacy or the belief that the health practice will have a beneficial effect and that the practice is accessible and achievable is necessary for a person to take action in adopting a new health practice (Rosenstock, 1974; Cheung et al., 2015) . This state deemed as a readiness to action is achieved through personal analysis of perceived susceptibility and seriousness of the health condition, coupled with a weighing up of perceived benefits against barriers to adopting the health practice. Individuals with low levels of readiness often re quire a strong stimuli cue to action for health practice to be adopted. In contrast, a person with a high degree of readiness may only require a small stimulus cue to action for the same practice to be adopted (Franckowiak & Glick, 2015; Hayden, 2014) . 1.4.3.1 Self-efficacy The adoption of a new health practice is dependent on an individual's self -efficacy or belief in their own ability to take control and manage their health by incorporating the new practice into their lifestyle (Rosenstock, 1974; Franckowiak & Gl ick, 2015; Hayden, 2014) . If the person believes they cannot implement the health practice, or that it may be difficult to assimilate into their current lifestyle, they may not take action even if they believe the health practice has benefits (Rosenstock, 1974) . Many older adults in the RACF environment are reliant on nursing staff to provide health interventions; therefore this research in this is primarily aimed at creating self -efficacy in nurses. Identifying perceived barriers to the implementation of p ositive health practices and providing support for education and encouragement may foster self -efficacy. Finally, in the HBM for a new health practice to be adopted , the individual must conduct a personal risk analysis of the threat to health and an evalua tion of remedies, particular ly, the benefits and ease implementation to lifestyle. As with risk management 15 the probability of a useful out come and likelihood of the risk occurring play an essential role in a person's decision making. A beneficial result mu st, therefore, be weighed against the individual's objection to implementing the health practice (Rosenstock, 1974; Hayden, 2014) . As such the nurse may consider their susceptibility and the seriousness of agitation in their workplace. Modifying factors of age, personality, education, experience and health literacy will affect their perception of susceptibility and seriousness as well as their perception of benefits and barriers to adopting es sential oils for management (Chaudrue, 2013; Gray & Rutledge, 201 3). In line with the HBM, this study examined the nurse perception with the objective of identifying perceived susceptibility and seriousness of agitation as well as their perception of the benefits and barriers to implementing essential oils as an agitat ion management in the RACF setting. Further, the single blind RCT was conducted to provide evidence of essentia l oil efficacy as management for agitation to overcome existing barriers. Research assistants supported the essential oil intervention in the RAC F to ensure compliance and foster self -efficacy in nurses. A final interview with nursing staff was conducted to monitor changes in attitudes that had occurred over the essential oil trial. Nurses in RACFs acknowledge agitation to be distressing for the pe rson experiencing the agitation and all those in the vicinity of the behaviour, including the staff (NSW NMA, 2016; Hofmann & Hahn, 2014) . Agitation management requires the urgent attention of the nurse , is time -consuming, and the intractable nature of the behaviour often leaves the nurse frustrated. There is evidence that agitation management commonly used in RACFs is ineffective or unjustifiable (Burns et al. 2011) ; however nurses continue to comply with these management methods while remaining non -compli ant to research that in vestigates alternate management (Burns et al. 2011) . The HBM has been used in health promotion to influence people towards healthier choices or management of 16 health conditions (Quaranta & Spencer, 2015) . The Health Belief model provi des an understanding of the barriers, facilitators and practicalities as well as the potentiality for use of nurse administration of essential oils in the management of older adult agitation in RACFs. The HBM postulates that for the nurse to adopt a new health practice such as essential oils, the change is reliant on two factors. The first factor is dependent on the value that the nurse attributes to the reduction or elimination of agit ation in the RACF environment. The second factor is the belief held by the nurse that the essential oils or new health management could reduce or el iminate agitation on the ward (Rosenstock, 1974) . 1.5 Gaps in the literature This research sought to give evidence to Lavender or Lemon Balm 's effect as agitation management by addre ssing limitations in the literature and expanding on current knowledge. Pertinent areas of methodological limitation, inclusion of resident s without dementia, nurse understanding of agitation management and nurse compliance to research were identified as a reas for further investigation. Specific areas for investigation are discussed in further detail. 1.5.1.1 Managing agitation for residents without dementia Previous studies investigating the use of Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oils for agitation management in RACFs have largely focused on resident s diagnosed with dementia ( Burns et al., 2011 ; Fu et al., 2013 ; Fujii et al., 2008 ; Lin, Chan, Ng, & Lam, 2007 ). One study (Sakamoto et al., 2012) that did include people who do not have dementia , primarily investigated the effect of Lavender essential oils influence on older adult falls, over a 12 -month period. The inclusion of resident s without d ementia who exhibit unresolved agitation in essential oil studies can create a more inclusive policy for management of agitation in RACFs. In addition, essential oils may have a diff ering effect 17 on agitation for peo ple with and without dementia that requires investigation . Finally essential oil therapy when administered by the nurse is often enjoyable and well tolerated by older people , potentially improving quality of life for the re sident without dementia. 1.5.1.2 Nurse understanding of agitation management The literature reports that nurses consider complementary therapies to be effective in reducing agitation, however they continue to use restraint to mitigate behaviour (Azermai et al., 2014 ). Restraints contribute to physical and psychological decline while placing the resident at increased risk of serious injury and mortality (NS W NMA, 2016). Further, Ballad and Corbett's (2010) systematic review of efficacy and safety for chemical restraints commonly used in RACFs found a threefold increased risk of cardiovascular event to outweigh the temporary reduction of agitation experienced by the older pe rson at 12 weeks. Coon et al., (2014) research found chemical restraints continued to be prescribed to older adults regardless of educational initiatives to reduce prescribing. Other research suggests restraints may be popular as they serve to lessen the n urse's workload , provide ease in resident surveillance, short -term agitation management (Hofmann & Hahn, 2014 ; Jeste & Maglione, 2013 ) and minimise disruption to other residents ( Abermain et al, 2014). The reasons why nurses do not adopt gentler strategies such as complementary therapies for agitation management in favour of continued restraint use is an importa nt area for research. 18 1.5.1.3 Nurse compliance to research Nurse compliance to essential oil research protocol was recognised as a limitation in two studies (Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013) . Burns et al (2011) study found essential oil bottle weight at re search conclusion to indicate that the nurses had only administered 50% of the intervention to the older person. Nurses compliance to research protocol is necessary to provide the evidence of the intervention effect that nursing management requires for a b asis of clinical practice. The research speculates that nurse participation in research may be influenced by competing workload demands, level of research knowledge or challenges to research implementation in the RACF environment (Akerjordet, Lode, & Severinsson, 2012 ; Roll et al., 2013 ; Vedel\u00f8 & Lomborg, 2011 ). Alternatively nurses may lack belief in the benefits of the essential oil intervention to reduce agitation or its practicality in the RACF setting (Gray & Rutledge, 2 013; Hayden, 2014 ). Further investigation of nurse perceptions and barriers to the administration of essential oils is necessary to ensure practicality of the potential agitation management in Australi an RACFs. Several areas for further investigation have been identified from the literature that supported the significance of this study. 1.6 Significance of study This study is significant as it adds knowledge to the current body of evidence surrounding the u se of essential oil to manage agitation in older adults living in RACFs. Specifically, knowledge has been added in the three areas of (1) agitation management for older people with and without dementia living in RACFs, (2) the efficacy of Lavender compared to Lemon Balm for the management of agitation in this population and (3) nurse compliance to research in the RACF setting. This study is the first to compare agitation, agitation management and essential oil effect for agitation for older people with and without dementia in a single study. Baseline agitation comparisons between older people with dementia living in RACFs raises 19 awareness of the frequency and commonalities of behaviours exhibited in the different cognitive groups. Nursing strategies used to manage agitation in older people were compared for differences and similarity in approach. The study is also the first to compare Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils for effect as agitation management of residents in RACFs. Lavender and Lemon Balm esse ntial oils have demonstrated some evidence of effect in reducing agitation in older people with dementia and without dementia living in RACFs (Ballard et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2007; Fujji et al., 2008; Sakamoto et al., 2013). This study compare s the effec t of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils between residents with and without dementia. This study overcomes some methodological limitations identified in previous studies such as blinding methods and counterbalancing, and therefore adds to the body of evidence for the effect of Lavender and Lemon Balm as agitation management for residents in RACFs. This study is further significant as it examined the RACF environment for influencing factors that can improve nurse compliance to research. This study invest igated nurse knowledge of agitation management to establish their understanding of the research problem. Nurse perceptions were further investigated to identify preconceived belief s in essential oils effect and the practicalities of implementing essential oil research in the RACF environment. Finally, this research provides direct nurse responses for non - compliance to research and influencing factors that can support future research in the RACF environment. 1.7 Purpose The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Lavender and Lemon Balm essenti al oils as agitation management for residents with and without dementia, in RACF s. This study also sought to explore nurse s understanding of agitation management 20 for residents in RACFs and to improve nurs e research compliance by identifying influencing factors that support research in the RACF environment. 1.8 Research objectives and q uestions Phase I The objectives of Phase I were to: 1. Explore nurse understanding of agitation and its influence on the manageme nt of resident behaviour in RACFs? 2. Explore nurse perception of essential oils and their use to manage agitation . 3.

The first section examines the ageing population, the high prevalence of agitation in this population and the problem this presents for care in the RACF environment. The second section explores definition s of agitation including a list of associated behaviours . Further, this section explores causative factors that can contribute to agitation in older people. National guidelines for the assessment of agitation in RACFs that guide nurse responses to agitated behaviour are also presented. The final section examine s the current nurse initiated interventions to reduce agitation in residents in RACF. 2.2 Ageing, agitation and RACF care People in deve loped countries are, in general living long er than in previous generations due to advances in the standard of living, educa tion, healthcare provision and nutrition. (AIHW, 2015b ). Currently people aged 60 years and over account for 12. 5% of the global population and this figure is predicted to rise to almost 22% in 2050 (Guzaman, Pawliczko, Beales, Till, & Voelcker, 2012) . In Australia, the older adult population has increased by 300% in the last five decades. The most dramatic increase has been in 85 year and over population, that has increased by 153% in the last two decades in comparison with a total growth in population of 32%. The older adult population in Australia is predicted to continue to rise with the over 85 years age group increasing four fold by 2060 (AIHW, 2015b). As older adults are living longer, frailty and the complexity of age rela ted disorders and comorbid ities have increased. Chronic health conditions of dementia, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders and sensory impairment are prevalent in this population (AIHW, 2015b) . The need to provide care for the aged population will be complicated by 24 a progressive de cline in the contingent workforce and the necessity for family members to work to support household need. This poses the question of how the community will support the care needs of older adults in years to come (Valenzuela, 2015) . A greater demand will be placed on RACFs to accommodate older adults with increased frailty and higher complexity of care needs who can no longer live in the community. Residential aged care facilities operate on a minimal nurse to resident ratio , therefore services and facilitie s will require efficient and effective management if nurses are to meet the care needs of residents (Willis et al., 2016) . 2.2.1 Australian RACFs and their vulnerable population Residential aged care facilities provide accommodation and supported living for peop le who can no longer live at home, frequently due to infirmity or diminished cognitive capacity. In 2014, RACFs were home to 273,559 Australians over the age of 65 (AIHW, 2015b) . The majority of people that live in aged care are over the age of 80 years (7 7%) , the mean age for women 85.8 and men 81.6 years. Ninety -six percent of RACF residents are now over the age of 65 years and one in three residents are over the age of 90 years (AIHW, 2015b; DSS, 2015) . Australian RACFs are home to people from diverse cu ltural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Many of these residents are first generation migrants to Australia who seek to retain their heritage after they move to the facility (ABS, 2013). The population over the age of 65 years born outside Australia is report edly growing rapidly with multicultural representation in RACF increasing (ABS, 2013; AIHW, 2015b; DSS, 2015) . Older adults are entering aged care with increasing levels of frailty and complexity with the majority of service providers now making available a mixed level of high and low care in each facility (AIHW, 2012; AIHW 2015a) . The health conditions common to older people in RACFs include disorders of the nervous , endocrine, cardiovascular or systems or cancer (AIHW, 2015c ). Infirmity a nd increased dependence 25 on care staff can escalate challenging behaviour in residents (DoHA, 2014; Pritchard & Brighty, 2015) . The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2015c) reported in the residential aged care census 2013 -2014, that behavioural p roblems were prevalent among residents in RACFs , with over two -thirds (67%) of residents requiring high -level care to manage behaviours. Further, it was noted that 52% of people living in RACFs have a recorded dementi a diagnosis, of these residents 81.1% r equired high -level care for behaviours. It was also noted that 45.6% of residents who did not have a dementia diagnosis also required high -level care for behaviours (AIHW, 2015b) . Management of behaviour is a priority in RACFs to provide a safe , conducive living environment for all residents. 2.2.2 Agitation in the RACF environment Agitation is common in the RACF environment and nurses are frequently challenged to manage unpredictable, disruptive, abusive or physically violent behaviour among residents (Cohen -Mansfield et al., 2007; NSW NMA, 2016) . Agitation requires the immediate attention by staff to resolve the situation, protect the agitated person and regain environmental equilibrium (Zwijsen et al., 2014) , which imposes a significant burden on nurses as it diverts attention from the care of other residents (King, 2012) . The time necessary to assess, manage or continually monitor a resident with agitation is highly demanding of the nurse's time and some manifestations of agitated behaviour are seemingly intra ctable (Poole & Mott, 2003) . Time restrictive schedules and reoccurring agitation can leave nurses discouraged at their inability to manage the situation effectively (Edberg et al., 2008; Poole & Mott, 2003) . This often results in the use of chemical or p hysical restraint to control the behaviour (Hofmann & Hahn, 2014; Lesser & Hughes, 2006) as a strategy to enable nurses the convenience to resume care duties with the knowledge that the resident's behaviour is contained, with nurses monitoring their respon se to being restrained (Kong 26 & Evans 2016 ). However, restraints are a short -term management for behaviour and are often ineffective while posing significant risk to the older adults physical and emotional wellbeing (NSW NMA, 2016; Poole & Mott, 2003) . Agitation affects an older person's social circumstance, as behaviours are not well understood by others , leading to misunderstandings and quarrels. People with agitation are more likely to become victims of social discrimination that can result in isolation (King, 2012) . Family members often feel distressed and helpless at the behaviour they witness (Kyomen & Whitfield, 2008) and this can result in fewer visits or a request for chemical restraint in the hope that their relative will settle (Hofmann & Hahn, 20 14). The costs to the facility in staffing and training as a result of agitation are high. Increased sick leave, worker's compensation and staff turnover attributed to carer strain are expensive. The recruitment of new employees or the reliance on agency s taff is both expensive and compromises continuity of care (Edberg et al., 2008; Zwijsen et al., 2014) . Ongoing training in agitation assessment and safety is often mandatory for staff , proving expensive to the organisation. Due to the high frequency of agi tation in RACFs , staff training is pivotal to provision of resident and staff safety (Burn et al. 2011; O'Conner et al., 2013). 2.3 Defining agitation There is a lack of consensus in determining a concise definition for agitation; rather there is agreement tha t agitation pertains to a specific set of observable physical and verbal behaviours widely accepted to have an origin of inner turmoil (Grose & Schub, 2013; Brighty, 2015) . New South Wales Health (2014) defines agitation as a phenomenon that is multi -dimensional and complex associated with a person's psychosomatic condition. Pritchard and Brighty (2015) postulated that agitation is a subjective experience of inner tension observable to others in the person's 27 behaviour. Kop ecky, Kope cky and Yudosky (1998) described agitation as urgent, unpredictable and destructive in nature, resulting in carer stress. While some consensus has been reached, a lack of clarity in defining the limitation of agitation has created some confusion in the literature. Dewing (2010) noted that agitation is often used interchangeably with aggression (Ballard, Corbett, Chitramohan, & Aarsland, 2009 a), similarly anxiety and agitation often share the same representation in the literature (Alzhiemers Assoc iation, 2015) . Poole and Motte's (2003) attempt to clarify a definition led to the identification of 47 behaviours considered agitation. Garriga et al. (2016) combines previous thought on agitation to propose a definition of non - productive and \"repetitious activity that consists of behaviours such as pacing, fidgeting, wringing of the hands, pulling of clothes and inability to sit still (p 87)\". This a mbiguity has led to the reliance on measurement tools that assess agitation to clarify meaning, in particul ar the widely accepted Cohen -Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Measurement tools of the CMAI and NPI, while currently relied on by researchers to inform characteristics of agitation, are designed to measure behaviou rs in the clinical setting rather than provide clarification and meaning. Dewing (2010) postulated that greater clarity is needed in defining agitation and associated behaviours. In 2015 the International Psychogeriatric Association formed an Agitation De finition Workgroup to develop a provisional consensus definition of agitation that can be applied in clinical and research settings. An interim definition by Cummings et al. (2015) defined agitation to be a symptom common to neuropsychiatric disorders that can contribute to institutionalisation, disability and diminished quality of life for the older person and the caregiver. The research community waits with anticipation for the IPA revised definition of agitation. 28 In the absence of a definition of agitat ion this study uses the three behavioural constructs determined by Cohen -Mansfield and Billing (1986) o f physical aggressive, physical non- aggressive , and verbal behaviour that was aggressive or non -aggressive, to clarify the behavioural characteristic of agitation. Table 1 lists presents Cohen -Mansfield behaviour categories with characteristic and examples provided. Category Characteristic Behaviour Physical aggressive agitation Motor activity hostility Biting, falling intentionally, grabbing, hitting, hurting oneself or others, falling intentionally, kicking, pushing, scratching, sexual advances, spitting, tearing things or throwing. Physical non aggressive agitation Motor activity in the absence of hostility Exit -seeking behaviour, handling things, hid ing things, hoarding, inappropriate dressing or disrobing, inappropriate eating or drinking, night awakening, pacing, repetitive mannerisms and restlessness. Verbal agitation Vocal activity both aggressive or non - aggressive Aggressive - cursing, insults, making strange noises, shouting, screaming and verbal sexual advances. Non a ggressive - attention seeking, complaining, negativism, repetitive sentences or questions. Table 1 Cohen -Mansfield (1986) behaviour categories 2.3.1 Causes of ag itation Causative factors of agitation provide differing perspectives on the origin of the agitated behaviour. Cohen -Mansfied summarised four models that explain causes of agitation including the biological; unmet need; behavioural, and environmental mode ls (Cohen - Mansfield, 2000) . The literature considers all causes of agitation to have beginnings in the unmet need model with each model containing some overlap (Bidewell & Chang, 2010) . Despite overlap, models have independent schools of thought and discip linary perspectives that explain the cause of agitation. Each model is discussed separately in this section. 29 2.3.1.1 Biological model The biological model attributes agitation to underlying pathology. Agitation from biological causes is considered common in olde r adults precipitated by acute or chronic illness in the presence of degeneration associated with ageing or infirmity. Agitation from acute biological disturbances can often be resolved with careful assessment to identify cause and treatment. Agitation res ulting from chronic biological causes can prove more difficult to resolve , often requiring ongoing monitoring and attention to management plans (DoHA, 2014). Biological conditions common to older people that result in agitation include delirium, sensory de ficit, chronic or unresolved pain, anxiety, depression and dementia (Pritchard & Brighty, 2015) . Delirium is agitation that results from acute biological conditions. Common older adult conditions associated with delirium are infection, particularly urinary tract, dehydration, polypharmacy, and chemical or electrolyte imbalances (Kyomen & Whitfield, 2008; Pritchard & Brighty, 2015). Older adults are predisposed to delirium due to increased frailty; any condition that affects the neuronal processes can precip itate delirium Fong, . Delirium accounts for 30 -40% of hospital presentations by older adults, with symptoms that include sudden onset of acute confusion often accom panied by Delirium in the presence of chronic conditions or sensory impairment can further compound the person's agitation. Sensory deficits such as impaired hearing or eyesight can make communication difficult , increasing the likelihood of a situation to be misinterpreted (Alzheimers Australia, 2012; Ballard & Corbett, 2010) which may result in resident's needs being misconstrued by staff. This can prove frustrating for the older adult and time consuming for the carer in their attempt to determine an older adult's requirements. Agitation can result from the 30 older adult becoming anxious or irritable, concerned that their needs may not be met (Pritchard & Brighty, 2015). Vi sual and hearing aids may mitigate this situation correcting the agitation. Pain is not well managed in RACFs with estimates that 85% of residents experience pain at least once a week (Conway & Higgins, 2011) often presenting as agitation. Older adults can contribute to pain being unresolved due to attitudes of stoicism, fear of addiction to pain medication and belief that pain is a natural part of ageing, these beliefs are more prevalent in people aged over 65 years (Savvas & Gibson, 2015) . Pain that is u nresolved or chronic can contribute to agitated behaviours of restlessness, irritability, anxiety and depression (Ballard & Corbett, 2010) . The role of anxiety (Twelftree & Qazi, 2006) or depression (Volicer, Frijters, & Van der Steen, 2012) and their rela tionship to agitation is well documented in the literature (Drageset et al., 2013) . Conditions of anxiety or depression can be attributed to situational circumstance or imbalances in the central nervous system (CNS). Major mediators for anxiety appear to b e related to increases in norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitters with the sympathetic nervous system providing many of the symptoms (Alexander, Sahib, Michael, & Jason, 2013) . Major mediators for depressio n in the CNS appear to be the depletion of neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine (McCrae & Khan, 2014) . The conditions of anxiety and depression are reported to be high among older people living in the residential aged care environment (R oyal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, 2010). Australian Bureau of Statistics (2013) reported that in 2011 78% of residents exhibited a mental illness with 26% of these residents not having a diagnosis of dementia. The most prevalent m ental health conditions for older people without dementia are anxiety and depression. A 2010 review of anxiety and depression in Australian RACFs revealed 31 34.7% of residents held a diagnosis of one or both of these conditions ( RANZCP, 2010). In light of th ese figures, the literature still attests that anxiety and depression are under - reported in RACFs with anxiety being the more prevalent of the two conditions (AIHW, 2013) . Drageset et al., (2013) claimed that due to increased aged related health loss, powe rlessness, and dependency many people living in RACFs feel vulnerable, regardless of existing diagnosis and previous mental health background. These older adults are more likely to become anxious or depressed and experience agitation. The AIHW (2013) repor ted that residents with depression were more likely to exhibit verbal or physical agitation in the trajectory of their health condition. Residents without dementia who have depression experienced verbal agitation (34%) or physical agitation (25%) twice as often as people without dementia who do not have depression. Drageset et al., (2012) and Beyond Blue (2015) specify the agitated behaviours of anxiety and depression commonly include the wringing of hands, pacing, restlessness, anxious physical or verbal r eactions, irritability, aggressiveness, anger, and sleep disturbances. Anxiety or depression is further complicated for people with dementia as these agitated behaviours may be overlooked and attributed to the dementia trajectory. Agitation is claimed to b e the most frequently observed and intractable Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia [BPSD] (Akhondzadeh, 2003; Ballard & Corbett, 2010) BPSD is common in people with dementia with 90% of this population experiencing o ne or more symptom s in their trajectory (DeYoung et al., 2002; Raetz, 2013) . Agitated behaviour in dementia can include aggressiveness, delusions, hoarding, irritability, resistance to care, restlessness, sleep problems, wandering and yelling (Raetz, 2013) . The symptom of aggression is most concerning , often triggered during interactions when assisting the older person with their care needs. Aggression affects the quality of the person's relationship with their carer and is 32 rated among the most common reaso n why people present to permanent RACF residency (AIHW, 2012.) . Agitation is commonly associated with dementia, which is an umbrella term for a variety of progressive brain diseases that are characterised by loss of core abilities in addition to abnormalit ies of mood and behaviour (Holmes, 2012) . The four common types of dementia presentations are Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular Dementia, Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Frontotemporal Dementia (Hughes, 2011) . Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterised by progres sive insidious loss of core function, changes in mood and behaviour as the brain becomes increasingly atrophied. The brain is lighter with increased silver inter -neuronal tangles and extra -neuronal plaques with amyloid deposits (Hughes, 2011) . The risk of AD increases with age and genetic predisposition (Holmes, 2012). Vascular Dementia (VaD) is a common form of dementia that results from the loss of neurons and axioms resulting from impaired supply of blood to the brain that often occurs during cerebral i nfarcts or stroke (Holmes, 2012). VaD is characterised by sudden onset of symptoms and changes in a person's function; the mix of a persons retained and lost function are dependent on the area of the brain affected by the impaired blood supply (Hughes, 201 1). Lewy Bodies Dementia contains extracellular structures called Lewy's bodies that are also located in the cerebral cortex of people with Parkinson's disease. Amyloid plaque is present, however there is no neocortical pathology as in AD. Lewy Bodies Dem entia presents as altered consciousness, vivid visual illusions, and hallucinations. People with Lewy Bodies Dementia often have difficulty in maintaining attention and spatial awareness, and therefore falls are not uncommon (Holmes, 2012; Hughes, 2011) . 33 Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is characterised by atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres and presents with changes in personality and communication difficulties in the form of altered speech. Communication is often complicated by progressive aphasia, repetitio n or mutism (Holmes, 2012; Hughes, 2009). Residents with dementia often present with impaired communication and progressive aphasia which can prove frustrating for the resident when attempting to communicate needs or requirements to care staff in RACFs. 2.3.1.2 Unmet need theory The literature considers all agitated behaviour to have an origin in unmet need (King, 2012) with agitation being a response to incongruence in physical, social or environment circumstance (Dewing, 2010) . The Macquarie D ictionary defines n eed as a \"case or instance in which some necessity or want exists; that is, a requirement.\" (Macquarie Dictionary, 2013 p.1140). Needs can be common to an age group or an individual preference of that person . Older adults have common needs associated with their age, declining health and protection of their human rights. Individual needs are often formed from preferences created over a lifetime of routine and habit. These individual preferences are often intractable in an older person's personality, form the ir identity and the way in which they perceive themselves. However, individual preferences may be difficult to accommodate in the institutionalised environment of the RACF, which can lead to resident distress. The unmet need theory recognises that the RACF environment often fails to meet the individual physical, emotional and spiritual requirements of the older person. If needs are not met , frustration or anxiety often ensues, culminating in agitation (DoHA, 2014 ). In 1991 the UN declared their principles for the older person with the aim to bring awareness to the contributions made by older people to society and \"add life to the years of life added\" (United Nations, 1991) . The D eclaration contains 18 principles under 34 categories of independence, participati on, care, self -fulfilment and dignity and these principles are designed to underpin the minimum standards of older adult care provision in RACFs (United Nations, 1991) . Brownie and Horstmanshof (2012) acknowledge the principles to be embedded in Australian RACF care standards and often promoted to older Australians as achievable when entering into a RACF. A promise made by providers that often proves challenging to deliver in the RACF environment. Further , the UN principles recognise the ne eds of older adul ts to include but not be limited to; access to effective timely pain relief, exercise, mentally stimulating activities, hobbies, maintaining habitual routines, socialisation and the need to practice spirituality in an accepting and accommodating environmen t (Ball & Haight, 2005; Cohen -Mansfield, -Ali, & Freedman, 2012; Turner, 2005) . Yet despite increases in government funding, RACFs often have difficulty meeting the individual preferences and care demands for older adults. Cognitively i ntact older people have associated entry into RACFs with a loss of autonomy and independence, loneliness and containment in the facilities, stating feeling \"trapped, stuck, confined, isolated and discouraged \" (Brownie & Hortmanshoff, 2012 , p. 778 ) and o f institutionalised conformity \" We are told when to eat when to shower, everything and no one says a 0 word\" (Brownie and Hortmanshoff, 2012 , p. 781 ). These unmet needs and unrealised expectations contribute to increased anxi ety, loneliness and frustration, often observed as agitation. Older adults frequently have social and emotional unmet needs with many encountering life changes and challenges previously unconsidered when entering a RACF. Adapting to the new environment can prove challenging for older adult s as many lifetime habits require changing to conform to facility life and the loss of privacy can be confronting. Older adults experience significant losses that are often not considered earlier in life; many residents are contemplating the loss of indepe ndence, activities of daily living (ADLs) and home (Drageset et al., 2012) . Progressive loss of health is common as 80% 35 of older people have one or more chronic conditions (AIHW, 2010) . Furthermore, older people can also experience loss of family or friend s through relocation or death , leading to isolation and loneliness (Drageset et al., 2012) . Making new friends can also be difficult due to failing health and high incidents of cognitive decline in facilities (Routasalo, Savikko, Tilvis, Strandberg, & Pit kala, 2006) . In addition Erikson's theory (1959) of psychosocial development consisting of eight distinct lifestyle phases, considers many individuals contemplate their accomplishments in the later stage of life. An older person who perceives they conducte d their life with integrity is more likely to look back with satisfaction. While an individual who perceives their life to have been unproductive is more likely to experience despair and possible depression (McLeod, 2013) . It is hardly surprising that a h igher prevalence of depression and anxiety is reported for older adults living in RACFs when compared with similar populations in the community (Brownie & Horstmanshof, 2012; Dragaset et al, 2013) . These incongruences for older people in the RACF environme nt serve to increase stress in many individuals. 2.3.1.3 Behavioural Model The B ehavioural model implies that the agitated behaviour is learned and persists as the older person receives a reward for this behaviour in the environment, with the nurse's attention bei ng the reward Raynor, 1920 ). The behavioural model suggests that the unmet need for attention or companionship stemming from loneliness or to alleviate boredom can be the driver for some resident's agitated behaviour (Bidewell & Cha ng, 2010) . The nurse is required to manage agitation in an equitable and consistent manner. When nurses believe that a residents' behaviour is a result of attention seeking they can become frustrated with the time spent managing the agitation that takes pr iority over competing care demands. In time , the resident's 36 behaviour may be overlooked or trivialised re -enforcing the unmet need for attention in the environment (Reader & Gillespie, 2013). 2.3.1.4 Environmental model The E nvironmental model links agitation to e xternal factors that cause the older person stress, as it postulates that a person is more content when the environment aligns with their needs. Increased vulnerability to environmental stresses is common in older people due to a dementia diagnosis or the lowering of a person's stress threshold with age (Chrabaszcz, 2014) . Environmental stresses may include, but are not limited to unmet care needs, noise, sensory impairment or difficulties in completing everyday tasks such as eating or grooming. The P rogres sivel y Lowered Stress T hreshold (PLST) theory considers each individual to have a stress threshold that is set during adulthood that can be temporarily altered during times of illness, or permanently altered during episodes of brain damage as in the case o f dementia. When this threshold is breached the person has limited coping mechanisms to deal with stress and may begin to exhibit agitated behaviours such as aggression, wandering, shouting, irritability or compulsive, repetitive physical or verbal behavio ur (Tyrrell, 2014) . Older adults with dementia or infirmity can be susceptible to environmental stressors. Stressors in the environment can render a person anxious, often resulting in anger or irritability if they perceive to have lost personal freedom or control over the situation (Anderson, 2011) . This response is a reaction to perceived loss of autonomy, independence and value. According to Chrabaszcz (2014), common stressors in older adults include fatigue, changes in routine, noise , as well as demands that the resident places on themselves or others that are unachievable. Physical conditions of pain, acute illness or depression were also found to increase agitation in older adults influencing a persons stress threshold (Alzheimers Australia, 2012) . 37 Agitation in RACFs impacts on the person and all those within the vicinity of the behaviour. A careful initial assessment of the resident's circumstances and their response can identify triggers or underlying causes that may contribute to the agitation (Raet z, 2013) . Identifying causes of agitation can enable staff to correctly and appropriately manage the situation to reduce or eliminate agitated behaviour (NSW DoH, 2014). 2.3.2 Assessment of agitation In Australia, there are set guidelines and protocols for the management of older adult agitation in RACFs. The New South Wales Department of Health guidelines (2014), recommend a careful assessment of the older person's physical, mental and psychosocial status as well as environmental circumstances to identify cause s of agitation (NSW DoH, 2014). Within 28 days of entering an aged care facility residents are assessed for the Aged Care Funding Instrument [ACFI] as well as social background and preferences are documented in the first 28 days of residency (Australian Go vernment, 2016). These assessmen ts, which are regularly updated, determine Government subsidy and also assist staff to provide personalised care and activities to the resident. This detailed account of the resident can alert staff to incongruences in the r esident's usual health status or environment that can trigger agitation. Nurses use information from these assessments of the older persons usual health status, their preferences and routine behaviours when assessing and managing agitation (Australian Gove rnment, 2017) . The New South Wales Department of Health (2014) recommends a six -step process for nurses when responding to older people with agitation in RACFs. The first step recommends nurses remain calm when approaching a person with agitation. Further , to be respectful of the person's feelings and to reassure all within the vicinity of the behaviour. Secondly, to identify details of the behaviour and event for later documentation. Thirdly , the nurse must assess the older person's physical, mental and psychosocial status , and environmental situation. The fourth step requires the nurse to 38 identify causative factors from the assessment that may have triggered the agitation. A fifth step requires the nurse to choose and implement a management strategy that can reduce the trigger of the agitation. Evaluation of the resident's response to the management strategies is the final step in the process. If the behaviour is not resolved by the final step , the nurse is required to begin the process again (NSW DoH, 201 4). Identification of causative factors for agitation with the implementation of strategies to minimise their impact is considered the most effective way to reduce agitation in an older person (DoHA, 2014) . However when causative factors are not forthcom ing this process can prove frustrating and time -consuming for the nurse. The assessment process requires one -on-one interaction with the resident to identify causes. The time taken to assess and manage agitation is often increased if the older person's com munication or comprehension is impaired (Ballard & Corbett, 2010). When causative factors are not identified by assessment, nurses employ a variety of management strategies to reduce agitation with varying degrees of effect and safety. 2.4 Management of agita tion in RACFs This section discusses how nurses manage agitation in the RACF environment, described under the headings: distraction; physical restraint; chemical restraint, and complementary therapies. 2.4.1 Distraction Nurses frequently use distraction as a ma nagement strategy to de -escalate agitation in older people ( Duxbury, Pulsford, Hadi & Sykes, 2013) . Using distraction techniques to divert the older person's attention to another topic or activity and reduce the focus of the causative faction, an older per son is often consumed by frightening, strong emotions that lead the individual to feel out of control with their environment (King, 2012). Distraction strategies can allow the emotions time to decrease in intensity to be more easily managed by the older pe rson. Older people may be more susceptible to distraction 39 techniques for behaviour management. Weeks an d Hashner (2014) report that older people are more likely to process distractions in their environment than younger people. Further, they suggest distrac tion can reduce an older person's memory of the original topic of concentration. Nurses are frequently challenged to initiate appropriate person -centred distraction interventions for older people experiencing agitation in their care (Duxbury et al., 2013) . A person's level of engagement in a distraction topic may be directly related to their interest in the new scenario presented (Dombeck, 2015). Nurses are guided by their knowledge of the older person's preferences when implementing distractions including conversational topics, activities or complementary therapies. For example, a nurse may instigate a song for a resident with an appreciation for singing or a conversation about the arrival of a new great -grandchild for another. Distraction is , however, a t emporary strategy and when the activity finishes or the nurse is no longer available to instigate distraction agitation often reoccurs for the older person (Dombeck, 2015). Reoccurring agitation can leave the nurse frustrated with their inability to manage the behaviour which can result in the use of restraint to manage behaviour (Hofmann & Hahn, 2014). 2.4.2 Physical restraints One form of management of agitation is the use of physical restraint. Physical restraint is the intentional restriction of a person's movement through device or force (NSW DoH, 2014 ; Garri ga et al., 2016 ). The use of restraints in RACFs is supported in circumstances where there is a serious threat to the resident or another resident's safety. Methods of physical restraint in RACFs include lap belts, tabletops , bed rails and water chairs (Hughes, 2009; NSW DoH, 2014) . Restraints are an attempt to provide a safe environment for the resident, however research indicates a lack of efficacy and increased risk to resident safety with the use of re straint (Royal College of Nursing, 2008) . Research into use of restraints report confusion is escalated in the resident and 40 communication is impaired further compromising the ability to identify causative factors. These side effects also contribute to incr eased cognitive decline, risk of morbidity and mortality (Cohen -Mansfield et al., 2007; NSW DoH, 2014) . Further investigation into physical restraints report that residents maintain better physical health and mobility and are more able to participate in ac tivities when they are not restrained (NSW DoH, 2014) . The use of physical restraint is demoralizing for an older person and is often interpreted as punishment. Restraints impair a resident's self - reliance, detrimentally affecting their self -confidence tha t can contribute to physical and psychological decline (NSW NMA, 2016) . Some suggest that physical restraints are more likely to contribute to increased risk of serious injury from inappropriate use or resident's resistance (NSW DoH, 2014; Tilly & Reed, 20 06). Awareness of the detrimental effect of physical restraint on older adults has resulted in new procedural monitoring in facilities, consisting of an hourly assessment of the resident's emotional and physical wellbeing as well as the continued justific ation for restraint requirement (Burns, Jayasinha, & Brodaty, 2014) . Restraints for older people in RACFs are not limited to physical restriction of movement and often include chemical restraint. 2.4.3 Chemical restraints Chemical restraint is the intentional u se of medication for the sole purpose of controlling a person's behaviour (NSW DoH, 2014) . Medications prescribed for chemical restraint in older adults usually influence gamma -Aminobutyric [ GABA] processes, acetylcholine, and serotonin or dopamine neurotr ansmitters to lower agitation. Atypical antipsychotics are the most commonly prescribed chemical restraints to manage agitation in older adults. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare (2015) reported that 919,026 Pharmaceutical Benef its Scheme [PBS] antipsychotic medication prescriptions were dispensed in 2013 - 2014 for people over the age of 65 41 years, representing more than 25% of this population. A total cost of antipsychotic medications use to the PBS was estimated in 2007 to be $ 334.4 million (Hollingworth, Siskind, Nissen, Robinson, & Hall, 2010) . Medications used in agitation include predominantly atypical antipsychotics as well as alternate pharmacology's of benzodiazepines, cholinesterase inhibitors, memantime, antidepressants and anticonvulsant medications. These medications are discussed in further detail in this section. 2.4.3.1 Atypical antipsychotics Atypical antipsychotics are neuroleptic medications that act major tranquillisers, originally used in schizophrenia. This medica tion is used to subdue agitation in some RACF residents. Atypical antipsychotics block the receptors of dopamine and serotonin to remove the negative symptoms of apathy, jumbled thoughts, concentration difficulties and difficulties in interacting (Chioca e t al., 2013) . Atypical antipsychotic medications include but are not limited to risperidone, olanzapine and q uietipine. Atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated an effect in reducing aggressive behaviour over a period of 12 weeks however, serious adverse effects overshadow evidence for efficacy (Livingston et al., 2014; Nguyen & Paton, 2008) . Ballard and Corbett's (2010) systematic review investigated 18 placebo -controlled trials for efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics use in people with BPSD. T he review found a significant benefit in aggression over 12 weeks, however the study reported a three fold increase in cerebrovascular events, a 1.5 to 1.7 fold increase in the risk of Parkinson's, increased sedation and a 1.6 to 1.7 increased risk of mort ality. Jeste and Maglione (2013) attempted to compare the long -term safety and effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in 332 older adults with agitation. A participant withdrawal rate of 50% after six months revealed reasons for withdrawal to be adverse side effects (51.6%) and lack of effect (26%). A further 42 breakdown of these results revealed that 23% of the withdrawals had experienced a severe adverse event resulting in hospitalisation or death. The authors concluded, \"Anti - psychotic medications are neither safe or effective\" (Jestes & Maglione, 2013, p.4). Coon et al 's (2014) systematic review of data spanning 27 years investigated initiatives to reduce inappropriate antipsychotic prescribing in RA CFs. They reported that educational programs, in -services, medication reviews and multicomponent interventions provided some short -term reduction in antipsychotic prescribing however little difference in the long -term prescribing. They concluded that for a ntipsychotic prescribing to be reduced, long -term change of culture, environment and availability of non-drug alternatives were required in the RACF setting. Abermain et al. (2014) investigated general practitioner [GP] and nurse barriers to reducing antip sychotic use in RACFs with three main barriers being identified. Firstly, GPs were concerned that ceasing atypical antipsychotic medications would negatively impact a resident's quality of life. In contrast, two systematic reviews (Akhondzadeh et al., 2003 ; Banerjee, 2009) investigating atypical antipsychotics report a perceived lowered quality of life in older adults when taking antipsychotics. Further adverse effects related to the use of antipsychotics including increased falls, impaired communication an d confusion appear to conflict with the GP opinion that the resident's quality of life would deteriorate if the medication were ceased. The second reason for atypical antipsychotic continuation was the fear of a reoccurrence of the initial behaviour and th e third reason was that the behaviour would be a hindrance to others and risk of harm to the resident (Azermai et al., 2014) . It has also been suggested that atypical antipsychotics reduce nurse workload by lessening the need for surveillance and repetitiv e agitation management (Jeste & Maglione, 2013). In the absence of evidence -based alternatives, it appears that atypical antipsychotics will continue to be prescribed regardless of side effects. Interestingly, Abermain et al., (2014) 43 reported that GPs perc eive non -pharmacological agitation management to be ineffective, a belief that was in opposition to the nurses who believed these complementary therapy methods to be effective managements. 2.4.3.2 Alternate Pharmacology There is limited pharmacological evidence fo r the effectiveness of alternative medications compared to current practice in the management of agitation. Alternate pharmacology investigated for agitation management for older adults in RACFs are cholinesterase inhibitors, memantime, antidepressants and anticonvulsant medications. There is some limited but promising evidence that cholinesterase may have some benefits in reducing anxiety or apathy. Memantime showed benefits over three to six months in irritability, lability, agitation -aggression and agita tion or psychosis (Ballard et al., 2009; Ballard , et al., 2009 b). However, Livingstone et al's (2014) review reported memantime as ineffective on agitated behaviour. Ballard and Corbett 's (2010) review of anticonvulsant medications for dementia revealed t wo small cross over RCTs and several case studies. The results reported that the use of Carbamazepine demonstrate d a significant improvement in overall behaviours in one of two trials. The case studies for sodium valproate found low dosages to be ineffecti ve while high doses were unable to be tolerated by participants. The antidepressant citalopram demonstrated a significant effect in reducing agitation and aggression in older adults with severe Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ballard & Corbett, 2010) . Pollack e t al's (2007) study reported citalopram to be comparable in effect to risperidone in the management of agitation symptoms in moderate to severe dementia. A further study demonstrated citalopram's effect in reducing irritability without sedation. Another an tidepressant, Mirtazapine has also demonstrated reductions in agitation similar to that of citalopram. However, cardiac side effect s and reduced 44 cognition in pa rticipants excludes Mirtazapine use in the older adult population (Livingston et al., 2014) . Chemical and physical restraints are crude expedients in the absence of better management methods. Ideally an intervention, which will either eliminate the cause or if possible, target symptoms in a way that maintains the dignity and welfare of the older pers on, is a more desirable approach. Some promote complementary therapies as an alternative agitation management strategy (Watson, Chang & Johnson, 2011; Turner, 2005). 2.4.4 Complementary therapies Complementary therapies are based on traditional philosophies that aim to restore resident health while not interfering or interacting with concurrent healthcare regimes (Lindquist & Snyder, 2013; Kayne, 2009) . Complementary therapies commonly used for agitation management in RACFs include aromatherapy, exercise, massage , heat packs and music therapy. A therapy's effectiveness is empirically determined by observing the cause and effect relationship between healing technique and the illness. When used as agitation management, complementary therapies can provide relaxation, distraction and social interaction for the resident (Kayne, 2009) . Currently there is a lack of scientific evidence to support the efficacy of complementary therapies and little is known about the mechanism of action in reducing agitation in older people . This section discusses complementary therapies in concept, safety, observed effect and scientific evidence. The concept of holistic health is fundamental to complementary therapies , it incorporates the health management of a person's physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing concurrently. Complementary therapies are categorised under four domains of practice being biological, manipulation and body -based practices, mind -body therapies and energy -based therapies (WHO, 2002) . Therapies known for their rela xing, low side effects are often enjoyable and applications are popular in the care management 45 of frail persons owing to their gentle nature (Halcon, 2013; WHO, 2002) . When considering the controversy surrounding the efficacy and safety of restraints, it i s understandable why complementary therapy management is promoted as a first -line management for agitation or used concurrently with medications (Azermai et al., 2014; NSW DoH, 2014) . Distraction is an accepted manage ment method for biological pain and environmental boredom and may provide necessary stimuli without over stimulating. Relaxation can calm psychological distress and anxiety in an older person regardless of lucidity. Social interaction may provide the necessary attention certain older people ma y require to feel heard and acknowledged. Needs are met in a variety of ways through the application of complementary therapies leaving the older person in a more approachable state to identify and possibly communicate further unmet needs either verbally o r non -verbally (Cohen -Mansfield, 2000). Raetz 's (2013) systematic review of the evidence for a non -pharmacological approach to BPSD included complementary therapies of aromatherapy, exercise, massage and music therapy. Based on the evidence reviewed, aroma therapy and massage received the highest level ( level A) recommendation indicating evidence was patient orientated, of good quality and reported a reducing effect on agitation. Music therapy and exercise received a B level recommendation indicating that ev idence for effect was inconsistent or limited. A review by Dewing (2010) also supports evidence of reduction in agitation with the use of aromatherapy and massage only. Essential oils may prove an effective management for older person agitation with low side effects and limited medication interactions that warrants further investigation. 46 2.5 Summary This chapter has discussed the ageing population focusing on the growing number of older people that are presenting to RACFs with increased levels of frailty and complexity of care needs. The high prevalence of agitated behaviours among this age group living in RACFs has been identified as a major area of concern for the care of residents. The nurse challenges to agitation management, of time poor work schedules, f rustration at the inability of staff to resolve behaviour and competing demands in the RACF environment were discussed. Agitation management has also been reported as costly to the facility in staff training or absences due to workplace stress. The term a gitation has been defined in this chapter as an umbrella term with behaviour categories of physical aggressive behaviour, physical non aggressive behaviour and verbal agitation. Each agitation category has been presented with corresponding behaviours liste d. Causes of older person agitation have been explored under the biological, unmet need and environmental model's. The current six -step process that guides nurse assessment of agitation in RACFs has been reviewed. A review of current RACF nurse initiated interventions to manage agitation reported that distraction and restraint were identified as being short -term, ineffective or having detrimental side effects. A need for more available, safe and effective options for the management of agitation in resident s in RACFs has been established. Finally, this chapter has presented preliminary evidence for the use of complementary therapy of essential oils as a potential solution for agitation management that is further explored in Chapter 3. 47 Chapter 3 Essential Oil Literature Review 3.1 Overview This chapter consists of three major sections. The first section examines the origin of essential oils and their therapeutic benefits. This section also examines the constituents of essential oils, modes of actions to determ ine suitable oils with anti -agitation properties and methods of administration . The second section examines the properties and benefits of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils for reduction o f agitation, investigating the potential effects on the nervous system and safety in administration. The final section appraises seven RCTs of Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oils for effect on agitation in residents in RACFs. Trials are examined for con trasting and consistent themes and methodological quality. 3.2 Esse ntial oils for health and wellbeing Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils derived from plant materials to manage health conditions; the oils are administered by ingestion, inhalation or absorption through the skin (Halcon, 2013; Mills & Bone, 2013) . Essential oils are formed in plants during photosynthesis by chloroplast cells. Chloroplast cells absorb energy from the sun and convert it into sugar bonds. These bonds form molecules to provide the plant with glucose necessary for growth, fatty acids for energy, proteins for plant repair as well as the hydrocarbons of terpenes and related terpenoids that are essential oils (Halcon, 2013) . These essential oils are contained in the glands, sacs and veins of the plants that are located in the leaves, flower, fruit and woody stem. The essential oils strong aromatic fragrance is considered to protect the plant from parasites and herbivores while attracting bees for pollination and plant survival (Mills & Bone, 2013) . There is evidence of use of essential oils fo r medicinal purposes in the ancient Persian, Egyptian, Roman and Greek civilisations, and in Europe in the 10th century. Details of 48 distillation, application and oil selection for specific health conditions spans centuries through documentation or cultural practice . A Persian manuscript dated at 450BC describes balsamic aromatic substances as popular in religious ceremonies and for medical purposes. In addition, over 200 references are made to the anointing and the healing of the sick with essential oils in the Bible (Soni, Upadhyay, & Upadhyay, 2013) . Hildegard of Bingen distilled and documented the medicinal purposes of Lavender in the 12th century and her writings incorporated many herbal and oil remedies that became popular in the following centuries (Bi ngen and Hozeski, 1997). The rise of the pharmaceutical industry in the 13th century encouraged distillation of many oils that were used to combat illness (Nussbaum, 2014) , including the black death of the 14th century and was a major influence in the rise of alchemy in the 16th century (Weiyang, Vermaak, & Viljoen, 2013) . Essential oils were again used for medicinal purposes in a French hospital during World War I when a chemist Rene -Maurice Gattefosse applied Lavender oil to burn wounds of soldiers for i ts antibacterial and wound healing properties (Dunning, 2005) . Interest in the healing properties of essential oils continues today and although there is sparse scientific evidence of effect, they remain popular due to their traditional benefit, low side effects and pleasant aroma. Essential oils are administered by dermal absorption, ingestion and inhalation. Routes of administration are explored in the following section . 3.2.1 Dermal absorption Essential oils can be applied topically to the skin by massage, c ompress or Balm , with the oil penetrating the skin through the pores and hair follicles. As the skin is permeable to fat-soluble molecules, the oils travel the 0.5 to 4.00 mm thickness of the skin to reach the blood capillaries and enter the blood stream. Cal (2006) investigated skin penetration of essential oil terpenes linalool, linalyl Linalyl acetate and C itronellol, are major constituents of Lavender 49 and Lemon Balm essential oil s. That study found no penetration of linalyl acetate or linalool, with Citronellol the only terpene to permeate the skin. These results contrast with Jager, Biuchbauer, Jirovetz and Fritzer's (1992) case study of one person that demonstrated linalool and linalyl acetate to be detected in the plasma 19 minutes after massage to the skin. 3.2.2 Inhalation Absorption of essential oils by inhalation, or breathing in are probably absorbed through the upper and lower respiratory system (Halcon, 2013) . Not all constitu ents are taken into the lungs; some will enter the brain through receptor cells of the upper respiratory system. Absorption by the respiratory system occurs when oil and oxygen are inhaled, the nose warms the air and the volatile and aromatic particles in the oil dissolve in the mucus that covers the olfactory epithelium at the top of the nasal cavity. Receptor cells link the roof of the nas al cavity to the olfactory bulb from where the cilia transmit signals to the central nervous system [CNS] (Halcon, 201 3). Once the cilia detect the aromatic molecules , a message is sent by the olfactory receptors to the olfactory bulb which transmits the information to the limbic system in the brain. The limbic system's amygdala governs the emotional response while the h ippocampus is involved in retrieval of memories surrounding the scent. The limbic system interacts with the cerebral cortex to control heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, stress and hormone levels (Fontaine, 2014; Halcon, 2013; Kayne, 2009) . It links ar oma to sensations of pain or pleasure, emotions and memories. This explains how an aroma can recall memories and feelings of long ago (Soudry, Lemogne, Malinvaud, Consoli, & Bonsfils, 2011) . Anosmia, loss of scent, is believed to impair the benefits of es sential oils in an individual, however a recent study by Chioca (2013) found that inhalation of Lavender essential oils 50 can induce anxiolytic effects through the CNS or stimulate the olfactory system in mice regardless of the absence of scent. 3.2.2.1 Patch inhal ation Scent has also been detected by the unconscious mind as identified in Lillehei, Halcon, Savik and Reis 's (2015) RCT that investigated the effects of inhaled Lavender from a patch on sleep quality of 79 college students who reported sleep difficulties . Participants were randomised to a placebo group of sleep hygiene only and a treatment group of sleep hygiene and Lavender inhalation patch. The study was conducted over five nights with the students wearing the inhalation patch on their chest. Sleep qual ity was recorded using a fit bit tracker on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the United States National Institute of Health (NIH) Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Participants when receiving Lavender and sleep hygiene showed improved sleep quality at post intervention and at two -week post intervention. However, scientific evidence requires essential oils to be tested for efficacy and safety with mechanism of effect explained in full before the practice can be e vidence based. Further investigation is required into the selection of the most appropriate essential oils to maximise the clinical benefit of essential oils and produce quality evidenced research outcomes (Perry & Howes, 2011) . 3.2.3 Therapeutic benefits of ess ential oils Essential oils are comprised of chemical constituents that can be categorised into Individual constituent groups presented in ta ble 2 claim therapeutic benefits, aroma and cautions. Essential oil that is high in a specified constituent is considered to produce the effects attributed to the constituent. Table 2 presents a summary of essential oil constituents including therapeutic b enefit and safety. 51 The high content of aldehydes, terpenes and esthers constituents that claim to produce anti -agitation like effects that are contained in Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oil warrants further investigation. A summary of Lavender and Lemo n Balm composition and scientific evidence is reported in the following section. 52 Constituent Therapeutic Benefit Plants rich in constituent Caution tonic.

These constituents claim therapeutic benefits of anxiolytic or sedative effect, however both can cause skin irritation or sensitivity when oils are in direct contact with the skin (Mills & Bone, 2013; Tisserand & Young, 2014) . Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oils have been use for centuries in Europe for their calming effect to relieve feelings of distress, anxiety or insomnia (Mills & Bone, 2013) . This section examines t he chemical and therapeutic properties of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils, with reference to their potential use to reduce agitation for older people. 3.3.1 Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia) Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia) is a perennial plant that grow s 23cm to 90cm tall and is native to France. Lavender's genus name lavare means 'to wash' as this plant was a favourite ingredient in herbal baths of both Greeks and Romans in 200BC. Lavender has a long history of medicinal use , possess ing potent anxiolyti c, sedative and calming properties (Cavanagh & Wilkinson, 2002) . The essential oil is contained in the flowers that yield a high volume of oil (Duda et al., 2015) . Lavender has four chemo types, being plants of the same botanical characteristics with dist inctly different chemical compositions (Koulivand et al., that account for approximately 90% of essential oil. Other constituents include Lavandula, oils have antispasmodic, carminative, analgesic, sedative properties. They also used traditionally as hypotensive, antiseptic, antimicrobial, antifungal, diuretic and general 54 tonics. Externally, it can be used for wounds and superficial burns or oral hygiene (Duda et al., 2015; Koulivand et al., 2013) . In China, Lavender is known as \" cure -all\" medicinal oil called White Flower Oil. 1.4.5.1 Mechanism of action on the nervous system The high content of l inalool or linalyl acetate is believed to be responsible for the observed anti -agitation effect (Linck et al., 2010; Takahashi et al., 2014; Tsang & Ho, 2010; Woronuk et al., 2011) however the mechanism of action is unclear. Linalool or linyl acetate's act ion on the GABA processes, acetylcholine, and serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitters is still contentious (Takahashi al., 2014; Woronuk et al., 2011) . GABAa Neurotransmitter The constituents of linalool or Lavender may influen ce neurotransmitter GABA (Chioca et al., 2013) increasing the available GABAa in the brain to produce an anxiolytic effect similar to that of benzodiazepine (Koulivand et al., 2013) . Hritcu, Cioanca and Hancianu (2012) investigated the effect of inhaled La vender oil on anxiety -like and inhibited depression in Wisteria rats. The rats inhaled Lavender for 60 minutes daily for seven consecutive days before being subjected to behavioural testing designed to increase anxiety. The rats exposed to Lavender aroma p articipated in the behavioural testing for a longer period than the control rats. Bradley, Starkey, Brown and Lea (2007) compared effects of inhaled Lavender to diazepam, a GABA agonist, in Mongolian gerbils. The gerbils were exposed to Lavender continuous ly for 14 days or administered diazepam before being subjected to behavioural testing. The results found Lavender inhalation comparable in effect to diazepam in Mongolian rats. This i ndicating that Lavender was just as effective in producing an anxiolytic state as a benzodiazepine medication in the rats. 55 Dopamine or Serotonin Chicoa et al. (2013) investigated whether the effect of the Lavender constituent of linalooll influenced an action on the GABAa similar to benzodiazepines or influenced dopamine or serotonin to create a similar effect to atypical antipsychotics in mice. Serotonergic mediation was studied by pretreating the mice with a serotonin 5 -HT1A receptor antagonist before behavioural testing. Mice were exposed to either Lavender inhalation or n eutral odor anxiolytic properties. This study attributed the effect of Lavender to a result from the constituent effect on serotonergic neurotransmission, which played a significant role in the anxiolytic effect and the participation of GABAa unlikely. Chi coa et al. (2013) reported that inhaled Lavender reduced serotonin syndrome when induced by fluoxetine plus 5 -HTP indicative of effect along serotonin pathways. Further , mice were pretreated with a at a dose blocking anxiolytic ef fect of diazepam; this did not interfere with Lavenders anxiolytic effect on the mice. This study however, does not exclude a synergistic effect that Lavender may have on both serotonin and GABA pathways, once the GABAa receptor antagonist block is removed . Cholinergic System Wang, Hu and Cheng (2011) postulate d that Lavender's anti -agitation effect may originate from influences in the cholinergic system to increase acetylcholine levels in the brain. Increases of acetylcholine in the brain have a similar effect to the parasympathetic nervous system to reduce anxiety and hyperactivity (Koulivand et al., 2013) . The study investigating the mechanism of Lavender action in neuronal tissue indicated a weak cholinergic inhibition and the antioxidant effect that c ould contribute to neuroprotective factors (Wang et al., 2011) . 56 3.3.2 Lemon Balm (Melissa Officinalis) Lemon Balm (Melissa Officinalis) is a perennial plant that grows to 70 -150cm tall and is native to Europe, North America, and Central Asia. The Genius name M elissa meant \"bee\" in Greek for the plants ability to attract bees and was first recorded in the Theophrastus's Historia Plantarum in 300BC . The essential oil, which is conta ined in the leaves of the plant are terpenic aldehydes (32 -42%) that comprise the constituents of citral, geranial and neral. constituents 2015) . Lemon Balm can be ingested as a tea or used externally as an essential oil with the leav es used medicinally for their Yankova, 2005) . The essential oil is often used for its sedative effect on neurological disorders or pain (Duda et al., 2015) . The her b was valued in the eleventh century for treating depression and melancholy according to an old Arabian proverb \" Balm makes the heart joyful and merry\" (Fernie, 2013, p.39). 3.3.2.1 Effect on the nervous system Lemon Balm s action may influence the neurotransmitte rs gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) complex in the central nervous system (Chioca et al., 2013) . An affinity for neurotransmitter GABAt , results in more available GABAa to the brain which produces an anxiolytic, sedative and muscle relaxant effect similar to that of benzodiazepine medication (Awad, Muhammad, Durst, Trudeau, & Abuhamdah et al., (2008) conducted an electrophysiological analysis using primary cultures of rat cortical neurons and reported that while Lemon Balm does exert a depressant effect on neural activity, this is not a reflection of its interaction with GABAa complex. In contrast Awad, Muhammad, Durst, Trudeau and Arnason's (2009) study demonstrated the methanol extract of Lemon Balm to be a potent in -vitro inhibitor of rat brain GABA transaminase (GABAt), thereby increasing GABA in the brains. 57 A further trial by Ibarra, Feuillere, Rol ler, Lesburgere and Beracochea (2010) was conducted to determine the pathway of Lemon Balm's anxiolytic effect on mice in the the gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and cholinergic systems. Cyracos, a Lemon Balm tincture was administered to mice and investigated for effect in an anxiety -like reactivity. Lemon Balm significantly reduced the anxiety in the mice during elevated maze testing. I n contrast to Abuhamdah et al's (2008) findings Ibarra et al. (2010) concluded that anxiolytic effect was most likely attributed to GABAa processes rather than the gluatamate or cholinergic system. Cases et al's (2011) pilot study of 20 pe ople investigated the effect of Lemon Balm on mild to moderate anxiety disorder and insomnia . In this study 600mg of Cyracos Lemon Balm tincture was ingested by participants daily for 15 days, reducing agitation by 35 % (1.30 \u00b1 0.16 compared to 0.25 \u00b1 0.10,p < 0.01) and lowering insomnia by 42% (p < 0.01). Ninety -five percent of subjects (19/20) responded to the treatment, of which 70% (14/20) achieved a full remission for anxiety , 85% (17/20) for insomnia and 70% (14/2 0) for both. The results suggest that Lemon Balm may be effective in reducing agitation via effect neurotransmitter gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA). 3.3.3 Safety of Lavender and Lemon Balm The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA] regulates safety an d ingredient quality of complementary medicine with a two -tiered system of both listed and registered compleme ntary medicines. Essential oils such as Lavender and Lemon Balm can be purchased over the counter and are listed with the TGA and tested for safet y and purity of oil. However , the oils are not tested for effectiveness in managing specific health complaints (TGA, 2015) . Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia) and Lemon Balm (Melissa Officinalis) hold assessment reports with the European Medicines Agency (E MA), the European union for the evaluation of medicinal products. The EMA assessments provide a comprehensive evaluation providing a description of the herb, a summary of non -58 clinical and clinical data along with evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety (EMA , 2011) . The EMA (2011) safety evaluation for Lavender essential oil concluded \" no concern regarding human toxicity' however 'contact dermatiti s may be possible in rare cases\" . In addition the EMA (2012) safety evaluation reported no adverse effects wi th the use of Lemon Balm to have been reported in the literature or World Heath Organisation database of clinical trials. Burn's et al's (2011) study of Lemon Balm essential oil reported adverse events in two participants when a 10% essential oil consiste ncy was massaged twice daily. Further research is required to investig ate safe doses of essential oil with some research considering a much lower potency of massage oil of 2.5% essential oil to be the optimal dosage for older people (Dunning, 2008). Most a dverse side effects or medication interactions reported for essential oils result from use of high dosage essential oil above recommended levels or oil ingestion (Burns et al., 2011; EMA, 2012) . The essential oils show potential to effectively manage agita tion in older people however to be readily available to residents in RACFs the oils must be able to be administered by the nurse. 3.3.4 Nurse administered aromatherapy in RACFs Aromatherapy in nursing practice is supported by the Complementary Therapies in Nurs ing and Midwifery Practice policy, which was re -endorsed at the 2009 ANF annual conference (ANF, 2011) . Aromatherapy is well tolerated by the older people with minimal side effects or interactions with concurrent medications, therapies are relaxing and oft en enjoyed by older people (Fontaine, 2014; Halcon, 2013) . Successful implementation of essential oils for agitation management into RACFs requires the support of not only the older adult with agitation but also the nurse administering the essential oil. Although nurse initiated aromatherapy is endorsed by the Australian Nursing Federation , it is unfamiliar to many nurses in RACFs. Aromatherapy is not generally 59 included in undergraduate nursing courses , therefore nurses are responsible for acquiring their o wn knowledge of aromatherapy through accredited courses that build upon nursing practice (ANF, 2011) . Many nurses have no knowledge about aromatherapy and when coupled with competing demands, may lead nurses to continue to rely on medications or restraints in an attempt to complete their workplace demands (King, 2012) . This being said, nurse initiated aromatherapy management is feasible as nurses are primary carers to older people in RACFs, they are knowledgeable of the resident's health care requirements, and therefore able to quickly administer aromatherapy, monitor and assess physical and behavioural changes. This therapeutic relationship between nurse and resident may be extremely important in the administration of aromatherapy to elicit a positive heal ing response in agitation management in RACFs (Fontaine, 2014) . 3.4 Lavender and Lemon Balm Research This section reports the findings of a literature search of RCTs investigating Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oils to manage agitation for residents in RACF s. A search of electronic databases was conducted in July 2014 and again conducted in July 2016, alerts in each database set up to inform the researcher of newly published relevant literature that was accepted until August 2016. A computerised search using key terms of the databases Academic Search Complete (1978 -current), CINAHL (1937 - current), Cochrane library (1800 - current), EMBASE (1947 - current), Joanna Briggs database (1998 -current) MEDLINE (1826 - current), Mednar (1990 -current), OVID (1946 - current), ProQuest Social Science Journals (1971 - current), PsycINFO (1987 - current), SCOPUS (1966 - current) was conducted. A copy of the search strategy is presented in Appendix A. The search returned 107 potential studies of which 36 duplicates were remov ed from the Endnote file. A review of the 71 studies remaining found the title to be unrelated in 60 a further 37. The abstracts of the remaining 34 articles showed 25 more studies to be unrelated due to unrelated setting, population, administration methods o utside a nurse's scope of practice or used herbal extracts. The full text of the remaining nine potential studies justified the removal of a further two studies. The seven studies (Ballard, O'Brien, Reichelt, & Perry, 2002; Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2 013; Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2013; Sakamoto et al., 2012) remaining are discussed in this literature review. Lavender was investigated in five studies (Fu et al., 2013; Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2 013; Sakamoto et al., 2012) with Lemon Balm investigated in two studies (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011) of the studies reviewed. The seven RCTs identified in this literature review are desc ribed further in this chapter. A summary of the studies can be found in Appendix B. All seven studies included in this review are RCTs with a variety of comparisons. Study designs were complex with only one RCT (Fujii et al., 2008) using a single experimental group that was directly compared to a control group of usual care. Two RCTs (Ballard et al., 2002; Sakamoto et al., 2012) used a single experiment group that was compared to a placebo treatment. Another two RCTs (Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013) investigated two treatment groups that were compared with each other and to a third group of placebo treatment. The final two RCTs (Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2013) adopted a crossover design that investigated the effect , both the treatment and placebo in each of the participants. The time frames for t he RCTs differed in the studies ranging from 360 days (Sakamoto et al., 2012) , 12 weeks (Burns et al., 2011) , eight weeks (Lin et al., 2007) , six weeks (Fu et al., 2013) , four weeks for two studies (Ballard et al., 2002; Fujii et al., 2008) to two weeks (O'Conner et al., 2013) . A total of 562 participants with an age range of 60 -93 years were represented in the RCTs reviewed. Four trials (Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2013; Sakamoto 61 et al., 2012) included participants of 65 years and older with the remaining three studies (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013) including participants 60 years of age or older. All Seven RCTs (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013; Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2013; Sakamoto et al., 2012) reported information on participant gender and median age. Based on this information the combined median age of the participants were 80.8 years and the sample comprised of 56.5 % female population. Six trials (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013; Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2013) had reported a greater number of females in their sample. In contrast Sakamoto et al. (2012) investigated a predominantly male s ample with 118 men and only 27 women initially recruited to the study. All of the RCTs outlined above, were conducted in long -term care facilities, comparable to Australian RACFs. Participants were residents of special care or personal units within 23 RAC Fs. Six RCTs (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2013; Sakamoto et al., 2012) were conducted in multicentre trials in Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom. Two studies (Fu et al., 2013; O'Conner et al., 2013) recruited participants from eight specialist psychogeriatric and three private nursing homes, and long -term care facilities in Australia. Another two studies (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011) used three clinical centres and two nurs ing homes in the UK. Further one study employed three nursing homes in Northern Japan (Sakamoto et al., 2012) . Fujii et al. (2008) was the only study to conduct the entire trial in a single site setting that was located in Japan. Further Lin et al., (2007) study recruited participants living in aged care facilities in Hong Kong, however, did not specify how many facilities. This review included RCTs from both Western (n=4) and Eastern (n=3) global communities. It is anticipated that these results will have resonance with Australia's growing multicultural population residing in RACFs 62 3.4.1 Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia) studies Scientific evidence for Lavender effect on agitation in older adults living in RACFs was also explored for similar and conflicting evid ence. Five RCTs (Fu et al. 2013; Fujii et al. 2008; Lin et al. 2007; O'Conner et al. 2013; Sakamoto et al. 2012) identified in the literature search investigated the effectiveness of Lavender essential oil for reducing agitation in older adults. Studies us ed massage or inhalation to apply the Lavender oil to older adults who were assessed for changes in frequency and or severity of agitated behaviours. Outcomes in the studies were conflicting, the four studies (Fujii et al., 2008; Fu et al., 2013; Lin et al ., 2007; Sakamoto et al., 2012) that used inhalation and scent application of Lavender demonstrating clinically significant reduction in agitation. Two RCTs, administered the essential oil by massage ( Fu et al., 2014; O'Conner et al., 2011) Fu et al's (201 3) study used water spritz for inhalation and massage to administer essential oils . No significant decrease in agitation between treatment and placebo group was reported in two studies (Fu et al., 2013; O'Conner et al., 2011) . Summaries of the five Lavende r studies are reported separately in this section. Lin et al 's (2007) singl e-blinded randomised controlled crossover trial of humidified Lavender essential oil reported a clinically significant reduction in the agitation of 70 older adults with moderate t o severe d ementia. All participants had a certified dementia diagnosis as specified by the inclusion criteria with measurement at Baseline on the Chinese CMAI and determined clinically significant agitation. In addition , Lin et al. (2007) used Cohen's (198 8) statistical table to project a required sample size of 70 participants to achieve a power of 0.8 with alpha at 0.05. Participants were then randomised to a treatment group b y block randomisation, however further details of the randomisation process are not provided. The inte rventions compared in Lin et al 's (2007) study included a Lavender essential oil treatment group and an odourless sunflower placebo group. Participants in this trial 63 received both treatment and placebo for effect on agitation. The tr eatment was two drops of 100% Lavender oil on each of two cotton swabs. Two humidifiers were placed either side of the resident's head while they slept; one cotton swab was placed in each humidifier. The placebo treatment consisted of the essential oil tre atment replaced with two drops of odourless sunflower oil administered in the same manner. Participant s received one treatment for three weeks followed by a two -week washout period and then the alternate treatment for a following three weeks. Agitation was monitored on the Chinese CMAI and NPI during the study. A clinically significant reduction in agitation was reported on the Chinese CMAI scores of 24.68 to 17.77 (t=10.79, Df69, p<0.001) and the Chinese NPI scores of 63. 17 to 58.77 (t=14.59, Df69, p<0.00 1). Participants were asleep during the intervention and successfully blinded to treatment allocation, however, Lin et al. (2007) claimed difficulty in the ability to blind nurse's assessing behaviours to scent when they were also administering participant interventions. Lin et al. (2007) was the only trial to report no participants withdrew, however a limitation was identified in the crossover trial. A second baseline data collection was not attended before the second treatment was administered and resear chers acknowledged they considered the participants conditions to remain stable over the eight weeks trial duration . Further, assessors were not blinded to allocation group, potentially biasing reporting of outcomes. Lastly, medications were reported to ha ve been monitored but not re ported in this study. Lin et al's (2007) outcomes of reducing agitation with inhaled Lavender was again demonstrated th e following year in Fujii et al's (2008) study. Fujii et al. (2008) completed a double -blind, randomised cont rolled trial of Lavender inhalation and reported a significant reduction in agitation in 28 participants with mild to moderate dementia living in one long -term facility in Japan. A dementia diagnosis was made according to DSM -IV criteria however it is uncl ear whether staff, researcher or 64 physician made the diagnosis. Significant agitation was determined at baseline using the NPI, however, frequency or severity of minimal agitated behaviour for trials inclusion was not reported. A power calculation was compl eted to determine the number of participants required for generalisability of results for this study before recruitment. However, the study failed to meet the required sample size. Participants were randomised into two groups of Lavender oil and usual care . However, the randomisation process that was undertaken in this stu dy is not reported. Fujii et al's (2008) intervention included two drops of 100% Lavender oil that were applied directly to the participant's collar three times daily after meals for a per iod of four weeks. The treatment group was then compared to a control group of usual care for changes in agitation. Agitation levels were monitored in both groups by nurses and reported on the NPI. Participant and staff blinding to allocation groups are un clear in the study, however, staff reported behaviours to an assessor trained in the NPI measurement tool and blinded to participant allocation. A clinically significant improvement was demonstrated in agitation on the NPI (from 31 +/- 10 to 18 +/ - 12, P < 0.01;) when compared to the control group (from 32 +/ - 11 to 27 +/- 12). Clinically significant improvement is also demonstrated in the NPI subcategories of aberrant motor activity, agitation/aggression, hallucinations and irritability/lability, when com pared to the control (Fujii et al., 2008). Fujii et al's (2008) outcomes support the Li n et al. (2007) study, however methodological flaws and lack of reporting detract from the overall results in this study. Limitations in Fujii et al. (2008) randomisatio n processes and lack of adequate blinding may have introduced bias into the study and a small sample size compromises the generalisability of results obtained . Further the medication monitoring process remains unclear and participant withdrawal is not repo rted. Sakamoto et al's (2012), larger stu dy of inhaled 65 Lavender supports Fujii et al's (2008) findings and overcomes many of the methodological flaws presented. Sakamoto et al's (2012) randomised, l of Lavender AromasealTM patch demo nstrated a clinically significant effect in reducing agitation of 145 participants with and without dementia. Sakamoto et al. (2012) did not report inclusion criteria for agitation, as participant agitation was a secondary measure to a primary measure of f alls risk and investigated as a contributing factor to older adult falls. One hundred and forty -five older people with agitation from three aged care facilities in Japan were randomised into two groups to receive Lavender or placebo treatment patches. This study used randomised number generators or tables to allocate participants and used blocking to randomise participants by the facility. The person conducting the randomisation was independent of the study. Sakamoto et al.'s, (2012) intervention involved AromasealTM Lavender scented 1x2cm aroma patches attached to the inside collar area of participant's clothing worn for a 24 - hour period and replaced by the nurse daily for 360 days. The patch was trialled against a placebo group of AromasealTM unscented pa tches. Sakomoto et al. (2012) reported details of comparable baseline data in both the placebo and treatment group. Agitation significantly decreased on the 24.3 +/ - 5.4 to 22.9 +/ - 2.3 CMAI (P=. 04) in the Lavender group but not in the placebo group 24. 5 +/ - 6.7 to 24.0 +/ - 3.7 (P=. 82). In addition , the Barthel index ( Mahoney & Barthel, 1965 ) also found fewer falls in the Lavender group. Participants were not blinded to group allocation however dementia conditions may have obscured participant s memory o f patch. Care staff administered treatments and employed the services of a research assistant to assess behaviours independently. Care staff and the research assistant were blinded to group allocation and patch scent was mild enough that only the participa nt could detect the scent in the environment. 66 A power calculation was performed to determine the number of participants required for generalisability of results for this st udy before recruitment, however the study failed to meet this projected sample size at the trial's conclusion, in part because of a 31% participant withdrawal rate that reduced the number of participants completing the trial (Sakamoto et al. 2012). The most common reasons for withdrawal included hospitalisatio n, transfer to another facili ty or death. A review of medication changes over the 12 -month trial period was comparable to each group at baseline and the trials completion. The limitations of the study include the omission of the concentration of Lavender Angustifolia oil used by the AromasealTM patch, that is not reported by the authors or recorded on the packaging of the commercial patch used in this study. Finally, the percentage of participants with dementia from the three facilities was not reported. Instead, the mean MMSE scores from the treatment 15.3 +/ - 8.4 and placebo 14.6 +/ - 8.1 group indicate cognitive decline was high among participants. Despite methodological limitations, all Lavender inhalation studies gave positive outcomes for reduction of agitation in older people . Fu et al 's (2009) study investigated Lavender inhalation as a water spray against essential oil massage to determine greater effect in the mode of Lavender essential oil application. Fu's (2013) single blind randomised controlled trial of combination arom atherapy and massage, aromatherapy only or placebo of 61 older people with dementia, reported that despite a downward trend in behaviour , there was no clinically significant effect on agitation. Dementia was defined by cognitive functional impairment obser ved in people with dementia, MMSE score below 24 out of 30, in addition to feature of Alzheimer's disease reported on the DMSV -TR. Fu et al 's (201 3) study determined participant s clinically significant agitation for inclusions by history of chemical and or physical restraint. 67 This trial was conducted in three RACFs in Australia and used the siz e of effect from Ballard et al's (2002) trial in a G*Power prior calculation to give a sample size of 45, 15 participants in each of the three groups at a power of 0 .95 with an alpha of 0.5. Fu (2009) used a random number tables to allocate participants, used block allocation to randomise participants by the facility to one of three groups and reported the person conducting the randomisation was independent of the stu dy. Aromatherapy interventions were a 3% Lavend er essential oil water solution which was sprayed as a mist at the participant's chest area. The aromatherapy and hand massage treatment combined a five -minute hand massage with no essential oil with the aroma therapy intervention. The Placebo used the water solution spray without the essential oil. Treatments consisted of three sprays of mist at chest area twice daily for six weeks. Agitation levels were monitored in each group on the CMAI for the study duratio n. No significant change in agitation was fo und between the groups, in fact increases in agitation were reported in the combination aromatherapy with the hand massage group. Fu (2009) acknowledged that participants were not blinded to treatment allocation . However, those administering interventions and assessors of behaviour were blinded to the allocation group. Fu (2009) employed an independent research assistant to administer interventions to the participants. This overcame assessor and allocation bias while ensuring compliance to treatment doses. The research assistant was blinding to intervention with the use of a nose clip and masking oil of rosemary essential oil smeared above the top lip. Fu et al. (2009) reported that 48% of participants in the stu dy had severe dementia postulating it is possible that massage may have been too invasive or oils too stimulating for this population. Withdrawals also led to a lower than anticipated sample size 68 compromising generalisability of results. The most common re asons for withdrawal in this study included participant refusal to participate or death. A final study investigated Lavender massage for effect on reduction of agitation in older people with agitation l iving in RACFs. O'Conner et al's (2013) single blind randomised controlled trial of Lavender massage in 77 participants with moderate to severe dementia reported no clinical significant change in agitation. Dementia was determined by a rating on the CDR scale of at least mild dementia by RACF staff. O'Conner et al. (2013) defined agitation for inclusion by a single agitated behaviour specific to a resident that occurred several times during the day and required staff intervention. An assessor monitored the specific agitated behaviour for changes in frequency from baseline during intervention sessions. This study used the Microsoft Excel software random number generators to allocate participants to groups without blocking, the person conducting the randomisation was independent of the study. O'Conner et al. (20 13) used an intervention of 30% Lavender lotion, of which 1ml was applied to each forearm of the participant and massaged for one minute. Three treatments were performed over a period of seven days with four days washout between treatments . The study inves tigated physical agitation only, the primary measure being the mean count of behaviours 30 minutes prior to interventions when compared to mean behaviours 60 minutes preceding intervention. A secondary measure of CMAI monitor ed agitation on a weekly basis informed by a regular carer. As residents are their own control in crossover trials, uniformity between placebo and treatment groups can be assured. However, outcomes may be attributed to disease progression if groups are not counterbalanced. O'Conner et al. (2013) relied on the care staff to administer treatments and a research assistant assessed behaviours independently. Participants were not blinded to scent with researchers questioning the practicality of blinding participants to scent, therefore 69 the s cent may trigger the essential oils therapeutic ac tion in participants. Assessors however, were unaware of group allocation aided by the use of a nose clip and masking oil of rosemary essential oil smeared above the top lip when monitoring behaviour. O'Co nner et al. (2013) attempted to mitigate the risk of medication influences in their short trial by requesting staff not to change participant's medic ation unless necessary, however changes were not reported. A power calculation was obtained to determine th e number of participants required for generalisability of results before recruitment. However, the study failed to meet calculated sample size at the trials conclusion. The most common reasons for withdrawal included refusal to participate, breakthrough agitation or death Six trials sought to investigate exclusively part icipants with dementia; however a diagnosis was obtained in only one study (Lin et al., 2007). The researcher or nurse through the use of a dementia or cognitive declin e assessment tool ofte n determined the dementia status of the participants. Five studies (Fu et al., 2013; Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2013; Sakamoto et al., 2012) used the Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE], four studies (Ballard et al., 2002; Burn s et al., 2011; Fujii et al., 2008; O'Conner et al., 2013) used the Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] scale, three studies (Fu et al., 2013; Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007) used DSM -VI criteria or the NINCDS/ADRADA Alzheimer's criteria (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011) to assess participant dementia. In the absence of a dementia diagnosis, two studies (Burns et al., 2011; O'Conner et al., 2013) referred to participants as having probable or possible dementia. A further study (Fu et al., 2013) re ferred to participants as having severe cognitive decline and possible dementia as indicated by scores on the MMSE , a scale that measures cognitive impairment. 70 3.4.2 Lemon Balm (Melissa Officinalis) studies Two double -blind randomised controlled trials (Ballar d et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011) investigated Lemon Balm's effect on agitation in older adults with dementia. Each study used an intervention of 10% Lemon Balm lotion administered with massage and conducted in RACFs in England; it is unclear if these fa cilities were the same in each trial. Results of the two trials are conflicting. Ballard et al. (2002) investigated 72 participants with severe dementia and clinically significant agitation from eight National Health Care nursing homes in the United Kingdo m. Consent for participants in this study was obtained from the next of kin as participants had severe dementia as confirmed by a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) of three. Participants exhibited agitation at least daily with moderate to severe nurse management to be significant. Agitation was defined as a cluster of symptoms that lead to disturbed behaviours that could be measured on the CMAI and NPI measurement tools. Baseline behaviours on the NPI, CMAI and Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) were obtained f or all participants. The earlier study (Ballard et al. 2002) demonstrated a significant clinical effect when Lemon Balm essential oil lotion was applied, to participant's face, hands and arms twice daily for four weeks. Frequency and severity of agitated behaviours were monitored on the CMAI and NPI during the study and a significant reduction of agitation was reported in the behaviour categories of physical aggressive, physical non -aggressive and verbal behaviours in the Lemon Balm group when compared to placebo (Ballard et al., 2002). This significant reduction in agitation was demonstrated by a 35% reduction in the Lemon Balm treatment group compared with an 11% reduction in agitation for participants in the placebo group, a Mann -Whitney U test analysis Z = 4.1, p < .0001 demonstrated this effect. Ballard et al's (2002) study was the first essential oil study that addressed agitation in dementia to be included in the Cochrane review ( Thorgrimsen et 71 al., 2014b) however it was criticised for its randomisati on method. Participants were randomised in facilities by the toss of a coin rather than individually and therefore the results may be confounded by differences in care within each facility. Nine years later Burns et al. (2011) sought to replicate some comp onents of Ballard's et al. (2002) study, improve on methodological limitations and add a third intervention of Donepezil medication for comparison. Burn et al.'s (2011) study, however, showed no significant reduction in agitation in 115 older adults with p robable or possible Alzheimer's Disease and high levels of agitation with Lemon Balm lotion. This study again compared Lemon Balm lotion to placebo with the addition of a second treatment group of Donepezil medication. The aromatherapy group received 10% L emon Balm lotion massage plus placebo medication; the Donepezil group received medication plus placebo massage (without oil), and the placebo group received placebo medication plus placebo massage. The interventions were administered to participants twice daily by the care staff for 12 weeks. Frequency and severity of agitated behaviours were monitored on the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale [PAS] and NPI during the study Despite no significant clinical effect, a substantial reduction in agitation across all thre e intervention groups was demonstrated by improvements of 18% in the PAS score and 37% in the NPI total score over the 12 weeks trial (Burns et al., 2011). Reduction of agitation in the placebo group suggests that social contact during administration of th e intervention may have a positive effect on agitation. Burns et al.'s (2011) trial concluded that Lemon Balm was at least as effective as Donepezil medication to manage older adult agitation in RACFs. A comparison of Lemon Balm and Donepezil side effects and interactions suggests Lemon Balm to be the safer management method. Burns et al. (2011) incorporated several improvements that have advanced research into essential oils and Lemon Balm for agitation management. This study is the first 72 aromatherapy stu dy to include a Quality of Life (QoL) measure to monitor participant's wellbeing during an aromatherapy study for residents in RACFs. A clinically significant improvement in QoL was demonstrated on the Blau Quality of Life measure when participants used Le mon Balm. In contrast QoL scores decreased in participants that used the Donepezil intervention (Burns et al, 2011). Burns et al's. (2011) study also used methods of randomisation and blinding in essential oil trials that significantly improved the validi ty of the findings. Randomisation of participants to one of the three intervention groups by computer -generated blocks of six that were then stratified to each RACF, overcome the randomisation limitation in the previous study. Improvements in blinding were made with the staff that administered the aromatherapy intervention using nose pegs during the procedure and applied rosemary oil above their top lip to mask the intervention scent. Nevertheless, there were limitations including a 29% participant withdraw al rate that compromised the sample size resulting in a lower than anticipated number of participants completing the trial and decreasing generalisability of outcomes. Further, staff compliance to administering the intervention was also low with an estimat ed only 50% of the essential oil and medication as stipulated in the study design administered to the participants. This was determined by counting the number of medications that had not been administered and weighing aromatherapy bottles to determine rema ining intervention stock. The conflicting outcomes of Ballard et al. (2002) and Burns et al. (2011) Lemon Balm studies are inves tigated further in this study. 3.4.3 Trials of essential oils in subjects without a dementia diagnosis Sakamot o et al's (2012) trial was the only RCT to investigate people with and without dementia. This trial reported that 82% of participants exhibited possible or probable cognitive decline as demonstrated by a lower than 24 score on the MMSE. According to this information only 26 of t he 562 participants were cognitively intact and therefore 73 considered not to have dementia. A breakdown of results for people with and without dementia is not reported in this trial. The inclusion of participants without dementia experiencing agitation is essential in identifying potential effective management methods that can be practical in the RACF environment. Much research to date has f ocused on people with dementia due to the severity of behaviour and ease in monitoring high frequency of agitated beha viours common in the trajectory (Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013; Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007). However, more inclusive policies for researching related health problems will provide equity and potentially improve quality of life for all reside nts in RACFs. 3.4.4 Quality of Life Two studies (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011) investigated changes in quality of life score when participants were administered Lemon Balm in compa rison to a placebo. Both studies reported statistically significant im provement in the quality of life on the Belau measurement scale (Burns et al., 2011) and Dementia Care Mapping (Ballard et al., 2002) when participants were treated with 10% Lemon Balm massage oil (Burns et al., 2011) . Ballard et al's (2002) study suggests the participant's quality of life improved in the Lemon Balm group as demonstrated by reductions in time spent socially withdrawn Z=2.6, p=.005; and improvement in percentage of time engaged in constructive activities: Z=3.5, p=.001 as evidenced on the De mentia Care Mapping tool. The study also demonstrated a clinically significant difference in baseline QoL scores when compared to 12 week across groups of Placebo -2(-34,30), Donepezil -39(-63, 15) an d Lemon Balm 17(-13, 47) p=0.03 , with Lemon Balm showing the most marked improvement. The Quality of L ife (QoL) research into the agitation of older people needs to be investigated to identify the needs of the agitated individual without pre -empting them (Craig & Smyth, 2011; Pearson et al., 2007) . Aromatherap y may resonate as a preferred healing method amongst some older people who have previously found the therapy 74 beneficial (Kayne, 2009) . The QoL surveys can also provide accessible data for nurses in their care giving to monitor the impact essential oils have on older people and can validate the intervention effect for the nurse. 3.4.5 Nurse compliance Nurses as primary carers are fam iliar to the agitated residents and are well placed to identify agitated behaviour and provide timely intervention. Interventions w ere initiated by care staff in five studies (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2013; Sakamoto et al., 2012) , nurses administered oils by massage (Ballard et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011; O'Conner et al., 2013) , patch (Sakamoto et al., 2012) and through the use of humidifiers (Lin et al., 2007) . The person who delivered essential oil or placebo oil onto participants clothing in one study is unclear (Fujii et al. 2008), although a later study published by Fu et al., (2013) relied on the researcher or research assistant to administer essential oil or placebo mist spray and massage. Direct care nurses are essential to research investigation because they are familiar with the participants and can give advice on the pract icality of the intervention in a clinical environment. The reviewed studies identified the nurse's role in research to be observing participants, administering essential oils and informing agitation measurement tools for the research. However, nurse non -compliance to essential oil administration was recognised as a limitation in two studies (Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013) . Fu et al's (2013) results were compromised by nurses not complying with the study protocols for administration of interventions, p ossibly due to time constraints and shifting priori ties of care. Burns et al. (2014 ) calculated administration compliance to be 10% Lemon Balm massage oil to participants at only 50% of administrations. Currently, it can only be speculated as to why compl iance is an issue with essential oil administration in RACFs. Barriers to nurse compliance may include competing for workplace demands and priorities or knowledge deficits surrounding aromatherapy or 75 older person agitation (Edberg et al., 2008; King, 2012; Poole & Mott, 2003) . Despite limited resources, many nurses in RACFs are challenged to meet all care needs of residents in their charge, often proving too much for the nurse with competing demands (King, 2012; Poole & Mott, 2003) . Prioritising competing d emands may lead to essential oil administration for agitation management being omitted from the nurse's schedule in favour of priorities the nurse perceives to be of more value. Alternatively, agitation is common in RACFs with a potential underlying percep tion among nurses that agitation is a normal part of ageing which cannot be remedied (Grose & Schub, 2013; King, 2012) . The literature that investigates the involvement of direct care nurses in research infers that nurses are often absent from the researc h process. The three studies (Akerjordet et al. 2012; Roll et al. 2013; Vedel\u00f8 & Lomborg, 2011) obtained in the literature identified balancing the fluctuating volume of patient load and care demands with research commitments to be a challenge to research participation. Nurses who felt comfortable with their level of research knowledge and with the research team were more likely to participate in research (Akerjordet et al., 2012; Roll et al., 2013; Vedel\u00f8 & Lomborg, 2011) . To mitigate these challenges, res earchers need to ensure that nurses have allocated time to participate in research which enables them to fulfil their research roles in addition to their regular care duties. Secondly, timely and transparent communication with care staff may better support the challenges they face in committing to a research project. Finally, researchers must be aware that care staff often have little experience in conducting research. Education should be provided at the appropriate level of the staff knowledge and involvem ent (Roll et al., 2013) . Nurses are required to follow clinical procedure manuals when delivering evidence -based care to clients, therefore educating staff on research process using a similar process may improve knowledge and participation (Vedel\u00f8 & Lombor g, 2011) . 76 Researchers need to address barriers to nurse participation in research for future studies (Roll et al., 2013; Vedel\u00f8 & Lomborg, 2011) . The recruitment of a research assistant to administer essential oils can support the nurses by attending to t he daily intervention to ov ercome this limitation, however this can prove expensive and defeats the purpose of a quick, effective intervention which can be provided by the nurse. Further investigation of nurse perceptions and barriers to nurse administrati on of essential oils is require d to ensure practicality of the intervention for use in Australian RACFs (Burns et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013) . 3.4.5.1 Nurse observation reporting Nurse perception of the effectiveness of essential oils work or an inability to disti nguish agitated behaviour from an older person's rational behaviour may unintentionally bias outcomes especially if the allocation group is known. Inaccurate reporting of behaviours on the measurement tools intentionally or unintentionally , devalues outcom es obtained. Compromised nurse blinding in two studies (Fujii et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2007) increased the risk of bias and inaccurate reporting. Zuidema et al. (2011) support this view when assessing the NPI and CMAI for reliability and found poor inter -rater agreement in observed behaviours. Investigation of a nurse's preconceived inclination towards agitation, essential oil and research may identify bias in agitation management selection or bias in reporting. Further , well -designed studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils to manage agitation in older adults with and without dementia. Research that will address limitations in methodology, investigate the RACF environment, specifically the benefits and b arriers to nurse administration of essential oils while being inclusive of all older people experiencing agitation who live in RACFs is needed. 77 3.5 Summary This chapter has reviewed the suitability of essential oils as potential manageme nt for agitation in th e RACF setting. The first section of this chapter explained the origin of essential oils and mode of administration to the older person . The chemistry governing essential oil formation including the locations of storage and development in the plants have b een detailed. A brief history of the use of essential oils as a therapeutic intervention was provided, which included claims of low side effects and pleasant aroma. Current understanding of dermal and respiratory absorption of essential oils have been disc ussed with reference to key constituents of Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oil. Theories of biological or memory mechanism of action are discussed within the context of the literature. The second section in this chapter identified constituents of Laven der and Lemon Balm that traditional observation of effect supported as having anti -agitation properties. Constituents of Lavender and Lemon Balm have been explored for anti -agitation scientific evidence as demonstrated in animal, human and in vitro studies (Burns et al. 2011; Chioca et al. 2013; O'Conner et al., 2013; Takahashi et al. 2014). Constituents in both oils have been investigated for evidence of access to neurological pathways similar to anti -agitation or antidepressant medications with conflictin g results. The safety of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils and viability for nurse administration as an agitation management was also reported. A literature review of RCTs on the effect of Lavender or Lemon Balm for the management of agitation in old er people living in RACFs was conducted. The review identified seven RCTs , however the effectiveness of both Lavender and Lemon Balm is inconclusive from the studies results. The reviewed RCTs revealed pertinent areas of methodology, participant inclusion and nurse compliance that can be improved. The methodology of a mixed methods study to overcome limitations in the literature and provide nurse's 78 scientific evidence of Lavender or Lemon Balm 's effectiveness and practicality in RACFs setting is presented i n chapter 4. 79 Chapter 4 Methodology 4.1 Overview This chapter presents the methodology of a mixed methods study with a three -phase sequential design. A rationale is provided that gives evidence of the effectiveness of this design to determine the effect and practicality of Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oils as agitation managements in the RACF setting. The theoretical underpinning, the adapted HBM provid ing the framework for this inquiry is presented. The qualitative and quantitative components of this mi xed method research are detailed separately with each section providing a rationale for the methods used and study objectives addressed. Finally, the rigour and ethical considerations to which this study complies are provided. 4.2 Mixed method design Mixed met hods research is a process that combines both quantitative and qualitative methods in one project to provide data that can be triangulated to provide a clearer understanding of a research problem (Treddlie & Tashakkori, 2012). The combination of methods pr ovides a broader understanding of the research problem than either interview or statistical data could provide alone (Creswell, 2012) . Quantitative and qualitative data have distinct features that when mixed can strengthen research results because the stre ngths of one research approach can counteract the possible limitati ons of the other approach (Cres well, Klasson, Clarke and Smith, 2011), for example, the ability of a quantitative study to sample a large number of people can build upon a qualitative study 's smaller sample to improve generalisability of findings (Green et al. 2015). 4.2.1 Rationale for a mixed method sequential design This study used mixed method research to investigate the use of two essential oils, Lavender and Lemon Balm to manage agitatio n in older people living in RACFs. In this 80 research a single blind Randomised Control Trial (RCT) was conducted compare essential oils interventions for agitation management while the qualitative studies examined the issues of nurse attitudes towards essen tial oil research in the RACF environment in which the research was conducted. A double -blind method could not be achieved in this study as attempts to blind the resident from the essential oil scent may have reduced the effect of the intervention. The res earchers participating in the administration of intervention, data collection and analysis were the not aware of resident allocation through blinding and masking strategies. The researchers kept the nurses reporting behaviours blinded to essential oil allo cation. This blinding was achieved by the RA administering and removing the oils from residents before the reporting nurses started their regular work hours. However, researchers could not guarantee that resident's participating in the RCT did not identify the essential oil intervention, in par ticular Lavender, a commonly used herb among the o lder adult population. A single blind method is therefore considered to provide the most appropriate understanding of the practicality and effectiveness of using Laven der or Lemon Balm to manage agitation in older people living in RACFs. This study employs a three -phase sequential design with exploratory and explanatory sequential research components: Phase I : Qualitative interviews were conducted with nurses to explo re current practices for the management of agitation at the study sites, their attitudes about agitation management and the use of essential oils as an intervention to manage agitation in the RACF setting. The interviews also explored nurse's attitudes and experiences to conducting and participating in research in the RACF setting . Findings that support nurse participation in research and the conduct of research in RACFs were incorporated into Phase II of this research. 81 Phase II : A single blind RCT was cond ucted at six residential facilities on two sites in Sydney metropolitan area to provide evidence of the effectivenes s of two essential oils, Lemon Balm and Lavender, fo r the management of agitation in residents of RACFs. The single blind RCT design was sel ected for this phase as it is considered to be the gold standard according to the hierarchy of evidence in medical and biosciences (National Health and Medical Research C ouncil, 2007) and most appropriate design for the intervention evaluated . Phase III: Qualitative interviews were conducted with nurses to build upon the responses obtained from Phase I and identify changes in attitude after participating in the Phase II single -blind RCT. The interviews examined changes in perc eptions of agitation frequency and the ability of essential o ils to manage agitation. These questions also examined the ease of which the single -blind RCT was implemented into the RACF setting and facilitators to nurse participation in the research. Table 3 presents the mixed methods th ree-phase sequential design that is us ed to guide this study. Phase Method Description 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 Exploratory Phase I Qualitative Exploratory semi -structured interviews with nurses to explore the factors that influence agitation management, nurse perceptions of ess ential and facilitators to single blind RCT implementation in the RACF environment. Phase I explored a lack of RACF nurse compliance to previous RCTs. Findings that support nurse participation in pre-trial education, intervention and data collection timin g are incorporated in Phase II. 4.2.1.1.1.1.1 Explanatory Phase II Quantitative A single -blind RCT of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils effect on agitation in sixty -five older adults living in RACF settings. Nurses who observed resident behaviour in Phase II a lso participated in Phase I and Phase III of this study. Phase III Qualitative Explanatory semi -structured interviews with nurses monitored changes in perceptions of Lavender or Lemon Balm as an agitation management for people with and without dementia. Further examined are the influencing factors that can facilitate nurse participation in research in the RACF setting. Table 3 Mixed method sequential design 82 4.2.2 Theoretical Underpinnings As discussed in Chapter 1 section 1.3 the theor etical underpinning for this research is the adapted Health Belief Model [HBM] ( Cheung et al., 2015 ). The qualitative Phases I and Phase III support theoretical under pinnings of the HBM that focus on the nurse's likelihood of changing their current agitati on management strategy to essential oils application for residents in their care. The literature review established that nurses were exposed to agitation in their workplace that often seriously impeded their daily duties. When applied to the topic the HBM postulates that susceptibility and seriousness of agitation in the RACF environment should develop a cue to action among nurses to seek acceptable managements to resolve agitation in their workplace. 4.3 Qualitative studies This section describes the qualitat ive design used to guide Phase I and Phase III of this research. Study methods include d the use of semi -structured interviews that gave insight into nurse perceptions of agitation, its management, use of essential oils and the conduct of research in the RA CF environment. The objectives explored by the qualitative study that supports this inquiry are provided. The content analysis that guided the data collection and dissemination of data into credible, reliable areas of interest are detailed. 83 4.3.1 Phase I a nd Phase III The qualitative components o f this design, Phases I and III addressed five objectives below : Phase I 1. Explore nurse understanding of agitation and it's influence on the managem ent resident behaviour in RACFs 2. Explore nurse perception of essent ial oils and their use to manage agitation 3. Explore nurse attitudes towards research in RACFs, and identify barriers to research in that setting Phase III 1. Determine if nurse's perception of the use of Lavender and Lemon Balm to manage agitation has chan ged by participation in Phase II 2. Determine influencing factors that can facilitate nurse participation in research conducted in the RACF setting. The objectives in Phase I explored nurse understanding of agitation management, the perception of essential oils and their use to manage agitation, the importance of research for older people and the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of res earch in the RACF environment. Findings from Phase I were incorporated into Phase II of this study to address knowledge deficits and facilitate ease of research implementation to encourage nurse participation. Phase III of the study addressed changes in nurse perceptions of Lavender or Lemon Balm as an agitation management. Nurses provided opinion on the differenc es in Lavender and Lemon Balm 's effect on agitation in older people with and without a dementia diagnosis. Nurse's observation al assessment of the essential oils effect informed the scientific results obtained from the Phase II single blind RCT by verifyin g if results were similar to their observed experience. In addition, nurses 84 in Phase III review ed their Phase II RCT research participation to reflect on factors that influence nurse participation in research conducted in the RACF environment. 4.3.2 Study samp le The sampling for Phases I and III included a purposive sample of 11 nurses employed in the RACFs . Purposive sampling was conducted to ensure that nurses who were potential participants for the study would be available for all three phases. Purposive sa mpling is non-random; resident s are selected on the basis of certain characteristics that are desirable to conduct the research (Ryan & Maruyama, 2014). In this study, potential nurse participant s were invited to participate if they cared for residents par ticipating in Phase II , four days per week for at least two hours per day. Sample bias was reduced in the study sample by ensuring that an accurate and diverse representation of the nursing st aff was involved in the study. This was achieved in this study by recruiting nurses of different ages, education level and ethnic background to provide an accurate representation of a miniature sample of the nu rsing population in the facilities . The selection criteria for the nurse participant 's are detailed in the following section. Selection criteria Participants were included in Phase I and III if they met the following criteria: Nursing staff that care for residents recruited to Phase II of this study, for a minimum of four days a week for at least two hours p er day. Nursing staff who consented to monitor residents behaviour in Phase II and report these findings to the researcher for recording on agitation measurement tools NPI, CMAI and QoL -AD. 85 4.3.3 Recruitment Nurse participant s were initially identified in con sultation with the RACF care manager as the person regularly caring for resident s participating in Phase II RCT. Following this , information sheets (Appendix C) were administered to prospective participants outlining their required involvement in Phase s I, II and III of the study. Prospective nurse participant s were encouraged to contact the researcher by telephone if they had further questions about the study. The nurse s who agreed to participate in the RCT signed a consent form (Appendix D) to participate in all three phases of the study. In Phase I and III nurse participant s agreed to take part in a semi -structured interview with the researcher and participate in subsequent phases of this trial. The setting for interviews was a quiet location of the inte rviewee's choice at the RACF, to promote nurse participant comfort. The interview setting varied and included meeting ro oms, lunch rooms, outside areas and nursing stations of the RACF. 4.4 Phase I and Phase III study method The study methods for Phases I and III are guided by sequential design, use of semi - structured interviews and content analysis . The Phase I exploratory phase aimed to access information from 11 nurses observing and repo rting agitation in this study. Seven semi -structured i nterview question s were designed to investigate preconceived ideas of agitation, use of essential oils and practicalities in the RACF setting (Greenwood & Terry, 2012). Moreover, Phase I interview questions (Appendix E) were designed to elicit an initial and com prehensive insight of the nurse s perception and knowledge of agitation , including its relationship to dementia. Additionally, nurses attitudes towards the use of essential oils for agitation management were explored. Finally , the influencing factors that impede or fa cilitate research in RACFs were investigated . 86 The objective of Phase I interviews was to gain nurse foundational knowledge to be built upon and used to guide practicalities in the subsequent study phases. As nurses primarily need to administer essential oils in the RACF environment nurse attitudes towards essential oil and compliance in application are investigated . Phase I findings influenced Phase II, by identifying gaps in nurse education for the intervention and research that were addressed in Phase I I prior to the commencement of the RCT. Further , Phase I findings educated the researcher on the most appropriate times for Phase II intervention administration and data collection that could best support nurse participation and the projects success in the RACF setting. Phase III was designed to expand further upon the nurse perceptions reported in Phase I interviews and to give context to the qua ntitative results in Phase II. Five i nterview questions used in Phase III (Appendix F) were constructed from fi ndings and anomalies of Phase I data , to review changes in 10 of the nurse s attitude s after participation in Phase II . A sequential design collects data in phases, the initial data analysed from the first phase informs or develops the second phase, a seco nd phase then informs the subsequent phase and so on (Cameron, 2011) . In addition , nurses' perception of changes in the frequency of agitation on the ward and their opinion on the effectiveness of Lavender or Lemon Balm as an agitation management served to inform Phase II results. Phase III interview questions also built upon the Phase I findings and Phase II experience to inform the researcher of the facilitators to conducting research with nurse s in the RACF setting. 4.4.1 Data collection Data for Phases I and III was collected during 30 -minute semi -structured audio recorded interview sessions with each nurse participant . The researcher in this study used reflexivity, the process of being aware of one's own biases throughout the qualitative 87 interview and transcr iption processes. The researcher diarised thoughts and feelings before and after interview s as well as during each interview transcription to become aware of preconceived bias (Treddlie & Tashakkori, 2012) towards agitation management, effectiveness of ess ential oils and older person research in RACFs. The researcher listened to all 21 interviews to transcribe areas of interest and statements from the nurse's dialogue. The transcriptions were reviewed and verified as correct by all 11 nurse participant s. Identifying features were removed from the data once approved by nurse participant s to ensure confidentiality. 4.4.1.1 Semi structured interviews Semi -structured interviews included 12 set questions that were asked to each nurse participant . The semi structured inte rview questions for Phase I semi -structured intervie w questions for Phase I and Phase III are found in the Appendices E and F of this thesis. The questions were followed as a guide during the interview with the nurses responses viewed as an opportunity to explore related trajectories that focus on the areas covered (Edwards & Holland, 2013) . The semi -structured interview process is a means of collecting contextual information about the broad experiences of the participants with the use of predetermined ques tions to provide uniformity (Green et al. 2015) . Semi -structured interviews were considered the most appropriate means to obtain information from nurses in Phase I and III of this study. This form of questioning was chosen for its less formal approach and encouragement of two -way conversation (Stuckey, 2013). The questions may be rephrased or explained more fully to ensure participants understanding. The researcher considered nurses would be more receptive to the interview questions and comfortable with th eir responses with this relaxed approach. Further, the standardised pre -determined open questions allow the researcher to clarify what is known and probe what is currently unknown (Edwards & 88 Holland, 2013; Green et al. 2015) . The researcher in this study c onstructed the questions from common themes and anomalies in the literature regarding agitation management, essential oils and research in the RACF environment. 4.4.2 Data analysis Content analysis was considered the most appropriate method to disseminate th e qualitative data into aspects of interest . Content analysis focuses on the information that was contained in the data having been used since the early 1940s to analyse large amounts of qualitative information into manageable reoccurring themes and ideas (Gondim & Bendassolli, 2014). Content analysis adheres to the principles of scientific method, systematic approach and generalisability to obtain trustworthiness in findings (Krefting, 1991). The principle of the scientific method is achieved by conforming to a set of rules and codes that enable different researchers to duplicate results from the same transcripts. Content analysis is a systematic approach that counts word and phrase frequencies (Vais moradi, Turunen, & Interna tional NVivo 10 qualitative software to locate recurrent themes, ideas and wording in the transcripts. This systematic approach to analysis removes the researcher's interpretation from the initial data limiting bias in the raw a nalysis (Vaismoradi et al. 2 013 ). The frequency of words and phrases obtained with the NVivo software in this study was categorised through a process of information coding to establish meaning in the data (Gondim & Bendassolli, 2014). In this study, data were coded by word frequency using NVivo 10 software to avoid individual bias and singular interpretation of data. The most frequent 20 words of four letters or more from the interview responses for each question formed the codes. A researcher independently reviewed all transcripts u sing the pre - established coding with supervisors overseeing the process to promote consistency . All 21 t ranscripts were then coded into manageable areas of interest supported by key 89 words, phrases, sentences and areas of interest. The areas of interest are identified by patterns and relationships as well as similarities and differences in the data categories (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with the researcher and two supervisors until 100% consensus was achieved. Content analysis is bound by the principle generalisability that the findings from the interview transcripts can be generalised as correct in similar circumstances among similar populations (Macnamara, 2009). To ensure these findings are transferable the process used to obtain areas of interest must be credible, dependable and conformable , reflecting trustworthiness (Elo et al. 2014; Vaismoradi et al. 2013 ). The numerical method of assessing data in content analysis is often perceived as a quantitative proc ess of qualitative data. This method of analysis was considered appropriate for this study due to the primary study being a quantitative design and in keeping with the numerical focus of the study. An example of the numerical coding is included below: Area of Interest Types of Agitation Category Physical non -aggressive agitation Physical aggressive agitation Verbal agitation Physical and Verbal agitation Sub - category Wandering Restlessness Aggression Swearing Shouting Repetitive behaviour Codes Like Agitation Just Want Wandering Something Know Start Like Agitation Just Want Wandering Physical Anxiety Constantly Like Agitation Behaviour Physical Manage Start Verbal Just People Physical Know Sometimes Resident Like Agitated Verbal Sometime s Know Beh aviou r Start Staff Just Like Agitated Like Just Verbal People Come Know Behaviour Evening Want Coming Asking Wandering Behaviour Know Verbal Want Table 4 Area of interest 1 - Types of agitation A limitation in content analysi s is considered to be that coding for frequency may miss or overemphasise the importance of data. It is argued that frequency of wording in some 90 cases does not indicate importance rather that the participant has a greater willingness to talk at length abou t the topic (Vaismoradi et al. 2013 ). The qualitative phases of this research are situated either side of the quantitative study which is designed to evaluate essential oil effect as an agitation management in older people living in RACFs. The following s ection details the quantitative method. 4.5 Quantitative study Phase II of this research a 2x3 factorial single blind Randomised Contr ol Trial (RCT) was designed to measure the effe ct of Lavender and Lemon Balm on agitation in older people with and without de mentia and who live in RACFs. The RCT is the primary focus of the study as the results will add to the body of evidence for the effectiveness of these essential oils for the management of a gitation. This research phase was informed sequentially by the Phas e I findings (Chapter 5) that influenced the implementation of this trial in the clinical environment. 4.5.1 Phase II study The RCT addressed two research questions (1) To examine the effectiveness of Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oils as a management for a gitation in older adults and (2) To examine the differences of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils as a management for agitation in older adults with and without dementia . This section addresses the research questions: 1. What is the effectiveness of Lave nder compar ed to Lemon Balm and a placebo for the management of agitation in residents of RACF s with and without dementia? 2. What is the difference between Lavender compared to Lemon Balm and a placebo for the management of agitation in residents of RACF s with and without dementia? 91 4.5.1.1 Rationale for using a RCT The RCT is considered the gold standard of clinical trials. The random allocation of treatment sequence to each resident and masking of assessors to essential oil scent can limit bias to overcome limita tions in some previous trials. This trial was conducted as a single blind trial due to the inability to disguise scent from the resident . The researchers who assessed the outcomes in this study were blind to interventions. This research sought to determine di fferences in Lavender and Lemon Balm s effect on agitated behaviour in resident s with and without dementia. A placebo of 100% Sunflower oil was used in this trial. The placebo was considered to provide no therapeutic effect on resident agitation. The active treatment effects of Lavender and Lemon Balm were compared to the placebo effect for differenc es in the residents agitation. An RCT was necessary to provide evidence for Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils potential as an agitation management. Previous studies (Ballad et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2007; O'Conner et al., 2011; Sakamoto et al., 2013) investigating either Lavender or Lemon Balm have argued that there is evidence for the use of these products to reduce agitation. This study is the first to use both Lavender and Lemon Balm in the one study enabling a comparison of the oils to determine if one is more effective than the other in reducing agitation. 4.6 Phase II study method As stated above, a 2x3 factorial single blind design was used for the RCT component of the study. The repeated measure design permitted all resident s to receive each of the three interventions: Lavender, Lemon Balm and the sunflower oil placebo, and to compare to the resident 's baseline behaviour for effect, as such resident s, acted as their own behaviour control. Participant agitated behaviours were assessed on the NPI and CMAI standardised agitation measurement tools, between each treatment to monitor for condition progression and changes to baseline behaviour . The nurses reporting resident observed behaviours were interviewed in Phase I and II of this study. Nurses were 92 provided education on the measurement tools at the commencement of Phase II. This data collection process was considered most appropriate to m easure difference of effect between the essential oils in comparison to placebo . The first factor was the degree to which the resident s had dementia and consisted of two groups: dementia and without dementia. The second factor was the essential oil treat ment and consisted of three groups: Lemon Balm (A), Lavender (B) and placebo sunflower oil (C). The second factor is the within group factor, as all resident s received all thr ee treatments separately during the trial. This repeated measures design allowed resident s to act as their own control. Participants were allocated to either the dementia or without dementia group based on diagnosis and cognitive score on MMSE and this ensured resident s within each group contained similar cognitive characteristics, the only difference being interventions. Participants were then randomly allocated a treatment sequence A, B or C giving a total of six groups for comparison. Participant allocation between groups of dementia and without dementia and treatment sequences are outlined in Table 5. A factorial design allowed the comparison of within resident groups for intervention effect and also examination between the independent groups, dementia and without dementia (Polit & Beck, 2014) . A-B-C A-C-B B-A-C B-C-A C-A-B C-B-A With dementia (30) 5 5 5 5 5 5 Without dementia (30) 5 5 5 5 5 5 Table 5 Participant allocations between 2 -group dementia split and within group treatment sequence This repeated measure design study is a modification of Lin et al 's (2007) study with the improvement made in attention to counterbalancing treatment sequence. An inhalation method was chosen to administer essential oils as this method proved most effective in the literature reviewed (Lin et al., 2007; Fuji et al., 2008 ). 93 4.6.1 Participants Potential participants were identified in consultation with the RACF care manager and regular permanent nursing staff. Participant i nformation sheets (Appendix G) were administered to these resident s outlining their required involvement in the RCT. In those instances (68) where cognitive impairment prevent ed resident s providing informed cons ent, the researcher approached the person responsible for the resident, usually a family membe r, explained the study giving the Carer Information Sheet (Appendix H) and sought their consent to include the resident . Residents or their carers were encouraged to contact the researcher if they had further questions pertaining to the study. The 87 residents recruited to this RCT were required to complete the conse nt form prior to study commencement (Appendix I and resident consent for a carer in Appendix J). 4.6.1.1 Participant Selection Participants were selected for inclusion in this trial if they met the following criteria: Inclusion Criteria Participants were age d 65 years or older. Participants must have lived full time in a residential aged care facility (RACF) for three months to ensure they are familiar with the daily processes and settled into their environment. A cognitive level of moderate or higher as demo nstrated by a score above ten on the mini -mental state examination [MMSE]. Recorded agitated behaviours on at least one of the Aged Care Funding Instrument [ACFI] behaviours domain questions. Behaviour question s being question 7 wandering, question 8 verba l behaviours and question 9 physical agitations. Be stable on medication for three months as confirmed by medication charts. Any changes in psychotropic medications need to be reported to the investigator. At least one agitated behaviour with a frequency of at least six occurrences observed by the nurse in the last two weeks , assessed on the NPI at baseline. Ability to detect scent as demonstrated in a scent test at screening. 94 The resident or the carer have provided consent. Participants also consented to: Wear a 2x2.5cm dark cloth patch for two hours daily for a duration of six weeks. Understood the patch contained two drops of treatment being either Lavender, Lemon Balm essential oil or placebo sunflower oil. Participate in a Quality of Life survey cond ucted by the primary investigator every two weeks for the 10 -week duration of the trial . Exclusion Criteria Diagnosis of psychosis or agitation resulting from brain damage. The presence of an acute life -threatening condition as reported by staff or the medical officer. Any condition that was likely to confound the study such as schizophrenia , Parkinson s disease or another medical condition as determined by the researcher to interfere with interpretation of study results. 4.6.2 Study Setting This study was cond ucted in conjunction with a large not for profit provider of aged care assisted accommodation in NSW. The setting for the study was six residential aged care facilities that provided assisted living to the older adult participants on two Sydney metropolita n sites . These facilities share commonalities of core values and care standards. All facilities were assisted living facilities with 24 hour nursing care. Si te A contained three facilities; the first being a mixed cognition accommodation of 68 beds; the se cond facility was mixed cognition accommodation of 66 beds that contained a secure dementia unit. The third facility contained 94 beds with two secure dementia units. Si te B contained three facilities; the first being a mixed cognition accommodation of 112 beds and the second facility containing three secure dementia units of 75 beds. A third facility of 96 beds and two secure dementia units commenced this study. However due to the relocation of the nurse participant from this facility during the RCT and fa ilure to secure a suitable replacement, data collection was not completed on this site. 95 The RACFs were typical of the assisted living facilities targeted to older people in Australia. The facilities offered recreational and social activities in addition t o services common to RACFs of similar standards. Activities offered included craft, live entertainment, music, social events and exercis e. Services provided were 24 hour nursing care, personal care, podiatrist, hairdressing and meals. The se RACF s were chos en because they represented a typical facility that encompassed approximately 500 residents , the major ity being over 65 years of age and had ample older residents from which to obtain willing participants that met inclusion criteria for this study. 4.6.3 Inter vention This study included three interventions consisting of tw o treatment oils; Lavender and Lemon Balm , and one placebo, s unflower oil. The within group design ensured all resident s trialled two drops of oil for each intervention in this way resident s acted as their own control . All essential oil dosages for this trial were determined in consultation with a qualified aroma therapist from the Australian College of Aromatherapy (ACOA). Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia) an essential oil with a chemical (>28%), Therapeutics, 2013) was used in this trial. Lavender has medium scent intensity with a sweet woody aroma; dosages were 100% concentration at two drops each treatment. Lemon Balm (Melissa Officinalis) an essential oil with chemical composition of 2006; Huang et al. 2008) was used in this trial (Essential Therapeutics , 2013). Lemon Balm has strong scent intensity with a sweet citrus aroma. Lemon Balm used in this trial was diluted in a 50:50 mix of 100% Lemon Balm to Jojoba oil, dosages were two drops each treatment. 96 Sunflower Oil (Placebo) is a triglyceride with chemi cal composition of palmitic acid, stearic aci d, oleic acid and linoleic acid. The phosphatides present in the oil are lecithin and cephalin (Elvers, 2013) . Sunflower oil when refined is scentless; dosage was two drops each treatment. Forty -nine p articipant s received all the alloc ated treatment sequence s for 14 - consecutive days followed by a 14 -day washout period before the commencement of the next treatment. A research assistant (RA) was trained by the researcher in aromatherapy protocol and was responsible for administering treatment to resident s. Each treatment was administered daily and consisted of two drops of essential oil or place bo oil applied on a 25mm x 20mm dark coloured 100% cotton patch daily and attached via double sided Velcro to the resident 's collar area. The patch was removed by the RA after being in situ for two hours. During the 14 -day washout period, no patches were applied to the resident s. Interventions were administered to resident s during their normal daily activities at a regular tim e negotiated with the RACF nurses to provide the least disruption to routine. 4.6.4 Measurement tools Tools used to measure cognition (MMSE) and agitation (NPI; CMAI) had been validated reliable for a credible outcome when used in this population and within t he timeframes specified (Cohen -Mansfield et al. 1989; Cummings et al. 1994; Tombaugh & McIntyre, 1992) . An assessment test of scent to screen for anosmia was also performed. 4.6.4.1 Smell test Inhalation was the mode of administration for the essential oils Lave nder and Lemon Balm in this study. The mechanism of action for essential oils as described in Chapter 2 may rely on identification of scent. A smell test of identification and discrimination was 97 conducted in all participants (residents) . As olfactory dysfu nction has been predicted among those with cognitive decline, the smell test was essential to rule out anosmia (Sohrabi et al., 2012) . The smell test consisted of three scent sticks, two with sweet orange essential oil and one with sandalwood essential oil. The resident was asked to identify which scent stick smell was different to the other two. A positive result proved identification of scent present and ability to distinguish one scent from another. A negative re sult was considered a possible olfactory dysfunction excluding the potential participant from this trial (6). In addition resident s were also excluded from the trial if they had advanced dementia as indicated by MMSE score (6). 4.6.4.2 Mini Mental State E xaminatio n [MMSE] MMSE is a widely recognised measurement which screens for cognitive impairment. This tool is commonly used clinically to screen for cognitive decline. The MMSE was used to support the separation of resident s into dementia and without dementia grou ps based upon their level of cognitive decline. The MMSE consi sts of a 30 -point questionnaire which tests arithmetic, memory and orientation taking approximately 10 minutes to complete. The MMSE is scored out of 30; a score below 24 indicates a possibility of mil d impairment, below 18 moderate and below ten severe cognitive decline (Fu, 2009) . Residents in this study who achieve d a score of 2 5 or more were placed in the without dementia group unless a diagnosis of dementia was concurrent. Those who achieve d a score of 10 -24 with a dementia diagnosis were placed in the dementia group. Participants who score below ten on the MMSE were excluded from the study due to possible severe dementia. Table 22 phase II participant characteristics reports the MMSE score for the residents that w ere included for analysis in this study. Good test /retest reliability 0.89 and internal consistency of 0.83 (Tombaugh & McIntyre, 1992) have been achieved with the MMSE. The MMSE was obtained at baseline to screen for resident and support group all ocation . 98 4.6.4.3 Neuropsychiatric Inventory The NPI was the primary outcome measure for agitation in this study. The NPI was initially developed for use in the dementia population , however it can be used in other psychological states of older person assessment. The NPI assesses frequency and severity of behaviour through observation of 10 behaviour categories and two neurovegetative states. Behaviour cate gories consist of delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, agitation and aggression, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability and lability, apathy, aberrant motor activity, and nighttime behaviour disturbances (Smart et al., 2011) . A yes or no is recorded , dependent on where the behaviour is present. If the behaviour is present, a number is allocated for frequency and severity of the behaviour. Frequency is scored one to four and severity scored one to three (Smart et al., 2011) . The internal consistency for this measure is 0.75 to 0.89 for each category (Cummings et al., 1994) . This study measured seven NPI categories only, five directly related to agitation being, delusions, agitation/aggression, aberrant motor activity, irritability/lability and night - time disturbances. Also m easured were the two categ ories of anxiety and depression which are possible precursors to the older person experiencing agitation (Grose & Schub, 2013; Volicer, Frijters, & Van der Steen, 2012) . The full NPI is co nsidered to take approximately 15 minutes to administer. The NPI with the omission of three categories and the two -neurovegetative states was anticipated to take approximately eight minutes to administer. As nurses were reporting behaviour on the NPI this time saving measure was a necessary compromise with stakeholders. A secondary measure used to monitor agitation was the Cohen -Mansfield Agitation Inventory. 4.6.4.4 Cohen -Mansfield Agitation Inventory The Cohen -Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) is another meas urement tool for agitation, which features heavily in the literature among dementia populations. The 99 CMAI measures frequency of agitated behaviour only and was used as a second agitation measure in this study. The CMAI monitors 29 behaviour s for frequency; each behaviour is scored a numerical frequency between 1 an d 5. A number 1 score indicates the behaviour was not observed in the previous two weeks and a 5 score indicating the behaviour occurs several times within the hour. The o utcomes of the CMAI in th is study were s ubcategoris ed into three categories of verbal, physical non -aggressive and physical aggressive agitation. The reliability and validity of the CMAI tool was studied in residents of a long -term care facility and determined to be a valid measur e for this population. The CMAI demonstrates a high internal consistency and adequate inter -rater reliability (Finkel et al., 1992) of 0.92, 0.92 and 0.88 at three nursing home units (Cohen - Mansfield et al., 1989) . The administr ation of the CMAI took approximately 10 minutes for each resident . Participant s were also screened for Quality of L ife during the trial. 4.6.4.5 Quality of Life Measure The QoL -AD is a brief, 13 -item measure designed specifically to obtain a residents quality of life that is informed by either the resident or their caregiver. The questionnaire has 13 measures of physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, chores, fun, money, self and life as a whole (Delaney, Cullen, & Dolphin, 2011) . The resident or the nurse rate each item as either excellent, good, fair or poor accordingly. The validity of the QoL -AD is supported by a correlation with the dementia quality of life scale (0.69) and on the Euroquol -%D scale (0.54) and indicates a good criterion concurrent validity between resident and carer responses (Thorgrimsen et al., 2003 a). The QoL -AD is not validated in the people without dementia population. In this study, a quality of life measure that was validated in dementia populations was preferable for use as one quality of life measurement tool only was chosen for ease of comparison. 100 A timeline of measurement and the patient/nurse timeline of events is presented in table 6 schedule of events.

This was calculated using the NPI means of the treatment groups ba sed on the results of Lin et al's (2007) st udy that reported patients' mean NPI scores as 63.2 (placebo) and 58.5 (treatment) with a standard deviation of 17.5. For the present sample size calculation, we used NPI scores of 63.2 (placebo), 58.5 (T1) and 59 (T2) with an SD=17.5 were used . The sample size was calculated using a 2x3 factorial within group analysis of main effect (Placebo vs. T1 & T2). An increase of 14% was added to control for the possible withdrawal of resident s before completion of the study, increasing the sample size to 75 randomi sed resident s. Sample size calculations were conducted using GLIMMPSE ( http://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org/#/ ). Two previous studies (Burns et al. 2011; Fu et al. 2013) reported high resident withdr awal due to the investigated populations frailty, with one researcher (Svansdottir & Snaedal, 2006) suggesting an overestimation of the sample size by 30% was necessary to protect the sample size . 101 4.6.6 Randomisation Participants were randomly assigned a treatm ent sequence of Lavender, Lemon Balm and pla cebo s unflower oil for the study duration. Treatment assignment was fully counterbalanced such that one -third of each dementia and without dementia group received alternate treatments simultaneously. An independe nt researcher performed the study randomisation using a block randomisation of the three facilities and a randomised number table to allocate resident sequence. The independent researcher was invaluable in minimising selection bias and ensuring research st aff were kept blinded to group allocation. The randomisation process used in this study took into account the pr evious limitation in Lin et al's (2007) study. In that study care was taken to counterbalance groups to protect results from being attributed to intervention order or disease progression. In the interest of full disclosure, this study clearly outlines the process of randomisation that ensured resident s were given equal opportunity to be allocated to each group at any stage of the trial. Allocation bias in this study was also protected through the use of blinding and masking techniques. 4.6.7 Blinding An independent researcher was responsible for essential oil preparation in bottles for administration which kept staff blinded to allocation assignment. E ssential oils were stored in dark glass bottles fitted with a dropper for accurate dosage. Bottles were clearly labelled A, B or C and kept in a dry locke d environment when not in use. A research assistant (RA) responsible for administering essential oils to the resident s minimised researcher assessor and allocation bias. In addition , this study made use of masking techniques to blind the RA from the scent being administered to resident s. The RA was masked to the allocation group, and treatment by nose peg and three percent Rosemary Oil in Jojoba oil placed above the top lip. The RA did not engage in any non -deliberate conversation with the resident during administration. 102 The RA was responsible for checking the resident 's identity, bottle assignment and documentation of treatments administered. The RA applied two drops of oil from the correctly labelled bottle to the dark 100% cotton patch and attached the patch to the resident s collar. The patch was dark in colour to obscure essential oil colour. The RA the n signed and dated the resident 's logbook as treatment was administered from the correct ly lettered bottle. The RA returned after two hours to remove the patch from the resident , sign the l ogbook as removed and discard the patch appropriately. 4.6.8 Data Collec tion The researcher responsible for collecting data was blinded to treatment allocation and not present when treatment was administered to resident s. An independent researcher was responsible for randomising resident treatment and the RA for administering resident treatment. The blinded researcher recorded observations of agitated behaviour as reported by the nurse, checked medica tion records and completed the Quality of L ife score with resident s fortnightly. Nurses who participated in monitoring behaviour in this study also participated in Phase I and II of this study. Nurses were provided with pre -trial training on the research being conducted including the measurement tools used that took between 15 -25 minutes to complete . Due to the nurses demanding wor kload, education was carried out by the researcher with one or two nurses at a time , agreeable to the nurse s during their work day. A regular data collection time when the workload was least likely to impact on the nurses time was negotiated with the nurse that was also agreeable to the researcher. The researcher also provided a phone n umber should the nurse have further questions or require additional support in the research process. Data were collected at the conclusion of each two -week treatment period to assess for changes in agitation and after each washout period to gain new baseline measures. Therefore information for the NPI, CMAI and QoL -AD was collected at six stages 103 throughout the study. There were no active treatment sessions during the data col lection however, as an added precaution the researcher wore rosemary oil upon the top lip to confound any residue scent when interviewing resident s. A second researcher collected behavioural observations from the clinical staff and recorded the informatio n on the NPI and CMAI. This researcher was also responsible for collecting Quality of Life information from the clinical staff or directly from the resident , dependent on their level of dementia. The researcher collected data pre and post treatment cycles fortnightly obtaining six measurement sets on each resident . 4.6.9 Statistical analysis An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the degree of agitation present between the groups of dementia and without dementia in the absence of intervention. An ANOVA was then performed for a within group subject comparison of the effect of Lavender intervention and Lemon Balm intervention; both interventions were then independently compared to placebo irrespective of the level of dementia among resident s. Finally , a within -between subjects comparison of the interaction between level of dementia and the effect of both Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils compared to the placebo group was investigated using ANOVA. The NPI data were collected in categories of delus ion, agitation/aggression, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviours, sleep time distur bance, anxiety and depression. Data from CMAI and NPI was then correlated with changes in the three constructs of physically aggressive, physical non -aggressive a nd verbal agitations. Data were analysed with adherence to Per Protocol ( PP) guidelines, a PP analyses valid cases only or a subset of resident s that were more compliant with the research protocol. These resident s completed all treatment cycles, were avai lable for all measurement periods and did not violate inclusion criteria throughout the trial. The researchers remained blinded in this study until all analyses were finalised. An intention -to-treat 104 (ITT) analysis was also conducted to minimise type one er ror or false positives and withdrawal bias. ITT included all available completed outcome data for all randomised resident s (Jadad, To, Emara, & Jones, 2011). A full report of the PP analyses is presented in Chapter 6 with the outcomes for ITT analyses tabu lated in Appendix K of this thesis. In addition to monitoring for essential oils effect on agitation, a major focus of the analyses compared for a difference in treatment effect between the two cognitive groups. Contrasts between these two groups provided greater insight into the relationship between essential oil agitation management. 4.7 Study Rigour An investigation of study quality relies on how strictly the researcher follows the protocol that eliminates bias and how the study adds knowledge to the emergi ng body of research (Grove, Burns, & Gray , 2013). Rigour in mixed method studies is dependent on the quality of the qualitative and quantitative studies that it combines (Creswell, 2012). Therefore attention to rigour was required for both the quantitative and qualitative components of the study. 4.7.1 Scientific Rigour Scientific rigour is determined for quantitative research by how scrupulously a protocol is followed in addition to how objective and precise the design and analysis techniques conform to the rese arch. This study used a RCT. That design is governed by strict guidelines that evaluate an intervention for accuracy against a blinded comparison treatment within a population that has similar characteristics and an identifiable clinical presentation (NHMR C, 2007). The RCT is considered the gold standard of evaluation with a Level II evidence on the NHMRC level of evidence scale. This level of evidence is superseded only by the systematic review that compares similar Level II evidence studies for consistenc y in the outcome. This study complies with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting (CONSORT) that promotes strict adherence to protocol through 105 the complete and transparent reporting of all trial procedures (Schulz, Altman, Poccock & Evans, 2010) . This st udy used a single -blind RCT, in that both resident and researcher were blinded to the intervention allocation. Participants were randomised to a treatment sequence to compare essential oils with a placebo for effectiveness and safety in agitation managemen t (Stevely et al. 2015). Random allocation by an independent researcher assigned similar resident demographics between treatments to ensure the treatment groups were comparable except for intervention. The treatment sequence was counterbalanced among resid ents to ensure the outcomes were not attributed to treatment order. The agitation measurement tools that were used in this study held validity and reliability for assessment in the older adult population and within the timeframe of use. The RCT evaluation contai ned manipulation, randomisation and a control condition that together minimise d uncertainty and increase d the reliability of outcomes (Moher et al. 2016). The RCT was necessary when considering whether a) Lavender and Lemon Balm are effective in red ucing agitation and b) if one essential oil is more effective than the other and therefore more appropriate to introduce into RACF clinical practice (Buchanan, 2015; Moher et al. 2016). The differing definition of rigour in qualitative research, when compa red to quantitative, is indicative of the opposing data they capture in mixed methods research. 4.7.2 Trustworthiness The concept of rigour in qualitative research is refer red to as the trustworthiness of research or how closely it follows research protocols so that results are reproducible. Rigour is defined in qualitative research by its adherence to a philosophical perspective, thoroughness in data collection and how open the data collection method is to scrutiny (Grove et al. 2013). The researcher practised r eflexivity during the qualitative 106 interviewing process in that the thoughts and feelings of the researcher were diarised. This self -referencing technique was conducted before and after the interview process as well as during the transcription period. This process assisted the researcher to become aware of any existing bias and remove them from the qualitative data process (Treddlie & Tashakkori, 2012). Qualitative rigour requires trustworthiness in that attention to reciprocity, the validity strategy and re flexivity that have been practised throughout the qualitative process. Reporting of interview questions, the types of data collected, how the data were prepared including processes for multiple coders and the steps taken in data analysis can assist in prov iding trustworthiness. Rigour is important in qualitative research due to the lack of experimental design and opportunit y for researcher interpretation. Table 7 reports the criteria for the assessment of trustworthiness that promotes rigour in qualitative research. Truth value/credibility Degree to wh ich researcher has established \" confidence in the truth of the findings for the subjects and the context in which the study was undertaken \". Applicability Degree to which the findings can be applied to other c ontexts, settings or groups Consistency Extent to which the findings would be consistent if inquiry were replicated with same subjects or similar context Neutrality Degree to which the findings are a function of the subjects/informants and condition of t he research and not of other biases, motivations, and perspectives. Table 7 Rigour in qualitative research: The assessment of trustworthiness (Krefting, 1991 Pg. 214 - 222 ) 4.8 Ethical considerations This trial adheres to the ethical con siderations of informed consent, confidentiality and avoiding harm to do good (Israel & Hay, 2006). All nurse participants, resident s or persons responsible for the resident , granted consent for participation in this study with the full knowledge of the study aims, participation expectations and possible consequences of involvement. Capacity to provide valid consent for people with dementia was determined by a dementia diagnosis and the resident s score on the evaluation to consent form (R esnick et al., 2007 ). Consent was obtained in compliance 107 with ethical considerations and good clinical practice regulations that have an origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (ICH GCP, 1996). Informed consent and ethics approval was obtained for the researcher to access the medical records of the participants. The researcher is competent to conduct this research with qualifications and experience in older adult nursing, naturopathy and research (ICH GCP, 2011). Further, the researcher holds several publications in complementa ry therapies and older adult healthcare. Confidentiality of the resident and nurse participants was protected durin g all stages of this research. Data collected on older person characteristics during the trial were attributed a numerical value and residen t's name and identifying details removed. Similarly, nurse interviews once transcribed and verified as correct had all identifying features removed and a pseudonym assigned. Data was entered and stored on the primary researcher's password protected compute r. A trial master file managed by the primary researcher contained all essential documentation regarding the trial, in cluding ethics approval and source protocol documents with resident s identifying criteria such as consent and conforming with inclusion cr iteria. The master file is located in the researcher's locked filing cabinet; information will be kept for five years from publishing at which time information will be erased and destroyed (NHMRC, 2007). The safety of the essential oils used in this study was of pr imary concern to the researcher . In Australia, essential oils are recognised as chemical substances defined as medicines in Section 3.1 of the TGA (TGA, 2015). Both essential oils of Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia) and Lemon Balm (Melissa Offici nalis) hold evidence of safety in research (EMA, 2011, 2012) when used in higher dosages in the older adult dementia population (Ballard, O'Brien, Reichelt, & Perry, 2002; Burns et al., 2011; O'Conner et al. 2013). Lavender and Lemon Balm hold assessment r eports with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Union for the evaluation of medicinal products. The EMA provides a summary of non -clinical and clinical data along with an evaluation of clinical 108 efficacy and safety (EMA, 2011, 2012) that promo te the oils safety when used as directed in this study. This research conforms with the NHMRC Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research, the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007) and other relevant legislation and gu idelines that apply to this study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Western Sydney University Human Research Ethics Committee for the study Essential oils for agitation management in older adults: A mixed method study , with registration approval num ber H10550 14/009176. This ethics approval ensured that the research protected the rights and interests of all resident s in the study. This trial also holds registration with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registrar [ANZCTR]. The ANZCTR is an o nline registrar of National Health and Medical Research clinical trials that is accountable to the public. As such this research meets the appropriate content, quality and validity that is required by the World Health Organisation [WHO] registry network st andards. The trial registration number is ACTRN12614000130662 -Essential Oils for Agitation Management in Older Adults: A Mixed Method Study (ICH Tripartite , 2011). 4.9 Summary This chapter has described the methodology for a mixed method study comprising quali tative and quantitative data to provide evidence for the use of Lavender or Lemon Balm to manage agitation in the RACF setting. A rationale for a mixed method sequential design with three phases that included an RCT in phase II proposed to establish the ef fect essential oils as an agitation management. Nurse interviews, phase I and phase III, either side of the phase II RCT inform the conduct of the RCT in the facility. Theoretical underpinnings of the HBM that guides this research were discussed within the study context. The nurse interviews were designed to identify the attitudes of nurses towards essential oils that may influence their likelihood to adopt this strategy as an agitation 109 management. The RCT was designed to provide aspherical evidence of effe ctiveness what coul d be used by nurses to support selection of essential oils for use with agitation in older people . Qualitative Phases I and III have been designed to explore nurse s understanding of agitation management, their perception of essential oi ls to man age aggression, the importance of research for older people and the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of research in the RACF environment. The qualitative phases of the study were detailed, including study sample, selection criteria, recruitment, methods of semi -structured interviews and content analysis to analyse the data. The primary focus of the RCT was to examine the effect of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oil on agitation in residents with and without dementia in RACFs. The quantitative randomised controlled trial was presented with a rationale provided for the 2x3 factorial design. The quantitative methods detailed recruitment, randomisation, sample size, blinding, measurement tools, data collection and analysis processes. Finally, the rigor of the study was examined, and the ethical considerations to which the study complies are presented. The findings obtained from this study are presented in Chapter 5 Phase I Qualitative Findings, Chapter 6 Phase II Quantitative Results a nd Chapter 7 Phase III Qualitative Findings. 110 Chapter 5 Phase I Qualitative Findings 5.1 Overview This chapter reports the findings of 11 exploratory, semi -structured interviews conducted with nurses caring for older people living in six RACF s and w ho exhibit signs of agitation. The interviews sort to understand (1) Nurse perceptions of agitation and its relationship to dementia (2) C urrent agitation management of agitation at the study sites including resident characteristics that influence the type of strat egy used by the nurse to manage behaviour (3) Nurse perceptions of essential oils and their efficacy; and (4) Nurse perceptions of and compliance with research in the RACF environment. This section presents the findings of the semi -structured interviews , and includes a profile of the nurse participant demographics and attributes relevant to this study. The findings are reported as areas of interest identified from the analysis accompanied by the frequency of occurrence and percentage of data coverage. Respo nses by the nurses were grouped into the following themes: types of agitati on, agitation management, perceptions of essential oils and nurse perceptions of research in the RACFs. All areas of interest are supported by categories and subcategories with quot es from the nurse transcripts . 5.2 Data Collection and Analysis Data were collected in r esponses from the nurses interviewed were analysed using content analysis (discussed in Chapter 4), which is often employed as an analytical tool in nursing research (Vais moradi et al., 2013) . In the current study content analysis was employed as a means of inquiry to explore nurse assumptions and situational circumstances of the environment in which this study was conducted. It is a process of organising and integrating na rrative from the semi -structured nurse interviews according to key concepts and areas of interest (Polit & Beck, 2014 ). The interviews were audio recorded and listened to several times before being transcribed by the researcher. Before including data in the analysis, each nurse verified a hard copy transcription of the interview as correct. The frequency of keywords in the interviews, were used to code 111 responses into manageable categories to identify key areas of interest in the nurse responses. The c oded content was analysed by pattern and sequence of occurrence to identify relationships in the interviews (Braun & Clarke, 2006 ). The findings are presented for each area of interest supported by c orresponding categories. Categories are supported by sub -categories from the interview transcripts. Each sub -category is supported by a code frequency along with the percentage of interview coverage being the number of interviewees that reported this sub -category topic in response to the intervie w questions. A detailed table of codes for the area of interest 1, types of agitation is presented in table 4. 5.2.1 Participant Characteristics This section focuses on the characteristics of the 11 nurses who took part in this study. All nurses were full -time care staff employed by the same aged care organisation operating on two sites in the Sydney metropolitan area. Qualifications of the nurses included seven registered nurses (RNs) who held Australian Health Practiti oner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) registration. The remaining four assistants in nursing (AINs) had obtained a qualification of Certificate IV through an accredited provider. The length of experience varied significantly between the nurses with employment in the aged care sector ranging from six months to 25 years. Five RNs (Gabi, Jasmine, Rosemarie, Sabrina, and Sam) were new graduate nurses who held six months to three years aged care experience. The remaining two RNs had been employed for 18 years (Kaye) a nd 22 years (Jess) as registered nurses and both held managerial positions that also provided direct care to residents. The four AINs also varied in length of employment being four years (Sanaya), 16 years (Natasha), 19 years (May) and 25 years (Abbie) respectively. All 11 nurses held direct care responsibilities for the resident with agitation in their positions. Aged care role, area of specialty and level of responsibility differed between the 11 nurses. Six nurses were em ployed in mixed cognition wards and five 112 nurses were employed in specialty dementia secured facilities. Two nurses held managerial positions in the facility with one being a care manager and the other a clinical nurse educator. All nurses were exposed to the same core values, training and education materials endorsed by the organisation. The nurses were 91% female. The language of origin differed among the nurses with 73% not having English as their first language. Each of the nurses also participat ed in the RCT Phase 11 of the research . Pseudonyms were assigned to protect participant confidentiality. The names allocated were Abbey, Gabi, Jasmine, Jess, Kaye, May, Natasha, Rosemarie, Sabrina, Sam and Sanaya . The characteristics of Phase I nurse participant s are presented in Table 8 .

These ar eas of interest and categories are: Area of interest 1: Types of agitation Physical non -aggressive agitation Physical aggressive agitation Verbal agitation Physical and verbal agitation Area of interest 2: Agitation management Types of agitation management Differenc es in agitation management for residents with and without dementia. Area of interest 3: Perceptions of essential oils Individual use of essential oils Clinical experience of essential oils Perceived effectiveness of essential oils Areas of inter est 4: Nurse perceptions of research in RACF's Importance of research Nurse compliance Recommendations for future research 5.4 Area of interest 1 - Types of agitation This section describes the four categories of agitated behaviours identified in the trans cripts using content analysis. These behaviours include physical non -aggressive agitation, physical aggressive agitation, verbal agitation , and physical and verbal agitation. The four categories were further divided into six subcategories of wandering, restlessness, aggression, shouting, swearing and repetitive behaviour. The most frequent ly reported types of agitation identified by the participating nurses are tabulated into categories and subcategories in Table 9 below. 114 Area of interest Types of Agitat ion Category Physical non -aggressive agitation Physical aggressive agitation Verbal agitation Physical and Verbal agitation Subcategory Wandering Restlessness Aggression Shouting Swearing Repetitive behaviour Table 9 Types of Agi tation A central focus of the semi -structured interviews was nurse's understanding of the types of agitation. The most frequently reported agitated behaviour s were wandering and restlessness, which was identified by seven nurses, followed by aggression, id entified by six nurses . Five nurses also identified the behaviours of shouting and three identified swearing as agitation. The agitation related behaviours of aggression, swearing and shouting were also considered to be problematic in the RACF environment. Further, four nurses considered the characteris tic of repetitive behaviour indicative of agitation. Table 10 presents the behaviours identified by these nurses, reporting frequency and percentage of interview coverage. Subcategor y Frequency Percentage (n=11) Wandering 7 64% Restlessness 7 64% Aggression 6 54% Shouting 5 45% Swearing 3 27% Repetitive behaviour 4 36% Table 10 Nurse identified behaviours of agitation 5.4.1 Physical non aggressive agitation Nurses identified non -aggressive behaviours of wandering and restlessness to be the most frequent behaviours they considered as agitation. Wandering wa s identified by seven nurses, describing this behaviour as originating from internal unease that results in ambulating behavio ur and requires close monitoring. This is illustrated in some of their comments: 115 \"When they get cranky... and there is something not feeling well inside... and they feel like, where to go, what to do and they just start wandering.\" Sanaya AIN \" ... trying to g et into inappropriate places... because they just cannot sit still.\" Gabi RN Restlessness, described as the constant physical movement that interferes with the resident's routine, was also identified by seven nurs es as an agitated behaviour. The following are examples of behaviours the nurses identified as agitation: \"... like they cannot sit down to finish their meals they(sic) constantly want to get up and do something.\" Gabi RN \"... fidgeting and... a lot of non -verbal's.\" Kaye RN 5.4.2 Physically aggressive agitat ion Just over half , six nurse s interviewed identified physically aggressive behaviour as the agitation related behaviour of most concern in the RACF environment. Nurses observed aggression to be impulsive behaviour that posed serious safety concerns for ot her residents and staff in the RACF environment. This is demonstrated by the following nurse comments: \"Like kicking, hitting, pulling the hair, my hair. It's been pulled so many times even if I have short hair, because sometimes if I put on their socks a nd they just pull my hair. And grabbing, grabbing my arm and then sometimes they twist my fingers.\" Natasha AIN \"They just want to do something without thinking and that usually involves violence... some people have a... you know 116 they have like a fight or flight response where people usually just fight it.\" Sam RN \"... a lot of behaviours in here like punching some of the resident's... physical aggression towards staff and residents as well.\" Jasmine RN 5.4.3 Verbal agitation Five n urses also associate d shouting and three nurse s associated swearing with agitation. Nurses described the residents shouting as disruptive vocal behaviour that was used by the resident to air grievances. This is outlined in the following comments: \" ... and sometimes shouting at you like go a way, just leave me alone, stuff like that but it's not really, really severe.\" Jasmine RN \"Mrs. X she is quite agitated... because of the yelling.\" Sabrina RN \"... verbally abruptly telling the staff that they are not happy with this and they are not happy wi th that.\" Jess RN A smaller proportion of nurses (3) identified swearing as a verbal agitated behaviour that was common in the RACF environment as shown by the following comment: \" ... verbal agitation, yes swearing, most of this side [of facility] swears.\" Natasha AIN 5.4.4 Physical and verbal agitation Four nurses indicated repetitive behaviour to be a characteristic of agitation that often accompanied physical or verbal behaviour. Nurses described repetitive behaviour as 117 repeating the same verbal or physical a gitation, with or without aggression, several times without resolve. The nurse comments below demonstrate their understanding of resident repetitive behaviour: \"Agitation is people constantly coming up to you with some being aggressive and some verbally ab usive.\" May AIN \"... coming to the trolley repeatedly asking the same question.\" Sabrina RN \"Like tapping tapping the door or the wall.\" Jasmine RN Physical non -aggressive, physical aggressive, verbal and a mix of physical and verbal behaviour s require the nurse's attention for management in the RACF environment. Management strategies commonly used by the nurses to reduce agitation in the RACF environment are discussed under the second area of interest agitation management in the following section. 5.5 Area of interest 2 - Agitation management This section presents the findings for nurse's perceptions of agitation management in RACFs. The area of interest agitation management includes the two categories, types of agitation management and differences in agitatio n management in residents with dementia compared to agitated behaviours exhibited by residents who do not have dementia. The first category, Types of agitation management contains six subc ategories including distraction, providing space, knowing the reside nt, medication, causative factors, and individual time that represent the most common strategies nurses use d to manage agitative behaviours by residents. The second category differences in agitation management for reside nts with and without dementia, inclu des four subcategorie s: ease of agitation management, communication, comprehension and preference based care. 118 Table 11 presents the interventions most frequ ently used to manage agitation , presented by category and subcategory. Area of Interest Agitation Management Category Types of agitation management Differences in agitation management for dementia and without dementia Subcategory Distraction Providing space Knowing the resident Medication Causative factors Individual time Ease of management Communi cation difficulties Comprehension level Preference based care Table 11 Agitation management 5.5.1 Types of agitation management Nurses were asked what management strategies they used to reduce agitation in residents at the RACF. The mos t frequent response reported by ten nurses was distraction . Seven nurses also identified giving the resident space to settle down as a common strat egy. Six nurses acknowledged the importance of knowing what triggers a resident's agitation and the intervent ions that assist in calming episodes of agitation . Further, five nurse s described medication, four nurses attested to identifying the underlying causative factors or providing individual time as strategies used to reduce agitation in the RACF environment. These management strategies are discussed separately and supported by nurse s comments from the interviews. Table 12 presents the t ypes of agitation management as reported by nurses, presented as frequency and percentage of respondents. Subcategory Frequenc y Percentage (n=11) Distraction 10 91% Providing space 7 64% Knowing the resident 6 55% Medication 5 45% Causative Factors 4 36% Individual time 4 36% Table 12 Types of agitation management Ten nurse s identified dist raction as the most frequently used agitation management in the RACF setting. Nurses described the diversion of a resi dent's attention away from the cause by replacing it with another idea or activity. Distraction when individually tailored 119 to the resident 's preference was considered by the nurses as an effective short -term management for agitation. This is shown in the following comments: \" the best way is just to distract them, there is one resident, if she's getting really angry I just make her sing bec ause she loves singing... that really calms her down... another one (resident) if he gets really agitated you can just hold his hands and give a cup of tea or I just say I'll give you a massage and if you give a massage for 20 seconds he's fine. Pretty effecti ve.\" Sam RN \" But it [distraction] can not continue for the whole day you know the agitation starts of course after the activity is over\" Gabi RN Seven nurses identified providing space as a common response when a resident is agitated. Nurses described p roviding space as the process of removing themselves from the vicinity of the agitated resident for 5 -10 minutes to allow the resident to calm down. The nurse would then re -enter the relationship once the situation had de -escalated in an attempt to establi sh the causative issues for the behaviour. Nurses described this process as p referable to using touch, which they believed sometimes increases agitation and places staff and resident s at risk of harm. This is shown in the following comments: \" ... we use the five-minute rule which is coming back again later so that is re -entering the relationship... I try to avoid tactile interventions because it puts the staff member at risk and often increases the agitation... we come back later with a cup of tea or come back with a different face and also try and problem solve it.\" Kaye RN 120 \" ... if they become really agitated and we really only have one or tw o [staff] you are best to leave them.\" May AIN Six n urses identified knowing the resident as a type of agitation manageme nt method commonly used in RACFs. Nurses recognised that being familiar with or knowing the resident's usual behaviour can assist to determine how they approach the resident and manage agitation. Nurses reported that when they have knowledge of situations or events that trigger unease in a resident, agitation can often be pre -empted. In addition, a nurse's knowledge of the resident's preferences can be quickly implemented to address the behaviour appropriately. This is shown in the following comments: \"We know the behaviours so... we know how to approach\" Sabrina RN \" ...we have to watch for the triggers and I'm aware of the triggers... I see that someone has a certain look in their eyes and I think, oh, they're going to go off.\" Abbey AIN \"They know the residen ts well because everything is in their file and before you are on the floor probably a majority of our staff have worked here for many years so they know.\" Rosemarie RN Five n urses interviewed in this study reported that medication is commonly used to mana ge agitation in RACFs. Almost half of the nurses believed that medication was an appropriate management for agitation, specifically when agitation was disruptive or not resolving by other management methods, describing medication as a necessary measure for the welfare of the resident and other s on the ward. Medication was also described as necessary to manage behaviour in cognitive decline: 121 \" ... there are some medication management as well from the doctors... if the agitation is really disturbing them and disturbing other people , well then we get medical help.\" Gabi RN \"... with dementia it is different , cause it's cognitive impairment so therefore we have to deal with the doctors and deal with the medications... anything that can manage the behaviour.\" Rosemari e RN \"We know the behaviours so it can be with the staff that we know how to approach and we can give them medications.\" Sabrina RN However , nurses also suggested that excessive doses of medication administered to some resident's is ineffective, with side effects impairing resident mobility. \"I think it 's not helping... they give too much (medication)... the way they walk leaning you can tell on their face\" Natasha AIN Four nurses described the importance of identifying the causative factors for agitation in RACFs. Nurses attempted to find physiological causes for agitation and to encourage the resident to verbalise the causes of their agitation, considered to be pivotal in calming the resident. This is shown by the comments below: \"First of all we have to f ind out how and why, what is the cause of agitation so that we can resolve it.\" Jess RN 122 \"Do they need to go to the toilet? Are they hungry? Are they thirsty? Are they in pain?... have they had a change in medication or are they becoming increasingly unwell ?\" Kaye RN \"We will talk to them calmly... and we ask them what do you feel? Why do you feel like this? Why are you angry? If they couldn't actually tell you, you need to look for the non -verbal cues.\" Jasmine RN Four n urses also recognised that providing in dividual time with an agitated resident is a suitable management strategy. Nurses described that providing individual time with an older person gave the resident personal attention to voice their concerns. This is shown by the following comments: \"... spend one on one [time] with them, talking to them, allow them to express their feelings and let them air whatever is not happy , and provide lots of reassurance and emotional support .\" Jess RN \" We have one on one sessions... we will try to manage the agitated be haviours on the ward face to face, spending time with them.\" Gabi RN 5.5.2 Differences in agitation management for dementia and without dementia Nurses were asked if agitation was managed differently in residents with dementia compared to residents without demen tia. Nine nurses reported a d ifference in management. The reason for difference in agitation management approach was reported by six nurses to be impaired communication or comprehension that is often associated 123 with dementia. Impaired ability to communicat e undermines the nurse's attempts to identify factors influencing the behaviour, and impaired comprehension reduces the resident's ability to follow instructions aimed to modify behaviour. Four nurses identified agitation management strategies for resident s without dementia to most often involve changes to care delivery to better align with the residents needs. Table 1 3 presents t he number of nurses who report ed the approach to managing agitation varies for people with dementia compared to residents without dementia . Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=11) Ease of agitation management 8 72% Communication difficulties 6 55% Comprehension level 6 55% Preference based care 4 36% Table 13 Differences in agitation management for deme ntia and without dementia Nurses where asked if there was a difference in the way agitation was managed in residents with dementia compared to residents without dementia. Nurse's acknowledged there to be a difference in the management of agitation between people with and without dementia. This is supported by the following comments: \"Well there is definitely a difference.\" Rosemarie RN course there is a big difference.\" Jess RN Nurses were asked if agitation was easier to manage in people without d ement ia compared to those who have dementia. An analysis of the comments revealed eight nurses believed there was a difference in the ease of agitation management between residents with and without dementia . Not surprisingly, the majority , nine of these responses described agitation as being more easily mana ged in people without dementia. Six n urses considered symptoms common to the dementia trajectory that impair communication or comprehension to adversely affect the ease in which contributing factors can be quickly identified and agitation effectively managed. This is shown in the following comment: 124 \" ... it might be a little easier [residents without dementia] because you can just ask them what's wrong and can just say if their care (needs) are not met. We can make sure (future needs are met) we can reassure them... that it will not happen again... the problem would be solved immediately and it will be faster.\" Sam RN Alternatively , one nurse explained that regardless of the residents diagnosis , interventions were more effective and easier to implement when the resident has insight into why they are feeling agitated: \" Also on the flip side of it, when someone is verbal they [nurses] are less likely to look at the non -verbal's . So I think sometimes the words of 'No, no, no I'm fine' when actually all the non -verbal's are saying that they are not fine at all... can add a layer of complication... it depends on their insight.\" Kaye RN Six n urses identified difficulties with communication to be a frequent reason for the differences in agitation management between residents with and without dementia. Residents with dementia were considered to be less verbally able to articulate the causes of their agitation. Nurses expressed their frustration at not being able to find the cause of agitation quickly in residents with dementia. Agitation was assumed to be more easily managed in residents who could communicate their reasons for agitation. This is shown in the comments below: \" People who don't have dementia , we will find the cause, it will be easier as they can describe the cause and we will try to fix the problem... But with dementia , it is not necessarily 125 that we will definitely get a cause. We can only guess the trigger.\" Gabi RN \"I think that the main difference would be th e ability for the resident to verbally identi fy what is happening for them. But other than that basically not, the reliance upon non - verbal's, the reliance of knowing the resident, their medical condition, their social condition, where they are at the time makes no difference as to whether they have dementia or not. It's the ability of the resident to be able to verbally articulate what is giving them agitation.\" Kaye RN Six n urses reported that comprehension deficits often seen in residents with dementia result in an impaired ability to recognise their own emotional state, understand nurse s questions or follow instructions, necessitating a different app roach to agitation management. Nurses described the need to repeat instructions, remind them or modify language for resident's with dementia to be the main difference in agitation management between those with and without dementia. This is shown by the following comments: \"... with dementia they don't understand what we are talking about. You need to constantl y be reminding them or doing something if they may be agitated.\" May AIN \"People who have dementia... in a sense you have to keep repeating yourself all the time... and it doesn't always work because they are so forgetful.\" Gabi RN Four n urses identified meet ing residents needs for care to be more commonly used as an agitation management of older adults without d ementia compared to those with dementia. Nurses reasoned that resident s without dementia often became agitated when 126 the care was of low quality or doe s not meet their needs. Providing care that aligns with older persons preferences to fit within the persons routine was considered to reduce agitation in residents without dementia. This is shown in the following comments: \" ... without dementia, they alway s come [to the nurse] when the care is not provided properly. We will try to deliver or make it change so that we can deliver the care properly, you know, or according to their needs.\" Jess RN \"Like we have residents like [Mr X] he is quite agitated about his medication and he is always asking about his medication and you need to have his catheter bag right at 7pm. If you don't he does get agitated. He doesn't have dementia so we try to do things on time for them.\" Sanaya AIN The types of agitation manageme nt commonly used in the RACF and the differences in management strategies required between resident cognitive groups have been described in this section. Strategies for agitation management in older people with impaired communication or comprehension have been reported as time consuming offering only short -term resolve in behaviour. More effective long -term agitation managements are required with some promoting essential oils as a possible alternate management (Lin et al, 2007; Sakamoto et al. 2013). Nurse perceptions of essential oils as possible agitation managements for resident's are reported in the following section. 5.6 Area of interest 3 - Perceptions of essential oils This section presents the area of interest nurse perceptions of essential oils as iden tified in the transcripts using content analysis. Nurse perceptions of essential oils are categorised into three catego ries nurse's individual use of essential oils , nurse's clinical 127 experience of essential oils and perceived effectiveness of essential oil s. Within these three categories are nine subcategories . The first category individual use of essential oils has three subcategories potential for nurse self use , no experience and motivators for use. The second category, clinical experience of essential o ils c onsists of three subcategories previous clinical use , dementia setting and palliative care setting. The final category perceived effectiveness of essential oils contains three subcategories positive effect , resident selective and uncertain. Table 1 4 presents the most frequent reported nurse perceptions of essential oils under the third area of interest . Area of interest Nurse Perceptions of Essential Oils Category Individual use of essential oils Clinical experience of essential oils Perceived effect iveness of essential oils Subcategories Potential for nurse self use No Experience Motivators for use Previous clinical use dementia setting Palliative care setting Positive Effective Resident selective Uncertain Table 14 Nurse p erception of essential oils 5.6.1 Individual use of essential oils Nurses were asked if they would consider using essential oils for their own health. Ten nurses agreed they would use essential oils for their own health conditions. Nurses were asked if they had used essential oils previously with six nurses indicating they had no previous experience with essential oils. Th ree nurses claimed the motivators for their individual use of essential oils included a belief that the oils provided a pos itive effect or the oils pleasing scent. Table 1 5 presents the reported nurse experience of using essential oils for their own health conditions . Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=11) Potential for nurse self use 10 91% No experience 6 55% Motivators for use 4 36% Table 15 Nurse individual use of essential oils A significant majority of ten nurses agreed they would try essential oils to manage their health and well being . Several nurses were already using essential oils for their own health and some owned home diffusers. This is illustrated by the following comments: 128 \"Yes. I have got a diffuser in Sabrina RN \"I find it quite relaxing.\" Sanaya AIN A slight majority of six nurses interviewed had not used essential oil s previously for various reason s. One nurse identified a need for education of essential oil properties and effects before committing to using the oils. Allergies prevented another nurse from using essential oils. \" Well it depends on what does it do though, like well I'm not really sure what it does?\" Sam RN \"No... I need to be quite wary because I get a bit of asthma\" May AIN Four n urses use d essential oil for their perceived benefit including pleasant aroma or relaxing effect. Nurses reported that essential oils have a greater effect on resident's . The following comments portray this: \"I like trying the smells...\" Gabi RN \" ... have had education about it, that it's quite soothing and calming especially to the older people.\" Rosemarie RN 5.6.2 Clinical experience of essential oi ls Seven nurses had used essential oils previous ly in the clinical environment , three nurses for people with deme ntia and two nurses for people receiving palliative care (18%). Table 16 presents the previous clinical use of essential oil and settings as re ported by the nurses. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=11) Previous clinical use 5 45% Dementia setting 3 27% Palliative care setting 2 18% 129 Table 16 Previous clinical use of essential oil This is demonstrated in the respons es below: \" ... we have a client who... was prescribed Lavender oil to go on the pillow, a few drops on the pillow before he went to bed.\" Gabi RN \" ... the answer is no, I seen anybody using it.\" Sam RN \"No I haven't seen it but I heard about it.\" Sanaya AIN Three nurses who reported using essential oils in a dementia care setting in their clinical practice, had administered Lavender hand massage in their current facility, while others had been involved with e ssential oil use for residents with dement ia at other organisations. This is shown by their comments: \"Oh about five years ago in another organisation in our dementia specific unit. I used aromatherapy\" Kaye RN \" ... then I used, they gave us aroma oil... it smells nice, Lavender, I massaged it into their hands.\" Natasha AIN Two nurses reported they had used essential oils in a palliative care setting in their clinical practice. These essential oils were used for patient relaxation at the end of life. This is shown by the following comments: \"Yes , I oil use] in palliative care patients as they get restless too... they get very agitated in that end of life stage.\" Gabi RN 130 5.6.3 Perceived effectiveness of essential oils Nurses were asked how effectiv e they perceived essential oils to be in managing agitation in older adults. Eight nurses reported that essential oils would be effective in managing agitation in residents . Seven nurses believed that essential oils would reduce agitation in some resident s only, that effect would be dependent on pre -existing cond itions or personal situations. Another two nurses were unsure as to the effect of essential oils , preferring to wait for the RCT results. Table 1 7 reports nurse perceptions of essential oils effecti veness as an agita tion management in residents . Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Positive effect 8 80% Resident selective 7 70% Uncertain 2 20% Table 17 Perceived effectiveness of essential oils as agitation management Nurses who described essential oils to have a positive effect on managing agitation, believed effectiveness was assisted by the pleasing fragrance, comforting touch and one on one communication during the application process: \"It is good, aromatherapy sme lls nice and people always love the nice things, so I think it's good for them. And when you do the aromatherapy you... like, comforting and touching them and then talking with them.\" Sanaya AIN Nurses who cared for residents in a palliative care setting b elieve d the essential oils were effective as they created a comfortable homely environment in the clinical setting that was important to both resident and their families. This is shown by the following comment: \"The oils calm the client and the visitors, it creates a really nice environment and it really feels like it's not a nursing home or it's not a hospital, it feels like home where actually 131 there is something meaningful to them. I had a feeling like that.\" Gabi RN Nurses reported essential oils promot ed relaxation and enhanced appetite in some residents, and this effect was observed in residents regardless of dementia diagnosis. This is demonstrated in the following nurse comments: \" ... it certainly created a more comfortable ambience whether we were using the Lavender based relaxing type things or the citrus type based appetite enhancers.\" Kaye RN \"I found it calming, even for the staff with their approach. Even with normal residents without dementia background sometimes they get agitated, restless or because of anxiety level... essential oil usually able to calm, you feel more comfortable in that environment, it feels good.\" Jess RN Seven n urses perceived essential oils would be beneficial in reducing agitation in some residents only. These nurses cons idered the effect to be dependent on a resident s pre- existing health condition or individual circumstance. Nurses considered that should essential oils reduce agitation in dementia, lower levels of medication might be prescribed. This is shown by their fol lowing comments: \"I don't think it will work for everyone but some people sure it will work.\" Sabrina RN \"Maybe people who don't have dementia will get benefits out of it because it will relax them.\" May AIN 132 \" ... if it is working on dementia patients that would really be a breakthrough and that would help in terms of managing their behaviour rather than medication.\" Jess RN A minority of two nurses were uncertain of the effect of essential oils on agitation, preferring to observe the clinical trial further before providing an opinion. This is demonstrated in Jess's comment: \"I want to see how effective it is. Actually I want to see whether its really working on dementia patients'.\" Jess RN Nurse's prev ious experience through individual or clinical use, in c onjunction with their perceptions of the essential oil's effectiveness have been explored in this section. Research on the effect of essential oils on agitation conducted in the RACF setting can provide nurses evidence for the use of oils as an agitation m anagement. Nurse perceptions of research in the RACF environment are discussed in the following section. 5.7 Area of interest 4 - Nurs e perceptions of research in RACF's This section presents the area of interest, nurse perceptions of research in RACFs as identified in the transcripts using content analysis. Nurse perceptions of research in RACFs are categorised into three categories importance of research , nurse compliance and recommendations for future research. Within these three categories are 11 subcateg ories. The first category importance of research has three subcategories older adults living in RACFs , dementia behaviours and barriers to research. The second category nurse compliance consists of five subcategories : supportive of research , demanding wor kload lack of belief fear of reprisal and lack of education. The final category recommendations for future research contains three subcategories education communication and researchers expectations. Table 1 8 presents the most frequent 133 reported nurse percept ions towards research in the R ACF environment under the fourth area of interest . Tabulated are the categories and subcategories from the frequency codes from the nurse transcripts. Area of interest Perceptions of research in RACF's Category Importance of research Nurse compliance Recommendations for future research Subcategories Older adults living in RACFs Dementia behaviours Barriers to research Supportive of research Demanding workload Lack of belief Fear of reprisal Lack of Education Education Communi cation Researchers expectations Table 18 Perceptions of research in the RACF's 5.7.1 Importance of Research An additional focus of the semi -structured interviews was the nurses understanding of the importance of r esearch in the RACF envi ronment . Nurses were asked how important they perceived researc h to be in RACFs. Ten n urses believe d that research in aged care facilities to establish an evidence base for care of residents was important and could assist understanding of the exper iences o f people living in RACFs. Four nurses did not believe enough research was being conducted into resident behaviours, specifically those common in the dementia trajectory. However two nurses identified barriers to the research process that required addressin g. Table 1 9 presents the responses to the importance of research in the RACF environm ent as reported by the nurses . Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=11) Older adults living in RACFs 10 91% Dementia behaviours 4 36% Barriers to research 2 18% Table 19 Importance of research Ten nurses perceived research for residents in RACFs could improve care and quality of life. Nurses believed that increased research could provide awareness of dementia issues in RACFs and give value to the older person's experiences. This is shown in the comments below: 134 \"I think it's a good benefit for research to see how dementia people are living in aged care, it's very important for some other people as they don't have an understanding.\" May AIN \"I thi nk it's pretty important... there is not enough research on older people being... valued by research teams.\" Sam RN Four n urses specifically identified research into behaviours to be an important area of research for the RACF setting. Nurses admitted difficult y in managing agitation and had concerns for the safety of residents, family or staff. Nurses described a need for additional effective strategies to manage agitation in the RACF setting, they hoped essential oils would provide an alternative management. I n addition nurses spoke of the detrimental effect agitation had on residents , being lack of sleep or appetite that often resulted in health deterioration and hospitalisation. This is shown by the following comments: \"I think it's quite important to do the research in the aged care... It's really getting hard to control their behaviours and then if we do the research and we can control their behaviours it will be beneficial for resident and everyone in aged care. I have seen a lot of residents because of thei r agitation, they don't eat, they don't sleep and that is how they get sick and end up in hospital.\" Sabrina RN \"It's very important because at the moment ... we are managing dementia behaviour by using distraction and by using other alternatives but if essen tial oil helps that will make a big difference.\" Jess RN 135 Two nurses identified barriers to research in RACFs including confidentiality, workload and resident or family non -compliance. Nurses considered many residents and their families to be in crisis duri ng the RACF placement, with the realisation that services or family members can no longer support the older person to live in the community. Some staff concluded that the additional burden of research participation may not be a priority for the resident or family during this time. This is shown below: \" It's essential and it's extremely difficult... the laws of confidentiality, access and having staff that are so flat chat trying to complete their daily tasks. To add any additional workload or even any change to their work process... its met with a lot of stonewalling.\" Kaye RN \"I don't know 50:50, probably the clients themselves, if they don't want to participate or don't understand and things like that. Probably the families too, if they don't want to be invol ved in this kind of thing, because it's extra isn't it , to what is already happening. Most of the families here, they come here, they have a kind of guilt as to why their family members are here, they are already in such an emotional trap. So researchers I think... there are some boundaries.\" Gabi RN 5.7.2 Nurse compliance Nurses were informed of staff non -compliance wit h research in previous studies and asked to identify underlying factors that may affect compliance. Five nurses stated they were supportive of nurs e participation in research. However nurses reported demanding workload ( n=5 ), lack of belief in intervention fear of managerial reprisal ( n=3 a lack of research education ( n=2 ) to influence nurse compliance with 136 research. Table 20 presents the subcategories identified as reasons influencing nurse compliance with research. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Supportive of research 5 50% Demanding workload 5 50% Lack of Belief 3 30% Fear of reprisal 3 30% Lack of education 2 20% Tabl e 20 Nurse compliance Five n urses were supportive of research regardless of their non -compliance to the protocol. Nurses concurred that if staff agreed to participate in a research study that they should endeavour to comply with tha t investigation process for the approved timeframe. Nurses considered compliance to research necessary to improve staff workload, quality of care and to provide best practice alternatives to manage current difficulties in the RACF environment. This is show n in the following comments: \"If something comes here that is going to benefit the residents and the staff, I don't think staff should have any problem cooperating with the interventions...\" Sanaya AIN \"I suppose if we do it in that time period I think all the nurses if they are participating, we should all be participating and compliant to that research for the sake of older people to get the best results of the research.\" Sam RN \"I would love to have research because I want to see what other alternative w e can do to improve the care for the patient.\" Jess RN Five n urses identified workload as the most frequent reason nurses may be non - compliant with research. Nurses described an increasing number of scheduled and unscheduled tasks that impact on their work day. These demands require prioritising to ensure they are all completed during a shift. Research tasks to be completed by the nurse 137 are additional demands to the already heavy work schedule that extend their work day. Nurses described that higher priorit y care demands could lower the priority of research tasks leading staff to forget their research commitments. This is shown in the following comments: \"Multiple demands from management down. We have constant demands on us and they are ever increasing so an y change to routine means it's going to take me longer to complete my day which means I won't get my work done \" Kaye RN \"... sometimes they might forget, sometimes they get really busy and they've got other stuff to do and they might not be compliant with t he intervention.\" Sam RN Three n urses identified that a lack of belief that a research intervention will benefit or improve the situation being investigated is a common reason for nurse non -compliance. Nurses reasoned if they believe the research will not be successful in improving the situation being investigated, the time and effort to comply with research is of low priority. This is shown in the following comments: \"Well it depends what kind of intervention it was and whether, I believe\" Sam RN \"Maybe th ey don't believe essential oils (are effective) .\" Jess RN \"Maybe they are thinking that it won't help first of all. Aromatherapy won't help the resident, maybe lack of time, lack of interest.\" Sabrina RN 138 Three n urses identified a fear of providing the rese archer with information that may not be acceptable to their supervisors as a reason for non -compliance. Some nurses believed their employment would be at risk if their responses showed limited knowledge or deviated from correct procedures. This is shown by the comments below: \"... some of them, they don't want to say anything and I think in my opinion because sometimes when you say research some people think maybe you are going to tell our manager. They are going to tell the big boss maybe I am going to lose my job. They are scared.\" Natasha AIN \" ... fear they are going to do the wrong thing they are going to make a mistake.\" May AIN Two n urses identified that a lack of staff education about the benefits and expected staff involvement of research could lead to non-compliance. Nurses reasoned if staff were not aware of their responsibilities in the research project they could not be expected to comply. Further, nurses described that education needs to be provided at different levels for managers, registered nurse s and personal care workers as they have differing levels of knowledge, responsibilities and expectations for their work day. This is shown in the comments below: \"... probably some of the staff, they're not aware of this so saying this we need to actually t alk to all of the other staff to make sure they are aware of this or what is happening so they can cooperate.\" Jasmine RN \"I think mostly if there is new research and there isn't education, no one will know. And starting from a staff or 139 carer , it is total ly different to being a manager or an RN because no perspective. We will look into things differently but I think you need education otherwise there will be a barrier, there will be a gap there and conflict, so education plays a role.\" Rosemarie RN 5.7.3 Nurses Recommendations for future research Nurses were asked how future research could be better implemented in the RACF environment. Nurse's recommendations for future research in RACFs included improved education ( n=7) and more effective communication between researcher and service provider ( n=5) . In addition nurses ( n=5) perceived researchers had limited understanding of the nurses demanding workload and limited time available for research collaboration. Table 21 presents the subcategories for nurse recommenda tions for future research in the RACF environment as reported by the nurses. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Education 7 70% Communication 5 50% Researcher's expectations 5 50% Table 21 Recommendation for future resear ch Seven n urses identified education as the most important recommendation for improvement when implementing new research in the RACF environment. Nurses believed education targeted at different levels of staff to outline the benefits that are relevant to e ach group could improve research commitment. The high prevalence of English as a second language amo ng nursing staff was also cited as reasons to why staff may need education. This is shown by their comments: \" ... it could be that probably they need to trai n the staff, they need to explain more of the research, like how the intervention was actually developed and things like that. They have to give a background to the staff.\" Gabi RN 140 \"I think that can only be done by encouraging or educating nurses because I think that nurses are the only ones that are in touch with their residents.\" Sam RN \"The staff that work on the floor, we shouldn't forget that they only have a limited qualification and they are only trained to do certain things, they need lots of educat ion... with most staff I have seen, with an overseas background , limited English this could be the problem as well, so I think they need more education\" Sanaya AIN Five n urses identified improved communication between the researcher and service provider as pivotal to research success in the RACF environment. Nurses considered a policy on disclosure of information to be shared between researcher and the nurse would assist in promoting transparent communication. This is shown in the following comment: \"I thin k very important is the communication between the resea rcher and the service provider. Disclosure of information and communication effectively in terms of how much the researcher... or how much the company is allowed to disclose to the researcher.\" Jess RN Five n urses identified the need to reduce the researcher's expectations of staff involvement in research, as adding work to an already demanding workload is often met with resistance from staff. Nurses considered it necessary for researchers to take ownersh ip of the workload created by their research by providing their own team to perform research related tasks. This is shown in the following comment: 141 \"The problem is it's an institution and it is an institution with a limited budget so we are all trying to e ek [gain] out of our budget the best that we can. So we say that this will be good for you and we will do research that will give you best care and no one disputes that. The problem is that unfortunately the only way to do that is to bring in the team that are going to do the research and make sure when it's ready to roll it is going to make the staff members day faster, more effective and meaningful for their residents.\" Kaye RN 5.8 Summary This chapter has reported the finding s from 11 semi -structured intervi ews with nurses. A content analysis obtained information relating to four areas of interest; Types of agitation, Agitation management, Perceptions of essential oils and Nurse perceptions of research in RACFs. The 12 categories and 36 subcategories supporti ng the four areas of interest were described. Subcategories were identified by content analysis coding and supported by nurse quotes from the Phase I interviews. Nurse s understood agitation to be physical or verbal behaviours that could be aggressive or n on-aggressive. Nurses identified behaviours of shouting, restlessness, wandering and repetitive behaviours to be agitation that they regularly managed in their facilities. Nurses understood behaviours to be distressing to the resident and disruptive to oth ers in the facility. Current agitation management included distraction, providing space, knowing the resident 's triggers or providing medications . Nurses explained that by identifying causative factors for the agitation, the behaviour could be more readil y resolved. However, impaired communication or comprehension associated with a dementia diagnosis hindered the nurse's ability to manage behaviour in this group. Nurses were 142 concerned by the escalating level of agitation on the ward and the limited effecti ve management strategies at their disposal. A majority of nurses believed in Lavender and Lemon Balm s ability to reduce agitation in the residents. A small percentage had worked with essential oils previously in the clinical setting. Several nurses were a lso using the oils for their own w ell-being. Some nurses, however did not believe the oils would be effective on all residents agitation, considering the agitation in dementia to be intractable in the conditions trajectory. Nurse s perceived research to be important for residents in the RACF. The nurses suggested that lack of compliance in research can stem from a lack of belief in the intervention or the nurses demanding workloads. They suggested nurse compliance to rese arch could be improved with pre trail education, and better communication between researcher and nurses , in addition to researcher's having realistic expectations of what can be achieved by the nurses in the RACF environment. The findings from Phase I nurse interviews informed the practicali ties of the RCT in Phase II of this study and the implementation of essential oils into the aged care environment. The additions to Phase II from the Phase I results are discussed in chapter 8 of this thesis. The results of Phase II RCT are presented in ch apter 6. 143 Chapter 6 Phase II Quantitative Results 6.1 Overview This chapter presents the results of the Phase II single blind RCT of the effectiveness of Lavender and Lemon Balm to reduce agitation in resident's people living in RACFs. As previously describe d in Chapter 4, resident data was collected using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Cohen -Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Quality of Life AD (QoL -AD). Planned analyses and post hoc analyses were conducted; the planned analyses was base d on previous research, which indicated that the two treatments would be effective in reducing agitation in elderly people with and without dementia. Significant effect is reported in the planned analysis for the NPI, CMAI and QoL -AD measures. The outcomes of the NPI and CMAI are reported in full followed by analyses of instrument specific behaviour categories. NPI categories reported are aggression/agitation, aberrant motor activity, anxiety, delusions, depression, irritability and sleep disturbance. The C MAI categories reported are physical aggressive behaviour, physical non -aggressive behaviour and verbal agitation. The QoL -AD total score is reported incorporating the categories of physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores, things for fun, money and life as whole. All results are reported for the per protocol (PP) analyses which is a standard analysis that includes only those resident s that completed all allocated treatment wit hin the study protocol guidelines (Shah, 2011). 6.2 Data Analysis This section reports the details results , including details of the four planned and post hoc analyses. Data were recorded for behaviour on the NPI, CMAI and for quality of life on the Qol -AD mea surement instruments. The measurement tools are validated for use in this population within the timeframes specified in this study (Cohen -Mansfield et al. 1989; Cummings et al. 1994; Tombaugh & McIntyre, 1992) . Data were collected before and after the thre e treatment periods, a total of six data collection occasions for each 144 resident . Each resident trialled each of the two essential oil treatments, being Lavender and Lemon Balm and the placebo therefore each resident acted as their own control. The treatmen t cycles consisted of a 14-day treatment period followed by a 14 -day washout period. Measurements were taken before treatment to obtain baseline and again after treatment to compare the effect in each of the three treatment periods. Data were collected on hard copy templates in conjunction with the regular carer. Once collected resident data were entered into an Excel spread sheet checked for accuracy and transferred to statistical software SPSS for analysis. The statistical software SPSS Version 23 condu cted an Intention to Treat ( ITT) and PP analyses for collected resident data in this study. An ITT standard analysis that compared treatments from the data of all resident s who were randomised and completed at least one observable treatment was conducted ( Shah, 2011) to provide a complete picture of resident results. Data from the 65 resident s who had completed at least one treatment cycle were analysed by statistical software SPSS Vers ion 23, the details of the ITT analysis can be found in Appendix K . Of the 65 resident s who completed at least one treatment period, only 49 completed all treatment periods within the study protocol guideline and were included in the PP analysis reported in this Chapter . Reasons for the withdrawal of the 16 resident s, includ ed changes in health status (6), refusal of treatment (2), discharge from the RACF (6) and unavailability of carers to report behaviours (2). 6.2.1 Participant Characteristics This section reports the characteristics of the 49 older adult participant s whose dat a was analysed in the PP analysis for this study. The resident s were permanent aged care residents recruited from six RACFs on two sites operated by the same aged care provider in the Sydney area. The resident s were aged 65 years or older at the time of re cruitment with the mean resident age being 89.31 (SD6.3) years . Forty (62.7%) were female and 145 15 (27.3%) were male. All resident s experienced agitated behaviour as documented on the Aged Care Funding Instrument [ACFI] behaviour domain. The ACFI is a govern ment funding instrument that is used to appraise the care needs of older people living in RACFS across the three domains of activity of daily living [ADL], behaviour [BEH] and complex health care [CHC]. Older people included in this study , were residents a t the facility with observable behaviours as recorded in the BEH domain categories of wandering, verbal behaviours or physical agitations (Department of Social Services, 2007). Resident behaviours were routinely observable to the nurse three or more times during their regular working week. Resident's in this trial were assigned to either the dementia or without dementia based on dementia diagnosis and cognitive level as determined by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MMSE, is a 30 -point measurem ent scale commonly used to screen for cognitive decline that was used in this study to evaluate cognitive status in resident s (Fu, 2009; Tombaugh & McIntyre, 1992). Forty two residents in this study had been diagnosed with dementia and an MMSE score of 10 to 18 was documented for 39 residents indicat ing moderate cognitive decline and a further three residents scored 19 to 23 indicating a mild cognitive decline. The thirteen residents included in the without d ementia group scored 24 to 30 on the MMSE measure ment scale indicating no cognitive decline. A diagnosis of depression was also indicated for 28 residents , both with dementia (n=21) and without dementia (n=7). Anxiety was documented as a symptom in nursing notes for 18 residents , both with dementia (n=10) and without dementia (n=8), however only 10 of these residents were medically diagnosed. All participat ing residents experienced agitated behaviour with 19 residents taking antipsychotic medications either regularly or as needed to manage behaviour. Anti psychotic medication changes in all residents were monitored throughout the study. The characteristics for the 49 residents whose 146 data was analysed in this study are tabulated in Table 22 Phase II resident characteristics.

Seventy -five residents having met all of the inclusion criteria were randomised to a treatment sequence and allocated to either the dementia (n= 56) or without dementia (n=19) group according to MMSE score. Ten residen ts with dementia (n=6) and without dementia (n=4) allocated withdrew before completing the first treatment period and prior to data collection. Due to limited exposure, post -treatment data for baseline comparison was unable to be collected and these reside nts were removed from the analysis. Reasons for withdrawal in the initial treatment period include refusal ( n=7) hospitalisation ( n=2) and discharge ( n=1). Five residents with dementia were recruited and consented by family members, refused participation i n the 147 first treatment period. Of the two residents with without dementia who withdrew in the first treatment period , one was concerned with their behaviour being monitored and data collected , the other resident did not provide a reason. The 65 resident 's that completed the first treatment cycle were analysed using statistical software SPSS version 23 to report the ITT (Appendix K ). Of the 65 resident s who completed one treatment period, a further ten residents withdrew from the trial prior to completing al l treatment periods; six residents discharged through death or relocation, two residents refused treatment, one was hospitalised and one resident was withdrawn by staff due to a suspected respiratory infection. All ten residents partial data were removed f rom the PP analysis. A further six residents were withdrawn from the PP analysis as they had not adhered to key aspects of the study protocol. Reasons for the withdrawal of the six residents included changes to medication ( n=1), unavailability of carer to monitor behaviours ( n=2), violation of inclusion criteria, Parkinson Disease ( n=1), knowledge of a life -limiting condition ( n=1) and palliation in the last treatment period ( n=1). A Consort flow diagram of resident numbers is shown in Figure 2. 148 Figure 2 Consort flow diagram 6.2.2 Analysis for CMAI, NPI and QoL -AD Planned analyses based on previous literature is presented with orthogonal contrasts that compared treatments against placebo and then treatm ents to each other across both the with and without dementia groups. The planned analyses measured the change in NPI, CMAI and QoL -AD score between baseline and treatment evaluation. Planned analyses are reported for the total score and specified behaviour al categories for each measurement tool. The planned analyses were designed to provide evidenced answers to the research questions: (1) What is the effectiveness of Lavender compared to Lemon Assessed for eligibility (n= 8 7) Excluded ( n=1 2) Inclusion criteria not met ITT Analysis (n= 1 5) PP Analysis (n=10) Removed from PP analysis (n= 5 ) Discontinued intervention (2) Change in medication (1) Instability in carer reporting (2) Participant data for follow up (n=15) Discontinued intervention ( n=2) Discharged (2) Allocated to without dementia group (n= 19) Completed treatment 1 (n=15 ) Did not complete treatment 1 (n= 4 ) Refusal (2) Hospitalisation (1) Discharge (1) Participant data for follow up (n=50) Discontinued intervention (n= 8) Unwell removed by staff ( 1), Hospitalisation (1) Discharged ( 4) Refusal (2) Allocated to with dementia group (n= 56) Completed treatment 1 (n= 50) Did not complete Treatment 1 (n=6) Refusal ( 4) Hospitalisation (1) Relocation (1) ITT Analysis (n= 50) PP Analysis (n=39) Removed from PP analysis ( n=11) Discontinued intervention (8) Acute health crisis (1) Palliation (1) Parkinson Disease (1) Allocation Ana lysis Follow -Up Randomis ed (n= 7 5) 1.1 Enrolment 149 Balm and a placebo for the management of agitation in residents of RACF with and without dementia (2) What are the differences between Lavender compared to Lemon Balm and a placebo for the management of agitation in residents of RACF with and without a dementia diagnosis . The four planned analyses considered necessary to answer the research questions were: The first planned analysis reported the change in measurement tool score between baseline and follow up for the with dementia group compared to the without d ementia group independent of essential oil treatment. A second planned analysis reported the change in measurement tool score between baseline and follow up when Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils are compared to placebo. A third planned analysis compared the change in measurement tool score between baseline and follow up in residents treated with Lavender to resident s treated with Lemon Balm independent of cognitive status. The fourth planned analysis evaluated the change in measurement tool score between baseline and follow up of Lavender and Lemon Balm on the with and without d ementia groups. 6.2.3 Post hoc Analyses for CMAI, NPI and QoL -AD An unexpected result from planned analyses necessitated a focused post hoc analysis that separated essential oils and resident groups to determine cause of effect. The post hoc analyses are detailed below. A first post hoc analysis reported the findings for Lavender when compared to Placebo and Lemon Balm with a supplementary analysis comparing Placebo to Lemon Balm . This analysis was designed to deter mine the effect of Lavender essential oil on agitation or quality of life. 150 A second post hoc analysis reported the findings for Lemon Balm when compared to Placebo and Lavender with a supplementary analysis comparing Placebo to Lavender.

The change in NPI sleep disturbance score between baseline and follow -up for residents receiving Lemon Balm in the without dementia group was 0.00 compared to the dementia group of -0.28 where as residents in the dementia group receiving Lavender scored -0.66 compared to the score for the without dementia group of -0.30. There was no statistically significance differe nce between the groups P=0. 94 173 DF44.81 F(1, 0. 01) Fc=4.0 6. The change in NPI sleep disturbance was similar for resident s in the Lavender or intervention indicating that the essential oils had no significant effect on the cognitive status on NPI sleep distur bance. 6.4 Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI] This section reports the findings of the observable agitation behaviours measured on the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory ( CMAI ). Behaviours were observed and recorded by nursing staff in conjunction wi th the researcher on the CMAI measurement tool. Data were collected before and after the three treatment periods, with a total of six data collections were attended for each resident . As described in Chapter 4 Methods , the CMAI monitors twenty -nine behavio urs, frequency is recorded numerically with a 1 score being never to a 5 score representing several times within the hour . Data were entered into statistical software SPSS version 23 for analyses using Analysis of Variance [ANOVA] for planned analyses and T-test for post hoc analysis. Statistically significant findings include an opposite effect of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils in resident s with without dementia when compared to resident s with dementia on CMAI total score. There was also a signifi cant difference for PNAB score in the treatment groups when compared to placebo. A post hoc analysis of effect in dementia and without dementia groups follows the planned analysis of statistically significant findings. Reported is the CMAI total score and the three CMAI behaviour categories of physical aggressive behaviour, physical non - aggressive behaviour and verbal agitation. 6.4.1 CMAI Total Score This section presents the four planned analyses and relevant post hoc analyses for the CMAI total score. As descr ibed in Chapter 4 Methods, the CMAI total score reports the combined score tally for the three CMAI categories of physical aggressive behaviour, physical non -aggressive behaviour and verbal agitation. The CMAI total score reports frequency of agitated beha viours in older adults. 174 CMAI Total Score Planned Analysis 1 The CMAI total score analysis confirmed no significant change between baseline and follow -up in dementia (-6.03) compared to the without dementia (-8.5) group P=0. 45 DF46.99 F(1,0. 57), Fc=4.0 5. This result indicates no significant difference in CMAI agitation between the dementia and without dementia groups . Findings indicate CMAI total score to be similar for the with and without dementia resident groups in this study independent of essential oi l treatment. CMAI Total Score Planned Analysis 2 The analysis reported no significant change in CMAI total score between baseline and follow -up when residents received placebo (-3.79 ) compared ) Fc=4.0 5. The finding indicates that the essential oils did not improve CMAI total score in residents independent of cognitive status in this study. CMAI Total Score Planned Analysis 3 Analysis confirmed no significant change in CMAI total score between baseline and follow -up when residents received Lavender (-3.62) compared to Lemon Balm (-7.12 ) treatment (P=0. 23 F(1, 1.48 ) Fc=4.0 5). The change in CMAI total score was similar for residents receiving Lavender when compared to Lemon Balm . This result indicates tha t the essential oil treatments had a comparable effect on CMAI total score independent of cognitive status in this study. CMAI Total Score Planned Analysis 4 There was a statistically significant change in CMAI total score between baseline and follow -up in the Lavender and Lemon Balm interventions see Figure 7. Within the analysis the CMAI total score between baseline and follow -up for resident s receiving Lemon Balm in the without dementia group was -5.5 compared to its effect in the dementia group of -1.62, where as residents receiving Lavender in the dementia group scored -2.82 compared to the without dementia group that scored -0.8 (P=0.05 DF 46.72 175 F(1,4. 19) Fc=4.0 5). This result suggests that Lemon Balm may affect CMAI behaviours differently in resident s with dementia compared to those who do not have dementia . Figure 7 Effect of Lavender when compared to Lemon Balm in the cognitive groups on CMAI Total Score CMAI Total Score Post hoc analyses A focused post hoc analysis was undertaken to separate essen tial oils and resident groups to determine the cause of the significant effect in planned analysis 4between baseline and treatment effect of Lavender and Lemon Balm in the dementia and without dementia groups. Analysis confirmed no significant effect in a post hoc analysis by Lemon Balm when compared to Lavender and placebo in the without dementia groups. Within the planned analysis 4 change in CMAI total score between baseline and follow up in Lemon Balm was -5.5, for Lavender -0.8 and placebo -2.2. A sta tistical analysis reported no significant effect for Lemon Balm when compared to Lavender and placebo P=0.08 DF29 T(1,3.32) Tc=2.05. No significant effect was found in the difference between Lavender and placebo groups P=0.78 DF29 T(1,0.08) Tc=2.05. In thi s study neither Lemon Balm or Lavender were more effective that the placebo on CMAI behaviours in people with without dementia . -6-5-4-3-2-10 Lemon Balm LavenderChange in CMAI score between baseline and essential oil end of treatment Essential oil treatmentsEffect of Lavender when compared to Lemon Balm in the cognitive groups No Dementia Dementia176 There was no significant effect in a post hoc analysis for Lavender (-2.97) compared to Lemon Balm (-1.64) and placebo (-1.72) in the dementia groups P=0.14 DF(1,125) F=2.02 . There was also no significant effect between Lemon Balm and placebo groups P=0.94 DF(1,125) T(1,0.01) Tc=1.98. Demonstrating that in this study, neither Lemon Balm or Lavender were more effective that the plac ebo on CMAI behaviours in people with dementia . 6.4.2 CMAI Physical Aggressive Behaviours This section presents the four planned analysis for the CMAI physical aggressive behaviour category. Physical aggressive behaviours were recorded if the older person was ob served hitting, kicking, pushing, scratching, tearing things, or grabbing, biting and spitting. The CMAI measure tallied frequency of aggressive behaviours in older adults. CMAI Physical Aggressive Behaviours Planned Analysis 1 The CMAI physical aggressi ve behaviour analysis confirmed no significant change between baseline and follow up in dementia (-1.86) compared to the without dementia (-1.80) group P= 0.93 DF46.80 F(1, 0.0 1) Fc= 4.0 5. This indicates no significant difference in physically aggres sive behaviours between the dementia and without dementia groups independent. Findings indicate CMAI physical aggressive behaviour score to be similar for the with and without dementia resident groups in this study independent of essential oil treatment. CMAI Physical Aggressive Behaviours Planned Analysis 2 The analysis reported no significant change in CMAI physical aggressive behaviour score between baseline and follow up when residents received placebo (-0.48) compared to treatment (-1.59), P=0.2 6 DF47.03 F(1, 1. 29) Fc=4.0 5. The finding indicates that the essential oils did not improve CMAI in residents independent of cognitive status in this study. CMAI Physical Aggressive Behaviours Planned Analysis 3 177 Analysis confirmed no significant change in CMAI physical aggressive behaviour score between baseline and follow up when residents received Lavender (-1.67) compared with Lemon Balm (-1.51) treatment P=0. 86 DF46.32 F(1,0. 03) Fc=4.0 5. The change in CMAI physical aggressive behaviour score was similar for resident s in the Lavender and Lemon Balm . This result indicates that the essential oil treatments were comparable in effect on CMAI physical aggressive behaviours independent of co gnitive decline in this study. CMAI Physical Aggressive Behaviours Planned Analysis 4 Analysis confirmed no significant change in CMAI physical aggressive behaviour score between baseline and follow up in the Lavender and Lemon Balm interventions . Within the analysis the change in CMAI physical aggressive behaviour score between baseline and follow up for resident s that experienced Lemon Balm in the without dementia group is -1.0 relative to its effect in the dementia group -0.51, where as Lavender in the dementia group scored -0.77 relative to the without dementia group -0.90, confirming the groups did not significantly differ in the CMAI physical aggressive behaviour score between baseline and follow up P =0.70 DF46.83 F(1, 0. 15) Fc=4.0 5. 6.4.3 CMAI Physical Non -Aggressive Behaviour This section presents the four planned analysis for the CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour category. Physical non -aggressive behaviours were recorded if the older person was observed pacing, inappropriately robing or disrobing, wandering, handling things inappropriately, general restlessness or repetiti ous mannerisms. The CMAI measure tallied frequency of physical non -aggressive behaviour in older adults. CMAI Physical Non -aggressive Behaviour Planned Analysis 1 The CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour analysis confirmed no significant change between baseline and follow up in dementia (-1.59) compared to the without dementia 178 (-0.80) group P=0. 61 DF47 F(1, 0.37) Fc=4.0 5. This result indicates no significant difference in physical non aggressive behaviours between the dementia and without dementia groups . Indicating CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour score to be similar for the with and without dementia resident groups in this study independent of essential oil treatment. CMAI Physical Non -aggressive Behaviour Planned Analysis 2 There was a significa nt difference in the CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour score between baseline and follow up in the placebo (0.3 7) and treatment (-1.38) groups P=0.0 2 DF47 F(1, 6.38 ) Fc=4. 5 see Figure 8. This result indicates that essential oils have a significant red uction on CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour for people with and without dementia . Figure 8 Effect of essential oils compared to placebo for CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour (PNAB) CMAI Physical Non -aggressive Behaviour Planned Analysis 3 Analysis confirmed no significant difference in CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour score s between baseline and follow up when residents received Lavender (-0.96) compared with Lemon Balm (-1.8) treatment (P=0. 44 DF47 F(1,0. 61) Fc=4.0 5). The change in CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviours was similar for residents receiving Lavender when compared to Lemon Balm . This result indicates that the essential oil -1.5-1-0.500.5 Placebo Treatment (LB & Lav)Change in CMAI PNAB score between baseline and essential oil end of treatment Phase II TreatmentEffect of essential Oil compared to placebo for physical non - aggressive behaviour (PNAB) CMAI Physical Non- Aggressive Behaviour (PNAB)179 treatments were comparable in effect on CMAI physical non -aggressive agitation independent of cogniti ve status in this study. CMAI Physical Non -aggressive Behaviour Planned Analysis 4 Statistical analysis of the data set confirmed a statistically significant difference in CMAI physical non aggressive behaviour score between baseline treatment evaluation , between the Lemon Balm treatment effects in the dementia group compared to the without dementia group see Figure 9. CMAI PNAB score between baseline and follow up was reduced in residents without dementia who received Lemon Balm treatment -1.7 relative t o the dementia group -0.10, where as Lavender decreased NPI irritability score between baseline and follow up in the dementia group -1.26 compared to the without dementia group 0.03. Statistical analysis of the NPI irritability score confirmed a significan t interaction between the groups P=0.02 DF37.56 F(1, 5.65) Fc=4.11. This result indicates that the essential oil treatments may effect irritability differently in residents without dementia when compared to residents with dementia. Figure 9 Effect of La vender when compared to Lemon Balm in cognitive groups on the CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour score 6.4.3.1 CMAI Physical Non -aggressive Behaviour Score Post hoc analysis A focused post hoc analysis was undertaken to separate essential oils and resident groups to determine the cause of the significant effect in planned analysis 4.

A statistically significant effec t for Lavender was confirmed in the post hoc analysis when compared to Lemon Balm and placebo in the dementia groups see figure 10. Within the planned analysis 4, change in CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour between baseline and follow up in Lavender w as -1.26, Lemon Balm was -0.1 and placebo -0.23. A statistically significant effect was reported when Lavender was compared to Lemon Balm and placebo P=0.04, DF114 (1, 4.49) Tc= 1.98 . No significant effect was found in the difference between Lemon Balm and placebo P=1.0 DF114 (1,0.00) Tc= 1.98 . This finding indicates that residents with dementia experienced less PNAB when Lavender treatment was administered compared to Lemon Balm , Lavender may reduce PNAB in residents with Dementia. Figure 10 Post hoc anal ysis treatment effect for CMAI Physical non -aggressive behaviour in residents with Dementia A statistically significant effect for Lemon Balm was confirmed in the post hoc analysis when compared to Lavender and placebo in residents without dementia see fig ure 11. Within the planned analysis 4, change in CMAI physical aggressive behaviour between baseline and follow up in Lemon Balm was -1.7, Lavender 0.3 and placebo 0.6.

No significant effect was found in the difference between Lemon Balm and placebo P=0.77 DF27 (1,0.29) Tc= 2.05 . This finding indicates that residents without dementia experienced less physical non -aggressive behaviour when Lemon Balm treatment was administered compared to Lavender, Lemon Balm may reduce physical aggressive behaviour in residents without Dementia. Figure 11 Post hoc analysis treatment effect for CMAI Physical non -aggressive behaviour score in residents without Dementia 6.4.4 CMAI Verbal Agitation This section presents the four planned analysis for the CMAI verbal agitation behaviour category. Verbal agitation was recorded as present if the older person was constantly complaining, cursing, requesting a ttention, verbalising negativity, repetitious questions or screaming. The CMAI measure tallied frequency of verbal agitation in older adults. CMAI Verbal Agitation Planned Analysis 1 The CMAI verbal agitation analysis confirmed no significant change between baseline and follow up in dementia (-3.34) compared to the without dementia (-4.87) groups -2-1.5-1-0.500.51 Lemon Balm Placebo LavenderChange inCMAI score between baseline and essential oil end of treatment Phase II treatmentsTreatment effect for CMAI physical non -aggressive behaviour score in residents without Dementia No Dementia182 P=0. 52 DF47 F(1, 0.42) Fc=4.0 5. This result reports no significant difference in verbal agitation between the dementia and without dementia groups . Findings in dicate CMAI verbal agitation score to be similar for the with and without dementia resident groups in this study independent of essential oil treatment. CMAI Verbal Agitation Planned Analysis 2 The analysis reported no significant change in CMAI verbal agitation score between baseline and follow up when residents received placebo (-1.46) compared to ) Fc=4.0 5. The finding indicates that the essential oils did not improve CMAI verbal agitation for residents independe nt of cognitive status in this study. CMAI Verbal Agitation Planned Analysis 3 Analysis confirmed no significant difference in CMAI verbal agitation score s between baseline and follow up when residents received Lavender (-2.6) compared to Lemon Balm (-4.04) treatment P=0. 22 DF47 F(1, 0.05 ) Fc=4.0 5. The change in CMAI verbal agitation score was similar for resident s receiving Lavender when compared to Lemon Balm . This result indicates that the essential oil treatments were comparable in effect on CMAI verbal agitation independent of cognitive status in this study. CMAI Verbal Agitation Planned Analysis 4 Analysis confirmed no significant change in CMAI verbal agitation score between baseline and follow up in the Lavender and Lemon Balm interventions . Within the analysis the change in CMAI verbal agitation score between baseline and follow up for resident s that experienced Lemon Balm in the without dementia group is -2.8 compared to its effect in the dementia group -1.24, where as Lavender in the dementia grou p scored -1.80 compared to the without dementia group -0.8. The statistical analysis of the dataset confirmed the groups did not significantly differ in the CMAI verbal agitation score 183 between baseline and follow up P =0.07 DF4 7 F(1, 3.42 ) Fc=4.0 5. The chang e in CMAI verbal agitation score was similar for resident s receiving both essential oils indicating no significant effect regardless of cognitive status. 6.5 Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease [QoL -AD] This section reports the findings of resident quality o f life as measured on the QoL -AD. Data collected was entered into statistical software SPSS Version 23 for analyses using Analysis of Variance [ANOVA] for planned analyses and T -test for post hoc analyses. There was a statistically significant difference in QoL -AD score between the dementia and without dementia groups independent of essential oil treatment ,which is not an unexpected finding when comparing people with dementia to those who do not. A post hoc analysis of effect in dementia and without demen tia follows the planned analysis of statistically significant findings. Reported are the QoL -AD measures for quality of life in older adults participating in this study. QoL -AD Planned Analysis 1 Analysis confirmed a significant change in the QOL -AD qual ity of life score between baseline and follow up in the dementia compared to the without dementia group see Figure 12. The analysis, QoL -AD score change between baseline and follow up for the dementia group was 2.02 compared to -5.80 in the without dementi a group. Statistical analysis of the data set confirmed there was a significant difference in QoL -AD quality of life score between the dementia and without dementia groups P=0.03 DF34.23 F(1, 5.07) Fc=4.13. The result indicates that QoL differs significant ly for those with dementia and those without independent of intervention effect. Results indicate that residents who have agi tation without a dementia diagnosis living in RACFs ha ve a lower QoL than people with dementia who experience agitation . 184 Figure 12 Quality of life for residents with and without Dementia independent of essential oil treatment QoL-AD Post hoc Analysis A focused post hoc analysis was undertaken to separate essential oils and resident groups to determine the cause of the significant effect in planned analysis 1. The planned analysis 1 evaluated change between baseline and follow up effect for quality of life in the dementia group compared to the without dementia group independent of essential oil treatment. A statistical analysis conf irmed no significant effect in a post hoc analysis by Lavender (2.59) when compared to Lemon Balm (0.44) and placebo (-0.66) in the dementia group (P=0.07 DF(1,77) T(1,3.37) Tc=1.99) . Likewise, no significant effect was reported in the difference between t he Lemon Balm and Placebo groups P=0.47 DF77 T(1,0.53) Tc=1.99. This result suggests that neither Lavender or Lemon Balm improved QoL -AD score in residents without dementia. Analysis confirmed no significant effect in a post hoc analysis by Lavender (-3.80) when compared to Lemon Balm (-1.0) and placebo (-1.0) in the without dementia group (P=0.18 DF25 T(1,1.92) Tc=2.06.) . There was also no significant effect between Lemon Balm and Placebo groups P=1.0 DF25 T(1,0.00) Tc= 2.06. This result suggests that -8-6-4-2024 Dementia No DementiaChange in QoL -AD score between baseline and end of treatment Participant cognitive groupsQuality of Life for residents with Dementia compare to without Dementia independent of essential oil treatment Quality of Life185 neither Lavender of Lemon Balm improves QoL -AD score in people with without dementia . QoL -AD Planned Analysis 2 Analysis confirmed no significant change in QoL -AD quality of life score between baseline and follow up when residents recei ved placebo (-1.67 ) Fc=4.11 . The finding indicates that the essential oils did not improve quality of life for residents independent of cognitive status in this study. QoL -AD Planned Analysis 3 Analysis confirmed no signi ficant change in QoL -AD quality of life score between baseline and follow up in the Lavender (-1.5) and Lemon Balm (-0.56) groups (P=0.83 DF37.04 F(1,0.05) Fc= 4.11 ), indicating oils had no significant effect on QoL -AD quality of life regard less of cognitive status. QoL -AD Planned Analysis 4 Analysis confirmed no significant change in QoL -AD quality of life score between baseline and follow up in the Lavender and Lemon Balm interventions . Within the analysis the change in QoL -AD quality of l ife score between baseline and follow up for resident s that experienced Lemon Balm in the without dementia group is -1.0 compared to its effect in the dementia group 0.44, where as Lavender in the dementia group scored 2.25 compared to the without dementia group -3.80. The statistical analysis of the dataset confirmed the groups did not significantly differ in the QoL -AD quality of life score between baseline and follow up P=0.15 DF37 F(1,2.16) Fc=4.11 ., indicating essential oils did not improve QoL -AD qual ity of life for residents included in this study . 186 6.6 Summary This chapter has presented the results of Phase II of this mixed methods study, a single - blind RCT comparing the effectiveness of Lemon Balm and Lavender to reduce agitation. The characteristics of the 49 residents have been described, and results of the trial of Lemon Balm and Lavender essential oils presented., The four planned analyses have been reported for the measurements NPI and CMAI as total score and for associated behaviour categories. The quality of life results as reported on the QoL -AD have also been presented in this section. The data demonstrated that neither Lavender nor Lemon Balm reduced total agitated behaviour regardless of cognitive decline when compared directly to placebo in thi s study. Significant findings have been reported for opposing the effect of Lavender and Lemon Balm interventions between the with and without dementia groups on the NPI and CMAI total score and the domains of NPI irritability and CMAI . A post hoc analys is indicated Lemon Balm to be significantly more effective in reducing NPI total score compared to placebo and Lavender in the without dementia groups. This result indicates that Lemon Balm may reduce agitation in residents without dementia. This chapter has reported that Lavender and Lemon Balm interventions to significantly reduce physical non -aggressive behaviour independent of cognitive decline when compared to placebo independent of cognitive groups. A post hoc reported Lemon Balm to be significantl y more effective in reducing CMAI score compared to Lavender and placebo in the without dementia groups. This result indicates Lemon Balm may reduce physical non -aggressive behaviour in residents without dementia. A posthoc analysis confirmed Lavender sig nificant decrease in CMAI physical non - aggressive behaviour when compared to Lemon Balm and p lacebo, with no difference 187 indicated between placebo and Lavender. This result indicates that Lavender may reduce physical non -aggressive behaviours in residents w ith dementia. Further, a post hoc analysis has demonstrated Lemon Balm to be significantly less effective in reducing NPI irritability when compared to placebo and Lavender in residents with dementia . This result indicates that Lemon Balm decreases irrita bility in residents with dementia less than placebo or Lavender. A final significant difference between with and without dementia groups was reported for Quality of Life. Results indicate that residents without dementia experience a lower quality of life in comparison to residents with dementia independent of essential oil treatment. The results presented in this chapter will be further explored in conjunction with the qualitative findings from Chapter 5 and 7, in Chapter 8 Discussion of this thesis. 188 Cha pter 7 Phase III Qualitative Findings 7.1 Overview This chapter reports the findings from semi -structured interviews with 10 nurse s conducted following their participation in the RCT reported in Chapter 6. These interviews sort nurses perceptions of: (1) Frequency of agitation on the ward ; (2) The effectiveness of essential oils as agitation management in older adults ; (3) Nurse 's perception and use of essential oils for health conditions , and (4) Factors influencing the conduct of research in the RACF environ ment. The findings are reported as areas of interest identified from the analysis accompanied by the frequency of occurrence and percentage of data coverage. Areas of interest evidenced by the nurse interview responses were change in frequency of agitation ; effectiveness of essential oils for agitation ; nurse use of essential oils , and influencing factors that s upp ort research. All areas of interest are s upp orted by response categories and subcategories with quotes from the nurse interviews. 7.2 Data Collectio n and Analysis Data were collected through individual interviews and analysed using the content analysis process detailed in Chapter 4 of this thesis. The processes of data collection and analysis in cluding the interviewing process, transcription of data, verification of transcripts , coding content and frequency analysis are duplicated from Chapter 5 . A detailed table of evidence for the data analysis process is reported in table 4 of this thesis. 7.2.1 Participant Characteristics Ten nurses who had previously pa rticipated in Phase I interviews and Phase II RCT of this study were interviewed to obtain information about whether their perception of essential oils had changed having experienced a research project in their clinical area. This information add s a furthe r dimension to the quantitative results of the RCT. One nurse (Rosemarie ) from the original 11 nurses who participated in the interviews in 189 Phase I left the organisation during the RCT and did not participate in the Phase III interviews. All 10 nurses in P hase III were assigned the same pseudonyms as in Chapter 5 Phase I including Abbie, Gabi, Jasmine, Jess, Kaye, May, Natasha, Sabina, Sam and Sanaya. Full details of pseudonyms and nurse characteristics are presented under pseudonyms in Chapter 5. 7.3 Summary o f areas of interest The four areas of interest identified from the Phase III post -trial nurse responses are described in this section. Nurse responses are classified into categories and subcategories under each area of interest . These areas of interest and categories are outlined below: Area of interest 1: Change in frequency of agitation No change in agitation frequency Reduction in frequency of agitation Areas of interest 2: Effectiveness of essential oils for agitation Essential oils as an agitation m anagement Effect of essential oils on older people Importance of essential oil research Area of interest 3 : Nurse use of essential oils Essential oils for health conditions Motivators for using essential oils Area of interest 4: Influencing factors tha t support research Researcher's conduct of research Staff attitude towards research 7.4 Area of interest 1 - Change in frequency of agitation This section provides evidence for the two categories describing a change in frequency of agitation as identified in the transcripts using content analysis. These findings include no change in agitation frequency and reduction in the frequency of agitation. The two categories include three subcategories of frequency unchanged , all residents and some 190 residents . Table 27 presents in categories and subcategories the most frequent ly reported differences in agitation identified by the nurses . Area of interest Change in frequency of agitation Category No change in agitation frequency Reduction in frequency of agitation Subcat egory Frequency unchanged All resident s Some resident s Table 27 Change in frequency of agitation Nurses were asked if they had observed any changes in the frequency of agitation in residents during the essential oil RCT. Nurses wer e divided in opinion with five nurses reporting no change and four nurses describing a reduction in the frequency of agitation on the ward. A further four nurses believed reduction in frequency of agitation to be observed in some residents only. Table 28 illustrates the common responses to changes in the frequency of agitation on the ward as reported by the nurses. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Frequency unchanged 5 50% All resident s 4 40% Some resident s 1 10% Table 28 Change in frequency of agitation on the ward 7.4.1 No change in agitation frequency Responses to changes in the frequency of agitation were based on nurse perceptions of increases and decreases in overall agitation on the ward. Four nurses reported frequency of agitation to be unchanged on their wards during the trial; their comments are documented below: \"We have noticed no changes in agitation frequency. \" Kaye RN \"Have I seen any difference? No, not really.\" May AIN 7.4.2 Reduction in frequency of agitation The four nurses who reported a change had observed a reduction in the frequency of agitation on their ward during the trial as shown below: 191 \"I have noticed with a few residents I have seen some changes.\" Sabrina RN \" Mrs Y is still the same wandering around the same as before. She is hard to shower, but for a couple of weeks there she was compliant. \" May AIN The four nurses who reported a reduction in the frequency of agitation on the ward also perceived the frequency to be reduced in some residents only while frequency of agitation remained the same in others. Nurses also acknowledged that they were unaware of whether a resident was having active essential oil treatment or placebo at the time of their observations. This is shown in the following comment s: \"I am pretty sure I've seen some positive changes among the resident s but for some of the residents I don't think there is much change. Then I don't know whether they were having the real medication or the placebo medication.\" Sam RN This section has provid ed nurse responses to changes of frequency observed in their facility during the phase II RCT. Nurses were divided in opinion , some nurses observing no change other claiming a reduction in agitated behaviour. The following section presents the nurse percep tions of how effective Lavender or Lemon Balm were in managing resident agitation. 7.5 Area of interest 2 - Effectiveness of Essential Oils for Agitation This section provides evidence for the three categories describing the effectiveness of essential oils on agitation as identified in the transcripts using content analysis. Three categories were identified under this theme: essential oils as an agitation management , effect of essential oils on older people , and the importance of essential oil research . These 192 three categories are divided into five subcategories : effective ; not effective ; older person inclusive ; older person specific ; and reducing agitation in RACFs . Table 29 presents the most frequent reported nurse responses for Area of interest 2 the effectiv eness of essential oils for agitation. Tabulated are the categories and subcategories from the frequency codes taken from the nurse transcripts. Area of interest Effectiveness of Essential oils for agitation Category Essential oils as an agitation managem ent Effect of essential oils on older people Importance of essential oil research Subcategory Effective Not effective Older person inclusive Older person specific Reduced agitation in RACFs Table 29 Post trial nurse perceptio n of effectiveness of essential oils for agitation 7.5.1 Essential oils as agitation management Nurses were asked post RCT for their perception s of the effects of essential oils for managing agitation in older people. Nine Nurses agreed that Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils were successful in managing agitation in older people , and one nurse did not observe any change. Table 30 presents the most common responses of nurse perceptions of essential oils effectiveness in older people post -RCT as reported by the nurses. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Effective 9 90% Not Effective 1 10% Table 30 Effectiveness of essential oils for agitation management in older adults The nine nurses who agreed that essential oils were effective in reducing agitation in residents disagreed as to whether this reducing effect extended to every resident or every agitated behaviour. Nurses described the oils as having a relaxing effect with reductions of agitated behaviours and anxiety in some older people . This is demonstrated in the following comments: \"As far as Mrs X, I think it made a small amount of difference... her anxiety levels did decrease.\" May AIN 193 \"I was there most of the time, before and after, I could see a bit of difference in some of th e residents... Because that smell can sooth them down and comfort them.\" Sam RN Another nurse described a lack of observable change in behaviour s when the older people were trialling the oils. This left her with the belief that the oils were not effective in reducing agitation. This is demonstrated by the following comment: \"I can't really see any effectiveness because the behaviour is still the same as before without this or with this aromatherapy oil.\" Jasmine RN 7.5.2 Effect of essential oils on older people Of the nine nurses who reported that the essential oils did effectively reduce agitation in older people , five nurses reported that the oils appeared to reduce agitation in some residents only while four nurses credited the oils as being effective in reduc ing agitation in all residents trialled. Table 31 presents the most common responses of nurse perceptions of essential oils effectiveness in the older people that participated in the RCT. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Older person specific effe ct 5 50% Older person inclusive effect 4 40% Table 31 Effectiveness of essential oils on agitation in resident RCT participants Of the nurses interviewed , five considered oils to be effective in some older people. Nurses considere d that essential oils were more effective on certain individuals, and appeared to reduce some agitation behaviour more effectively . Their comments are illustrated below: \"There has been a change for some but for some they are still the same. \" Natasha AIN 194 \"I have seen some changes like with Mrs Y her agitation has reduced and also in Mrs Y she is also much better. So I think there is an effect but that effect depends on the individual person.\" Sabrina RN \"Yeah I think it is working. Last week I noticed Mrs Z more settled because before she was fighting and really non compliant with care but wandering is still the same.\" Sanaya AIN Nurses also considered that essential oils were not effective for residents with dementia. The following comment states: People in the last stages of dementia it is not effecting.\" Sabrina RN Four nurses expressed a firm belief in the calming effect of essential oils as shown in the comments below: \" I think very mild [effect] ... the patch, usually they have a very calming effect.\" Jess RN \" I think it's working... I [the oils] getting good results.\" Gabi RN 7.5.3 Importance of essential oil research Two nurses stressed the importance of undertaking further rigorous research on use of essential oil in RACFs . Table 32 presents the c ommon responses for the perceived significance of essential oils research for agitation management in RACFs. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Reduced agitation in RACFs 2 20% Table 32 Significance of essential oil researc h for agitation management in RACFs 195 Nurses advocated for essential oils calming effect on older people and for increased numbers of older people trialling the oils effect : \"I think I am where we were at the beginning I think that certain essential oils c reate a pleasant aroma and people feel good... this is a very small sample... I still think it generates a sense of wellbeing in the environment.\" Kaye RN The problematic nature of agitation on the ward was evident as nurses described reducing agitation could decrease the number of ward related unplanned mishaps. In addition, family distress at having an agitated person in care was clear as nurses described in the following comment: \"... the smell can soothe them... we can handle the residents more effectively... if the residents agitation is reduced. I think this is the most important thing in caring for people on a dementia ward. This is especially important for the care staff so they can achieve a better level of cooperation. Reducing agitation can also reduce the incidents and accidents that happen around the ward, and I'm pretty sure the families would... be happier if they see any reduction in agitation. \" Sam RN This section has reported nurse perception s of Lavender or Lemon Balm 's ability to manage resident agita tion. Nurses generally agree d that essential oils were effective in reducing resident agitation. Nurse opinion varied in the ability of essential oils to reduce behaviour in all r esidents or only some residents. The following section discusses nurse use of essential oils and the motivators for the adoption of this health practice. 196 7.6 Area of interest 3 - Nurse use of essential oils Nurses were asked about their personal use of essential oils. The area of interest nurse use of essential oil included the two c ategories : use of essential oils for health conditions , and motivators for using essential oils. These categories were further divided into five subcategories ; belief in benefit , lack of belief in benefit , current use , sense of well being , and pleasant arom a. Table 33 presents the most frequently reported responses from the nurse s interviews presented by categor y and subcategory . Area of interest Nurse use of essential oils Categories Essential oils for health conditions Motivators for using essential oils Subcategories Belief in benefit Lack of belief in benefit Current use Sense of wellbeing Pleasant aroma Table 33 Nurse use of essential oils 7.6.1 Essential oils for health conditions Nurses were asked if they would consider using esse ntial oils for their health conditions. Nine nurses claimed that they would use essential oils for a health complaint and one would not . Four o f the nurses interviewed confirmed they were currently using essential oils for health conditions of insomnia, an xiety and relaxation. The most frequent responses by nurse s are shown in Table 34 below. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Belief in benefit 9 90% Lack of belief in benefit 1 10% Current use 4 40% Table 34 Essential oils for health conditions The nine nurses who reported they would use essential oils for health conditions, would do so because of the health benefits of the oils , while one nurse was ambivalent about the benefit but would consider using essential oils in futu re. This is shown in the following comments: \"Oh yes definitely. Because I have been (using essential oils) , I know that it works... usually it works.\" Jess RN 197 \"Well, not at the moment but maybe in the future if I needed too.\" Sam RN Four nurses were using oils for a variety of different health conditions including anxiety, insomnia, migraines and pain. This is demonstrated in the following comments: \" I am using musk oil at home, which is promoting my sleep, it helps reduce my pain.\" Sabrina RN \"I actually do have some essential oils in my top drawer that I spray on myself because I suffer from anxiety.\" Kaye RN \"I sometimes suffer migraine and I... use some oil, especially the Lavender, I like the smell it calms me down.\" Natasha AIN 7.6.2 Motivators for using es sential oils Ten nurses reported us ing essential oils themselves, six because the oils provide a sense of wellbeing and relaxation and four because of the pleasant aroma . Table 35 presents the most common nurse responses for motivators for essential oil us e as identified by these nurses, reporting frequency of coding and percentage of interview coverage. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Sense of wellbeing 6 60% Pleasant aroma 4 40% Table 35 Motivators for essential oil use Six nurses believed the agreeable fragrance could create a feeling of relaxation and wellbeing regardless of whether the effect was attributed to a pharmacokinetic or psychosomatic origin. They commented: \"... certain essential oils create a pleasant aroma and people feel good... I think that a general feeling of wellbeing is 198 achieved... Is it psychosomatic? I don't know. Does it make me feel better when I smell it. Yes.\" Kaye RN \" ... sometimes you feel frustrated, you are not agitated you are frustrated. If y ou are frustrated your body is tight... if you use essential oils, it calms you down. I like Lavender.\" May AIN This section reported nurse self -use of essential oils with a majority of nurses agreeing they would consider essential oils for their own health conditions . Several nurses currently using essential oils stated motivators for use to be pleasant aroma and the benefits the oils produced. The following section presents nurse s opinion of the influencing factors that can support research in the RACF env ironment. 7.7 Area of interest 4 - Influencing factors that support research This section reports nurses' responses to interview questions relating to the conduct of research in RACFs. Nurses reported a variety of factors influencing research in the faciliti es, broadly categorised as researchers conduct of research and staff attitude to research . These categories were further divided into seven subcategories influencing factors include : unobtrusive research , routine timing , effective communication , staff work load , pre-trial education , researcher's attributes , and research value. Table 36 presents the most frequent ly reported influencing factors for research under Area of interest 4. Theme Influencing Factors that Support Research Categories Researcher's c ondu ct of research Staff attitude to research Subc ategories Unobtrusive research Routine Timing Effective Communicat ion Staff Workload Pre-trial Education Research Team Attributes Research Value Table 36 Influencing factors that suppo rt research 199 7.7.1 Researcher's conduct of research A central focus of this research was to identify factors that support and influence the success of research in the RACF environment. Nurses were asked if there were any difficulties in implementing the essential oil study on their ward. On analysing their comments, the most frequent responses by six of the nurses were that the research was unobtrusive and presented no obstacle for staff or residents and that the research was routinely timed to adequately prepare staff for the researchers arrival. Of the ten nurses interviewed , four suggested effective communication between researcher, staff and the residents would increase research success. Table 37 presents the subcategories for Researcher's conduct of research a s reported by the nurses. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Unobtrusive 6 60% Routine timing 6 60% Effective communication 4 40% Table 37 Researcher conduct of research 7.7.2 Unobtrusive research Of the ten nurses interviewed , six were pleased with the unobtrusive way in which the research was implemented in the facility. Staff described the research as having minimal or no impact on them and the intervention as being largely unnoticed by the participating residents . The researc h staff in the RACF environment were described by the nurses as unassuming in their duties and amenable with the residents . This is shown in the following comments: \"No impact on the nursing staff, she (research assistant) came in explained what she was do ing... some people come in and don't explain what they're doing and just start.\" May AIN \"So they [resident] don't even notice the little black thing on their clothes.\" Sam RN 200 \"No she (research assistant) was ok. She was just going around on the list; I th ink she had a list. She likes the residents she is very good with the residents.\" Sanaya AIN Further, when nurses were asked what suggestions or recommendations they would have for the future implementation of research in RACFs they described unobtrusive research that was well accepted by the residents and families as a preferred method of conducting research: \" ... it was a smooth running process.\" Kaye RN \"I think the trial went really really well we didn't have any problems... nobody has complained... the fa mily members were happy that their loved ones were getting treatment.\" Sam RN 7.7.3 Routine Timing Six Nurses identified routine timing to be the most important factor in future research success in the RACF environment. Nurses were aware of the fortnightly on/of f timeframe for the research and daily routine of the researcher. They were aware in advance of the activity to be conducted on the ward during these times. Researchers who adhere to regular timing provide consistency for staff and the resident , in their e xpectations of ward procedure or their daily routine at this time. This is shown in the nurses comments below: \"I think the way you did it was good. You came in and put on patches for two weeks and then you came back.\" Abbie AIN \"I think the trial went wel l, I've seen who does the patches she (research assistant) comes at the same time, she removes the patch at the same time.\" Sam RN 201 Some nurses also recommended a change in the routine timing of the research to better meet the needs of the nurse and residen ts. Nurses described changing the intervention time to the afternoon during \"sundowning \" behaviour may be more beneficial to the resident and possibly easier for the nurse to monitor behaviours. This is shown in the following comment: \"I was thinking if w e could also try for you to come in the afternoon so you can also observe the resident in the afternoon. Especially with the residents with sundowning, they are really bad in the afternoon but in the morning they are good.\" Jasmine RN 7.7.4 Effective Communicati on Four nurses identified effective communication among researcher s, staff and the resident as an influencing factor in the success of the research. Nurses described effective communication as crucial to the success of future research. Nurses described the research assistant as approachable and knowledgeable. They acknowledged the research assistant as having a genuine interest in the resident and a willingness to explain procedures thoroughly. Further, the families of residents who tried to assist the rese archer in completing the research duties appreciated this care. This is shown in the following nurse comments: \"She was very good and very friendly, and the resident and the family started knowing her and they were quite interested to help her, and they lo oked forward to her coming, I saw very enjoyed (sic) family members. \" Gabi RN \"... [the researcher] was wonderful, came in, said why she was here and spoke beautifully to the clients. The loveliest girl, she was terrific, explained everything, 'I'm just go ing to change your 202 patch today, and this is what I am going to do'. Because they wouldn't remember. \" May AIN \"[research assistant] giving the aromatherapy with them and talking with them and then they go back and when we [staff] approach that person they say 'oh that lady is good, she is good and nice, she gave us nice smells .\" Sanaya RN 7.7.5 Staff attitude towards research Nurses were asked to suggest how researchers could approach future research projects in RACFs to increase acceptability and success of the research. Staff recognised researcher 's awareness of the nurses current workload and the need to minimise research impact on their work day was deemed to be pivotal to future research success. In addition to pre -trial education , research team attributes and a perceived research value were deemed necessary to foster acceptance and compliance to the research among staff. Table 38 presents the staff attitudes towards research as reported by the nurses. Subcategory Frequency Percentage (n=10) Staff workload 3 30% Pre-trial education 2 20% Research team attributes 2 20% Research value 1 10% Table 38 Staff attitudes towards research 7.7.6 Staff workload Of the ten nurses interviewed, three identified staff workload to be a barrier in perfor ming research duties. Nurses were aware that the research assistant was performing the trial interventions in the clinical environment to minimise the research impact on nursing staff. Nurses described limited time for research duties in addition to their current workplace functions . Nurses generally felt disappointed that they could not contribute more to the research process. This is illustrated by the following statements: 203 \" It was a bit sad because I was quite busy on the ward and I really couldn't con centrate that much on the study purpose, just generally the observing behaviour was all I could do.\" Gabi RN \"... it is hard to get time [to report behaviours] when I am busy on the ward.\" Sabrina RN Some nurses recognised the difficult y committing to the time required to monitor a resident's behaviour. A shorter timeframe was suggested to be easier for the nurse to monitor older person behaviour. The is shown in the nurse response below: \"I think that you need to shorten it because two weeks is a very long time to monitor someone but if it's a week, the days are quick, then you can see if there is any changes for the residents... I think it's better one week than one week off and then one week.\" May AIN 7.7.7 Pre-trial Education Several nurses identified a short pre-trial staff education session as beneficial when introducing research into the clinical environment. Nurses acknowledged that pre -trial education describing the objectives, benefits and intentions may increase staff participation because if staff were aw are of the effect and procedures, they are more likely be interested and be in a position to participate in the research. This is shown in the following comments: \"Researchers need to tie into the pre -trial an education package, only very small maybe 10 -15 minutes long because that is as long as our staff have. So all the staff are 204 knowledgeable of the benefits, what we are looking for and some of the objectives of the research. \" Kaye RN \" ... and spend a little bit more time explaining what essential oils are and how they will be reacting on residents. Because not everyone knows about this very well and if you explain it to them they might help to do the things and they can also notice how it is affecting the residents.\" Sanaya AIN 7.7.8 Research Team Attributes Several Nurses identified the personal characteristics of the research team as being pivotal to the success of the research. Researchers who are polite to staff, acknowledge that routine care has priority over the research and make efforts to organise the research around usual activities are more likely to have the cooperation and support of clinical staff : \"I really do think it is the persons you employ to conduct the study.. . The research assistant always came to the door and said 'I'm here to change t he patch is that ok? And I might say, can you come back in half an hour because one resident is really uptight?' Very obliging... So if you want to do any more studies that is fine as long as I like the person coming in .\" Jasmine RN 7.7.9 Research value One nurse identified the capacity for the research to add value and a feeling of importance to the resident and nurse as a facilitator of research in the RACF environment. Participating in research provided a sense of importance to the resident , that researchers val ued them and were interested in what they could contribute. This is shown in the following comment: 205 \"It was actually a good thing for the residents and the staff, to have research on the ward, it made them feel important.\" Natasha AIN This section has rep orted of factors described by nurses that can support research in the RACF setting . Nurse perceptions had been informed by their participation in the essential oil RCT conducted in this study . 7.8 Summary This chapter has reported the finding s from 10 semi -structured interviews with nurses. A content analysis identif ied four areas of interest ; Change in frequency of agitation, Effectiveness of essential oils for agitation ; Nurse 's use of essential oils ; and Influencing factors that support research. The nine c ategories and 20 subcategories were identified from the four areas of interest . Subcategories were identified by the content analysis and illustrated by nurse's statements from Phase III interviews. Nurses were divided in their response s to Change in frequ ency of agitation in their facility. Nurses who claimed to have observed a change in frequency stated agitation had reduced on the ward with the majority claiming a behaviour reduction in all residents participating on the RCT . Other nurses claimed to have not observed a change in frequency on the ward or were unsure. A majority of nurses interviewed agreed that essential oils were effective in reducing resident agitation. However , nurses remained divided on whether essential oils would be effective in mana ging agitation in all residents or only some residents, with some nurses advocating for further essential oil research. A majority of nurses agreed they would consider using essential oils for their own health conditions. Almost half the nurses interviewe d were currently using essential oils for 206 their health, stating motivators for essential oils to be pleasant aroma and the sense of well -being that the oils created. Nurses described research that was unobtrusive in the RACF, routinely timed and provided good communication with the researchers to facilitate a projects success. Nurses advised researchers to be mindful of the nurses existing workload and need for pre-trial education. In addition, nurses also described pleasing research team attributes and co nducting research considered valuable to the nurse to be beneficial to a research project . The findings from Phase III nurse interviews are discussed in conjunction with Phase I interview findings pre RCT and the results of the intervention phase II RCT f or this study in Chapter 8. 207 Chapter 8 Dis cussion 8.1 Overview This final chapter discusses th e findings of this research the implications for the evolving understanding of agitation manageme nt, essential oil investigation and research involving residents li ving in RACFs. The findings are discussed within the context of the HBM, that predicts and explains behaviours that lead to the adoption of new health management strategy ( Hayden , 2014; Hochbaum, Kegels & Rosenstock, 1952 ). The findings as they relate to the research questions and obje ctives are discussed (1) How nurse understanding of agitation influence s the management of older persons behaviour in RACFs? (2) Nurse's perception of essential oils and their use to manage agitation (3) What is the effectiven ess of Lavender compared to Lemon Balm and a placebo for the management of agitation in residents of RACF with and without dementia, and (4) What are the influencing factors that can facilitate nurse participation in research conducted in the RACF setting. Implications for education, practice, policy, management and research are discussed . The final section of this chapter includes an account of the strengths and limitations of the quantitative and qualitative components of the study in addition to the auth or's concluding remarks 8.2 Research findings This research examined the effectiveness of Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oils as alternative approaches to the management of agitation for residents living in RACFs. While there are publications describing the effect of both Lavender and Lemon Balm oils in separate trials, this study was the first to compare Lavender to Lemon Balm essential oil in a single study for the management of agitation. The inclusion of residents with and without dementia has also not be en reported previously. Further, the design of the RCT phase of this research overcame some of the methodological limitations of previous studies investigating essential oils for agitation in older people. The main findings are summarised in Table 39. 208 Main Findings Explore nurse understanding of agitation and it's influence on the management resident behaviour in RACFs Nurses considered some agitated behaviours to be intractable to the dementia condition. Agitation is often managed differently when com munication is impaired. Nurses held a strong belief in the ability of essential oils ability to reduce agitation (new). What is the effectiveness of Lavender compared to Lemon Balm and a placebo for the management of agitation in residents of RACF s with a dementia diagnosis ? Lavender or Lemon Balm , did not reduce agitated behaviour independent of cognitive status when compared to placebo. Lavender and Lemon Balm reduced physical non - aggressive behaviour independently of cognitive status when compared to p lacebo (new) . Quality of life in residents without dementia was significantly less when compared to dementia indepen dent of essential oil treatment (new) . What are the differences of Lavender compared to Lemon Balm and a placebo for the management of agit ation in residents of RACF with and without a dementia diagnosis A significant opposing effect of Lavender and Lemon Balm between the without dementia and dementia groups on NPI and CMAI total score and in the domains of NPI Irritability and CMAI physica l non -aggressive behaviour (new) Lavender was significantly more effective in reducing physical non -aggressive behaviour compared to Lemon Balm and placebo in residents with dementia (new). Lemon Balm was significantly more effective in reducing NPI total score and physical non -aggressive behaviour compared to Lavender and placebo in residents without dementia (new) Lemon Balm was significantly less effective in reducing irritability on the NPI Irritability score when compared to Lavender or plac ebo in residents with dementia (new) . Influencing factors for Research Research is vital to providing optimum care to residents in RACFs Collaboration between researcher and nurse can promote and sustain research capacity Practical research achievable in the RACF setting is most beneficial in sustaining interventions long -term Staff education of research processes can encourage compliance with research Table 39 Summary of main findings The following sections discuss the major findi ngs as they relate to each research aim or question within the context of the literature. 8.3 How does nurse s understanding of agitation influence the management of resident behaviour in RACFs? Nurse's understanding of agitation influenced the strategies se lected to manage behaviour in residents with and without dementia in RACFs. Nurses interviewed acknowledged being susceptible to agitation in the RACF environment. The nurses 209 considered agitation to be a serious problem to the older person, staff and other residents in the setting. Most nurses perceived essential oils would be effective in managing agitation, however perceived barriers to effectiveness of the management between people with and without dementia. The nurses who were interviewed consider ed agitation in people without dementia to be preventable , therefore they may be more likely to persevere to identify triggers for the behaviour that once rectified could resolve the agitation. In contrast , nurses identified impaired communication, common in older people with dementia, hindered the nurse attempts to find reasons for agitation which results in nurses adopting short -term managements of distraction or restra int to contain behaviour. Nurse s perception that agitation is difficult to treat in people wi th dementia does influence their clinical decision making . 8.3.1 Nurse s experience s of agitation Nurses reported that residents frequently experience d episodes of agitation and in many cases, attempts by nurses to calm the resident often resulted in limited su ccess. This creates a stressful environment for other residents and staff. This finding is similar findings by Zwigsen et al. (2014) involving 432 nursing home residents. That study found that agitation and aggressive behaviours were the most prevalent beh aviours displayed by residents and the most disturbing to nurses. A New South Wales Nursing Midwifery Association [NSWNMA] (2016) survey also confirmed agitation and aggression to be a frequent occurrence in RACFs with 90% of nurses having experienced phys ical or verbal agitation from a person in their care. Concerns were expressed about the increasing level of agitation and aggression in the RACF environment and a lack of resources available to effectively manage the behaviour. Nurses in this study relied on their education and the resident s non -verbal cues to negotiate in an attempt to resolve the situation and ensure the safety of the person, other residents and staff in the immediate environment. Nurses in this study expressed frustration at the lack of effective agitation management 210 resources, the limited time available to manage agitation and meet the care needs of all residents in their charge. Edberg et al's (2008) study resonates the frustration of the nurses in this study claiming that the unpredic table nature and time required to manage agitated behaviour created difficulties in balancing competing demands in the workplace , resulting in nurse/ carer strain. When a resident is agitated, other residents and nurses are affected. The serious nature of t he behaviour and limited effectiveness of interventions such as distraction provides a cue to action for nurses to investigate alternate approaches to managing agitation in residents with and without dementia. Nurses interviewed in this study reported phys ical aggression, wandering and repetitive behaviour are more frequently exhibited in residents with dementia than those who do not have dementia. Several recent studies (Burns et al. 2011; O'Conner, Eppingstall, Taffe, & van der Ploeg, 2013) and the Intern ational Psychogeriatric Association [IPA] agree that some agitated behaviours are specific to the dementia trajectory and the IPA has recently formed a working party to develop an agreed definition for agitation that will include dementia specific behaviou rs (Cum mings et al. 2015). Nurse s in this study reported agitation in residents without dementia most frequently originated from incongruences in resident care preferences. They perceived agitation in residents without dementia to be easier to manage than in people with dementia. This agitation was more often attributed to frustration, irritability or as a symptom of an anxiety or depressive condition. Results of Drages et et al 's (2013), cross -sectional observation study of 227 residents without dementia s upports this finding, reporting the conditions of anxiety and depression to be a precursor to agitation in residents without dementia. These studies are consistent with the findings of interviews from Phases 1 and 111 of the st udy reported in this thesis, however nurses need to exercise caution when attributing behaviours or their origins based on cognitive level . Australian statistics 211 predict that 40 -50% of people with dementia also experience depression in addition to 49% displaying the symptoms of anxiet y (Neville & Teri, 2011). The presumption that an agitated behaviour is related solely to the cognitive status may result in anxiety or depression being overlooked and left untreated in older people with dementia. 8.3.2 Nurse s understanding of agitation manageme nt Nurses understanding of agitation management in this study focused on identifying the factors that contribute to the behaviour, which is greatly assisted by a resident s ability to communicate grievances, comprehend questions and have insight into their behaviour, as well as the nurse s aware ness of the resident's health, usual behaviour patterns and preferences. When triggers for behaviour are identified, care can be modified, assessment arranged or processes put in place to mitigate or eliminate the triggers of episodes of agitation. Nurses allocated individual time to older people when they were agitated, to assess agitation level, identify triggers and select appropriate management strategies (NSW Health, 2006). When residents were excessively agitated, nurses in this study agreed that it was best practice to remove themselves from the situation until the resident was calm and more able to communicate their grievances or participate in management strategies. The impaired capacity of older people with de mentia to communicate effectively is often an obstacle to identifying causes of agitation and further escalates the agitation (Edberg et als. 2008 ; Dux bury, Pulsford, Hadi, & Sykes, 2013) . Nurses also exhibit a high level of frustration when residents are unable to communicate ( Dux bury, Pulsford, Hadi, & Sykes, 2013) . Nurses interviewed in this study reported similar feelings when residents could not articulate the cause of their behavi our and noted resident's frustration escalated their agitation. Nurses i nterviewed agreed that agitation was most difficult to manage in residents with dementia primarily due to impaired communication. 212 As a consequence of the cycle of poor communication, Runci, Eppingstall and O'Connor (2012) found that agitation was often th e reason psychiatric medications are prescribed in RACFs and recomme nded that responses to resident s agitation should be monitored to ensure that medications are not inappropriately selected due to difficulty in communicating the causes. 8.3.2.1 Short -term manag ement strategies In an attempt to ease agitation and relieve distress in residents who could not communicate the reason for their agitation , nurses used short -term strategies of distraction, deception and monitoring . Residents with dementia were frequently managed in that way. However, short -term management provide s temporary relief only and rarely save s the nurse's time or decrease s frustration in managing behaviours (Dombeck, 2015; Hofmann & Hahn, 2014 ). Nurses perception that agitation in dementia is int rinsic may pose a barrier to select ing strategies considered to permanently reduce unwanted behaviours in this population. Distraction was the most common approach used by nurses interviewed. Distracting the resident with an activity or conversational to pic of their preference often resulted in the reduction of agitation. However , once the distraction ceased the behaviour was observed to reoccur necessitating the nurse to re -assess the resident and repeat the distraction technique. Nurses in this study a lso combined deception with distraction to calm residents using approaches such as placebo medications, telling residents a bus was due or that family would be visiting later. This approach has been used widely across RACFs . Tullo et al 's, (2015) study fou nd that medical staff considered deception to be an acceptable clinical management for people with dementia largely because this group have lowered capacity for understanding, retaining and emot ional processing of information . 213 Wandering was the most frequ ently mentioned agitated behaviour by nurses . The constant movement of the resident from one area to another required nurse s to keep a watchful eye on the resident to monitor their safety, protecting them from their own actions and external threats in the environment (DoHA, 2010). Wandering residents require not only monitoring for safety but also ensuring they receive adequate amounts of sleep and nutrition to support their activity. Wandering is easier for the nurse to monitor when the resident is contain ed in a ward or area in easy view of the nurse's station. This type of containment is considered restraint and is commonly used in dementia wards in RACFs nationally and internationally (DoHA, 2014). Nurses in this study considered pharmacological restrai nt to be an acceptable management for agitation that was unresolved by other non -pharmacological methods. Chemical restraint, the use of medication for the sole purpose of managing behaviour, often increases sedation that can further impair communication i n the older person (Jeste & Maglione, 2013). Morley's (2010) investigation of clinical practice in RACFs found that nurses were aware of the detrimental effects and limited efficacy of restraints. They understood non -pharmacological methods to be more effe ctive approaches, however restraint was still used in the RACFs . Chemical restraint has a negative impact on the resident increasing the risk of pressure areas, physical decline, incontinence, depression, anxiety, confusion, injury, aggression, falls and d eath (Gulpers et al. 2013; Hill & Fauerbach, 2014). Restraints that restrict a person's movement are degrading, violate human rights and are often perceived as punishment by the older person. These factors increase the resident's distress and can contribut e to injury as the individual often attempts to free themselves from their circumstance ( NSW DoH, 2014 ) While some of the nurses in this study believe d chemical restraint is acceptable to manage agitat ion, opinions about the appropriate use of chemical restraint varied from a first line management strategy for unresolved agit ation to a last resort measure. Some 214 nurses suggested lowering of medication dosage to reduce side effects. Similarly, Boase et al 's (2012) study found that regular use of medications to reduce agitation could further compromise a nurses ability to assess agitation as side effects often remove the resident's voice and limit use of alternate methods in favour of medications (Boase, Ki m, Craven, & Cohn, 2012). Morley (2010) contends that nurses considered restraint a safer option than unresolved agitation, with the short -term benefits of restraint outweighing the long -term detriment to the older person. Moh ler and Meyers ' (2014) study further demonstrates that despite a reported lack of benefit to the older person and evidence of detrimental effect, nurses still favoured restraint for agitation management. A small qualitative study investigating restraint use in the clinical environment by Duxbury et al. (2013) contradicts these findings reporting that nurses prefer to use strategies of distraction rather than medication in ag gressive physical agitation and as expected, relatives were also supportive of this non -coercive approach. In con trast, Ha ut, Kolbe, Strupeit, Mayer and Meyer (2010) found attitudes of sta ff and family towards restraint to be rather positive and comparable between groups. The family perceived their relatives situation to be less distressing when the family member was calm even for a short time. Hoffman 's (2015) investigation of clinical practice in RACFs found that use of all forms of restraint promote more autonomy for the nurses in their role. 8.4 Nurse perceptions of essential oils and their use to manage agitation This study found that nurses believed in the benefits of Lavender and Lemon Balmto reduce agitation in the residents. A small percentage of nurses had worked with essential oils previously in the clinical setting. Several nurses were also us ing the oils for their own well being. Some nurses, however, did not believe the oils would be effective on all 215 residents agitation, considering the agitation in dementia to be intractable in the conditions trajectory. This belief supports Azermai et al 's (2014) findings t hat nurses held strong beliefs in complementary therapies as effective management , despite their opinion being in opposition to the GPs who perceive d complementary therapies to be ineffective. Several nurses interviewed were currently or had previously us ed essential oils for their own health conditions. Nurses percieved a relaxation benefit, pleasing aroma and safety in use that they considered would be beneficial for other s. Nurses in this study's experiences with essen tial oils either clinically in p alliation or dementia care, or through self-use had been positive. These positive experience s coupled with knowledge of essential oils low interaction with medications and minimal side effect s may have led nurses to advocate their use for the residents in agi tation management. However, a substantial amount of the nurses interviewed did not believe that essential oils would be effective in managing agitation in residents with dementia. Nurses in this study perceived agitation in dementia to be an incurable sid e effect of the condition. This lack of belief in inventions effect can compromise compliance with research in essential oil trials that focus solely on dementia populations. Burns et al. (2011) estimated nurse compliance to administering essential oils to agitated residents with dementia at only 50% through measuring the returned bottles. If nurses perceive the intervention to be ineffective, they will feel their time is better spent elsewhere rather than supporting the research. The nurses interviewed in this study were aware that scientific evidence on the effectiveness and safety of essential oil will be required to support policy and practice change in facilities. To that end, nurses were supportive of further trials using essential oils being conducted in their facilities. 216 8.5 What is the effectiveness of Lave nder or Lemon Balm essential oils as a management for agitation in residents with and without dementia? Although some of the nurses reported that the essential oils did appear to improve agitation in some residents, primarily those without dementia, results of this RCT did not demonstrate a statistical reduction in agitation when results were independently compared to placebo. These findings are consistent with previous research by Burns et al. (2011), Fu et al. (2013) and O'Conner et al. (2013) that reported no significant difference when Lavender or Lemon Balm essential oils were used to reduce agitation in people with dementia . They contradict the finding s of Sakamoto et al. (2012), Lin et al. (2007) , Fuji et al. (2009) and Ballard et al. (2002) that reported the use of Lavender or Lemon Balm did significantly reduce agitation in older people living in RACFs. Timing of the application of the essential oils may also influence their effectiveness. The essential oils in this trial were administered once daily, at the same time in the morning. Administering a second dose in the afternoon when behaviours in dementia peak may have increased the effect. This assertion is supported by Fuji et al.'s (2009) Lave nder study and Ballard et al. 's (2002) Lemon Balm study, where essential oil interventions were administered twice daily , with both studies report ing a significant reduction in agitated behaviour in people with dementia. A more frequent small dose of essen tial oils may minimise adverse side effects associated with higher doses of essential oil s and may maintain a therapeutic level of effect for a longer period. A statistically significant reduction was reported in the CMAI domain of physical non - aggressive behaviour when Lavender and Lemon Balm treatment groups were compared to placebo in this study. This result indicates that the essential oils may reduce this behaviour. Non -aggressive physical behaviours include restlessness, repetitious mannerisms and wa ndering among other behaviours. This result supports findings by Lin et al. (2007) and Fuji et al. (2008) who also report ed a clinically significant reduction 217 in motor activity on the NPI with the use of Lavender in dementia residents. The post hoc analysi s in this study revealed that Lavender was more effective in reducing physical non-aggressive behaviour than Lemon Balm for people with dementia, further supporti ng Lin et al's (2007) and Fuji et al 's (2009) findings. Similar to this RCT , Fuji et al., (200 9) used two drops of 100% Lavender essential oil applied to residents clothing for inhalation as an intervention. Lin et al. 's (2007) study used two drops of 100% Lavender essential oil applied to a cotton ball to be inhaled by a humidifier during sleep. The frequency of treatments in Lin et al. 's(2007) study was once daily, the same dose frequency used in this study. While Fuji et al., (2009) applied the oils three times a day. These results suggest that increasing the dose and frequency of Lavender treatm ents may lead to an increased reduction in physical non -aggressive behaviour in older people with dementia. A significant reduction in physical non -aggressive behaviour as revealed by the analysis in this study contradicted the reports of nurses in this s tudy who perceived that non - aggressive physical behaviour, specifically wandering to have remained the same throughout the trial. This perception may indicate a bias by the nurses towards behaviours they considered specific to dementia. Physical non -aggres sive behaviours such as wandering were considered by nurses to be intractable in dementia and not expected to be influenced by essential oil intervention. This bias can affect the reporting of behaviours by nurses , bias was minimised from reporting in this trial, by low scent doses and counterbalancing treatments coupled with the nurses challenging workload nurses may not have been aware when residents were taking a active treatment or placebo . 8.5.1 What are the differences in Lavender or Lemon Balm essential o ils The essential oils investigated in this study demonstrated an opposite effect in residents with or without dementia. Lemon Balm essential oil consistently reduced behaviour in 218 residents without dementia when compared to Lavender . In contrast , Lavender was consistently more effective in reducing behaviour in residents with dementia when compared to the Lemon Balm treatment. This difference in the essential oil effect was significant between the with and without dementia groups in total agitation score, irritability and physical non -aggressive behaviour in this study, demonstrating the intervention to have worked differently in each group. Lemon Balm demonstrat ed an ability to reduce NPI agitation and CMAI physical non - aggressive behaviours in residents without dementia in post hoc analyses featured in this research. These result s are similar to the findings of Ballad et al (2002) w here Lemon Balm reduced behaviours by 30% in 71 older people living in RACFs when compared to a placebo of sunflower oil. Thi s trial however conflicts with the results of this study as participants in Ballad et al 's (2002) trial all had a diagnosis of dementia. In further contrast to Ballad et al 's (2002) results , this study demonstrated a significant difference with Lemon Balm being less effective than placebo in reducing irritability in residents with dementia. This result is supported by Burns et al 's (2011) study that reported Lemon Balm was not more beneficial than placebo for 114 residents with probable or possible AD as r eported on the NPI measure. Lavender was significantly more effective in reducing physical non -aggressive behaviours in residents with dementia when compared to Lemon Balm and placebo in this study. Th e result in this study is supported by Sakamoto et al' s (2012 ), Fuji et al (2008) and Lin et al. (2007) studies, which also reported a reduction in agitated behaviour in residents with Dementia when Lavender is administered. Th e result in this study are in contrast to O 'Conner et al's (2011) study of 64 resid ents with mild to moderate dementia which reported Lavender massage did not reduce physical agitation. O'Connor et al's study did not investigate the Lavender treatments effect in people without Dementia. 219 This difference in essential oil effect between th e cognitive groups may be attributed to impaired brain function in dementia, and the associated symptoms of olfactory dysfunction, memory impairment, and hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli or diminished neurotransmitter processes. Olfactory dysfunct ion in AD is estimated at high as 100% and 96% in Frontal Lobe dementia, but lower in Vascular dementia at 15% (DeYoung, Just, & Harrison, 2002; Raetz, 2013). A scent discriminate test was performed in this study to assess the ability to detect and disting uish between scents. The test did not determine odour identification or level of olfactory dysfunction. Scent detection relies on immediate memory while scent recognition is more a delayed memory processing. Depending on the degree of brain dysfunction sce nt may be harder to discern and recognise for a person with dementia. Lemon Balm essential oil was not well tolerated in this study by residents with dementia. A rationale for this outcome may be attributed to Lemon Balm being a less recognisable and high ly potent fragrance (Duda et al. 2015). Many residents with dementia are hypersensitive to sounds, smells or temperature in their environment (Tyrrell, 2014). Lemon Balm 's potent scent may over stimulat e the residents with dementia, the oil proving to have an irritant rather than a calming agent. Lavender's more subtle medium fragrance was more effective and better tolerated in this study by residents with dementia. Lavender statistically reduced physical non -aggressive behaviour in comparison to Lemon Balm and placebo in the dementia groups. Fragrances can evoke strong memories of earlier times in an older person's life when they recollect having smelled the scent previously (Halcon, 2010). The limbic systems amygdala governs the emotional response , while the hippocampus is involved in retrieval of memories surrounding scent (Fontaine, 2014). The ability of the hippocampus to retrieve memories is impaired in dementia; however earlier life memories rely less on the hippocampus for recollection (Simons, 2014) . Lavender was a 220 popular herb commonly grown in gardens, used as perfumes and disinfectants in earlier years (Halcon, 2010). It is highly likely that some older people with dementia would recognise and may be comforted by this scent. Conversely, the fragr ance of Lemon Balm was more effective in people with out dementia, and its highly potent , less familiar scent as having more of a pharmacological effect . However, treatment with Lavender did reduce agitation and the total score on NPI from baseline behavio ur for people without dementia. Lemon Balm significantly reduced agitation on the NPI total score when compared to Lavender and placebo . Regardless of Lemon Balm 's intense fragrance, no residents with or without dementia requested the removal of a patch du ring the trial. A final consideration for the difference in the effect of the essential oils between people with and without dementia, may be impaired pharmacodynamics effect. Lemon Balm is considered to influence GABA processes to create an anxiolytic, se dative and muscle relaxant effect (Awad, et al., 2009; Duda et al., 2015; Koulivand, et al., 2013). Lavender may affect the serotonin pathways, in addition to GABA pathways, which are thought to increase mood and social behaviour (Chioca et al., 2013). Dim inished neurotransmitter processes in deme ntia may impair pharmacodynamic effect in comparison to the intact brain in the without dementia groups. In addition, older people with dementia commonly take antipsychotics and benzodiazepines that also affect th e GABA and serotonin pathways (Banjee, 2009; Alzheimer's Australia 2012). Lavender may elicit a synergistic effect on people who are already taking medication that engages these neurological pathways, providing a greater calming effect than Lavender essent ial oil may exert alone. Further investigation is required into the synergistic effect with pharmacology and the mechanism of action of essential oils. . 221 8.5.2 Quality of Life independent of essential o il treatment As could be expected, t here was a significant difference in Quality of Life (QoL) for people without dementia compared to those with dementia, however the study did not find that essential oils improved QoL. Quality of life for older people is often determined by their ability to remain independent , individual and autonomous (Lee et al., 2009 ). Capacity to maintain these three factors can be problematic in a RACF due to communal living, structured routines and protocols that guide the furnishing of living areas. Before many people enter RACF they ha ve already experienced losses to one or more of the factors that underpin their QoL (Anderson, 2011). However, QoL for people living in RACFs is closely related to the quality of care provided and how well the older person suits this ca re environment (Lee et al., 2009 ). Many people with dementia thrive on routine and structured environments (Alzheimer's Australia, 2015), making them more suitable candidates for aged care living. This may contribute to a higher quality of life found in people with dementia w hen compared to older people without dementia in this study. 8.6 What are the factors that influence research in the RACF environment? This section addresses the final research question to provide information on the factors that influence research in the RAC F environment. There are barriers to change in clinical settings, includin g reluctance by staff to change that can influence the adoption of a new health management strategy in the clinical setting ( Hayden, 2014 ). This research sought to overcome barriers to using essential oil s in the clinical setting and to encourage nurses to value and take responsibility for research in RACFs . This study is the first to investigate influencing factors of a RCT for essential oils in the RACFs environment. Finding s of th is study were similar to other studies that investigated nurse research compliance in different clinical settings (Akerjordet, Lode, & Severinsson, 2012; Roll et al. 2013; Vedel\u00f8 & Lomborg, 2011). 222 Nurses interviewed in this study aspired to provide the be st evidence -based care to the residents in their charge and understood that research is a vital component in delivering care, however they also believe d that research for residents in RACFs was often overlooked in government funding. Nurses were aware that the ageing population was impacting on the role of aged care nurses , with greater numbers of people presenting to facilities with increased levels of frailty and complex comorbidities. Nurses specifically identified research into managing agitation to be a crucial area for in vestigation in the RACF setting. N urse's were concern ed about the increasing difficulty of managing agitation among residents in the absence of effective management . Three factors emerged from this study that influence d research inclu ding collaboration between researcher and nurse to promote and sustain research capacity , practical research that is relevant to direct care and achievable in the RACF to sustain interventions long -term and staff education of research processes to encourag e compliance when research. Nurses in this study highlighted a need for improved communication between the rese archer and nurse. Nurse s were the best informants of the daily practical difficulties encountered by residents and staff in their facilities. Thi s knowledge coupled with the researchers skill in developing strong arguments for evidence based practice can produce change for residents and RACF staff. Akerjordet, Lode and Stevensons's (2012) investigation of 364 clinical nurses in a university teachin g hospital in Norway support theses findings conclud ing that a conscious effort is required by the researcher to build collaborative relations with clinical staff to promote a sustainable capacity for research in the clinical environment. Nurses in this s tudy warned researcher's should have realistic expectations about the research they seek to implement in RACFs. Researchers have skills to design robust 223 studies that will provide reliab le and valid results, and front line nurses can advise on the feasibilit y of implementing the protocol in clinical settings (O'Keeffe, 2014). Vedlo and Lombor g (2010) report ed that for research to be successful, the design and logistics of the research m ust be flexible in the clinical environment to accommodate for an unexpect ed environment or care priority changes in the day to day running of the RACF. Smith et al. (2016) found communication between nurse and researcher to be pivotal to the success of a study. The nurses interviewed in this study indicated in this study that staff were often challenged to trust the researchers with sensitive client information and at times, workplace information . They were aware that withholding such information could jeopardise the validity of the research outcomes. Similarly, when researcher s withheld details of the research being conducted at the facility, often to reduce prejudicial outcomes, an element of distrust was created. Alt -White and Pranulas (2006) similarly demonstrated that inadequate communication by researchers of a study's progress and findings was common feedback received from nurses following a research project completion and requires the researchers attention. A positive attitude towards research was acknowledged by the majority of nurses interviewed in this study despite re cognising substantial barriers to their participation. Akerjordek et al 's (2012) study also reported a positive attitude among nurses towards research regardless of frequently not being actively involved in research projects. Support for research in RACFs was evident from the interviews compl eted for this research, however several nurses emphasised the difficulties of conducting research in the RACF environment, in part because of the requirement to follow a rigid protocol for clinical trials. Nurses in th is study consistently advocated for practical research relevant to direct care and achievable in the RACF setting as being the most beneficial factors in sustaining interventions long -term. O'Keeffe's (2014) review of research in RACFs supports this 224 findin g also claiming that many of the well -designed studies that researchers want to conduct in RACFs are impractical in the clinical environment. 8.6.1 Nurse identified barriers to research in the RACF setting Recruitment of suitable residents has been identified as a barrier by nurses in this study and is supported by other researchers. Vidello and Lomborg (2011) reported that researchers faced major challenges in recruitment for over 50% of the studies they reviewed. Nurses in this study explained that residents an d their families in the RACF setting were often distressed and emotionally fragile during an older persons placement, claiming that for physical, emotional and social reasons, often participation in research was far down their list of priorities. O'Kee ffe (2014) also acknowledges that researchers may well be out of date with their current view of RACF residents , warning prospective researchers that residents are no longer the low care relatively active older people that were willing to support research of 1 0 years earlier. Rather, many of the residents included in this study had complex care needs and were at increased levels of frailty, often palliative or experiencing advanced dementia. Demanding workloads, competing care priorities and staff shortages wer e also identified as barriers making it difficult for nurses to comply with research (Burns et al. 2011) . The nurses interviewed in this study stated their appreciation of the research assistant who applied the intervention during the RCT, as many felt tha t essential oils would not have been administered if the study relied on the nurses to deliver the intervention as part of their care. Nurses interviewed also claimed it was difficult to find time once per fortnight to report the observed behaviours of res idents in their care to the researcher. Nurses reasoned due to time constraints in an already busy work schedule that without strong scientific evidence of the effect of essential oils research was not a high priority. Researchers can often overestimate th e knowledge clinical staff have of the research process. Akerjordet et al's (2012 ) findings support nurse s lack of knowledge in research 225 processes as a possible reason for nurse non -compliance with research . Videlo and Lomb org's (2011) found nurses in over half the studies they reviewed failed to follow the research protocols correctly. Nurses in this study recommended that increasing education and providing encouragement to staff during the research process could increase compliance. They suggested includi ng information about the background to the research and potential benefits to the older person and the nurses daily routine would increase staff support for research projects. Nurses in this study emphasised a need to be provided with research training a t the staff member's educational and English level, which has also been identified by other researchers in RACFs (O'Keef fe 2014). 8.7 Implications for the nursing profession This section discusses the implications of this research for nurse education, practic e and policy, facility management and research in RACFs. 8.7.1 Implications for Education Aged care nurses are required to be knowledgeable of the management of a variety of health conditions associated with old age and to provide best practice, evidence -based care. This research has identified areas for nurse education improvement in agitation management and research processes that validate best practice. The findings from this research identify a need for effective education on agitation management for nurses in RACFs. Nurses in this study relied on their knowledge of the older person and agitation management training to alleviate behaviours; ho wever many felt ill equip ed to cope with the increasing levels of agitation on the ward. Agitation management trainin g is currently a mandatory training initiative for all aged care nursing staff. However, many nurses in this study considered current agitation 226 management strategies to be short -term measures that merely alleviated behaviour intermittently in many older pe ople. Nurses in this study reported a fear of management reprisal for not effectively managing agitation after training, which can lead to a lack of incident reporting or unsuitable agitation management. The NSWNMA (2016) survey reports that the frequency of agitation, in particular aggression, to be underreported in RACFs and also reported that 61% of staff feared managerial repercussions of reporting injury resulting from resident agitation. More effective education with practical strategies for managing agitation in residents is required for nursing staff working in RACFs. The appropriateness of education provided for nurses can be assisted by greater transparency between staff and management in addressing the increasing realities of agitation in RACFs. Nurse education on research processes was identified as a strategy that could enhance the success of research in the RACF environment. Educating nurses of the importance of adherence to research processes can foster a collaborative culture of best practic e and improvement in the facility. Nurse non -compliance to research has been associated in the literature with a lack of knowledge and support in research p rocesses (Akerjordet et al. 2012 ). Education of nurses on research methods can lessen the divide bet ween clinician and researcher for the betterment of care. Suitable nurses interested in research may be identified by management for further training in the research process coupled with support for postgraduate education in this area. 8.7.2 Implications for Pr actice and Policy This research has implication s for RACF nursing practice in three pertinent areas. The first being that increased allocation of nurse s time and resources are necessary for the identification of factors that trigger agitation in dementia. The second, relates to vigilance in conforming to legal guidelines in the use of restraints through the documenting, monitoring and reviewing of restraint necessity for older people. The 227 third, being the allocation of frontline clinical nurses to be resear ch champions for the facility in collaboration with researchers on areas of RACF improvement. Nurses currently spend less time assessing causative factors of agitation in people with dementia than they do for people without dementia , reporting that impair ed communication makes identification of the causes difficult. As a consequence , nurses were more likely to use distraction and restraint in d ementia which increases confusion and the likelihood of recurrent agitation. Strategies need to be developed withi n individual facilities to ensure residents with impaired communication be allocated the necessary time and resources to identify causative factors for agitation. A clinical nurse that specialises in agitation management may provide support to older people and nurses on the wards at a minimal cost to the facility. Strict adherence is required to monitor, document and review the use of all types of restraints in RACFs. N urses reported that reoccurring or severe agitation that was difficult to resolve was of ten managed with chemical restraint. The use of restraint is legal in NSW and serves to contain the behaviour while the nurse can continue with duties . Adherence to monitoring ensures the contained resident is safe, and care needs are being met (DoHA, 2012 ). Spot checks performed by management can ensure that the restraint regist ers are completed in a timely and correct manner. In addition, the regular review of a residents need for chemical restraint and dose regularly can limit unnecessary use or overdose of the older person (Hill & Fauerbach, 2014) . Implications for policy include the review of clinical guidelines for the management of agitation, such as the NSW Department of Health Working with People with Challenging Behaviours guide, to ensure transpar ent, equitable and consistent instruction is given for the management of agitation for all residents regardless of cognitive status (NSW DoH, 2014 ). 228 Nurses interviewed were keen to be involved in research, however they were limited in the available time t hey could contribute to the research. Nurses who show aptitude and interest in research should be encouraged by management to participate in research through the allocation of additional time and educational support. Implications for policy include guideli nes that support frontline nurses participation in research. The policy should include specific instructions for delegated time away from direct care duties to fulfil research responsibilities and attend education to support nursing staff to improve resear ch knowledge. In addition, future policy that specifies information that can be shared with researchers can promote greater confidence among staff in disclosing sensitive facility or resident information. 8.7.3 Implications for Facility Management Implications for organisational management from the findings of this research include the consideration of additional agitation specialist staff to provide support to nurses and older people with agitation and management support of a restraint free RACF environment to promote dignity in ageing. High levels of anxiety and depression represented in RACF residents coupled with disparity in care provision found in this research, requires investigation to ensure residents are provided with adequate opportunities for physica l, mental and timely -care provision. Support by management for staff opportunities to be involved in research can promote a culture of evidence based best practice in facilities. The employ ment of a specialist nurse to manage agitation within the facility to support staff and residents requires consideration from facility management. The creation of such a position would relieve frontline nurses of agitation management responsibilities and free up their time to provide essential care to all residents. In a ddition, the specialist nurse can ensure that agitation is managed consistently across the organisation and within evidence -based guidelines (Fu et al. 2013). Such an initiative would demonstrate 229 management's acknowledgement of the increasing levels of agi tation within facilities and their commitment to improving care provision for residents and staff work conditions. This research recommends management to take a proactive role in the promotion of restraint free environment in RACFs. Recommended measures i nclude the support of mandatory staff education and changes to policy that prohibit the use of restraint in RACFs (Testad et al. 2016 ). The benefits of a restraint free policy in RACF s protect the human rights of one of societies most vulnerable population s (Decker & Castle, 2011) . Essential oils were found in this study to be well tolerated and safe for older people, with a potential to reduce agitation. A progressive step for managers in aged care would be to promote a chemical restraint free environment that encourages the use of complementary therapies to manage symptoms in residents in their facilities. Essential oils were currently used by a majority of nursing staff in this study with good effect, therefore incorporating essential oil therap y may be supported by the staff and improve behaviour s and QoL of residents . This study also found high levels of depression and anxiety among residents in addition to a difference in care standard offered to those with agitation who have dementia compared to those without dementia and this requires investigation by facility managers. A review of policy, in particular older adults rights for independence, participation, care, self -fulfilment and dignity that underpin minimum care standards (UN, 1991) is warranted. Facility managers are accountable for the service they are promoting to older adults in ensuring that residents have access to physical activity, mental stimulation and timely care provision. Implications for facility managers also include the need to suppo rt nurse participation in research through education, policy and clinical time. Managers can assist nurses by supporting in -service training to inform staff of research being conducted in the facilities. 230 Alternatively, a designated nurse research officer s upported by policy can be appointed to assist the researchers in their investigation process. Researchers need to be mindful of fiscal costs to facilities that can limit the amount of available time the researcher can spend collaborating and educating staf f on research processes. However, support from organisational management for nurses to participate in research can only benefit an organisation through improved knowledge and care provision . 8.7.4 Implications for Research Implications for future research from t he findings of this thesis include further investigation of potential agitation management for residents of RACFs. Additional research to identify optimal doses, methods for administration , and pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of essential oi ls and mechanisms of action of Lavender and Lemon Balm to reduce agitation in older people with and without dementia is required. Further investigation is required into the essential oils synergistic effect with pharmacology and the mechanism of action. Research investigating olfactory dysfunction and scent identification in older people with dementia may explain the clinically significant difference in scent effect identified in this study. Research investigation of how to best support nurses in the resea rch process can improve compliance, while an inquiry potential resident psychosocial readiness to be involved in research can guide future recruitment processes and may protect samples from withdrawal. Further investigation of a ppropriate agitation manage ment for older people that is safe and provide s effective relief from symptoms is needed to improve care delivery to residents in RACFs. This research has shown nurses to be susceptible to the consequences of agitation in the RACF environment that seriousl y impact on their ability to prioritise and provide care to all residents. Nurse s frustration was compounded by a lack of effective or safe available agitation management for older people in RACFs. 231 Further research that provides scientific evidence of agit ation management effectiveness and practicality can assist nurses in the ma nagement of agitation in RACF. Although t his study did not provide the scientific evidence for effect that nursing management require s for Lavender or Lemon Balm positive effect s on agitation , this study does, however recommend further research necessary to comprehensively evaluate Lavender or Lemon Balm 's potential as an agitation management. Finally, recruitment concerns identified by nurses hold implications for greater collabora tion between researchers, residents and their families to assess their psychosocial readiness for involvement in research (O'Keeffe, 2014). Research investigating the understanding of the residents and family's experiences can further direct the recruitmen t approaches. 8.8 Strengths and limitations of this study A strength of this study was the investigation of influencing factors that support research in the RACF setting. The interview s of 11 nurses with varying qualifications and workplace demands provided i nformation on factors that influence the success of research in the RACF setting that will direct future research in the aged care sector. Another strength provided by the research was the insight into the differences in nurse s perceptions of agitation and management provided to residents with dementia compared to those without dementia. Further research is needed to provide standardisation and equity in agitation management for all residents in RACFs regardless of cognitive decline. A major strength of th is study was th e implementation of the RCT and maintaining of resident compliance to treatment throughout the 10 -week study. The employ ment of a research assistant overcame issues of nurse noncompliance identified in previous studies and afforded the assur ance that interventions were being administered consistently throughout the study (Burns et al. 2011). Dosages for this trial were sort in 232 consultation with a qualified aroma therapist and dosages were minimal in comparison with previous studies. However , scent can often increase agitation and unwanted behaviour , especially with high scent intensity oils such as Lemon Balm . As low doses were used in this trial, it was imperative that compliance to treatment was maintained. Another strength of this trial wa s that the within groups study design provided increased statistical power with the same number of residents compared to a between group design study. In addition, the study design facilitated a reduction in variability between treatment groups as all subj ects received each treatment and acted as their own control. Participants were assigned to treatments in a counterbalanced manner to control for time -dependent effects such as resident fatigue or familiarity with research procedures. This research attempt ed to overcome all methodological issues identified in previous studies , however limitations in sample size was still evident in this study. To ensure statistical power, 87 residents were approached and consented , however after screening only 75 residents remained and were randomised to the study. A further 10 residents had withdrawn from the study before treatment data was collected. Sixty -five residents completed at least one essential oil treatment cycle and their data was included in the ITT analysis (A ppendix K). Ten residents withdrew after one treatment due to departure, relocation, refusal or illness. A further six residents who violated inclusion criteria over the duration of the trial were removed from the analysis. This thesis has reported the PP analysis for the 49 residents that met resident inclusion throughout t he study and concluded all three treatment cycles. The unexpected resident withdrawals in this study have reduced sample size limiting the generalisabiity of the outcomes. More detail on the residents withdraw process can be found in Figure 2 Consort diagram flow chart. Further increasing the dose or frequency of dose may have resulted in a more substantial reduction in agitation. However, a higher dosage of Lavender was used by O'Conner et al., (2013) and Lemon Balm by Burns et al., (2011) and both studies failed to show any 233 clinical significant reduction in agitation among people with dementia. Increasing the frequency of doses may be a more viable alternative to increasing the quantity of oil used. 8.9 Conclusion Several directions for nursing including clinical practice, education, organisational management and policy are addressed in this study. This study is the first study to compare Lavender and Lemon Balm for agitation management in older people with out dementia. This study is also the first study to compare the effect of Lemon Balm to Lavender in the same study. Increased frequency of dosage could decrease the declining trend in behaviours. Dosages were given in the morning between 8 -10am and a second patch at 4 pm when sun downing behaviours occur may facilitate this trend. Despite reductions in behaviours, Lavender or Lemon Balm did not significantly reduce agitation independent of cognitive decline. A significant difference was shown in the comparison of treatment effect between the cognitive groups on the NPI and CMAI. This opposing clinically significant effect requires further investigation. Specifically further investigation is recommended for Lavender essential oils for the reduc tion of PNAB behaviours. In addition , research of Lavender 's anti -agitating effect s on people without dementia and Lemon Balm 's anti -agitation effect in those without dementia warrant s further investigation. This study has been the f irst study to investiga te nurse s perceptions of agitation in people with dementia and without dementia. Nurse s perception s that agitation is intractable in the dementia trajectory led to a difference in management approaches provided to older people dependent on dementia diagnos is and communication ability. This difference in care provision warrants further investigation to ensure standardisation and equity in agitation management provided. Further , this stud y is the first to investigate a RCT in the RACF environment with finding s of influencing factors that support research in this environment to guide future research in aged care. 234 This study was conducted within an adapted HBM theoretical framework. This study has found nurses to be susceptible to the carer and workplace stress es of residents agitation in the RACF environment. This study shows that the influence of agitation seriously impedes the nurse's ability to prioritise and conduct care for all older adults in the RACF setting. A lack of availabl e effective and safe manage ment for agitation has provided a cue to action for staff to seek, investigate and possibly adopt new agitation management for residents in the RACF environment. The HBM states for new management to be adopted benefits of the health practice must outweigh the barriers associated with its implementation. This study has investigated the essential oils of Lavender and Lemon Balm as possible alternatives for nurse -initiated agitation management . In such , nurse s perception s of essential oil were investigated fo r benefit and barriers as agitation ma nagement for residents . Regardless of limited scientific effect , nurses held strong beliefs in the ability of essential oils to reduce agitation in residents without dementia residents. Nurse s noncompliance with essent ial oils administration observed in previous trials alerted researchers to the possibility of barriers to essential oil implementation in the RACF environment. The RACF environment was investigated for influencing factors that could support essential oil r esearch and nurse self -efficacy to adopt and implement essential oils into RACF s. It is the researchers opinion that despite the nurse's best intention s, workload demands and competing clinical prioriti es hinder the use of essential oils to the resident in the RACF environment. This study recommends a specialist nurse be employed by the facility to manage and monitor resident agitation. Specialist nurses can assist the resident with evidence and individual prefer ence based agitation management . The nurse w ould relieve the burden from the frontline nursing staff allowing them to provide care to other residents. Such a measure by organisational management could be seen as 235 a positive step towards creating a restraint free culture in the RACF environment that promotes QoL for older people . 236 1 References Abdeyazdan, Z., Moshgdar, H., & Golshiri, P.

Telephone: 02 462033 45 Facsimile: 02 46203291 Email : a.good@uws.edu.au You are invited to participate in a study conducted by Karen Watson PhD candidate, under her supervisors with the School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Wes tern Sydney. What is the study about? The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the essential oils Lavender and Lemon Balm on agitation in older adults. The use of essential oils to promote health benefit is commonly known as aromatherapy. Lavender and Lemon Balm are used in aromatherapy traditionally for their relaxing properties. This calming effect of Lavender and Lemon Balm may assist in relieving or reducing agitation in older adults. Essential oils can be administrated by an accredite d aged care nurse and may provide an expedient management tool for health conditions. This study also provides foundation for future 264 research examining mechanisms of action and the types of people or conditions which best respond to aromatherapy management . What does the study involve? Should you agree to participate: The researcher will ask you to attend two semi -structured audiotaped interviews, once at study commencement and again at the study conclusion. The interview questions are designed to explore p erceptions towards agitation and complementary therapies. The aged care setting will also be explored for barriers and facilitators to nurse initiated aromatherapy. As a nurse participant you will be asked to observe agitated behaviours of the older adults in your regular care. A research assistant will attach a patch containing treatment to older adult participant s in your care daily and remove the patch after two hours. The nurse participant will report observed behaviours of older adult participant fortn ightly. Observations will be recorded on the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI] and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI] in conjunction with the primary investigator. How much time will the study take? Approximate Time What will be done Initial Interview 20-30 minutes Semi structured audiotaped interview investigating perceptions of agitation, complementary therapies and their feasibility as managements in RACFs. Interviews will be conducted during normal nursing activities or at a time convenie nt to the nurse and primary investigator. Agitation observing and reporting 5-20 minutes fortnightly. 5 times during the 10-week study. Nurses will be asked to observe the agitated behaviour of older adult participant s who are in their regular care. They will report what they have observed to the researcher every two weeks. The time taken in this task is variable and dependent on the nurse's familiarity with the resident and knowledge of their behaviours. Observation reporting can be attended during normal nursing activities or at a time convenient to the nurse and primary investigator. 265 Concluding Interview 20-30 minutes Semi structured audiotaped interview investigating perceptions of agitation, complementary therapies and their feasibility as manageme nts in RACFs. Interviews will be conducted during normal nursing activities or at a time convenient to the nurse and primary investigator. Will the study benefit me? This study aims to further nursing knowledge and may improve future treatment for agita tion of older adults living in residential aged care facilities. Reductions in agitation can lead to increased nurse productivity and improve morale among staff, residents and their families creating a less stressful workplace environment. Your contributio n in this study will allow better guidance on essential oil management of agitation in the future. Benefits may also include the knowledge that you are furthering the investigation into quality healthcare management practices for older adults in residentia l aged care facilities Will the study have any risks? All health care management procedures involve some risk. The researchers anticipate risks to be few and unlikely for nurse participant s in this study. However essential oils are proven low irritants an d may exacerbate allergy symptoms in some people. Additionally nurse participant s may become uncomfortable during the interview process; at this point the interview will be ceased at the resident 's request and rescheduled. There may also be risks associate d with the study that are presently unknown or unforeseen. If you at any time have concerns regarding anticipated or actual risks or discomforts, please raise them with the aged care nurse and the investigator directly. How is this study being paid for? The study is supported by the School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Western Sydney. Will anyone else know the results? How will the results be disseminated? All aspects of the study, including results, will be confidential and only the researchers will have access to information on resident s. Data will be recorded and stored on the primary researchers password protected computer and destroyed once results are finalised. Any identifiable information collected about you will remain confidential and can only be disclosed with your permission or as required by law. Nurse interviews will be audiotaped. The researcher will listen to the interview to transcribe themes and significant statements from the interviewee. The transcription will then be reviewed b y the nurse participant , amended and elaborated upon before the 266 information is pooled. Identifying features will be removed from the data once approved by nurse participant s to ensure confidentiality. The primary researcher plans to use this data in prepar ing a thesis, report and further publications. Be assured information provided is treated in the strictest confidence and you will not be personally identifiable in the resulting documents. Can I withdraw from the study? Your participation in this study is voluntary. Your decision not to participate will not affect the relationship you have with your place of work or the researchers.
