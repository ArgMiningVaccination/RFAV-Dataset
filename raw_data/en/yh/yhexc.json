The American Chiropractic Association estimated that more than 30 million people are treated by chiropractors annually for safe, natural and effective relief from back pain, neck pain, headaches, extremity pain, poor overall health, low energy levels and much more. According to The American Association of Chiropractic Colleges, \"Chiropractic is a health care discipline which emphasizes the inherent recuperative power of the body to heal itself without the use of drugs and surgery. The practice of chiropractic focuses on the relationship between structure (primarily the spine) and function (as coordinated by the nervous system) and how that relationship affects the preservation and restoration on health.\" To restore and optimize human health. Many people incorrectly assume that chiropractors treat only back and neck pain. So how can my health be restored or optimized with chiropractic care? The answer is found when we look at the relationship between the spine and the nervous system. Your nervous system is the master controller of all living cells, tissues and organs: like the conductor for a large orchestra. The nervous system sets the tune by meticulously coordinating and directing all the bodies cellular functions. The spinal column lovingly encases and protects the nervous system (spinal cord and nerve roots) and is responsible for its protection. Having this close and intimate relationship, biochemical and structural problems in the spinal column can easily irritate different areas of the enclosed nervous system. This often results in noxious inflammatory biochemicals released during tissue injury or from direct mechanical pressure. Whatever the case may be, when your nervous system is not functioning at an optimal level and is in a real sense impaired, it will have a negative influence over the functioning of your cells, tissues and organs which are all controlled by the affected nerve. The resulting ailment(s) depends on the cells, tissues, and organs affected and the extent of nervous system compromised. In short, correcting spinal abnormalities dramatically relieves nerve interference and restores the human body to its optimal healthy state without drugs or surgery. The major and most significant difference between the two is how health issues are approached. Chiropractors, when evaluating and treating patients take a holistic approach which includes correcting the cause(s) of the health aliment. Most traditional practitioners approach usually focus more effort on treating the symptoms of a condition verses the actual causes. Correcting the cause of a problem brings substantial long-term benefits to patients and a more natural way to reach optimal health.
