Ma jor Influences on Consumer-Goods Marketers decision to Ta rget U.S. Hispanics. Journal of Advertising Research , 9- 21. Key problem/Issue: A systemic evaluation of Hispanic Marketing that analyzes management issues raised by the marketers themse lves. This article discusses potential motivating factors for engaging in Hispanic ta rget marketing or for desisting from it. Methodology: The sample for this study was drawn from consumer packaged goods marketers in food, alc oholic and nonalcoholic beverages, personal care, and household products categories in which Hispanic media adver tising had been reported by at least one of several sources. Results/Findings: The most highly rated reasons for engag ing in Hispanic marketing were those related to market size, growth, and di stinctiveness or segment appeal of the product. Clearly, market and competitive-related benefits were of greatest salience to firms choosing to target Hispanics. Observations This article undertakes what is, to t he author's knowledge, the first attempt ever to systematically analyze managemen t issues raised by the marketers themselves. 9ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Appiah, O. (2001). Black, White, Hispan ic, and Asian American Adolescents' Response to Culturally Embedded Ads. The Howard Journal of Communication , 12, 29-48. Key problem/Issue: The researcher digitally manipulated t he race of characters in ads and the number of race-specific cultural cues in the ads while maintaining all other visual features of these ads. It was expecte d that characters' race and cultural embeddedness of ads would affect Black adolescents' psychological response to ads. Methodology: The experiment employed a 2 (characters' ra ce: Black or White) by 2 (cultural embeddedness: low or hi gh) between-subjects design to test the hypotheses for each racial/ethnic group (Black, White, Hispanic and Asian Am erican). The four dependent variables were: 1) per ceived similarity to characters; 2) identification with characters; 3) belief ads intended for them: and 4) overall rating of ads. Three hundred forty nine high school st udents participated in the experiment. Results/Findings: Contrary to predictions, the findings suggest that the level of cultural embeddedness has a stronger influence on White adole scents' response to product ads than on Black adolescents' response to ads. Observations This study contributed to the field of advertising research by demonstrating the usefulness of an innovative technique t hat used the latest technology to alter the race of the model and th e number of race-specific cultural cues in each experimental ad. 10ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Ardila, A. (2005), \"Spanglish: An Anglicized Spanish Dialect\", Journal of Behavioral Sciences, 27, 60-81. Key problem/Issue: The blend between Span ish and English found in Hispanic or Latino communities in the United States is usually known as \"Spanglish\". It is suggested that Spanglish repr esents the most important contemporary linguistic phenomenon in the United States t hat has barely been approached from a linguistic point of view. Theoretical review: Two types of phenomena are proposed: su perficial, including borrowing and code-switching: and deep, including lexical-semantic , grammatical, and the \"equalization to English\" phenomenon. An analysis of both superficial and deep Spanglish phenomena is presented. Results/Findings: It is suggested that the future of Spanglish depends on two factors: (1) the number of Spanish-speakin g immigrants to the Unit ed States, and (2) U.S. policies concerning bilingualism. Thr ee different scenarios can be conjectured for the future of Spanglish: (1) it will disappear, (2) it will continue growing and eventually receive the status of a language, or (3) it will continue growing as a non-recognized Spanish dialect. Most likely, Spanglish will contin ue growing as a non-recognized anglicized Spanish dialect. Observations This theoretical review from Ardila (2005) of the Spangli sh concept gives a deep understanding of this current and relevant p henomenon in the Hispanic community. It also contains a variety of interesting examples of the types of code-switching. 11ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Black, G. (2004). The Impa ct of the Engl ish Language on Cross-Cultural Consumer Research in As ia and Latin America. Asian Pacific of Marketing and Logistics , 16, 3-35. Key problem/Issue: This article reports findings from a study conducted using respondents from three different cultures: traditional Americans, Hispanics, and Taiwanese in order to assess the reliability of measures a ssessing 29 consumer constructs used in various studies reported in major mark eting journals. In general, these measurements were designed for use wit h a traditional American sample and were not reported to have been us ed with other cultural samples. Methodology: Data were obtained from 108 student subjects enro lled in upper division and graduate business courses at a major university in the Southwest. Questionnaire development began with a review of recent literature. The ma jor emphasis of the study was to assess the reliability of co nstructs and their related measures across cultures. In order to simplify th is task, only English versions of the questionnaires were administered to all subjects. This was deemed appropriate because all of the respondents whose firs t language was not English achieved acceptable scores on the TOEFL exam (500), indicating that they could read and comprehend the English language. Results/Findings: This study clearly indicates that there are no differences between the sub- samples which were included in this study -traditional American students, Taiwanese students, and Hispanic students. A researcher would not have to be concerned about the reliabi lity of measures across these respondents from different cultures. 12ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations This study has some limitations and cautions. Utilizing student samples usually results in poor exte rnal validity. Ther efore, caution should be exercised when applying these findings to a larger population. 13ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Czepiec, H. and Kelly, S. (1983). Analyzing Hispanic Roles in Advertising: A Portrait of an Emerging Subculture. Journal of Current Issues in Advertising Research, 219-240. Key problem/Issue: This paper use content analysis of Hispanic print media to develop a construct for determining how Hispanics are being portrayed. It then compares this benchmark construct to ads directed at Hispanic in the general media. Methodology: First, categories were developed to classi fy role portrayal were based on past content analyses of black and women. Value categories were developed based on the Yankelovich study. Next, the m odels, and products associated with the models, were classified according to t he appropriate role portrayal categories. The elements of the entire ad, including the setting and the themes of the copy, were analyzed as to whether or not t hey suggested that a particular value was being emphasized. Results/Findings: In comparing ads in Anglo to those in Hispanic magazines, the researchers found that Hispanic ads were usually smaller, less often in full color, and shorter in body copy. Another findings is t hat Hispanic magazines are not using Hispanic models as frequently as might be expected. Observations: The values expressed in the ads were different in the Hispanic an Anglo media. The researchers suspect this might be due to the lack of broad and diverse advertising offerings in the sma ll sample, but it may also indicate a different marketing strategy. 14ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Delener N, Katzenstien H. (1994). Credit card po ssession and ot her payment systems: use patterns among Asian and Hispan ic consumers. International Journal of Market ing. 12(4): 13-24 Key words : credit card, ethnicity, purchase payment situation Key problem/issue : The study intended to exami ne the extent of Asian an d Hispanic consumers' use of credit and their attitudes towards ow nership and use, to explore whether measurable differences exist betw een Asian and Hispanic consumer users/holders and how their behavior is affected by credit cards and to investigate selected purchase/payment situations that affect Asian and Hispanic consumers' decisions to use credit cards and other payment methods. The variables measured in this study we re credit card possession and payment method use. Methodology: A stratified sampling method was used and data was collect ed from a sample of Asian and Hispanic household s in the north-east region of the United States. A total of 201 questionnaires were completed. Results: The results of the study indicate that marketers should emphasize the usefulness of credit cards and encourage Asian and Hi spanic consumers to use them more often. In addition, these consumers should be motivated to carry multiple cards. Due to the continuing significant influx of Asians and Hispanics into USA, these cultures are ripe for credit cards. The study also suggests that checks usage among Asians and Hispanics is another source of income for banks. Marketers and merchants should start to examine their check acceptance policies more closely and consider guaranteeing checks and check verification programmes. Banks and credit card companies should also consider going after the significant 15ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY proportion of Asians and Hispanics who pay cash for rent/house payments. Card associations could use transaction dat a to create profit ability modules to encourage members to market cash advances more vigorously. The increased acceptance of credit cards in Asian and Hispanic markets is indicative of the potential for future growth of the gener al payment business and the markets will develop rapidly once the educational and cultural barriers to card usage are broken. 16ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Delener, N. and Neelankavil, J.

Key problem/Issue: This article studies the Hispanic and Asian markets in t he U.S., comparing and contrasting their unique market behavior. The study specifically focuses on their media preferences and how media is used as an informational source for making purchasing decisions as well as collecting general information. Methodology: Personal interviews were conducted in New York metropo litan area. New York has a high concentration of both Hispanic and Asian subcultures. The sample data was drawn from a conveni ence sample of 203 respondents. Results/Findings: The most important media in reaching Hispanics appear to be television and radio. The higher preferences for the two media could also be supported by the availability of Hispanic TV net works and radio stations. Observations Both Asians and Hispanic exhibit cl ear-cut and unique media preferences. The U.S. Asian market is much more co mplex; there are many more languages and cultures involved within the Asian market. 17ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY DeSheilds W O, Santos G, Berumen A .O, Torres O.C.C. (1997). Salesperson's accent and gender and consum er purchase intentions: implications for Latino salespersons in Mexico and the United States. Key words : spokesperson's credibility, Tajfel's decoding theory Key problem/issue: The study was a test of the ability of Tajfel's decoding theory to explain the influence of a Latino salesperson's credi bility as measured by ender and accent on the purchase intentions of Am erican and Mexican consumers. Methodology: A hypothetical sales pitch was prepared with an American English accent, Mexican English accent, Mexican Spanish accent and English Spanish accent and eight commercials were produced. A total of 1821 respondents were exposed to the tapes in a univers ity classroom or mall setting. Results: The results of this study show that ther e is a significant im pact on the purchase intentions of American and Mexican consumers that can be attributed to the relationship between the spokesperson's gender and accent and the gender of the respondent. The study also indicates that when addressing an audience in the United States, a s pokesperson having a Standard English accent has an advantage over a spokesper son speaking with a Spanis h English accent. The finding is significant since it suggests a compel acculturation for the Hispanic population in the sample along the language pronunciati on dimension of the new environment, i.e., identification of cr edibility is transferred to the language standard of the new host country. 18ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations: Since this study was done in 1997, there might be significant differences if the study was to be conducted again. Due to the influx and 'mainstreaming' of various cultures, accents might not be seen in the same light as before. 19ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Deshpande, R. and Stayman, D. (1994). A tale of Two Cities: Distinctiveness Theory and Advertising Effectiveness. Journal of Marketing Research , 31, 57-64. Key problem/Issue: Applying distinctiveness theory to adver tising persuasion, the researchers found that members of minority vers us majority groups found an ad spokesperson from their own ethnic gr oup to be more trustworthy and that increased trustworthiness led to more positive attitudes toward the brand being advertised. Methodology: The study was a 2x2x2 between-subjects factorial. The independent variables were the subjects' ethnic situat ion (either Anglo or Hispanic majority) the subjects' ethnicity (Angl o or Hispanic), and the ethnici ty of the spokesperson in the ad (Anglo or Hispanic). Subjects we re asked first to read the script for the proposed radio commercial, then complete the dependent measures, and finally, answer information about themselves. Results/Findings: Minority group consumers are more likel y to spontaneously evoke their ethnic identities when they are in numerical minority rather than a majority in their cities. Hispanic (the traditional \"minor ity\" group) consumers were more likely to believe that a Hispanic spokesperson was trustworthy when they lived in Austin than when they lived in San Antonio. Hispanic consumers in Austin were more likely than those in San Antonio to have posit ive attitudes toward a brand whose ad featured a Hispanic spokesperson. 20ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Deshpande, R., Hoyer, W. and Donthu, N. (1986). The Intensity of Ethnic Affiliation: A Study of the Sociology of Hispanic Consumption. Journal of Consumer Research , 13, 214-220. Key problem/Issue: The article examines Hispanic consum ers and uses recent developments in sociology and anthropology to show that most work on the Hispanic market has overlooked certain major ethnic identif ication differences between groups of Hispanics. Implications of these differ ences for future research and theory on consumer subcultures are developed base d on an empirical study comparing Hispanics and Anglo Americans. Methodology: The sample was drawn from two voter registration lists of a central Texas county. One was composed entirely of Spanish surn ames and the other of non- Spanish surnames. From each list, 1, 000 names were randomly selected and questionnaires were sent to every househo ld. In addition, a follow-up was sent 10 days after the initial mailing. In total 529 questionnaires were returned. The first step in the development of t he survey instrument involved the construction of an English questionnaire containing several sets of questions: ethnicity measures, attitude scales, brand loyalty-related questions, purchase influences and general demogr aphics. A Spanish versi on of the questionnaire was constructed in three steps using the back-translation method suggested by Green and White (1976). First, the questi onnaire was translated into Spanish. Second, two Spanish-speaking research assistants who had not seen the English version back-translated it into English. Results/Findings: The results appear to largely confirm the importance of usi ng the strength of ethnic identification as a measure of et hnicity. Not only are there the expected 21ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY differences between the dominant Anglo group and the entire Hispanic group, but the latter group itself can be seen to be non-homogeneous. Differences between Hispanics appear to be especially strong in terms of their attitudes toward institutions (business and government), use of Spanish-language media, brand loyalty, and preferences for prestige and ethnically advertised brands. To some extent, there appears to be more similari ty between Weak Hispanic identifiers and Anglos (particularly in terms of a le sser preference for pres tige and ethnically advertised brands) than between the two Hispanic groups. 22ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Dimofte, C., Forehand, M. and Deshpande, R. (2004). Ad Schema Incongruity ad Elicitor of Ethnic Self-Awareness and Differential Advertising Response. Journal of Advertising , 32, 7-17. Key problem/Issue: The present research assesses the influence of advertising execution variables on consumer social identific ation and advertising response. It is proposed that targeting strat egies that are incongruent with existing advertising schemata due to unusual use of identity cues can increase the salience of particular self-identification and influenc e consumer response to advertising targeting specific audiences. Methodology: Eighty-two staff members of a major university in Cali fornia took part in the experiment. Subjects were randomly selected from the university's employee records. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Upon entering the lab, participants were inform ed that the researchers were examining attitudes toward television media and that they would be asked to watch an eight- minute segment from a news program and then answer some questions about the program in the questionnaire packet. Results/Findings: The experiment provides evidence of the power of advertising context to elicit ethnic self-awareness. It was shown that unusual targeting strategies stimulated the processing of ethnic information and increased consumers' awareness of their group memberships, and also influenced consumers' responses to ads. The main theoretical cont ribution resides in the proposed role of advertising schema incongruity (or unusualness) in ac centuating the distin ctiveness-eliciting aptitudes of advertising target ing specific audiences. 23ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations According to Dimofte, Forehand and De shpande (2004) the results suggest that, on one hand, schema incongruity is an appropriate variable to have in mind when designing target marketing strat egies, but, on the other hand, careful attention should be paid to the potentia l negative reactions of the non-target audience membership. 24ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Dolinsky, C. and Feinberg, R. (1986) . Linguistic Barriers to Consumer Information Processing: Information Overload in the Hispanic Population. Psychology and Marketing , 3, 261-271. Key problem/Issue: This study examined the relations hip between information overload and linguistic decision making. Americ ans and Hispanics were presented with varying amounts of consumer informa tion in their nativ e and non-native language. Methodology: One hundred and sixty biling ual students at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, were randomly assigned to conditions in a 2 (native language ability\u2014English or Spanish) X 2 (consum er information pr esented in either English or Spanish) X 4 (levels of consumer information\u201416, 64, 144, or 256 items of information) factorial design. This design was m odeled upon previous successful investigations of the overlo ad phenomenon in which subjects were exposed to hypothetical profiles of potential houses (e.g., Malhotra, 1982). In this study subjects made a house purchase decision. Each house description had either 4, 8, 12, or 16 attributes. There were either 4, 8, 12, or 16 houses described. Therefore, each subject was exposed to either 4 houses with 4 attributes, 8 houses with 8 attributes, 12 houses with 12 attributes or 16 houses with 16 attributes. Subjects were exposed to either16, 64,144, or 256 pieces of information before having to decide about which house they would choose. The two groups, Native English and Native Spanish speakers were as equally proficient in each other's second lang uage as was possible with the limited subject population. 25ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY The materials developed were equivalent in every way except the language they were printed in. All written material was put through double-blind translation procedures until the English version wa s translated to a nearly equivalent Spanish version and vice versa. Results/Findings: Individuals' possibility of making an opt imal decision decreas ed as the level of information increased. However, the controversy about the existence of information overload is more clearly defined by the inabi lity to get an information overload effect using the \"deviation\" me thod (amount of information overload) of operationally defin ing overload. Information can act as a stressor, a ffecting decision making in a non-native language prior to affecting decision making in a dominant language. Information overload occurred sooner in Hispanics and Amer icans when consumer information was presented in their non-dominant language, so marketers need to be sensitive to the fact that, even if proficient, Hispanics and other linguistic minorities may have difficulty processing consumer information and making effective consumer decisions when that information is presented in their non- dominant language. At some point, inform ation levels overload the processing system making consumers less able to make effective consumer decisions. Observations The methodologies used don't allow for very conclusive results, as the sample was only taken from students. In addition, because of the limited sample, all participants may not have been fully bilingual. 26ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Donthu, N. and Cherian, J. (1994). Impact of Strength of Ethnic Identification on Hispanic Shopping Behavior. Journal of Retailing , 70, 383-393. Key problem/Issue: In this study, retail shopping behavior differences between strongly and weakly identified Hispanics is exami ned. The authors argue that one key variable tying ethnicity of a consumer to retail shopping behavior is the strength of ethnic identification. C onsequently, all hypotheses that relate ethnicity to retail shopping behavior must be moderated by how strongly the consumer feels affiliated to the ethnic group. Methodology: One thousand random addresses with Hispanic surnames were obtained from a leading Marketing Research firm. Only those respondents who self- identified themselves as His panic were included in the study. Questionnaires were first translated from English to Spanish and back from Spanish to English until the versions in bot h languages were judged to be the same by bilingual students. Both versions were also pr e-tested using a convenience sample to check for possible errors in and during administration. Questionnaires in both languages were ma iled to the national sample and the \"adult of the household\" was requested to complete the questionnaire using the version (English or Spanis h) that they felt most comfortable with. No remuneration was provided for participati on. A total of 281 questionnaires were returned. Of these, only 240 were used because the remaining 41 did not identify themselves as Hispanic. While the response rate was 28.1%, only 24% were used in the analyses. Results/Findings: The results show that for services, Strongly Identified Hispanics are more likely than Weakly Identified Hispanics to seek Hispanic vendors, especially for 27ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY low involvement services; and for products, Strongly Identif ied Hispanics are more likely than Weakly Identified Hispanics to be loyal to brands used by family and friends, to be influenced by targeted media and to be less concerned about economic value. The Strong/Weak ethnic identification scheme allows the retailer a segmentation basis that is: 1) measurable, as indicate d by the survey technique used; 2) substantial, as indicated by Hispanic demogr aphics; 3) accessible, as indicated by the identifiabl e behaviors with respect to us e of formal and informal communication; and 4) actiona ble, as indicated by id entifiable differences in behavior vis-\u00e0-vis the elements of the marketing mix. 28ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Donthu, N. and Cherian, J. (1992). His panic Coupon Usage: The Impact of Strong and Weak Ethni c Identification. Psychology and Marketing , 9, 501-510. Key problem/Issue: This article argues that the strength of ethnic identif ication, which measures the strength to which a person feels tied to the cultur e of origin, is a key variable in understanding the impact of ethnicity on response to marketing mixes. This study analyzes Hispanic consumers and demonstrates that weak Hispanic identifiers are quite different from st rong Hispanic identifiers in their coupon usage, and that weak Hispani c identifiers are more lik e the dominant culture. Methodology: One thousand nationwide addresses with Hispanic surnames were obtained from a leading marketing research firm. The intended questionnaires were first translated from English to Spanish, and ba ck from Spanish to English, until the versions in both languages were judged to be the same by bilingual students. After pre-testing, questionnaires in bot h languages were mailed to the national sample; of these, 281 were returned. From the response s, 41 had to be eliminated because they di d not identify themselves as Hispanic. The final response rate of 24% is acceptable for surveys on national samples. Results/Findings: The strong Hispanic identifier uses fe wer coupons because (a) they are more brand loyal and have ethnic pride: (b ) they use Spanish magazines and newspapers more and hence may not be ex posed to the actual coupons, or information about coupons as much as we ak Hispanics; and (c) they are less responsive to in-store marketing tactics. Strong Hispanic identifiers use fewer coupons because of cultural factors and not because of economic factors. 29ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations For the practitioner, there are two major implications: first, when targeting the Hispanics, use the ap propriate media for strong and weak Hispanic identifiers, and use this media appropriately. Seco nd, the use of c oupon-based promotions should be tied to culturally driven behaviors or events. 30ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Dunn, E.

Key problem/Issue: In 1972, a significant media-ori ented study was condu cted among Mexican- Americans in several cities across the Southwest. The aim was to collect data which would be useful in producing te levision programs for Mexican American audiences. The research discuss ed here expanded upon the concomitant variation found in the survey dat a collected in San Antonio. Methodology: A telephone survey was conducted in San Antonio early in 1972; approximately 1500 attempted calls yielded 739 completed interviews. Data were collected only from respondents who were at least 18 years old and who had Spanish surnames or coul d otherwise be identified as Mexican-American. The telephone numbers were selected randomly from the San Antonio telephone directory. Results/Findings: The San Antonio Mexican- American community was found to be comprised of at least five identifiable subgroups of individuals- the subgroups being defined by clusters of social and personal charac teristics on the one hand, and media habits and preferences on the other. Observations At the most general level, the present study was one in audience definition, based on the notion that a more precise definition of an audience of mass communication will yield a greater understanding of the process of mass communication. It is believed that the identific ation of the several clusters of similar subgroups within a minority population adds something to the precision with which an audience can be defined. 31ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Eastlick A.M, Lotz L.S. (2000). Object ive and multidimensio nal acculturation measures: implications for retailing to His panic consumers. J ournal of Retailing and Consumer Services. 7: 149-160. Key problems/issues: The study examines accultur ation measures as predict ors of differences among Hispanic consumers with respect to s hopping orientations, attitudes towards retailer attributes and information source preferences. Methodology: Data for the study were collected using mall intercepts which were conducted by interviewers. A total of 1445 intercepts were made during the two week period. Of those intercepts 388 surveys were completed of which 378 were usable. Results: The study's evidence suggests that accu lturation does differentially affect Hispanic consumers' attitudes on some factors. Those shopping attitudes which were not influenced by a cculturation levels in t he US culture encompassed shopping orientations, including those orientations focusing on brands and low pricing/value. The researchers suggest that more research is needed that focus on varied socioeconomic groups of Hispanics for a deeper understanding underlying these results. The results also suggest culturally relation attitudes for upscale Hispanic consumers may be differentia ted by levels of acculturation. The study reveals evidence that less accu lturated Hispanic consumers are more incline to have positive attitudes towards retailers that cater to their cultural needs through provisions of cultura lly oriented merchandise and Spanish speaking sales personnel. The study also indicates that both types of acculturation measures, objective and multid imensional. Are similar predictors of shopping attitudes among Hispanics cons umers and that, independent of the type of acculturation measur e, the strongest prediction by both measures was for culturally related phenomenon 32ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations: The intercept method of the study does not generate a rando m sample of the shopping population. 33ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Faber, R., O'Guinn, T. and McCarty, J.

Key problem/Issue: This investigation examined the rela tionship between su b-cultural group membership and the importance of vari ous products attributes in purchase decisions. Sub-cultural gr oup membership was defined on the basis of Hispanic ethnicity and level of assessed acculturation. Methodology: Data for this investigation were collected during the fall of 1983 and early spring of 1984. Chicago was selected bec ause it represents the sixth largest concentration of Hispanics in the United States. A telephone interview of approximately 25 minutes gathered an ext ensive set of data regarding many aspects of buyer behavior, demography, media exposure , and attitudes toward advertising and advertisers. A total of 205 Hispanics and 105 Anglo interviews were conducted. There were two separat e instruments for respondents to choose from, one in English, the other in Spanish. Results/Findings: The results of the present study indicate that there are cultural differences involved in the evaluation of the impor tance of some product attributes. The highly acculturated Hispanics had importance ratings of attributes that fell between the low acculturated Hispani cs and the host Anglo culture. Observations The authors recommend seeing accult uration as an ongoing process. The use of longitudinal research designs is necessary to focus on how and why changes occur during this process. 34ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Fennell G, Saegert J, Piron F, Jimenex R. (1992). Do Hispanics constitute a market segment? Advances in consumer research. 19: 28-33 Key problems/issues: The study answers questions relating to targeting a br oad Hispanic segment; how to go about selection of attributes and implication of such special targeting for the firms' overall marketing efforts. Methodology: The study is an analysis of exis ting literature in the field. Results: The authors argue against a homogeneous Hispanic marketing segment. While Fenell et. al acknowledge that it is necessary to think of markets as segmented since choosing brand attributes require s reducing heterogeneity, they suggest that Hispanics, or any other ethnic group are not homogeneous with their wants and desires. Identifying an ethnic group as a market segment fails to deal both with the heterogeneity of conditions within and similarity of conditions across ethnic groups. In line with the marketing concept ie., brands are formulated to respond to a subset of prospects' wants, the notion of a Hispa nic, or any other ethnic, \"market segment\" is an oxymoron. The researchers suggest following a marketing strategy as outlined in Fene ll (1982) which outlines categories of motivation that lay the groundwork for differentiating brand offerings and developing marketing strategy. A further unexamined reason for recommending ethnicity as a basis for marketing strategy is the characteristic preference for the Spanish language by many Hispanics. Thus the cause of Hispanic marketing is not well served by such studies repor ted in the \"marketing to Hispanics\" literature. A research des ign that is chosen to s how differences between Hispanics and non Hispanics is irrelevant to how a pro ducer should proceed in trying to find favor with Hispanics and it es tablishes nothing to show a producer that his/her scarce resources are going to be well spent by being diverted to a 35ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY special Hispanic effort. Issues under a number of headings should be disentangled including c oncepts of social justice, marketing science and marketing practice. 36ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Fullerton, J. and Kendrick, A.

Key problem/Issue: While numerous studies have analyzed the portrayal of women in U.S. general market television as well as the depiction of both sexes in several foreign countries, no data have been published rega rding gender depictions targeted to the growing U.S. Hispanic market via Span ish-language television. The purpose of this study is to describe in detail the manner in which Hispanic women and men are portrayed in U.S. network Sp anish-Language television, and to the extent possible, compare the findings here in with existing studies of the portrayal of men and women in major U.S. m edia and media in other countries. Methodology: A quantitative analysis content of 162 prim e-time commercials from Spanish- language television affiliate in a major U.S. market was conducted. Eighteen hours of prime-time programming (7 p.m.-10p.m.) from Univision Network affiliate in Dallas, Texas were collected between 29 December 1997 and 7 January 1998. Results/Findings: The study revealed that the depiction of women is most likely to be in traditional sex-stereotypical roles. In onl y a few cases was a male character cast as a parent or performer of household chor es, and never as a homemaker. This study revealed that there is limited sexual imagery in Hispanic television commercials. Major U.S. consumer products companies appear to be advertising to the lucrative Hispanic market in many of the same ways that they advertise to the general market. 37ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations This study, the first of its kind, found that sex ro le stereotypes exist in Spanish-language television commercials, but to no greater ex tent and in some cases to a lesser extent than they do in U.S. general market television advertising. 38ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Hacker, K.&Steiner, R.

Key problems/issues: The research objective guiding the study concerns discovering differences there may be in Internet usage between Anglo and Hispanic Americans. Methodology: Respondents of this study were samp led through a random sample telephone survey from the municipal area in the southwest. Results/Findings: The study found that Inter net usage frequency is correlated significantly for all users with skills, opportunities, and comfort. The researchers also found that there is a digital divide- gaps between His panic and Anglo Amer icans in Internet skills and opportunities for using the inte rnet with Anglo Americans having the advantage. The researchers found that Angl os are higher on skills even when controlling for education and income. Therefor e, the study indicates that income and or education does not subsume ethni c differences in Internet usage frequency or benefits, however, there is little data available that indicates why these gaps exist. Hacker and Steiner sugges t that there is an ethnic lag in network society and digita l democracy. The researchers suggest that because Hispanic Americans have suffered discrimin ation and marginalization, they have formed tighter ethic community ties that make internet communication a less pressing need as a source of information. Previous findings: -Parent concern about pornography -Internet taking away time from family communication 39ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations By identifying what hurdles and benef its are most important for ethnic differences, policy makers can make more informed decision about what to do about the digital divide. It is important to realize that Internet adoption differs from other modes of mass communication (i.e., TV , radio etc) due to the active skill that is required that are non existent in the passive process of watching TV and radio. Furthermore, internet usage adopti on is cumulative i.e., one technology release builds on the prev ious one beginning with computer adoption and skills continuing through to networking, software, programming etc. 40ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Herbig, P. and Yelkur, R.

Methodology: Theoretical approach. Results/Findings: Hispanics today are targeted regularly in Spanish as well as English-language ads. Hispanics have traditionally (and to th is day) tended to be fiercely brand loyal. They are willing to pay extra to purchase quality products for their family. Hispanic immigrants gener ally gravitate to brands t hey knew in their native country. Hispanics spend more than non-Hispanic whites and African-Americans on food. They tend to eat at home more ; therefore, in-hom e food preparation costs tend to be higher. They tend to be greater users of te lephone services as well. Observations No set of guidelines can capture the fu ll flavor, vitality, and special needs of the Hispanic market. The Hispanics have model demographic q ualities of high family values, work ethics and stability. They have a distinct identity, set of values, mode of expression and language. They hold fast to their language, customs, and culture, and are willing participants in the American Dream. Hispanics are here to stay and s hould not be taken lightly. 41ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Hernandez, S. and Newman, L. (1992).

Methodology: Literature review Results/Findings: Although most advertisers bel ieve that it is best to advertise to Hispanics in Spanish, empirical evidence s eems to suggest that is more effective to advertise to Hispanics in their dominant la nguage, whether Spanish or English. Observations The authors advance a series of pr opositions about the choice of language in advertising to Hispanics: a.

Patterns of cognition typifying each group are compared for four consumption-salient constructs: novelty seeking, information transfer, divergent processing ability, and consumption motives. Methodology: A mailing list for New York City S.M.S. A. households having annual income greater than $25,000 and professional managerial occupat ional status for the household head was purchased from a national marketing research firm. A total of 700 5-page questionnaires was mailed to list households. The primary analytical technique employ ed for comparing the cogni tive structures of the nationality subcultures was factor analysis. Results/Findings: It was found that a wide range of inter-g roup congruence is present: in some cases consumers in different ethnic subc ultures have very dissimilar cognitive structures; while in other instances strong similarity is present.

Key problem/Issue: To test the international applicability of the concept of perceived risk, and the relationship between perceived risk and bra nd loyalty, in order to provide some indication of the extent to which this relationship can be assumed to exist by international marketers. Methodology: In this study, samples of upper-middle and upper class female s were selected from Houston, Texas, and Monterrey, Mexico. The two cities are generally comparable in terms of size and economic base, both being large industrial centers. Chi-square analysis was used to test for differences in perceived risk levels between the two samples. A 2 x 7 analysis of variance was used to test for national differences in br and loyalty, the existence of an overall relationship between brand loyalty and perceived risk , and most importantly, national differences in the relationship between brand loyalty and perceived risk. Results/Findings: It appears that risk is a less important determinant of purchase behavior in Mexico than in the United States. A possible explanation of these lower risk levels involves the fatalism that is repor ted to characterize Mexican society. Observations On a more general level, the findings ra ise the question of the applicability of employing other concepts of consum er behavior in overseas markets. Considerable international research is necessary to answer this question. 45ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Hudson, J.C, Watts, E (1996) . Hispanics preferences fo r health care providers and health care information. Health Marketing Quarterly. 14(1): 67-83 Key problems/issues: The study explored (1) Hispanics sources of information for health care services and physicians (2) preferences for physicians and (3) differences among the responses based on the participants' dem ographic variables. The researchers further tried to (1) identify health care habits of Hispanics (2) identify members of family who make healthcare decisions within the Hispanic household (3) identify Hispanic preferences for physicians based on physician's race and sex. Method: A random sample of 1500 telephone num bers purchased from a commercial direct mail company using an updated vers ion of the 1990 US Census data for Lubbock County, Texas. The sample in cluded only Hispanic residents with telephones. The data reported in this st udy regarding health care decisions among Hispanics was part of a larger study conducted by the researchers that also included Hispanic media use and preferences. Results: The responses provided by the sample by the sample of Hispanics in this study suggested that only 35% of the respondents or someone in their household had been hospitalized during the previous six mont hs; however, about 61% had visited a physician during the same perio d of time. Only 40% sought a second opinion. Additionally, 85% had hospitalizatio n insurance and 72% had some form of life insurance. About 64% of the respondents indicated that most of the health care decisions for the family were made by the mother. Male respondents were less likely than female respondents to identify the mother as the health care decision maker in the family. The study did not find that raci al and ethnic minorities were disproportionately insured as previous literature indicat ed. Media were not major 46ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY sources of information among Hispanics for health care services and physicians as was also noted in previ ous literature. Hispanics seem to value opinions and information provided by family and friends. However, media may have been a source of information that was used to assimilate and integr ate with opinions of family and friends. The study supported previous research regarding self efficacy. Hispanics in this study seemed to rely more on self efficacy and internal communication than media. The Hispanic mother was the health care decision maker in the family and she was not likely to have a reference for physicians based on the physician's sex or race. The researc hers suggest that messages must be targeted to the likely consumers of the message and health care decision makers in the Hispanic family. Observations: The study did not address gende r differences in illnesses and incidences. It also did not look specifically at which family members go to the hospital or what the frequencies of illnesses are. 47ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Kara, Ali; Kara, Natasha R.

It explored the importance of product attributes and attribute levels fo r three groups: Hispanics with a low level of acculturation, Hispanics with a high level of accult uration and Anglos in order to predict their choices for different products/services. Methodology: A questionnaire was developed for the data co llection. Each conjoint calibration questionnaire contained (1) attribute leve l rating, (2) relative importance of attributes, (3) profile evaluation information and (4) a detailed demographic profile section. A convenience sample of 298 undergraduat e and some graduate students were approached on a large state university campus in South Florida. The resultant sample consisted of 53% male and 47% female respondents. Their ages ranged from 18 to 45, with the average age being 24 years old. The SBM (Single-Beta-Main Effect) hybrid conj oint model was used for analysis. The product/service contexts used were job se lection and toothpast e choice and were selected so they would be meaningful to subjects and could be characterized by multi-attributes. Results: The result of the study indicated that Hispanics with a high leve l of acculturation and Anglos were very similar to each ot her but different from Hispanics with a low level of acculturation in terms of t he utilities placed on the product attributes of jobs and toothpaste. There were dist inct differences bet ween job selection choice especially on attributes like loca tion, prestige, rec ognition and personal development. In case of toothpaste choice, the differences were mainly on 48ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY attributes such as brand, ADA certif ication and purpose of use. The results indicated enough evidence to conclude t hat the degree of acculturation is a critically important segm entation variable for both high and low involvement products. To target Hispani cs with a low level of accu lturation marketers can emphasize the attributes t hat were placed on high utility by this group using communication media. To target Hispanics with a high level of acculturation, marketing strategies similar to those for Anglos may be used. Observations The extent of the study was not capable in drawing general conclusions about Hispanics in US since the sample was li mited to college goi ng Hispanics in South Florida. 49ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Kaufman, C.

Methodology: The author conducted an exploratory survey of food-related retailers who serve ethnic markets. Interviewers we re required to select a neighborhood grocery/food store, then identify its prim ary target market as one or more ethnic groups. For this exploratory work, a conven ience sample of elig ible retailers was employed. Results/Findings: This exploratory study had three primary findings: a. Ethnic brands are overwhelmingly preferred by consumers in ethnic markets. b. Over half of the retailers surv eyed (66 percent) reported little or no use of coupons by their costumers. c. Major barriers exist because coupons are not available for the brands carried and are also not available to customers.

Key problem/Issue: This study was undertaken to fill the gap in the literature of Hispanics' view of Direct Marketing Advertising (DMA). The ai ms of the study were twofold: first, to study Hispanic consumers' beliefs, a ttitudes, and past purchase behaviors in response to direct marketing advertisi ng, and second, to compare differences among subgroups of the Hispanic market. Methodology: Data for the study were collected via personal interview of 425 consumers in the southeastern part of t he USA by interviewers flu ent in both English and Spanish. Results/Findings: The degree of assimilation into mainst ream American cultur e is a critical factor in segmenting the Hispanic market. Such language-based segmentation will assist direct market ers in understanding the va lues, beliefs, usage, and norms relating to product/service offerings as viewed by the two different groups (assimilated and less assimilated Hispanics). Observations It is apparent from other areas of bus iness and form politics that the Hispanic American population is becoming more li ke the rest of the USA in its demographics and especially in its income and education profile. 51ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Korgaonkar, P., Silverblatt, R. and O'Lear y, B..

However, little is known regarding how Hispanics view and use Web advertising. Methodology: The survey instrument included seve ral statements designed to measure the participants' beliefs and attitude towa rd Web advertising.

The respondents were given the choice of responding to an English or Spanish questionnaire. Results/Findings: Hispanic Web users' level of intere st in Web advertisement correlates significantly with their perceptions about providing useful product information, enhancing social roles, hedonism/ enhancing pleasure, being good for the economy, promoting materialism, and not being false, along with their attitude toward Web advertising and their education level. Observations Hispanic consumers in the USA are more responsive to advertising compared to the average U.S. consumer.

Key problem/Issue: The authors apply sociolinguistic theor ies of accommodation to investigate how consumers in a minority subculture respond to the use of their ethnic language in advertising. Specifically, Hi spanic consumers' responses to the varying degrees of Spanish-language usage in print advertising were examined. Methodology: Field interviewing with a between-subj ects design was employed. Each subject was shown only one of four adver tisements during the interview. Using a convenience sampling approach, here bilingual in terviewers conducted 413 field interviews. The stimulus materials and questionnaires were administered to Spanish-speaking Hispanics at three S outhern California supermarkets in Hispanic neighborhoods. Results/Findings: It was found that the effect s of Spanish usage in advertising can be usefully explained by accommodation theory. Sp anish language advertising increased Hispanic consumers' percepti on of advertisers' sensitivit y to Hispanic culture and people, and this perception in turn enhanced affect toward the advertisements. However, the results also suggest that advertisers should use some mixture of Spanish and English. 53ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations Hispanics value the use of Spanish less for what the advertisement communicates about products than for wh at Spanish usage signals about the importance of Hispanics co nsumers. Importantly , the mixed-language advertisements have the most positive th ings to say about Hispanics, and this may have much to do with how Hispanics are viewed by mainstream Anglo- American culture. 54ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY LaChausse, R.G.

Key problems/Issue: The current study examines the attit udes and media literacy skills of Hispanics migrant farm workers regarding tobacco advertising to provide an evidence- based approach for program planning effort s for health education specialists. Methodology: The participants were 414 Hispanic migrant farm workers in Imperial County, California. The participants were recruited by contacting field supervisors at five area agricultural fields and making annou ncements during lunch breaks. Surveys were collected during one visit at the five agricultural fields. A 12-item questionnaire was developed to assess effects of tobacco ads on attitudes, exposure to tobacco ads and beliefs re garding tobacco use. Media literacy was also assessed. The questionnaire was also available in Spanish and English. Results/findings: Hispanic migrant farm workers are particu larly susceptible to U.S. tobacco advertising along the U.S./Mexico bor der. Among the same group, low media literacy exists, especially among males. Hispanics perception of the number of tobacco users in the U.S. may be infl uenced by tobacco adver tisements. While children of these farmers might rece ive school based education on anti-tobacco they are less likely to receive the sa me messages at home. Hispanic migrant farm workers are not likely to believe tobacco ads are directed at them. Observations: Primary prevention and educ ation strategies should focus on increasing media literacy skills. 55ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Landeck, M. and Garza, C.

Results/findings: The main Laredo users of Mexican physi cians come from low income group (48.8%) followed by the somewhat mo re affluent group (46.3%) and less by the upper income group (21.5%). The utilizat ion of these services declines with education level. The difference in utiliz ing these services does not differ significantly with gender. In conclusion, 41.2 percent of U.S. border city's population is utilizing physician health care services in Mexico. 56ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations: This study contributes for the first time , according to its authors, evidence that quantitatively represents t he magnitude of this problem clang the U.S.-Mexican border. 57ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Larson, M. (2002). Race and Interracial Relationships in Children's Television Commercials. The Howard Journal of Communications , 13, 223-235. Key problem/Issue: The study attempts to describe not only the proportions of racial portrayals, but also the settings, activities, in teractions, and products advertised in commercials in which White children and AHANA (African American, Hispanic, Asian Native American) children were portrayed together compared to when White children were alone. Methodology: Quantitative content analys is was used as the methodology for this study. Children's programming on t he broadcast network of ABC , CBS, and FOX, plus Nickelodeon was taped. The unit of analysis was the physical appearance for a real or animated child. Results/Findings: A total of 892 commercials were aired, 595 of which featured at least one real or animated child. 42% of the commercials featured only White children, 57% featured White and AHANA children toge ther, and 1% featured only AHANA children. The proportion of ra cial representation, the pr esence of diversity within commercials, and the fact that Whit e and AHANA children are portrayed interacting and communicating in cooperative ways are positive. However, the very low frequency of commercials with on ly AHANA children suggests that there is much progress yet to be made in re presentations of race in television commercials. Observations This study is one of a few, if not t he only one, to empirically examine the portrayal of race and interracial relationshi ps available in television commercials in children's television programming. 58ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Luna, D. & Peracchio, L. (2005), \"Advertisi ng to Bilingual cons umers: The Impact of Code-Switching on Persuasion\", Journal of Consumer Research, 31, 760-765 . Key problem/Issue: This research focuses on English- Spanish code-swit ching among U.S. Hispanics. Code-switching refers to insertion of a foreign word or expression into a sentence, resulting in a mixed language. Methodology: A between-subjects experiment was cond ucted in which two factors were manipulated: 1) direction of code-switchin g (majority to minority or minority to majority) and 2) attitude toward language (positive toward the majority language or positive toward the mi nority language). A total of 70 fluent Spanish-English bilinguals participated in the study. Al l respondents were either foreign-born Hispanics or first-generat ion Hispanic Americans. Results/Findings: The study found a code-switching directio n effect such that minority-language slogans switching to the majority langu age resulted in greater persuasion than majority-language slogans switching to t he minority language. The effect was attributed to the salience of the code-switched word in the slogan. Observations Luna and Peracchio (2005) pub lished two papers from their code-switching research, one of them in the Journal of Consumer Rese arch and the other one in the Journal of Advertisi ng. These papers are pionee rs in the study of code- switching strategy in advert ising messages to Hispanics. 59ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Luna, D. & Peracchio, L. (2005), \"Socioli nguistics Effects on Code-Switched Ads Targeting Bilingu al Consumers,\" Journal of Advertising , 34 (2), 43-57. Key problem/Issue: The research deals with the consequ ences of code-switching in ad persuasiveness. In advertising, code-swit ching generally consists of inserting a foreign word or expression into an ad sl ogan, resulting in a mixed-language message. Methodology: A between-subjects experiment was cond ucted in which two factors were manipulated: direction of code-switching (majority to minority or minority to majority) and attitude toward code-switchin g (positive, negative, neutral). A total of 105 fluent Spanish-English bili nguals participated in the study. Results/Findings: Majority-language slogans that switch to the minority language were found to be generally less persuasive than minority-language slogans that switch to the majority. Code-switching results in the acti vation of associations relevant to the language which the slogan switches to. If a slogan switches to possesses positive (negative) associations, cons umers engage in positive (negative) elaboration, resulting in higher (lower) evaluations. Observations Luna and Peracchio (2005) published two papers from their codes-switching research, one of them in the Journal of Consumer Rese arch and the other one in the Journal of Advertisi ng. These papers are pionee rs in the study of code- switching strategy in advert ising messages to Hispanics. 60ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Luna, D. and Gupta, S.F.

Key problems/ Issue: This article presents a framework that integrates and reinterprets current research in cross cultural consumer behavior. The study also identifies areas that need further research and can be used as a template for marketers seeking to understand their foreign consumers. The study also attempts to include an anthropological approach and cross cultural psychology tradition in the study of culture and consumer behavior. Methodology: The method used in this study represents a review of the lit erature with regards to various aspects of cult ure and consumer behavior. Results/fidings: The study describes the difference between emic (understanding issues from the perspective of the subject being studied) and etic (collectiv e programming of the mind that distinguishes the individuals from a group wit h other individuals from another group) approaches to culture. In addition, culture influences consumer behavior through its manifestations that include values, her oes, rituals and symbols. More specifically, consumer behavior is affected by each of these manifestations at three different leve ls: cognition, affect and behavior. Very important, the relationship between cultural manifestat ions and dimensions of consumer behavior is bidirectional. Th is bidirectional relationship can be moderated by acculturation and marketing communication. 61ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations: Some recommendation for managers and market ers that want to enter a foreign market include evaluating which markets po sses similar cultural characteristics and then developing an appropriate marketing mix. In addition, marketing communication should be used to shift or reinforce cultural manifestations. 62ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Marin, G. and Gamba, R.

Key problems/Issue: The article reports the development of a bidimensional acculturation scale of a short 12-item for Hispanics. The scale pr ovides an acculturation score for two major cultural dimensions (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) by incl uding 12 items per cultural domain that measure three langua ge related areas. Methodology: Subjects were sampled using the Mito fski-Waksberg method for random digit dialing. A household was c onsidered eligible if thos e answering the phone self- identified as Hispanics or Lat ino or identified the majori ty of the residents in the household as Hispanics. The items in the survey covered topics such as frequency of use of English or Spanish in different contex ts, language-based media preferences and partici pation or preference fro cult ure specific occasions. Results: The scores obtained with the BAS show high internal consistency and high validity coefficients. The scale works well with Mexican Americans and with Central Americans. BAS continues to be dependent on language-related items and dimensions. The only social scale able to develop showed moderately good reliability but extremely weak validity coefficients. Observations: The researchers have failed to develop a scale that could measure acculturation on another dimension than language based it ems. This scale has shown to be reliable with Mexican American and Central American but has not yet to been tested with other Hispanic groups. 63ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Marin, G., Sabogal, F., Marin, B., S abogal, R., Perez-Stable, E.

Key problems/Issue: The article reports the development of a short 12-item acculturation scale for Hispanics. Methodology: Respondents were 363 Hispanics and 228 non-Hispanics whites who agreed to be interviewed or to answe r the questionnaire.

The new shorter scale correlat ed highly with the following validation criteria: generation, length of residence in the U.S., age at arrival, ethnic self- identification, and with an acculturation index. Th e validity and reliability coefficients for this new scale are comparable to thos e obtained for other published scales.

Key problem/Issue: This study will look at t he issue of exposure to alc ohol billboard adv ertising and drinking behaviors Mexican American youth. The study will evaluate the images depicted on alcohol billboards and exami ne the resultant relationship between exposure and beliefs. The theoretical framework of the study is based on Badura's social cognitive theory. Methodology: Both content analysis and surveys were conducted. The content analysis was conducted to establish the themes and im ages of alcohol around schools within a five mile radius. Then students were surveyed within 9-11 days from photographing the billboard adv ertisements. The dep endent variables included drinking intention, approval of underage drinking and soci al perception. The independent variables included attention (retention, production and motivation) and exposure frequency. Control variable s included parental approval and acculturation. Lastly, demographics char acteristics were also taken into consideration. Results/findings: The primary characteristic of the models depicted in t hese billboards would be sex appeal. It was also found that the billboards de pict one of the Mexican national colors (mainly red). The result s also found that romance was the most commonly occurring motif. Models and romance were significantly more likely to appear in ads with hard alcohol than bee r. Only measures of retention and motivation were found to have predictiv e ability. As retention and motivation increased so did the approval of under age drinking. Increase motivation was associated with increa sing levels of intent to drink. 65ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations: In this study the majority of the hy potheses failed to be supported.

(1999). Biased Attr ibutions of a Price Increas e: Effects of Culture and Gender. Journal of Consumer Marketing , 16, 9-23. Key problem/Issue: This research explores the effects of attribution on the eval uation of a price, especially a price increase. Attribution theory addresses how humans act as na\u00efve psychologists to expl ain causal relations. Methodology: The study of the influenc e of culture and gender on bi ased attributions of a price increase was conducted with a 2 x 2 x 2 between subjects design. The factors were culture (His panic and Anglo), gender (female and male) and price (same and increased). Two randomly assigned groups were used to compare the attributions of blame: the interfered actions of the seller when the price remained the same and when it was increased. Results/Findings: The assumption that Hispanics are more collectivist than Anglos was supported. Hispanic heritage was significantly associated with a collectivist orientation. The results of this resear ch suggest that biased attributions should be of concern to managers when they are making pricing strategy decisions. As a result of biased attri butions, consumers tend to ex plain the adverse outcomes of a price increase by plac ing blame on the seller. Observations The more positive attitude of Hispanics to wards sellers has a theoretical base in Hofstede's (1980) finding that His panics have greater \"p ower distance.\" Hofstede (1997, p.28) defines power distance as \"the extent to which the less powerful members of instit utions and organizations wit hin a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally.\" 67ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY McGorry, S.Y.

Key problem/Issue: This study focuses on the Puerto Rican population and the i ssues of quality in the delivery of health care services. The study reviews certain aspects that might influence the relationship between Latinos and health care services which include socioeconomic status, language, assimilation issues, familialism, spiritism, simpatia, respeto and cultural illnesses. Methodology: The sample was drawn from an obstetrics/gynecology clinic with large Puerto Rican patients in ur ban area of the north-eastern U.S. 105 patients completed the survey that was adapted from Parasuraman et al. (1988). The instrument was designed to measure both expectation and perceptions of service quality. Results/findings: Ten of the 22 expectation scores are lo wer than the perception scores. This conflicts with previous studies that show that the relationship should be inversed. The study yielded five dimensions of expectation (physical office, responsiveness, assurance, security and reliability) and four dimensions of perception (responsiveness, assurance, appear ance of office staff and reliability). Patients are more concerned with the physi cal aspects of the office therefore, providers should focus on this aspect more . Other improvements should take into consideration characteristics such as simpatia and respecto. Some of the confounding variables include income (63% of respondents hav e only one family member contributing to family income), cultural characteristics.

Key problem/Issue: Drawing on studies of Hispanic consumers for t angible products and services, this commentary suggests that the differences between Hispanic and non- Hispanic consumers are actually quite small. Methodology: A comparison of two research studies. The first study, the brand loyalty study conducted in early 1980s, hypothesized th at Hispanics were more brand loyal. The results, however, were not conclu sive. The second study, the legal expectations study, focused on preferences toward legal services to determine differences between the no n-Hispanic and Hispanic attit ude toward lawyers. And again the results were not conclusive.

(1994). A comparative analysis of shopping behavior in Hispanic and non-Hispanic market areas. Journal of Retailing, Vol. 70, No. 3, pp. 231 - 251. Key problems/Issue: The study attempts to determine the s hopping behavior of Hispan ics that live in Hispanic market areas. Since previous research has looked at the shopping behavior based on participants self-reports, the current study looks at the shopping behavior using scanning data to estimate econometric models of market response in three product categor ies: tuna fish, cake mix and gelatin. Market response for store located in Hispanic market areas are compared to responses for stores located in non-Hispanic market areas. Methodology: The authors looked at three aspects of shopping behavior: direct price responsiveness, brand substitution and store brand purchasing. Data were gathered using retail scanner representing brand sales and pric es on a weekly basis for a two year period in the late 1980's. The data we re obtained for six stores belonging to the same grocery chain and featuring the same price promotions. Researchers first located retail stores in market areas that had either high or low concentrations of Hispanic residents and than compared estimates for stores in the Hispanic mark et versus non-Hispanic market. Results/findings: Very few significant differences exist among stores in bot h the Hispanic and non- Hispanic market areas. The direct price responsiveness does not differ significantly for national brands but does so for store brands for tuna and gelatin for the Hispanic market versus the non-Hispanic market. For cake mix, significant differences occur for price responsive ness. Shoppers in the Hispanic market areas are no less prone to substitute brands than shoppers in the non-Hispanic market areas. Also, Hispanics do not have a national brand orientation than non- 71ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Hispanics. Most often, t here are not differences across market areas with regards to brand substitution bet ween national and store brands. Observations: The price sensitivity and pr opensity to substitute brands in response to price change among Hispanics suggest that retailers can influence the shopping behavior of Hispanics consumers with ca refully planned promotions. Also, retailers might want to consider carrying store brands specifically designed to satisfy the wants of Hispanic shoppers. 72ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Nicholls, J. (1997). Time and Companionship: Key Factors in Hispanic Shopping Behavior. Journal of Consumer Marketing , 14, 194-205. Key problem/Issue: This paper examines situational dim ensions affecting purchase behavior of Hispanic customers in a mall at some distance from their neighborhoods. Methodology: In the mall where this study was c onducted, there were four department stores and approximately 200 boutiques and specialty shops. Patrons who came to this mall were presented with a wide range of opportunities to consummate purchase of goods and services. This st udy examines the influence of four situational dimensions on four purchase behaviors of Hispanic mall shoppers. Using a randomized technique, respondents were approached after they had concluded their mall visit. Results/Findings: The Hispanics who spent more time in the mall purchased food or beverages, bought other products, spent $10 or more, and entered five or more stores. Since 80 to 100 shoppers spent an hour or more in the mall, Hispanics appeared to come with a distinct shopping pur pose. The presence of a companion appears to have been helpful in the purchase decision. Hispanics with companions entered more st ores and purchased food or beverage compared with those who came alone. 73ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Observations The major finding in this study relates to time: time spent in the mall is a central factor in the Hispanic shopping ex perience. In order to visit stores, consume food or beverages, select goods for purchase, and exchange money for products, time is a necessary correlate. It is evident that spending more time in the mall goes hand-in-hand with purchasing. Since Americans live in a \"time poor\" society, the extra amount of time that Hispanics devot e to shopping is a distinguishing featur e of this segment of the population. 74ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Nicholls, J.A.F. and Roslow, P.

Key Problems/issues: The study measured the effectiveness of Spanish-language TV commercials vs, English-language TV commercials in communicating to viewers and viewers comprehension of the adver tiser's main message. Methodology: The sample for this study was chosen r andomly from a telephone directory with bilingual interviewers conducting the interv iews. Individuals w ho did not consider themselves Hispanics and Hispanics who only spoke English at home were not included in the survey. Hispanic responde nts ages 18-49 were invited to evaluate television programs and commercials. Pa rticipants were classified into 2 categories (Spanish-dominant and Spanis h-bilingual). There were 16 popular brands in 12 product cat egories being evaluated. Target commercials (30 seconds) were included in the program s viewed along with other non-test commercials. Results/findings: Among all respondents who watches Sp anish language commercials 59.8% were able to play back the main me ssage correctly. Among those seeing in English language 38.4% were able to pl ay back the main message. For both bilingual and Spanish speaking respondent s communication in Spanish was still superior.

They l ook at the three major co-cultures, African American, Asian American and Hispanic Americ an, and how they relate to European Americans. Methodology: Theory review. Results/Findings: Hispanics tend to want paternalistic empl oyers. The business atmosphere is friendly, gracious, and easy- going. The pace will tend to be slower than that of the USA. In communicating with Hispanic Americans, first, it is important to remember that the Hispani c culture is very eloquent and family centered and the communication is a reflection of this.

Methodology: A telephone survey was conducted to determine the extent to which husbands influenced the purchase of household paint. Hispanic and Anglo responses were compared. Additional data were collect ed to determine the level of acculturation of the consumer. Results/Findings: The findings indicate no difference between Hispanic and Anglo patterns. There was also no difference between Hispanics high in acculturation and Hispanics low in acculturation in male dominance of purchase decision. In determining influence for paint related products, gender may be a better segmentation factor than le vel of acculturation.

The role acculturative processes play in the adaptation of immigrants and other non-mainstream citizens to the dominant U.S. consumer env ironment is also presented. Methodology: A literature review.

Results/Findings: Based upon the current body of know ledge and gaps in the research, a model is presented that advances the study of consumer accultur ation behavior. The model suggests that the pur chase outcome of micro-cultures is moderated by two variables: the degree of consumer acculturation and the type of product under consideration. Suggested steps fo r the study of micro-cultures are proposed and include the follo wing: 1) identify micro- culture(s), 2) determine measurement of the degree of acculturatio n, 3) determine product type, and 4) determine whether differences exist in purchase outcomes.

(1985). New Perspectives on Acculturation: The Relationship of General and Role Sp ecific Acculturation with Hispanics Consumer Attitudes. Advances in Consumer Research , 113-117. Key problem/Issue: Two acculturation scales were derived and then compared in terms of their association with Hispanic consumers' attitudes as well as their exposure to and perceptions of Spanish language televisi on commercials. The study attempts to uncover the underlying dimension of general acculturat ion and determine if role- specific acculturation can more accura tely explain role-specific values and behaviors than a general meas ure of acculturation. Methodology: The data used were collected in Chic ago, Illinois during the months of October through December, 1983. Thes e data were collected via a mixed method procedure which used both random digit dialing and systematic selection of Spanish surnames from the Chicago te lephone directory. Approximately 85% of the 208 Hispanic respondents were selected via the RDD method. This mixed method procedure has been suggested as being a preferred method for the collection of ethnic survey data (Himmelfar b, et.al. 1983). Data collection was bilingual and conducted by th e Survey Research Laborator y of the University of Illinois. Chicago was selected because it has the sixth largest concentration of Hispanics among U.S. cities, and is th e most heterogeneous of any major Hispanic community with respect to the composition of the Hispanic population by national origin. Respondents were asked which language they prefe rred (Spanish, English, or both) when at home, when at work, when speaki ng, when reading, when watching television, listening to the r adio, or when reading the newspaper. 81ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY The final set of items included in this study was consumer related measures which were considered to be potentially re lated to acculturation level. These measures included the use of attitudes towards Spanish language commercials versus English language ones, and product a ttribute ratings for beer. Beer was chosen as the product of study since His panics' brand prefer ences differ sharply from Anglos (Guernica 1982) and because prior research indicated that different cultural groups each have unique atti tudes and behaviors regarding the use of alcoholic beverages (Greely, McCready and Theisen, 1980). Results/Findings: The results here assessing the underlying dimensions of general acculturation are highly consistent with the current tr ends in explicating this concept. They indicate that accultur ation is not composed of just a single underlying dimension, but, rather, is comp rised of several separate lower-order constructs. This underscores the need for future research to avoid utilizing simplistic, single-item measur es as surrogates for accult uration. One item alone is incapable of tapping all the complexities of this multidimensional concept. 82ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY O'Guinn, T. and Meyer, T. (1983). Segm enting the Hispanic Market: The Use of Spanish Language Radio. Journal of Advertising Research , 23, 9-16. Key problem/Issue: The primary aim of the investigation wa s to test radio l anguage preference as a segmentation criterion for the Hispanic market. To this end we sought to demonstrate several differences between the SLR audience and those Hispanics who prefer English-language ra dio. Existing research suggests one very critical underlying dimension: sub-cultural ori entation. For this reason, it was hypothesized that those variables most related to sub-cultural orientation would contribute significantly to the statistical separation of these two groups. Specifically age, income, national origin, years lived in loca l area, occupation, educational level and general language use and preference were all clearly suggested. Methodology: In this study, the audience of primary interest was the Mexican-American community of San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio represents an interesting environment for the mass media, especially br oadcasting, in that six out of ten of its citizens are Mexican-Amer ican. No other city of major size has as large a concentration of Hispanics in comparison to the Anglo population (Strategy Research Corporation, 1980.) In-person interviews of approximatel y 35 minutes in length were conducted on three consecutive Saturdays by bili ngual interviewers, all of whom had experience and training in such procedur es. Respondents were contacted and interviewed at various shopping centers in San Antonio where the concentration of Mexican-Americans is 85% or higher. Refusals were less than 3%. The research instrument had three ma jor sections. The first dealt with personal demographics: age, sex, annual household income, occupation, 83ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY educational level, family size, years lived in San Antonio, and country of birth. The second section measured media use and exposure. The final section was composed of over 30 cons umption measures. Results/Findings: This investigation tested radio language preference as a means by which to segment the U.S. Hispanic market. The results were positi ve. SLR appears to be not only a reliable segmentation cr iterion, but its own means of implementation as well. Such a match of market and media is rare and should not be ignored by those adver tisers wishing to more effi ciently reach the rapidly expanding U.S. His panic market. 84ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY O'Guinn, T, Faber,R. and Meyer, T. ( 1985). Ethnic segment ation and Spanish- language television. Journal of Advertising , 14, 63. Key problem/Issue: The study dealt with the use of Spanis h-language broadcasting. Discriminant analysis was used to produce a profile of Mexican-Americans who prefer Spanish-language television over English- language television. A comparison of this profile with one previously der ived for Spanish-language radio listeners indicates that while there is some over lap between these audiences, they are far from identical. Methodology: In-person interviews were conduct ed with 993 Mexican-Am ericans living in San Antonio, Texas. Respondents were contact ed and interviewed at various shopping centers in areas with a high conc entration of Mexican-Americans. The interviews were conducted in the respon dent's preferred language by trained and experienced bilingual interviewers. Inte rviews lasted approximately 35 minutes. The refusal rate was less than three percent. The research instrument was composed of three major sections. The first assessed demographic information including age, sex, income, education, family size and national origin. The second section measured m edia use and language preference. The final par t contained a number of cons umption-related measures for a variety of products. Items were selected to represent a wide range of products which differed along dimensions of essentiality, importance, price and status value. Results/Findings: As with radio, Mexican-Americans wh o preferred Spanish-language television can be differentiated from those preferring English-language broadcasts. There is, as in the case of Spanish-language radio, some indi rect evidence of a less 85ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY acculturated Spanish audience. Both the fa ct that Spanish is preferred in other situations and for other uses and that those who prefer Spanish-language television were more likely born outside t he U.S are supportive of the contention. In order to benefit from ethnic segm entation, advertisers must determine which factors lead Hispanics to prefer specific Spanish- language media and how these ethnic media differ in meeting specific consumer needs. Observations While the study provides relevant info rmation, more current studies regarding Hispanics and media usage have been done and may be more useful. 86ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Oliver, R.L. (1999). Whence Consumer Loyalty? Journal of Marketing. Vol. 63, 33- 44. Key problems/Issue: This study attempts to analyze the rela tionship between satisfaction and loyalty as well as the different phases that lead to loyalty by looking at definitions of loyalty, loyalty phases, obstacles to loya lty and loyalty as a interaction between individual and social support. Methodology: The method chosen for this article include d a review of previous studies that looked at topics related to the ones described in the previous section (key issue). Results/findings: The main conclusion is that consumers bec ome loyal in a cognitive sense first, than later in an affective sense, still later in a conative manner (behavioral intention, brand-specific commitment to repurchase) and action loyalty (the idea of overcoming obstacles to buy the brand as opposed to just having an intention to purchase that can be stopped by certai n obstacles). Another trend is the idea of the interaction between individual commitment to repurchase a brand and community efforts to maintain or promoted brand loyalty. Observations: This study brings in an im portant idea that of the in teraction between individuals' commitment and social effort or obstacles to maintain or promote loyalty for a specific brand (Table 2). It also provides support and drawbacks of various perspective of the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty. 87ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Wilkes, R. and Valencia, H. (1986). S hopping Related Char acteristics of Mexican-Americans and Blacks. Psychology and Marketing , 3, 247-259. Key problem/Issue: The shopping-related characteristi cs of Mexican-Americans and Blacks. More specifically, the purpose of the study was to examine fo r applicability eight shopping lifestyle dimensions of Blacks and the largest Hispanic sub-group, Mexican-Americans. Additionally, depar tment stores purchasing and generic purchasing were examined. Methodology: Based upon an extensive review of rele vant articles in academic and trade literature, 10 dimensions of aspects of shopping were identified for examination in this research. The principal analyt ical method was multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Results/Findings: The findings challenge some of the more commonly held perceptions about these two minority groups. Contrary to ex pectations from prior research and the popular business press, neither Blacks nor Mexican-Americans were found to differ from Anglo with respect to brand loyalty, use of coupons, impulse purchasing, shopping for specials, buying generic grocery items or using discount coupons. Consistent with expec tations from available information was the finding that both Blacks and Mexican-Americans are mo re likely to engage in bargaining during their s hopping experiences and to shop more in discount stores. Observations The study doesn't suggest that Hispanic or Black consumers have been so acculturated or absorbed in the general U.S. community as to nullify distinctiveness from marketing perspective. What the study suggests is that 88ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY- CENT ER FOR HISPANIC MARKETING COMMUNICATION, FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY differences between Anglo, Black, and Hispanic consumers may not be as great as is frequently assumed and that overlap exists. 89 "}
