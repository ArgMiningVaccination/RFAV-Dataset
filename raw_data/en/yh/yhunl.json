Diversity statement The OIHC is committed to making integrative health practices and modalities available to all patients and are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion across all OIHC programs. We do not discriminate on the basis of age, gender/gender identity, disability, race, color, ancestry, citizenship, sexual orientation, marital status, religion or insurance status. Indigenous healing acknowledgement We would like to honor the people and lineages of knowledge that have influenced our care. Many people have contributed to the practices we promote today. Some of those people are long forgotten, and many were purposefully erased. Their knowledge was freely shared to help those in need amongst their own people but was exploited by outsiders. Today, we acknowledge the practices we share are taken from many peoples, which make us responsible to honor and care for all people in need, in order that we might make amends and heal our communities.
