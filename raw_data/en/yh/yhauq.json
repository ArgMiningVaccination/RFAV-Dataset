I warmly welcome our amazing new students and look forward to getting to know you over the coming years! The incoming students represent diverse backgrounds, strengths and interests and will continue to enhance the dynamic atmosphere that is the hallmark of our Program. Our Program is co nstantly evolving, making sure that our graduates have the skills, insights and compassion to make a difference in today's world. Public Health is about everything we do as a society to promote, improve and protect the health of all individuals and communi ties. We are continuing to expand our academic program and course offerings, and have recruited new outstanding faculty. We have firmly established our eight tracks rounding out what is a comprehensive and interdisciplinary set of specializations in public health education. Our tracks include General Public Health, Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences , Outcome s Research, Health Promotion & Disease Prevention, Health Care Management, and Gl obal Health. We are offering a Dual MD- MPH, MSW -MPH (with the Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service) and DPM -MPH (with New York College of Podiatric Medicine) degrees, and an Advanced Certificate in Public Health. In partnership with the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH), our accreditation agency, we are regularly adjusting our core curriculum and program competencies to meet future public health challenges. I encourage all students to reach out to the Program Administration, their Track Advisors and Course Directors early on to seek advice and mentorship. Meet with our outstanding and engaged faculty, staff and current students at ISMMS and become involved in public health research, advocacy and practice. A decade ago I worked as a public health manager in Sierra Leone. I he lped set up an epidemiological surveillance system, supervised a malaria resistance study, and trained underpaid and therefore unmotivated health workers. Contact with patients was not the priority; I was supposed to care for the national health policy and not for specific patients. Like all policies, national health policies are influenced by societal needs, economic capacities and, sometimes nationalistic sentiments. They do not aim to bring rapid relief to a suffering individual, but set conditions for a given society to become \"healthier\". Their slow evolution and implementation can often be tiring and frustrating. We all know of countless examples, from the ongoing challenges to enhance/improve vs. repeal/replace the Affordable Care Act here in the US, to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, globally. My vision for everyone in the Graduate Program in Public Health at ISMMS is that, as public health practitioners, we will always remember that for a human being in distress it is the here and now. Improving the health of human beings is the essence of public health. Keeping the individual at the center of all our work also means that we can approach overwhelming or unimaginable problems without despair. By focusing on the suffering human being, publi c health goes beyond mere analysis and implementation of health policies. It offers choices where there were none; it provides a human touch in an inhumane environment; and it may ultimately help reestablish human dignity. I welcome everyone in our program to make this a reality.

Application Process - Medical students accepted to Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai can apply into the Dual MD- MPH program. Interested students must comple te a supplemental application, which consists of an essay describing their motivations for the Dual MD- MPH Degree Program. Accepted medical students do not need to submit a separate SOPHAS application online. We recommend, however, completing the essay at the earliest convenience upon acceptance to the ISMMS MD program. Students who have applied to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and wish to be considered for admission to the MPH Program even if they are not admitted to the medical school will need to complete a SOPHAS online application and should contact the Academic Program Office for more information. Other healthcare workers or physicians who are interns, residents or fellows at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai or working in the Mount Sinai Hospital must also submit an application via SOPHAS. Four -Year Option- MD-MPH students choosing the Four Year Options take courses in the Graduate Program in Public Health beginning at 4 pm after medical school classes have ended. Ty pically, four-year dual degree students complete all coursework and the Applied Practice Experience during the first two years of 14 medical school and then complete the Culminating Experience during the last two years of medical school. Five-Year Option - The five-year option allow s current and new students to devote an entire year to completing the MPH Degree. However, students will be expected to complete at least three core courses during their first year of medical school (Introduction to Biostatistics, Introduc tion to Epidemiology, and Introduction to Global Health or Public Health). During the fifth year, students will take a Scholarly Year. Complete information about how to arrange a Scholarly Year is in the Scholarly Year packet available from the Medical Stu dent Research Office which is located in the Annenberg Building, 13th floor room 13 -30. The timing of the Scholarly Year is flexible and up to each student, though many may choose to begin the MPH year after completion of their third year medical cl erkships. It is important to note that not all MPH specialty track s can be completed in this five -year option. Careful an d early planning with the Dual MD- MPH degree advisor is necessary in order to ensure completion of degree requirements. Furthermore, it is important that students speak with the Student Financial Services early on in their planning to ensure that all financial aid requirements are met. Interested students should contact Academic Program Office to set up an appointment to discuss their individual interests and needs. Dual MD-MPH Deg ree Expectations and Exemptions - Students who are pursuing a medical degree and a Master of Public Health degree must meet with the MD- MPH Academic Advisor at the beginning of the first year to plan for the next two years of coursework . Students pursuing both degrees have special demands that require careful attention to planning their public health courses along with medical school curricula. In addition, MD -MPH students receive credit and e xemptions for the following activities: Ambulatory Care Clerkship : 4 credits. This course is taken by medical students during Year 3 and has an emphasis on Clinical Preventive medicine as well as population medicine. Students incorporate population- based medicine and evidence based medicine into direct patient care by analyzing and applying USPSTF Guidelines; socio- behavioral models of health and illness; and cultu rally sensitive models of care giving. Receive 4 weeks of elective credit in the medical sch ool for MPH activities during Years 3 & 4 of medical school .

Residency and Fellowship Directors have planned MPH curriculum that meets the requirements for MPH degree completion as well as the training requirements o f each residency or fellowship program. Residents and fellows in these programs are considered to be completing the General Public Health Specialty Track within the MPH Program. These fellowships and residency do not represent separate tracks within the MP H Program. Mount Sinai resident and fellow physicians who are not part of these programs but would like to consider taking MPH courses or completing the MPH Degree should speak with their residency or fellowship P rogram Director as well as the Academic P rogram Office. 17 PROGRAM COMPETENCIES The Graduate Program in Public Health adopted Program Competenci es in 2007. The competencies are based on those promulgated by the Council on Linkages between Academia and Public Health Practice Core Competencies for Public Health Profession als (the Council ). The Council on Linkages is a coalition of representatives from 22 national public health organizations. The Council on Linkages adopted a revised set of competencies in June 2014. These c ompetencies are designed to foster workforce development by helping academic institutions and training providers to develop curricula and course content, and to evaluate public health education and training programs. The Program Competencies guide overall program learning objectives, curriculum development, and course -specific learning objectives. The Graduate Program in Public Health at ISMMS presents here the current Program Competencies devised specifically for our p rogram. These competencies shall be the primary guide against which student achievement is measured in the classroom, in the Applied Practice Experience , in the Culminating Experience , as well as in other service learning opportunities. Going forward , the Program C ompetencies herein re place those in previous iterations of the Student Handbook and all other program materials. Students should understand that the Program C ompetencies are not intended to represent an endpoint that is reached at the time of graduation , or expect in every case a one -to-one correlation to a particular class or exercise. Rather , these competencies provide a baseline overview of the knowledge, skills, and other attributes that might be expected for emerging public health professionals . The Program Competencies serve as a framework for Program development, and for continual professional development that is driven by the student. Completion of the program will assure that all students are aware of the broad professional expectations, using these competencies as the model to drive dynamic, life-long learning in public health. COMPETENCY SURVEY All matriculated students are required to complete a Competency Survey each academic year in the Program . Students are asked to self -evaluate their level of mastery of each Program Competency using the measures below. As adult learners who are autonomous, self-directed, and goal oriented, students are encouraged to use the results of their Competency Surveys to monitor their own progress through the Program. Aggregate data from the Competency Surveys are useful to the Program because they provide an assessment of how well course, Applied Practice Experience , and Culminating Experience competencies are transmi tted to the students, and whether there is a need for revision of current courses or creation of new courses or experiences to enhance student achievement of the determined competencies. Students are asked to self -evaluate competencies using the following measures. Self-Evaluation Measures Aware: Basic level of mastery of the competency. Individuals may be able to identify the concept or skill but have limited ability to perform the skill. Knowledgeable: Intermediate level of mastery of the competency. Individuals are able to apply and describe the skill. Advanced: Advanced level of mastery of the competency. Individuals are able to synthesize , critique or teach the skill.

Use tabular and graphical methods to explain model results. 22 MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEGREE REQUIREMENTS To complete the Master of Public Health d egree, students are required to obtain a minimum of 45 credits, complete a 150 -hour Applied Practice Experience , and complete a Culminating Experience (Thesis, First Author Manuscript, Capstone). Advising MPH students must read and continually reference the Student Handbook, Curriculum Guide, Applied Practice Experience Guide , Culminating Experience Guide, Track Checklist, and Sample Curricula to understand the expectations of the Master of Public Health. T hese resources are available in the MPH Student Organization on Blackboard. Students should contact the Academic Program Office with questions regarding policies and procedures, degree requirements, and questions or concerns regarding the Program. Students are expected to seek guidance from their Specialty Track Advisor regarding their interest in specific topics in public health. Specialty Track Advisors can provide information and advice regarding elective courses, Applied Practice Experience and Culminating Experience opportunities, proposals, competencies, and development , as well as information on the public health profession. SPECIALTY TRACK COURSEWORK In addition to the General Public Health Track, which gives students a solid foundation in the five core areas of public health (biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, health policy & management, and socio -behavioral health) the Graduate Progra m in Public Health provides students with an opportunity to specialize in a specific public health concentration. Students are required to take the courses listed for the Specialty Track they choose to pursue. The credits accrued from required courses vary for each Specialty Track. In total, students must complete 45 credits to be eligible to earn the Master of Public Health. Students will be asked to declare which specialty track they are pursuing or whether they have decided to follow the General Public Health Track after their first term in the Program. The Specialty Tracks are: General Public Health Health Promotion & Disease Prevention Environmental Health Sciences Global Health Outcomes Research Biostatistics Health Care Management Epidemiology 23 Specialty Track Descriptions General Public Health Specialization is not required and students are free to pursue a general program of study consisting of an amalgamation of courses across all specialty tracks. General Track students, however, must still complete a set of required courses from each of the five areas of basic public health knowledge: biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, health services administration, and social/behavioral sciences. Health Promotion & Disease P revention The Health Promotion & Disease Prevention track builds on the long and rich tradition of Mount Sinai's collaboration with the East Harlem community in the promotion of health and the prevention of disease. Students who pursue the Heath Promotion & Disease Prevention Specialty Track will learn how to improve the public's health by working with individuals and their communities. This track emphas izes community level interventions through a curriculum developed to reflect the World Health Organizati on's 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion: \" Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health.\" Students in this track achieve the competencies necessary to assist communities in effective action in setting priorities, making decisions, planning strategies and implementing them to achieve better health. At the heart of this process is the empowerment of communities, their ownership and control of their own endeavors and destinies. Additionally, this track looks at individual behavior as a major determinant of health and helps students develop into public health practitioners capable of influencing social norms that provide a framework for health promotion and disease prevention across life stages. Students in this track learn how to collaborate with agencies, institutions and community -based organizations that influence the social determinants of health to foster the development and implementation of policy and environmental strategies that enable healthy individual behaviors. Topics addressed include nutrition and physical activity, chronic disease prevention and control, health literacy, health communications, injury control and prevention, aging/health and disabilities, men's health and women's health, as well as children's health. Particular emphasis is placed on the elimination of disparities in health outcomes. Examples of projects undertaken in this track over the past few years include: working on accurately recording all pediatric vaccinati ons given in New York City through collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; creating educational tools and evaluating effectiveness of those tools in a population of HIV/hepatitis C infected substance abusers; working to establish an Arab- American clinic at Mount Sinai; developing an obesity education program for the East Harlem community. Environmental Health Sciences The Environmental Health Sciences Specialty Track focuses on environmental exposures that affect huma n health that arise from air, water, food, work, and the built environment that affect the health of individuals a nd communities. This t rack also explore s global environmental issues like climate change, and highlight emerging pollutants of concern and cutting -edge research on chemical exposures and fetal origins of adult diseases. Throughout the coursework and practical experiences, students will learn app licable principles of toxicology, environmental epidemiology, exposure and risk assessment, and strategies to prevent disease, as well as fundamentals of laws and regulation that 24 address environmental and occupational hazards. Students also learn to recogn ize, address, and prevent common environmental and occupational health threats such as heavy metals, asthma triggers, pesticides, and solvents. The Environmental Health Sciences Track is interdisciplinary and considers the broader context of environment al exposures and their contribution to health disparities on a local, national, and global scale. Students will gain a core skill set that will prepare them to become leaders in this important and growing field of public health. Global Health The MPH Global Health Track is designed for students interested in acquiring the competencies necessary to bring practical solutions to the health problems of underserved and neglected populations in resource poor settings worldwide. Many of the greatest challenges i n public health are global. Experts in global health and individuals with a sense of responsibility towards populations lacking adequate access to health care are needed to help solve the many health problems these populations face. The MPH Global Health S pecialty Track fosters the acquisition of the competencies necessary to bring positive, lasting change to challenged populations around the world. The Global Health Specialty Track includes both didactic and practical experience designed to allow students to accomplish the competencies determined necessary to be global health practitioners. Classes feature many world -renowned lecturers from the field s of medicine, public health, social sciences, health economics and health management, as well as experts from NGOs and government policy makers. The courses are designed to give students a thorough understanding of the principles of public health, with special emphasis on globalization and human rights, and the arguments surrounding the interrelation of these fields of study. In addition to the core course work an MPH with a global health emphasis includes coursework that covers a wide variety of topics such as equitable distribution of life -saving drugs, the health impact of asylum seekers, global communicable diseases, global trade, humanitarian aid and the public health impact of military intervention. Students acquire practical skills that enable them to work successfully in a wide variety of settings with diverse populations both domestically and abroad. With constant interaction between students and instructors, discussion and debate are important features of this course of study. Students are encour aged to pursue locations and study topics that are of particular interest to them. Examples of projects undertaken in this track over the past few years include: working to improve the health of villagers in India through child health nutrition programs and community education; examining the role of alternative and complementary medicine in villagers in rural outpatient settings in India; designing and teaching a basic public health curriculum in a local college in the Spirit Lake Nation of the Native Ame rican Dakota Tribe; performing targeted needs assessments in rural Kenya through collaboration with the International Rescue Committee which serves refugees affected by violent conflict. Outcomes Research The MPH Outcomes Research Specialty Track gives students the necessary tools to contribute to the body of knowledge that determines how health care practices and interventions affect end results. End results include effects that people experience and care about, such as change in the ability to function . In particular, for individuals with chronic conditions\u2014where cure is not always possible \u2014end results include quality of life as well as mortality. By linking the care people get to the outcomes they 25 experience, outcomes research has become the key to dev eloping better ways to monitor and improve the quality of care. Time and again, studies have shown that medical practices as commonplace as hysterectomy and hernia repair were performed much more frequently in some areas than in others, even when there were no differences in the underlying rates of disease. Furthermore, there was often no information about the end results for the patients who received a particular procedure, and few comparative studies to show which interventions were most effective. Thes e findings challenged researchers, clinicians, and health systems leaders to develop new tools to assess the impact of health care services. The Outcomes Research Specialty Track gives students the competencies necessary to develop new evidence about benef its, risks, and results of treatments so that patients, physicians, public health practitioners and policy makers can make more informed decisions. Examples of projects undertaken in this track over the past few years include: evaluating role of persisten t depression in adherence to secondary prevention behaviors after acute coronary syndromes; evaluating differences in preventive services offered by gynecologists and generalists; food allergy as a risk factor for asthma morbidity in adults; determining factors associated with adherence to influenza vaccine among inner city adults with persistent asthma; association between minor and major surgical complications after carotid endarterectomy. Biostatistics The Biostatistics Track provides students the nec essary statistical reasoning and methodology skills to effectively design, assess, and analyze studies of the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic interventions, the characteristics and distribution of diseases in populations, health services research, and programs of health care delivery. The Biostatistics Track builds on the core curriculum in the MPH program to offer students a practical foundation in biostatistics through courses in important areas such as statistical inference, probability, multi variable models, analysis of longitudinal and time to event (or survival) data, genetics, and statistical computing. This foundation is meant to be a springboard to launching a successful career in clinical research, for both clinical researchers seeking q uantitative skills and those seeking careers as biostatisticians. Health Care Management The Health Care Management Specialty Track prepares graduates for positions of leadership and management in public health, health, government and community service organizations. Students will learn competencies in strategic, ethical and accountable man agement practices, in state of the art human resource management and supervision, in the techniques of finance and budgeting, the use of quantitative tools for management accountability and for managing cost effective health care and they will learn to des ign, implement and evaluate programs and projects. The Health Care Management specialty track curriculum provides competency -based learning in organizational development and organization behavior, including theory and application, team leadership, relationship building, collaboration and community orientation, social marketing, public relations and communication and information systems management and assessment. 26 Epidemiology The epidemiology track provides students with the skills necessary to analyze public health trends, design and implement studies, and interpret the results for policy and program development. They also learn to investigate disease origins, and prevention a nd intervention strategies at the individual and societal levels. The program prepares graduates to take on leadership roles in clinical and population- based health research in government, health care institutions, and private industry. In addition to t he MPH -required coursework in health policy and management, socio -behavioral health, and occupational and environmental health, students take epidemiology track -specific coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical outcomes research. Students are required to take two elective classes in specialized areas of epidemiology. Electives are available in infectious disease, chronic disease, molecular, genetic, and environmental and occupational epidemiology. Track Advisors Students in each Track are strongly encouraged to contact their Track Advisor early on and regularly throughout their time at ISMMS. Track Advisors are an important resource, and can provide information and advice regarding elective courses, Applied Practice Experience, and Cul minating Experience opportunities, proposals, competencies, and development , as well as information on the public health profession.

Students will implement and practice lessons learned in the clas sroom, gaining exposure to new and exciting prospects for future professional development. It is a planned, supervised, and evaluated field- based experience that can take place at a variety of agencies and organizations, involving some level of community e ngagement. The Applied Practice Experience enables students to achieve many of the competencies necessary to be successful public health practitioners. In the past, students have met this requirement by working at the community level, for example, in East Harlem; at the city level, working with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and at the international level, working on a disaster relief project in a foreign setting. Whatever the student's choice, the focus is on immersion into the setting selected. The Program requires that the APE encompass a minimum time commitment of 150 -hours. To satisfy the APE, students must achieve at least five program competencies (three of which must be foundational) through completion of two or more work products. Most students complete their work products at a single site as part of a practicum/internshi p. The work products are determined by the student and the preceptor, and should be mutually beneficial to both the student and the site. Examples of work products include written assignments, journal entries, projects, videos, presentations, spreadsheets, websites, or posters. Specifically, a work product might be a training manual, policy analysis, curriculum, grant proposal, needs assessment, educational materials, program evaluation, literature review, surveys, guidelines, etc. Generally, the student is advised to begin thinking about areas of interest as early as the first term of the first year. Steps toward formalizing the Applied Practice Experience usually occur in the second or third term. Students are eligible to begin the Applied Practice Expe rience after completion of fifteen credits in the Program. It is strongly suggested (though not required) that the student consider the Applied Practice Experience as laying the groun dwork for the Culminating Experience . Project i deas should be discussed w ith the Specialty Track Advisors. All MPH students are required to complete an Applied Practice Experience. Students must obtain approval from the Preceptor, Track Advisor, and the Office of Public Health Practice prior to initiating the project to ensure relevancy to Public Health, to confirm the proposed experience will meet the criteria of the Applied Practice Experience requirement, to assure that the student is able to maximize his/h er learning opportunities and achieve competencies . Students must complete all requirements, including submission of all necessary forms, for the Applied Practice Experience in order to receive credit for their experience. We do not grant waivers of the Applied Practice Experience. Requirements for the Applied Practice Experience : Attendance at an APE Information Session Submission of the APE Proposal and Proposal Form Registration for MPH0092 Applied Practice Experience - 3 credits Students who matriculated before Fall 2017 will register for MPH0090 Practicum- 0 credits Completion of a minimum of 150 hours at an approved practice site (Requirements continue on next page ) 29 Completion of a minimum of two work products Attainment of at least 5 competencies At least 3 competencies must be Foundational Competencies Submission of the APE Postscript Report Completion of Final Evaluation Submission of the Preceptor Evaluation Competency Assessment Participation in a Checkout Meeting with the Office of Public Health Practice This information, along with a more detailed descriptio n of the Applied Practice requirement, can be found in the Applied Practice Experience Guide on Blackboard > MPH Students Organization . Office of Public Health Practice Program Manager, Public Health Practice Christine Cortalano, MPH, Location: CAM Building, 17 E. 102 St., West Tower, 5th floor - room D5 -141 30 CULMINATING EXPERIENCE All MPH students are required to complete a C ulminating Experience. The Culminating Experience is typically started towards the end of the student's first year and completed by the end of the second year. The goal is for students to synthesize, integrate and apply the skills and competencies they hav e acquired to a public health problem. Students may choose to complete a Master's Thesis, First Author Manuscript or Capstone to satisfy the Culminating Experience. The type of project completed will depend on the student's Specialty Track and topic of int erest. The Culminating Experience must be completed under the direction of an ISMMS Faculty Advisor. The ISMMS Faculty Advisor may or may not be the student's S pecialty Track Advisor. Students can identify another ISMMS faculty member to serve as their ISMMS Faculty A dvisor as appropriate. If a student is working closely with an offsite mentor, this mentor may serve as a co -advisor /second reader alongside an ISMMS F aculty Advisor . Once an ISMMS Faculty Advisor has been determined, the student must submit the Statement of Support with an approved outline of the project to Academic Program Office . This Statement of Support must be submitted prior to initiating any research or project to ensure relevancy to public health. The Culminating Experience require s: One written Thesis, First Author Manuscript or Capstone formatted according to applicable guidelines as outlined in the Culminating Experience Guide Two Oral Presentations o Public Health Research Day Poster Session in the Spring II term before graduation o 10-minute Oral Presentation to summarizing their Thesis, First Author Manuscript, or Capstone project to the ISMMS Faculty Advisor and Second Reader Forms documenting the experience o Statement of Support - submitted before beginning work o Evaluation - submi tted after the Oral Presentation o Deposit Form - submitted after the Oral Presentation o Other documentation as detailed in the Culminating Experience Guide Description of the Thesis, First Author Manuscript & Capstone Below are general descriptions of each of the three types of projects . Please read the Culminating Experience Guide on Blackboard for all details regarding the Culminating Experience. Master's Thesis The goal of the Thesis is to advance or create new knowledge to an existing body of research. The student develops a research question and a hypothesis based on previous research on the topic. The student gathers data (either through primary or secondary data collection) and analyzes the data, usually with statistical analysis software, such as SA S or SPSS. The findings are then discussed as to whether or not they support the hypothesis. The study should be designed so that the results of the analysis are generalizable to a larger population, rather than the sample used in the student's data analys is. 31 First Author Manuscript The First Author M anuscript must be written in publishable format for a selected scholarly journal. Students meet with their Specialty Track Advisor and Culminating Experience ISMMS Faculty Advisor to determine which journal is most appropriate for their topic. The format of the paper is based on the formatting guidelines for submission as outlined by the selected journal. Capstone This scholarly project is much more applied in nature. The C apstone is a scholarly project developed for and with consultation of a public health organization or community agency. Generally, the capstone builds directly upon the Applied Practice Experience (formerly known as the Practicum experience ) in that the student produces a deliverab le based on the needs of the Applied Practice Experience site. The Capstone can take on several forms, including: Community Needs Assessment Public Health Program Plan Program Evaluation Training Manual Policy Analysis Systematic Literature Review Gran t Proposal Public Health Research Day Public Health Research Day, held annually by the Graduate Program in Public Health, is a required event for all MPH students. All graduating MPH students are required to present posters during the Public Health Research Day. The Public Health Research Day Committee will select the 3 top -ranked abstracts for oral presentations, and each w ill receive a Blue Ribbon Award with an honorarium. All other students are required to attend the day's events. Public Health Research Day showcase s MPH student thesis, manuscript, and capstone projects. In addition to the annual p oster session, the event will include a keynote lecture , oral presentations , and a networking reception. This is an excellent opportunity for networking among students, faculty, alumni, and community stakeholders, and to gain experience in presenting your work to an audience with diverse professional interests. Culminating Experience Submission Deadlines The documentation required for the Culminating Experience and all other outstanding degree requirements must be submitted by the following deadlines. Intended Degree Conferral Culminating Experience Submission D eadline June 30 June 15 September 30 September 15 January 3 1 January 15 Please refer to the Culminating Experience Guide for detailed information, including step -by-step procedures, registration requirements and track -specific requirements. The Culminating Experience Guide can be accessed on Blackboard > MPH Students Organization. 32 GRADUATION Graduation Application Form All students intending to graduate in June or September must submit a Graduation Application Form no later than February 1 of the year that corresponds to their intended graduation. This ensures that students have adequate time to at tend to any outstanding issues. Additionally, it ensures that the Academic Program Office has a record of the number of students wishing to obtain their diploma and t hose wishing to participate in the Commencement Ceremony. By March 1, the list of students petitioning to earn the degree in June and September is sent to the Registrar, including those eligible students wishing to participate in the Commencement Ceremony . Students intending to earn their degree in June must meet with the Academic Program Of fice by March 11 to ensure that all the requirements , including the Culminating Experience, are being fulfilled and that all appropriate forms are signed and submitted to the Academic Program Office. Students intending to earn their degree in September must meet with the Academic Program Office by March 29. Students intending to earn their degree in January must submit a Graduation Application Form by October 15 and must meet with the Academic Program Office by November 16 . Intended Degree Conferral Graduation Application Due Graduation Checkout Meeting June 30 February 1 March 11 September 30 February 1 March 29 January 31 October 15 November 16 Administrative Requirements Preceding Degree Conferral The Master of Public Health Degree cannot be awarded until all of the student's outstanding accounts have been cleared. These may include the Library, the Bursar's Office, Office of Student Financial Services , Registrar's Office and any other service provided or account outstanding at Mount Sinai. Upon satisfactory completion of the above -mentioned requirements, payment of all outstanding fees, and submission of the Student Exit Form, the degree is awarded on the conferral date following the final Culminating Experience deposit and submission of all degree requirements. Degree Conferral The MPH degree is awarded on June 30, September 30, and January 31. After the degree is conferred, students can start using the MPH credential after their name. Students should refer to the Gr aduation Application and the Culminating Experience submission deadlines. 33 If necessary, prior to receipt of the diploma, students can request a letter from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Registrar's Office verifying that they have completed the degree requirements and confirming that the degree has been conferred . Commencement Ceremony The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's annual Commencement Ceremony usually takes place in June each year. Students submitting all degree requirements by the Ju ne graduation deadline will be eligible to participate in the Commencement Ceremony . Participation in the Commencement Ceremony is distinct from degree conferral (earning the MPH degree). Final transcripts and the MPH diploma will not be issued until all degree requirements are satisfactorily completed . Students depositing by the September deadline, may, at the discretion of the Academic Program Office, participate in the prior June Commencement Ceremony , but will not receive their degree or diploma until after completing the MPH degree requirements in September. Commencement information will be sent during the Spring I and Spring II terms to the student's school email address. 34 RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT IN RESEARCH General Statement Students are expected to maintain the high standards of ethical and personal conduct that are the prerequisite for a productive academic, research and work environment. Students are required to participate in special seminars about the ethical issues and dilemmas that arise in research environments, and are encouraged to seek guidance with respect to optimal forms of record keeping. Course Directors and Faculty Advisors should familiarize their students with expected practices. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Failure to adhere to Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's standards of academic integrity will be treated as serious offenses that are inconsistent with the goals and activities of the academic environment. Breaches of academic integrity will be subje ct to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion from the School. Some basic types of behavior that are unacceptable include, but are not limited to, the following examples: A. Cheating: using unauthorized notes, study aids, or information on an examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then submitting the work for re -grading; allowing another person to do one's work and submitting that work under one's own name; submitting identical or similar papers for credit in more than one course without prior permission from the course instructors. B. Plagiarism: submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely one's own work without attributing those same portions to their correct source. C. Fabrication: falsifying or invent ing any information, data or citation; presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines defining the appropriate methods for collecting or generating data and failing to include an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered or collected. D. Obtaining an Unfair Advantage: (a) stealing, reproducing, circulating or otherwise gaining access to examination materials prior to the time authorized by the instructor; (b) stealing, destroying, defacing or concealing l ibrary materials with the purpose of depriving others of their use; (c) unauthorized collaborating on an academic assignment (d) retaining, possessing, using or circulating previously given examination materials, where those materials clearly indicate that they are to be returned to the instructor at the conclusion of the examination; (e) intentionally obstructing or interfering with another student's academic work, or (f) otherwise undertaking activity with the purpose of creating or obtaining an unfair ac ademic advantage over other students' academic work. E. Aiding and Abetting Academic Dishonesty: (a) providing material, information, or other assistance to another person with knowledge that such aid could be used in any of the violations stated above, or (b) providing false information in connection with any inquiry regarding academic integrity. F. Falsification of Records and Official Documents: altering documents affecting academic records; forging signatures of authorization or falsifying information on an official academic document, grade report, letter of permission, petition, add/drop form, ID card, or any other official University document. 35 G. Unauthorized Access to computerized academic or administrative records or systems: viewing or altering computer records, modifying computer programs or systems, releasing or dispensing information gained via unauthorized access, or interfering with the u se or availability of computer systems or information. All graded essays, papers, and problems, and all written materials submitted as part of the Collating Experience Proposal or the Collating Experience, must be entirely the work of the individual stud ent or referenced appropriately. E diting (e.g. syntax assistance for foreign students) should be sought only if explicit permission is obtained. If faculty observe or have knowledge of students engaging in any of the above mentioned activities, the stude nt should be confronted by the r elevant faculty member at once. Students and faculty who believe that any of the above mentioned activities have occurred will contact the Program Director and/or the Academic Advisory Chair and/or Academic Advisory Committe e which has the authority to discipline students up to and including dismissal. If necessary, the case will be elevated to the leadership of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. If it is determined that the student has been involved in any form of academic misconduct, the student will receive an F for the assignment or course. Additional consequences, including dismissal from the program, are at the discretion of the Program Director. If the student wishes to appeal the decision of the Academic Adv isory Committee, this must be put in writing to Academic Advisory Chair within two weeks of receiving notification of the consequences of the incident of academic misconduct. The issue will then be pursued, via an appropriate tribunal, in accord with inst itutional policy on the ethical conduct of research. (Adapted from http://www.northwestern.edu/uacc/defines.html ; used with permission, D. Garrison) POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON ETHICAL PRACTICES IN RESEARCH The School hereby affirms its commitment to the highest ethical standards in the conduct of scientific research, the promotion of original research of high quality, and the importance of academic freedom. It also acknowledges that unethical conduct in research is extremely serious and threatens these principles. The School is, therefore, committed to preventing unethical conduct in research from occurring and, should it occur, to dealing with it swiftly, fairly and thoroughly. Procedures for handling allegations of misconduct in research are described in detail in the Faculty Handbook (Chapter VI) . Allegations of misconduct in research must be reported to the Institution's Research Integrity Officer (RIO) who will have primary responsibility for implementation of the institution's policies and procedures on unethi cal practices in research. The RIO has general responsibility for overseeing the investigation of all allegations of unethical conduct in research and shall be available to: Consult confidentially with persons uncertain about whether to submit an allegati on of unethical research practices and if the allegations do not involve unethical practices in research, refer the individual to other offices with responsibility for resolving the issue. Receive allegations of suspected unethical research practices and work with the Research Integrity Committee to determine and pursue the appropriate method for investigating and resolving these allegations. 36 AUTHORSHIP POLICY In conformity with the principles of academic freedom, faculty and students are not required t o obtain prior approval before submitting a manuscript for publication or to amend such manuscripts to comply with suggestions made by others. However, it is recommended they provide Department Chairpersons with copies of manuscripts prior to publication. Students who wish to submit a manuscript to a journal from ISMMS or describe work conducted at ISMMS must review and obtain approval from a faculty member. That review should include the appropriateness of the authorship(s) and acknowledgment(s) of grant support, as well as the substance of the report. The Program adheres to the Authorship Policy, the Policy on Responsibilities of Authors a nd data Reten tion, and Policy and Procedures on Protecting Whistleblowers as established by the Graduate School and Department of Medical Education, outlined in the respective handbooks. Assignment of authorship documents the contributions individuals have made to a published work. Thus, authorship constitutes a key criterion by which funding agencies, academic institutions, and the wider academic community judge the contributions of acade mics to their fields. Appropriate assignment of authorship is an essential component of ethical conduct for academics. Authorship on a publication implies substantial contribution to work being reported, which entails critical intellectual and/or technic al contributions without which the publication as it exists would not have been possible. Contributions that merit authorship include a significant role in planning the studies, writing the manuscript, and other essential roles involving unique skills. The International Commit tee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines recommend that each author have responsibility for at least one component of the work, and that all authors approve the final version. Listing the explicit contributions of each author, as many journals currently require, is indeed a valuable and recommended method for disclosing and clarifying the rationale for the inclusion and order of authors. The contributions of colleagues or collaborators whose participation does not warrant authorship should be acknowledged. The requirement of substantial contribution clearly precludes unethical practices such as honorary authorships for senior colleagues who made minimum contributions to the work, colleagues whose role was solely to obtain funding or si milar resources for the work, or contracted individuals who simply carried out routine services for hire. This same principle precludes omitting from authorship colleagues who did make substantial contributions. Ghostwriting, in which an individual takes c redit as an author of a manuscript substantially written by an uncredited third party, is never permissible. In summary, authorship credit can be established by the following three criteria: (1) providing substantial contributions to study concept and desi gn, or acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data critical for the study; (2) drafting the article or revising its content critically; and (3) approving the final version to be published. All authors listed on an article must fulfill criteria (1) an d/or (2), and must fulfill criterion (3). It is expected that inclusion and order of authors will be discussed among all of the authors (including students and postdoctoral fellows). This should occur as early in the research process as possible, prior to drafting the manuscript when feasible and certainly prior to submission of the manuscript for initial peer review. Such dialogue is essential for all manuscripts and requires exceptional attention in collaborations involving multiple laboratories or inst itutions. Whether a contribution is substantial enough to merit authorship may sometimes be a matter of judgment, usually decided by the senior author(s). After authorship and order of authorship have been assigned by the senior author(s), in consultation with, and preferably also in agreement with all authors, the senior author(s) should be 37 able to defend the assignments based on the principles articulated above; final decision on authorship rests with the senior author(s). Members of the research team are strongly urged to resolve any disagreements concerning authorship as quickly and amicably as possible, in order to avoid ongoing disputes that could impede or prevent publication of a manuscript. Policy on Financial Conflict of Interest in Research As an academic institution, ISMMS has an obligation to assure that its scientific and clinical research is conducted pursuant to the highest standards of ethical conduct free from any improper external bias. At the same time, ISMMS encourages scientific coll aboration with industry and supports collaborative research geared towards developing new and improved diagnostic and therapeutic products. ISMMS appreciates, however, that these economic relationships with industry have the potential for directly and sign ificantly affecting the approval, design, conduct, monitoring or reporting of a research study. Situations can occur in which an independent observer might reasonably conclude that the potential for individual or institutional profit could influence the outcome of a research study. Even in the absence of an actual conflict of interest, such situations may require actions to minimize the appearance of a conflict. Therefore, to safeguard the academic integrity of both ISMMS and its investigators, the institu tion has adopted a rigorous conflicts policy predicated on full disclosure and appropriate management. The Policy sets out the requirements for disclosing potential conflicts of interest in research and specifies the procedures for reviewing such disclosures and determining what corrective measures, if any, should be instituted. Furthermore, the policy subjects clinical trials that evaluate the safety and eff icacy of a drug, medical device or treatment, and research on technology in which the Investigator/Covered Person and/or the Institution has an ongoing financial interest, to the most rigorous review and stringent conditions. This Policy is based on the standards set forth in the federal regulations governing research funded by the Public Health Service (PHS) or the National Science Foundation (NSF) (42 CFR Part 50 Subpart F) and the recommendations promulgated by the Association of Academic Medical Center s. 38 OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Registrar's Office supports teaching and learning by maintaining the integrity of academic policies and the student information system. The Registrar's Office is the steward of student records from application to degree conferral in perpetuity. The Registrar's key functions in carrying out this mission focus on guarding the integrity and security of all student records in accordance with ethical and legal standards, maintaining accurate and timely records of acade mic progress in order to provide definitive student status, and providing students with enrollment services necessary to pursue their educational goals. To that end, below please find information pertaining to the policies and procedures under the purview of the Registrar's Office. For additional information about the Registrar's services, please contact the Re gistrar staff in Annenberg 12 -70, (212) 241- 5245. ACADEMIC STANDING Students may be terminated (i.e., administratively withdrawn or dismissed) from a degree program at any time if, in the judgment of the Graduate School or the School of Medicine, a student fails to make satisfactory progress towar ds the completion of the degree (regardless of grades). The definition of satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree program may diff er among degree offering units. Examples of unsatisfactory progress may include, but are not limited to, inadequ ate grade point average (GPA), inadequate research and/or research skills, failure to obtain satisfactory grades in required courses, failure to maintain matriculation in the Program, and may also relate to the amount of time to complete the required milestones of the curriculum. Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory Academic Progress in the Graduate Program in Public Health refers to the satisfactory completion of courses, Applied Practice Experience ( Practicum) , and Culminating Experience requirements as established by ISMMS. Additionally, federal regulations require that students receiving federal aid make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) in accordance with these standard s set by the School. Students are required to maintain a 3.0 Grade Point Average (GPA) . Students may not graduate with a GPA below 3.0. Students who fall below a GPA of 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Please see below for more information. Below are the categories of student standing: Good Standing A student will be considered in Good Standing if they meet minimal academic standards in terms of course performance and degree requirements, school standards and deadlines for health assessments, immunization status, PPD testing, pay all bills on time including tuition and fees, remain free of any academic or administrative holds, and are otherwise meeting the academic expectations of their degree program . 39 Probation Students who d o not meet the criteria for Good Standing may be placed on probation by the Program Director, Dean of the Graduate School, or their appointed representatives: including the Academic Advis ory Committee and the Academic Program Office . Once a student is placed on academic probation, academic progress must be made within two terms. Dismissal is the likely consequence if performance continues to be unsatisfactory. Students on probation are considered enrolled. Students are required to maintain a 3.0 Grade Point Average (GPA). Students who fall below a GPA of 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Anytime a student's GPA falls below 3.0, the Academic Program Office and the Academic Advisory Committee will be consulted and a plan for remediation developed. The student will meet with a member of the Academic Advisory Committee, develop an individual plan of remediation, and sign a statement of understanding that they are on academic probation. The Academic Advisory Committee meets at the end of each term and reviews the progress of each student on probation. If the GPA has not improved in the subsequent term, the student will continue to meet the Academic Advisory C ommittee member revising the remediation plan, as needed. If the student's GPA has not reached 3.0 within two terms having been placed on probation, the student may be dismissed from the program. WITHDRAWAL AND READMISSION Voluntary Withdrawal A student may voluntarily withdraw from school at any time, upon application to the Academic Program Office . The request must be made by submitting a Request for Withdrawal Form. A student who voluntarily withdraws may apply for readmission at a later time . Future reinstatement may be denied either at the time of the withdrawal or at the time of application for reinstatement for reasons deemed sufficient to the Admissions Committee. T he School may require an Administrative Evaluation prior to acceptance of a withdrawal. Failure to comply may result in dismissal. For further information on withdrawing from the Pr ogram, refer to the Academic Program Office. Administrative Withdrawal In certain circumstances, a student may be administratively withdrawn from the school. Examples may include, but are not limited to: a student who has exceeded the limit of medical or personal leave ; a student who fails to maintain matriculation in the degree program, a graduate student who repeatedly fails a course ; any student failing to pay tuition, fees, medical insurance, or housing bills by the required dates. Dismissal Dismissal is a withdrawal from the School for failing to maintain \"Good Standing\" or meet standard educational goals of the degree program. Students who are dismissed are not enrolled. The Program Director or Academic Program Office may administratively di smiss a student. Status of dismissal is permanently reflected on a student's academic record. Dismissals will generally be imposed for students who exhibit the following: failure to meet academic milestones, failure to remediate academic probation status , positive toxicology result, disruptive behavior, illegal behavior, misconduct, or failure to meet administrative responsibilities (including 40 financial obligations). Dismissal may result when a student is convicted of a misdemeanor or felony, exhibits a b reach of academic or professional misconduct (including cheating). Any student who fails to comply with a directive to undergo an administrative evaluation or fails to fulfill the requirements that stems from this evaluation will be dismissed from the Grad uate School. Clearance to Graduate, Begin Leaves of Absence, Withdraw, Transfer, or Otherwise Leave The School Clearance to graduate, begin a Leave of Absence, Withdraw, Transfer or otherwise leave the School is required. S tudents must complete the appropriate forms requiring the signatures of the requisite offices indicating that there are no outstanding debts or other encumbrances to the student's rec ord. When all the signatures are obtained, the student must ret urn the form to the Re gistrar's Office. Please contact the Academic Program Office for the appropriate forms. Readmission Students who wish to reapply to a program following any type of withdrawal can do so by adhering to the same application protocols outlined by the admissions office for all applicants. No guarantee of readmission is made to any student. ACADEMIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE The Academic Advisory Committee consists of an appointed Chair and several Program Administration and faculty members . The goal of the A cademic Advisory Committee is to monitor the acad emic progress of students in the P rogram. The Committee meets regularly to review the academic standing of all students. The Academic Advisory Committee also reviews cases of misconduct, unprofessional beha vior and other grievances and has the authority to discipline students up to and including dismissal and expulsion. Both students and/or f aculty members with concerns about any of the above should contact the Academic Program Office or the Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee, who will review the information, meet with those involved, investigate to gather all pertinent information, and forward this information to the Academic Advisory Committee for review and, if required, recommended action. Recommend ation from the Academic Advisory Committee will be communicated to the Program Director or Academic Program Office . HOLDS The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai utilizes a system of holds when students fail to meet standard educational obligations. A \"hold\": 1. Prevents the release of a student's academic transcript or any school documentation , e.g., enrollment verification letter . 2. Freezes a student's registration status so that they may not continue on to the next term until the hold is resolve d by the student . All financial obligations must be satisfied before a student can register for another term and continue their studies and/or research. Students with holds will not be eligible for financial aid refunds until the hold is appropriately addressed by the student. 41 Types of ISMMS holds: Admissions, Academic, Administrative, Student Health, Housing, Financial, and Registrar. TRANSCRIPTS Official copies of your Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai transcript can be requested when a stamped and sealed copy of your academic record is required. Requests for official transcripts require the verification of the identity of the student/alumnu s requesting the transcript. Document request s can be submitted on the Office of the Registrar web page , \"Request a Document\" link. Transcripts cannot be sent out for students who are not in \"Good Standing.\" This includes but is not limited to academic, financial, housing, library, and health holds. To be considered \"official\" a transcript must: Bear the Registrar's signature. Be stamped with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Seal Be sent directly from the Registrar's Office to a designated person or institution. Be on official transcript paper. Students may request an unofficial copy of their transcript for their personal reco rds. This will be stamped \"Student Copy\" and may not be used for official purposes. CREDENTIALS All offers of admission are provisional, pending receipt and evaluation of final transcripts. Transcripts must be sent directly from the appropriate Registrar's Office to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Registrar's Office. These and all other materials requested by the Registrar in conjunction with the admissions process must be received to complete a student's enrollment. Submission of false or misleading information in the application materials or in connection with the application process will be considered by the Admissions Committee and/or the Academic Advisory Committee as grounds for withdrawal of the acceptance offer, dismissal, or resciss ion of degree. 42 OFFICE OF STUDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES TUITION Students receive a tuition bill each term for the courses for which they register. This bill can be accessed at student.mssm.edu. Tuition f or incoming students in the 2018 -2019 Academic Year is $1250.00 per credit. Costs for books and materials required in the various courses are not included in the tuition rate quoted above . If a student has applied for financial aid, and has applied for enough to cover tuition and medical insurance, they should coordinate payment of the tuition due with the Bursar's office. If a student is not receiving financial aid then their tuition and fees must be paid by the due date listed in their tuition bill. Payment may be made by personal check, bank draft, wire transfer or money order, drawn to the order of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. For payment plan and/or credit card payment arrangements, please contact Tuition Management Systems, an independent company, at 800-356-8329 or http://www.afford.com. The Board of Trustees reserves the right to revise all fees, including tuition. All financial obligations must be cleared prior to the completion of each academic term. Students who have not cleared their account by the due date will not be allowed to register for upcoming terms, receive a transcript or letter of recommendation, have academic credits certified, receive a L eave of Absence, receive other student services, attend class for the current academic term, o r have a degree conferred. There is a late fee of $100 charged on balances not covered by financial aid and/or tuition payment plan. At the end of the academic year, unpaid balances will be turned over to an outside collection agency. Tuition Refund Policy Students who withdraw from the Institution or from a course during an academic term will receive a tuition refund based on the below institutional schedule. Tuition refunds will be calculated based on the date the student submits their withdrawal f orm to the Registrar's Office. Withdrawal through the first calendar week of the term 100 percent of Tuition Only Second calendar week of the term 75 percent of Tuition Only Third calendar week of the term 50 percent of Tuition Only Fourth cal endar week of the te rm 25 percent of Tuition Only After the Fourth week of the term No Refund For students receiving federal financial aid processed through the Office of Student Financial Services, be advised that all funds from federal Title IV programs will be returned to the government according to federal regulations. Returned funds previously credited towards tuition will leave an outstanding balance that students are personally responsible for paying. Students are advised to understand the above tuition schedule as withdrawing after the first week of class creates a financial obligation which, if not cleared by the end of the academic year, will be referred to an outside collection agency. No refunds will be granted to students dismissed or suspended. The Institution reserves the right to dismiss a student whose academic standing or general conduct is considered unsatisfactory. 43 Repetition of Coursework in the Graduate Program in Public Health Student s may retake a course with permission of the Academic Program Office. A student who has earned credit for a course may repeat it once upon approval , but will not receive additional academic credit. A student permitted to repeat a course must pay full tuition and other regular fees in effect at the time of the repetition. Students cannot receive financial aid to cover the tuition for retaking a course. FINANCIAL AID General Financial Aid Policy The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai consistently provides as much financial assistance as possible to eligible students who are in good academic standing, maintain satisfactory academic progress, meet filing deadlines and require financial assistance in order to attend the School. Admissi on to ISMM S is completely independent of financial requirements. Financial aid decisions are made on the basis of documented need without discrimination due to age, race, color, language, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic disposition, ethnicity, culture, creed, national origin, citizenship physical or mental disability, socioeconomic status, veteran status, military status, marital status, being the victim of spousal abuse, or based on any other characteristic prote cted by law. Financial Aid Applications Degree seeking students who are interested in applying for Federal Stafford loans to cover the cost of tuition and direct expense can supply FAFSA data on the Web at www.fafs a.ed.gov . Reapplication is required annual ly for all loan and scholarship recipients. Determination of Need The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai utilizes the standard federal formula for determining financial aid eligibility. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai reserves the right to reconsider its offer and commitments of financial assistance in the event of a financial award made from an outside source. (Required adjustments will be applied to the loan portion of the financial aid package wherever possible.) All Cost of Attendance Budgets cover the student only. Federal law prohibits using federal funds for the support of anyone other than the student. Entrance Interviews As part of their financial aid package, all students receive a Financial Aid Entrance Interview form listing their loan obligations upon graduation. They must sign, indicating they understand these obligations. Each award letter they receive will outline the terms (interest rates and repayment options) for the loans r eceived. Online tutorials related to debt management are a required part of the loan process. Exit Interviews Students who have been issued any type of financial aid from ISMMS and recipients of Stafford Loans and other federal loans must meet with a re presentative of the Office of Student Financial Services prior to graduation or separation. Loans will be summarized; terms of repayment, deferment and responsibility will be discussed. 44 Debt Management and Counseling Throughout the student's education the Office of Student Financial Services is available to discuss indebtedness, career choices, and money management issues. Graduating students should be aware of the requirements of the various external student loan programs in which they may have partici pated. It is important to maintain contact with Icahn School of Medicine and the appropriate lending institutions to understand the terms of each loan program, and to plan for repayment. Timely loan repayments are essential in establishing a good cr edit rating. The extent that loan indebtedness will impact future expense budgeting can be considerable. In order to assist students in tracking loans, interest rates and various conditions of the loans, the Program suggests consulting online debt - management info rmation . https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action http://www.finaid.org/ http://gradsense.org/gradsense http://www.aspph.org/study/financing -your-degree/ Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Federal regulations require that students receiving federal aid make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) in accordance with these standards set by the School. Satisfactory Academic Progress refers to the satisfactory completion of courses, Applied Practice Exper ience ( Practicum) , and Culminating Experience requirements as established by ISMMS . Please s ee the definition of Satisfactory Academic Progress in the Graduate Program in Public Health . A student who fails to meet one or more of the standards for SAP is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term in which the SAP requirements were not met. In this situation, the student can be placed on financial ai d probation and receive aid if the Program Director, Academic Advisory Committee, or Academic Program Administration approves an academic plan for the student that will ensure, if followed, that the student is able to meet the S AP by the designated point of time. Length of Time to Complete Degree for Financial Aid A student will be permitted a maximum time limit to complete a degree: Degree Normal Length (Years) Maximum Time to Complete Degree (Years) MPH 2 5 Advanced Certificate 1 2 Dual Degree with MPH 5 7 These time limits include any time for personal or medical L eave of A bsence . In the Graduate Program in Public Health , benchmarks of satisfactory progress must be completed as outlined in the specific program requirements. Students who are approaching the time limit for 45 completion will be reviewed with enough notice so that a plan is in place to enable the student to complete the req uirements by the end of the time limit. Please see the full Length of Time to Complete Degree Policy on page 5 1. 46 COURSE AND GRADING POLICIES COURSE REGISTRATION & ENROLLMENT Students enroll for courses on the student information system: student.mssm.edu The Late Registration (Add/Drop) Deadline is the final date for students to make changes to their selection of classes. Prior to this deadline, students are permitted to add or drop courses. The Late Registration (Add/Drop) Deadline is typically the first Friday of every academic term. In AY 2018- 2019, the registration deadlines are as follows: Term Registration Deadline Late Registration (Add/Drop) Deadline Fall June 30, 2018 September 14, 2018 Spring I November 30, 2018 January 11, 2019 Spring II February 28, 201 9 April 12, 2019 After deciding to add or drop a course, any student who fails to change their initial online r egistration before the Late Registration Deadline will not be eligible to take a course (if not enrolled) , and may not receive a full tuition refu nd (if not withdrawn) for that t erm. Students will not be able to take a particular course if they lack the required pre -requisites. Please refer to the course description in the Curriculum Guide for information on a course's pre -requisites. Course Withdrawal After the Add/Drop Deadline, students may withdraw from a course by submitting a withdrawal form. All withdrawals are entered as \"W\" on the students' official transcript. A grade of W does not affect the over all GPA. Please see the Office of Student Financial Services section for more information about tuition refunds in the case of course withdrawal. Course Cancellation Please note that if fewer than five students enroll in a particular course, the course will be subject to cancellation. In the case that the course is cancelled, the student will be allowed to register for another course. NON-MATRICULATING STATUS AND COURSE AUDITING Non -matriculating Status Non-matriculated students may register for courses in the Graduate Program in Public Health by filling out an application on SOPHAS Express as a non -matriculated student and paying the application fee. Students will be billed for the appropriate amount of tuition and will be entitled to receive a transcript. The number of course credits that a non -matriculated student can take from offerings in the Graduate Program in Public Health will be limited to a total of 1 2 credits. 47 Official Audits A full -time matriculated student may audit a course with the permission of the Course Director. Students auditing a course usually do not write examinations or papers and do not necessarily participate in class discussions. However, auditors should clarify expectations at the start of the course with the Course Director and may be required to fully participate in the class. A complete d Course Audit Form, with all required signatures, must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar prior to the end of the Add/D rop period. An audited course will appear on the student's transcript with the designation \"AU\". No academic credit is awarded and the course can not be counted for determining full-time status (international students) or financial aid status. Non-matriculated students, including employees, who wish to audit a course and have the audited course appear on a transcript as \"AU\" will be billed at the same rate as for courses taken for credit. Unofficial Audits Unofficial auditing is rarely allowed . In these instances, students may unofficially audit with permission of the course director. No tuition will be charged and a transcript will not be provided. GRADES Grades awarded in the Program are A, A -, B+, B, B -, C+, C, C -, or F. Pass-Fail grades are permitted only for certain electives and are not used to calculate a student's grade point average (GPA). Course Evaluations and Grade Release The Program uses Blackboard to collect student course evaluations. Grades will not be distributed until the course evaluation has been completed. Before the end of every term the Academic Program Office will post the Course Evaluation on the blackboard course sites. If the Course Director had outside speakers address the class during the term, this information will be evaluated on the same Course Evaluation. Evaluations are confidential and import ant tools for course development. Calculation of GPA In calculating the GPA, all credits with the following grades are counted in the total used to compute the grade point average/cumulative index: A, A- , B+, B, B -, C+, C, C -, or F. To compute the grade point average, follow the steps below: Grade Quality Point Value A 4.00 A- 3.70 B+ 3.30 B 3.00 B- 2.70 C+ 2.30 48 1. Determine the total number of credits completed by adding up all the credits with letter grades. This total must include any credits with \"F\" grades. 2. For each course with a letter grade, which counts toward the GPA, multiply the number of credits by the appropriate quality point value, as indicated below: 3. Add the quality point values for all the courses to determine the total quality points. 4. Divide the total quality points by the total number of credits (as computed in Step 1). 5. The resulting figure is the grade point average/cumulative index. Please note that the index is computed to two d ecimal points and the index is not rounded off. Credits with grades of Pass (P), Satisfactory Progress (SP), or Satisfactorily Completed (SC) do not figure into the computation of the grade point average but do count toward the degree. Transfer credits count toward the degree but do not figure into the index. Credits for undergraduate courses are neither counted toward the degree nor computed into the average. Incomplete Grades Students are expected to take exams when they are scheduled and submit assig nments on time. Under extraordinary circumstances (such as medical emergency), a temporary grade of Incomplete (I) may be considered for a student who is unable to complete course requirements . To receive an incomplete grade, the student must make a formal request using the Incomplete Grade Request Form. The form must be signed by both the student and the Course Director and submitted to the Academic Program Office . The request will include the r eason for the incomplete, the work yet to be completed, and the final date by whi ch the work is to be completed. Final approval will be given by the Registrar. Students have two academic terms to remediate an incomplete, after which time the incomplete is converted to a failing grade (F). Retaking Courses Students seeking to improve their grade point average (GPA) may re take a course, with permission from the Academic Program Office. If a course is retaken, the original grade remains on the transcript but only the second (retake) grade will be counted in the determination of the student's GPA. A student who has earned credit for a course may repeat it once, but will not receive additi onal credit. Students cannot receive financial aid to cover the tuition for retaking a course. Failures A student who fail s a course may repeat the course one time. A grade of C or better in the repeated course is required to maintain matriculation in the program. Students who fail the same course more than once will be automatically withdrawn from the program. C 2.00 C- 1.70 F 0.00 49 Grade Appeals Process A student has one (1) month from the date of receiving a course grade to make an appeal. The grade may be amended in either direction. Students must bring all course grade appeals to the course director. If there is still a discrepancy after the meeting of the course director and the student, the student should present the issue in writing to the Academic Program Office who will then bring the matter to the attention of Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee. Information for the appeal should be solicited from both the student and the course director. In some cases, at the discretion of the Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee, it may be appropriate to hold a meeting during which the student must state the appeal to the Committee. The Committ ee will investigate the issue and present its finding(s) to the Program Director for a final decision. The Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee will inform the student of the decision. ELECTIVES AT ISMMS AND ELSEWHERE Students are permitted to take any course offered by the Graduate Program in Public Health as an elective. Please see the MPH Curriculum Guide for a complete list of MPH course offerings and pre - requisites. If a student wishes to take a course in a diffe rent degree program at ISMMS, an Elective Approval Request Form must be submitted and approved by the Academic Program Office prior to registering for the course . Without the necessary approval, the elective course may not be counted toward the MPH . This i s to ensure that the course meets the objectives of the Graduate Program in Public Health before a student commits time and money to another Program or Institution. Approval, when granted, is conditional upon student completing all of the course requirements. The student must follow the procedures for transferring credits and/or course waiver to apply the elective to the MPH degree. If a student is interested in enrolling in a course offered by another academic institution, a student must seek approval from the Academic Program Office. Please submit a course description and a syllabus from the Institut ion offering the elective course and an Elective Approval Request to the Academic Program Office . Approval must be given fro m the Graduate Program in Public Health prior to enrolling in a course in another Institution . Without the necessary approval, the student may not be eligible to transfer credits or course waiver s. If approved, the student must follow the trans fer credit or course waiver procedure. INDEPENDENT STUDY An Independent Study is an elective option providing the student with an opportunity to delve more thoroughly into an area of public health that is of specific interest to them. An Independent Study must be a unique experience and must involve mentorship from an ISMMS Faculty Sponsor . Material covered during an independent study project should be highly targeted and not simply a review of the regularly offered coursework. Each student may complete no more than two independent study projects. An Independent Study Proposal must be submitted at least six weeks prior to the anticipated start of the proposed project/course of study. This is to ensure that the goals meet the overall objectives of the Graduate Program in Public Health before a student commits any time and energy. An Independent Study Proposal submitted less than six weeks of the anticipated start of the project/course of study may not be approved and the student is responsible for assum ing any risk that this may entail. Approval, when granted, is conditional upon the student completing all of the outlined 50 requirements. The student must submit a Postscript Report and request that the ISMMS Faculty Sponsor complete the Independe nt Study Evaluation Form. Final credits are awarded at the end of the project by approval of the Academic Program Office . An Independent Study can be valued at one, two, or three credits. Each credit represents approximately 45 hours of work. Three credits are the maximum number of credits that may be awarded to any Independent Study. Please note that while the total hours committed to the pursuit of the Independent Study may be sufficient for more than three credits or more than one elective, students will not rece ive any more than three credits for one project/course of study. Eligibility Students with more than one outstanding Incomplete at the time of the proposal submission may not be eligible to complete an Independent Study. Restrictions It is important to note that independent study projects should not be attempts to take MPH courses that are offered routinely during the academic year at times that are more convenient for the student. Independent study projects cannot exempt students from core course requirements. Steps towards formalizing an Independent Study 1. Identify and meet with your ISMMS Faculty Sponsor to propose the Independent Study. 2. Complete the Independent Study Proposal Form. 3. Submit the Inde pendent Study Form to the Academic Program Office for approval. 4. Once approved , complete the project/course of study. 5. Complete the Independent Study Postscript Report. 6. Request that your Faculty Sponsor review the Postscript Report and complete the Independent Study Evaluation Form. 7. Submit completed Pos tscript Report and Ev aluation form to the Academic Program Office . TRANSFERRING CREDITS Credit transfers must be approved by the Academic Program Office . Students may be able to transfer up to 10 credits from courses taken at other institutions as long as they were not counted towards another degree. Students may be exempt from taking required courses in the Graduate Program in Public Health on the basis of having successfully ta ken equivalent courses elsewhere. The courses for transfer credit must be considered appropriate to public health and have been completed with a grade of B or better at an institution of established academic reputation. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis may be used for transfer credit; provided the student provides proof (a letter from the course director or Program D irector) that a grade of B or better would have been given. Decisions regarding transfer credits are not made prior to matriculation. All transfer credits will be assigned a grade of SC (Satisfactorily Completed) . The five cores courses of the MPH degree will not be accepted as transfer credits (i.e., introductory level biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, health policy & management, and socio - behavioral health ). 51 Please be aware that other institutions often award credits in a manner not consistent with ISMMS credit policy . Students should not expect in every case to receive the exact number of credits given at another in stitution. Credits awarded for courses taken elsewhere are decided after review of the syllabus and on a case -by-case basis by the Academic Program Office . COURSE WAIVER If the student successfully completed an equivalent course (nb: this generally means graduate level) to one required by the Graduate Program in Public Health , and that course was used towards the attainment of another degree, students may be exempted from having to take the course in our Program . In the case of a course waiver, the student will not receive credit towards the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Master of Publ ic Health degree. The exemption from taking our required course will free the student to take an elective course in order to achieve the necessary 45- credit minimu m required for the MPH degree. Students should contact the Academic Program Office for the Course Exemption Form. 52 ATTENDANCE , MATRICULATION , LEAVE OF ABSENCE , AND RELATED POLICIES ATTENDANCE STANDARDS Active participation in the Graduate Program in Public Health courses and activities is a critical component of the professional development of all students. Lack of attendance for any reason does not relieve a student from responsibility for material cove red during that absence. Students should refer to the Academic Calendar for the Graduate Program in Public Health when planning any travel. Students should notify the Academic Program Office about any anticipated or sudden absence from a required activity (e.g., Public Health Research Day). Students should adhere to the attendance and absence policies outlined in each course syllabus. Timely attendance is an expectation of performance for all Graduate Program in Public Health students. This shows respect for peers, faculty, staff , and other community members . Students will be held accountable for adhering to their course schedul e and the lateness policies outlined in each course syllabus. MATRICULATION POLICY Once matriculated in the degree program offerings of the Graduate Program in Public Health at ISMMS, students are expected to maintain matriculation or request an alternative status (e.g., leave of absence, voluntary withdrawal, etc.), or may be placed in an alternate status by t he Academic Program Office and Program Director (e.g., administrative withdrawal, etc.). To maintain matriculation, students must either register for at least one credit -bearing course or register for MPH 8001 Maintenance of Matriculation for every term up until degree conferral. The Maintenance of Matriculation registration allows students continued eligibility to earn their degree while not pursuing coursework . Students on Maintenance of Matriculation will not be eligible for financial aid. The MPH 8001 Maintenance of Matriculation registration is $333 per term for students in trimester programs. Students with compelling circumstance who wish not to maintain their matriculation status but need to discontinue their studies for a period of time can ap ply for a Leave of Absence (LOA) from the program. Students who fail to register for a term or receive an approved LOA, will be administratively withdrawn from the Program, and will have to re -apply in order to continue their degree or certificate studies. LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE DEGREE The Graduate Program in Public Health is a dynamic, cutting edge public health program, and as such, the course work for the MPH degree is designed to be completed in a full -time, two -year program. Students ar e permitted to take courses on a part time basis. The MPH degree must be completed within five years of the student's first matriculation date, including the completion of the Culminating Experience. Advanced Certificate students have a maximum of two year s to complete the Advanced Certificate. Dual Degree MPH students have a maximum time to degree completion of seven years for the MPH degree. Students who do not complete the degree or certificate within this specified time frame will be withdrawn from the program. 53 A student will be permitted a maximum time limit to complete a degree: Degree Length as Designed (Years) Maximum Time to Complete Degree (Years) MPH 2 5 Advanced Certificate 1 2 Dual Degree with MPH 5 7 These time limits include any time for personal or medical leave of absence . In the Graduate Program in Public Health, benchmarks of satisfactory progress must be completed as outlined in the specific program requirements. Students who are approaching the time limit for completion will be reviewed with enough notice so that a plan is in place to enable the student to complete the requirements by the end of the time limit. If a student does not complete their degree within the Time to Compete Degree, it is the responsibility of the student to contact the Academic Program Office to discuss their plan to complete their degr ee. As students approach their maximum T ime to Complete Degree they will be reminded of the Length of Time to Complete Degree policy. The student will be placed on a registration hold, and required to meet with the Academic Program Office to ensure that the degree is completed by the end of their maximum Time to Complete Degree. Students who do not complete their degree within the required time frame are administrativ ely withdrawn from the program. Under extenuating circumstances an extension of the Maximum Time to Complete Degree may be granted by the Academic Program Office and Program Director . If a student's appeal for an extension is denied, the student may not reapply to the program. Validity of Coursework Program C ompetencies and course content change over time. Course credit awarded within a student's maximum Time to Complete D egree will be honored and count toward the 45 credits required for the MPH. However, course credit awarded outside of the m aximum Time to Complete Degree specified for the degree may be assessed on a case by case basis to determine the relevance of course material to contemporary topics in the field of Public Health. Credit earned in courses that are considered no longer valid by the Academic Program Office will not count toward the MPH or Advanced Certificate requirements. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Life circumstances may require students to take time away from courses or ISMMS. If the time away is extensive or indeterminate, a L eave of A bsence (LOA) may be considered. A LOA is a period of temporary non -enrollment. A LOA constitutes a mutual agr eement between the School and a student with regard to utilization of time during the leave, as well as the requirements that must be met prior to reentering the curriculum. All requests for a LOA are made directly to and granted at the discretion of the Academi c Program Office. LOA approval can only be obtained if the student maintains satisfactory academic progress (as defined on page 37). Students who fail to follow the Leave of 54 Absence procedure will be administratively withdrawn from the Program. If the student wishes to return at a later date, they must apply for admission. International students should consult with the Office of International Personnel to discuss their eligibility for a Leave of Absence. LOAs may be Medical, Personal, or Administrative. Medical LOA Either the student or Academic Program Office may initiate a medical LOA. A medical LOA may require a physic ian's endorsement and/or an administrative psychiatric or medical evaluation (see page 80). The term of the Leave may be to one year. The L eave may be extended for a second and final year at the discretion of the Academic Program Office and Program Director upon recommendation of a physician. All students on medical LOA are required to have health insurance and are eligible to continue with the School's student health insurance plan. Personal LOA A personal LOA enables a student to take time off to address issues of a personal nature, including those related to the health and well -being of a family member or partner. A LOA may also be granted for issues related to childbirth, adoption, or other parental responsibilities. Personal leaves for non- health or n on-family related circumstances may not be taken at any time when the student is not in good academic standing. Ordinarily, personal leaves may not exceed one year; however, requests to extend a personal leave into a second and final year will be consider ed under exceptional circumstances. All students on personal LOA are required to have health insurance and are eligible to continue on the School's student health insurance plan. Administrative LOA A LOA can also be administrative. An Administrative LOA is mandated by the Graduate School at ISMMS and Program Director and is usually as the result of a student not complying with school's administrative requirements. Documentation of LOAs The dates for all LOAs will be noted on the Transcript. The reason for the LOA will not be included in these documents, with the exception of an Administrative LOA, which will be desig nated as such on the transcript . Financial Implications of LOA To be eligible to receive federal and institutional student aid, the stud ent must meet and maintain the School's standards of satisfactory academic progress. (Please refer to the section entitled \"Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid\" page 43 .) 55 A Leave of Absence status greater than 180 days will move students out of their loan deferment period. The last date of attendance before the LOA is the \"Out of School\" date. After 180 days, the grace period ends and all educational federal loans will go into repa yment. Students are expected to meet with the Office of Enrollment Services before a LOA is finalized in order to fully understand the consequences of the LOA on loan repayment. Additional Information Students on a Leave of Absence are not eligible f or any benefits associated with student status , such as a travel award for the duration of the L eave. While on LOA a student will hav e library privileges suspended. Students on LOA may not participate in any educational opportunities at the Icahn School of Medicine for credit. A student who resides in Aron Hall may be required to vacate Aron Hall while on LOA, based on the nature and anticipated length of the LOA. Requests for an extension of a L eave of A bsence must follow the same procedure as indicated above. The period of an approve LOA is included in a student's Time to Complete Degree . A student who was on an approved LOA may request an extension of the Time to Complete Degree. Clearance to Begin Leaves of Absence, Withdraw, Transfer, or Otherwise Leave The School Students who go on a LOA must obtain clearance beforehand from the Academic Program Office and Program Director. The st udent will receive a letter of l eave and individualized conditions will apply. All students must meet the criteria and confirm agreement with the terms of the leave in writing. In addi tion, students must complete a form requiring the signatures of the requisite offices indicating that there are no outstanding debts or other encumbrances to the student's rec ord. When all the signatures are obtained, the student must ret urn the form to the Registrar's Office. There is a processing fee of $100.00 for leaves. Please contact the Academic Program Office for the appropriate forms. Return from LOA The Program Director approves students for return from a LOA. The point person for the return process is the Academic Program Office . Students should refer to the individualized terms of their leave letter and must complete all required evaluations or testing prior to return. In general return from a medical leave of absence requires a physician's note that the student is cleared to return to school. At the end of a specified period of LOA, if the student does not notify the Academic Program Office of their intentions, it will be assumed the student no longer wishes to be considered enrolled and will be administratively withdrawn . If a student wishes to app ly for reinstatement at a later date, a new application for admission must be completed. 56 STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE GRADUATE PROGRAM IN PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH DAY Public Health Research Day, held annually by the Graduate Program in Public Health, is a required event for all MPH students.

Prescriptions are av ailable for generic and brand medications with co -payment in the Mount Sinai Employee Pharmacy, provided the medication prescribed is in the Pharmacy formulary. Students who receive prescriptions for medications not carried by the formulary can obtain pres criptions at a local drug store. Each June, the open enrollment period for continuing students takes place. During the open enrollment period , students who wish to make adjustments to their insurance coverage will be able to update their benefit choices. Students must always carry basic health insurance. If a student waives from the Icahn School of Medicine plan, they must file a waiver form in the Enrollment Services Office and present proof of insurance from another source. Students who anticipate an eminent change in insurance needs should consult with a member of the Enrollment Services staff for guidance. When a student marries, has a child, or goes off their parent's insurance policy they must notify the Enrollment Services Office immediately followi ng that event so that the policy can be altered appropriately.

Security Guard st ations are located at the entrance to all buildings on the campus. Security measures at the Icahn School of Medicine are reviewed continuously to provide a secure environment for all who use its facilities. The policy requiring all students, faculty, and e mployees to wear Mount Sinai identification within the complex is implemented for protection and is enforced. The ID card must be displayed and worn upon entering all buildings and while on the premises. A student's personal security is of paramount import ance. For this reason Security will, upon request, provide escorts within 69 the Icahn School of Medicine and to on- campus residences. Call ext. 46068 or 46069 (from on -campus phones), or 212 -241-6068 / 212 -241-6069, approximately 10 to 15 minutes prior to de parture. Security is a function that requires the cooperation of everyone associated with the Icahn School of Medicine.

Emergency Alert System In order to allow for a more coordinated and rapid response to emergency or disaster s ituations at Mount Sinai, the Medical Center has a messaging system for faculty and students. The Emergency Alert System has the capability of informing students of and delivering instructions regarding city - wide, hospital, or student specific emergencies requiring immediate attention. Signing up for this system is mandatory for all medical students, as medical students are considered First Responders in the state of New York and are expected to aid in an emergency. During the online registration process upon matriculation, students are expected to provide their mobile device as the primary contact, but have the option of including a sequence of secondary contacts (e.g. home phone, email, etc.). Fire Safety It is critical to student safety as well as pat ients' well -being that students know what to do in the event of a fire. There is a session during orientation on fire safety. CODE RED is the mnemonic used to alert the Mount Sinai Community to enact the \"RACE\" protocol for fire emergencies. R = Rescue A = Alarm C = Confine E = Extinguish/evacuate 70 To use a fire extinguisher, the mnemonic is \"PASS\": P = Pull A = Aim S = Squeeze S = Sweep (at the base of the fire) The number to call in event of a fire is \"4 -FIRE\" (43473) and for other emergencies students should dial \"60\" from an in -house phone. On Blackboard, under Student Services is a section on emergency preparedness. This includes the fire bell codes for the tw elfth and thirteenth floors of the Annenberg building. The Mount Sinai Intranet has a fire safety video that all students should review.

PROGRAM STATEMENT The Graduate Program in Public health adheres to guidelines set forth by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the Graduate School of Biomedical Science s, and Human Resources policies regarding the following: rules of conduct, authorship policy, Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Director y Information, Records Kept by the Instituti on, Information Sharing and Confidentiality, Policy on Teach ing and Evaluation, Guidelines for Interactions between the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Industry, Acquired Immune Deficiency, Alcohol and Drugs Policy, Drug Testing, Alcohol Polic y - Levinson Student Center, Administrative Psychiatric Evalu ation, Harassment Policy, Sexual Misconduct Policy, Student Mistreatment Guideline, Affirmative Action Policy, and the Mount Sinai Health System Social Media Guideline. These policies are described in both the Medical Education and Graduate School of Biome dical Sciences Student Handbooks found here . RULES OF CONDUCT 1. All members of the School community, which for the purposes of these Rules and Regulations shall be defined as including faculty, students, organizations, members of the staff of the School, and all visitors and other licensees and invitees are expected to obey all national, state, and local laws. 2. All members of the School commu nity are prohibited from conduct which is proximate cause of or does unreasonably and unduly impede, obstruct or interfere with the orderly and continuous administration and operation of the School in the use of its facilities and the achievement of its pu rposes as an educational institution, or in its rights as a campus proprietor. Such conduct shall include, but is not limited to, that which is the actual or proximate cause of any of the following: a. Unreasonable interference with the rights of others; b. Intentional injury to school property; c. Unauthorized occupancy of classrooms, laboratories, libraries, faculty and administrative offices, patient care facilities, auditoriums, public halls and stairways, recreational areas and any other facilities used by the School (unauthorized occupancy being defined as failure to vacate any such facility when duly requested by the Dean, an Associate Dean, Assistant Dean, Hospital Administrator of similar responsibility or chair of a department of the School); d. Malicious use of or intentional damage to personal property, including records, papers and writings of any member of the School community; e. Any action or situation which recklessly or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health or involves the forced consumption of liquor or drugs for the purpose of initiation into or affiliation with any organization. The penalties set forth in Part II 74 are in addition to any penalty pursuant to the penal law or any other chapter to which the violator or organization may be subj ect for violation of this paragraph. f. Violations of these policies and regulations by students shall be referred to the Dean for Medical Education or Dean of the Graduate School. g. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing Rules and Regulations is intended to nor shall it be construed to limit or restrict freedom of speech or of peaceful assembly, or other individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution. h. The administration and faculty of the School are committed to providing a safe and healthy learning enviro nment for all students. Students should conduct themselves appropriately everywhere on the campus of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai Health System, and at affiliated institutions. Appropriate behavior is mandatory when participating in patient care or attending any functions at which patients may be present. In small group seminars, as well as during clinical activities, students are evaluated not only on their fund of knowledge and ability to use this knowledge but also on their responsibility, dependability, reliability, maturity, motivation, attitude, honesty, integrity, and ability to relate and interact effectively with others. i. Equally important is the realization that one's responsibilities do not end with individual behavior but a lso include not tolerating inappropriate behavior among others. While formal mechanisms, outlined in other sections, exist to provide due process for any specific allegations of inappropriate behavior, general issues should be able to be discussed freely among peers, faculty, and administration. Concerns requiring confidentiality should be discussed with the Dean of Medical Education, Dean of the Graduate School, individual faculty advisors, or through the School's Ombudsman Program. MISCONDUCT AND LAPSES IN PROFESSIONALISM Student misconduct includes, but is not limited to: cheating, plagiarism, breaches of confidentiality, falsification, unprofessional behavior toward staff, colleagues, and community members, use and abuse of illicit drugs, abuse or inappropriate use of alcohol, dishonesty, and failure to complete administrative, medical, and financial responsibilities. Administrative responsibilities include course evaluati ons, student health clearances , and other training as applicable . AFFIRMATIVE ACTION It is the policy of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai that all decisions regarding educati onal and employment opportunities and performance are made on the basis of merit and without discrimination because of age, race, color, language, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic disposition, ethnicity, culture, creed, national origin, citizenship physical or mental disability, socioeconomic status, veteran status, military status, marital status, being the v ictim of spousal abuse, or based on any other characteristic protected by law. In keeping with our continuing efforts to achieve a broadening of the representation of women and minority groups throughout the medical school, we have: 1. Developed an Affir mative Action Program which details actions designed to realize the School's commitment to equal educational and employment opportunities. 75 2. Insured our compliance with Federal, State, and Local laws and regulations implementing equal opportunity objectiv es by meeting the spirit as well as the letter of the law and contractual requirements . We cannot over -emphasize our commitment to the realization of these goals. Every decision affecting faculty, house staff, fellows, graduate students, employees, medical students, and other members of the medical school community rests solely on demonstrably valid criteria of merit, competence and experience. Additional information concerning the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Affirmative Action Program can b e found through the Human Resources Department of the Mount Sinai Health System. MOUNT SINAI HEALTH SYSTEM SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDELINE Social media are internet -based applications which support and promote the exchange of user - developed content. Some current examples include Facebook, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Posting personal images, experiences and information on these kinds of public sit es poses a set of unique challenges for all members of the Mount Sinai community, including employees, faculty, house staff, fellows, volunteers, and students (collectively \"Personnel\"). All personnel have responsibility to the Institution regardless of where or when they post something that may reflect poorly on Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai is committed to supporting your right to interact knowledgeably and socially; however these electronic interactions have a potential impact on patients, colleagues, Mount S inai, and future employers' opinions of you. The principal aim of this Guideline is to identify your responsibilities to Mount Sinai in relation to social media and to help you represent yourself and Mount Sinai in a responsible and professional manner. Guideline The following Guideline outlines appropriate standards of conduct related to all electronic information (text, image or auditory) that is created or posted externally on social media sites by Personnel affiliated with Mount Sinai. Examples include, but are not limited to: text messages, media messaging service (MMS), Twitter\u00ae, Facebook\u00ae, Linked -In\u00ae, YouTube\u00ae, and all other social networks, personal and organizational websites, blogs, wikis, and similar entities. This Guideline applies to future m edia with similar implications. It also applies whether Personnel are posting to: Mount Sinai- hosted sites; social media in which one's affiliation is known, identified, or presumed; or a self -hosted site, where the views and opinions expressed are not int ended to represent the official views of Mount Sinai. Reference to Other Policies - All existing policies of the Mount Sinai Health System apply to Personnel in connection with their social media activities. A list of relevant policies is included at the end of this Guideline . Best Practices - Everyone who participates in social media activities should understand and follow these simple but important Best Practices: Take Responsibility and Use Good Judgment. You are responsible for the material you post on personal blogs or other social media. Be courteous, respectful, and thoughtful about how other Personnel may perceive or be affected by postings. Incomplete, inaccurate, inappropriate, threatening, 76 harassing or poorly worded postings may be harmful to others. They may damage relationships, undermine Mount Sinai's brand or reputation, discourage teamwork, and negatively impact the institution's commitment to patient care, education, research, and community service. Think Before You Post. Anything you post is highly likely to be permanently connected to you and your reputation through Internet and email archives. Future employers can often have access to this information and may use it to evaluate you. Take great care and be thoughtful before placing your identifiable comments in the public domain. Protect Patient Privacy. Disclosing information about patients without written permission, including photographs or potentially identifiable information is strictly prohibited. These rules also apply to deceased patients and to posts in the secure section of your Facebook page that is accessible by approved friends only. Protect Your Own Privacy. Make sure you understand how the privacy policies and security features work on the sites where you are posting mater ial. Respect Work Commitments . Ensure that your blogging, social networking, and other external media activities do not interfere with your work commitments. Identify Yourself. If you communicate in social media about Mount Sinai, disclose your connection with Mount Sinai and your role at the Health System. Use good judgment and strive for accuracy in your communications. False and unsubstantiated claims and inaccurate or inflammatory postings may create liability for you. Use a Disclaimer. Where your connection to Mount Sinai is apparent, make it clear that you are speaking for yourself and not on behalf of Mount Sinai. A disclaimer, such as, \"The views expressed on this [blog; website] are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer,\" may be appr opriate. Respect Copyright and Fair Use Laws. For Mount Sinai's protection as well as your own, it is critical that you show proper respect for the laws governing copyri ght and fair use of copyrighted material owned by others, including Mount Sinai's own copyrights and brands. Protect Proprietary Information . Do not share confidential or proprietary information that may compromise Mount Sinai's business practices or security. Similarly, do not share information in violation of any laws or regulations. Seek Expert Guidance. Consult with the Marketing & Communications Department if you have any questions about the appropriateness of materials you plan to publish or if you require clarification on whether specific information has been publicly disclosed before you disclose it publicly. Social media may generate interest from the press. If you are contacted by a member of the media about a Mount Sinai- related blog posting or Health System information of any kind, contact the Press Office, a division of the Mar keting & Communications Department, at 212 -241-9200 or newsmedia@mssm.edu . Failure to abide by Mount Sinai policies may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Applicable Policies - 77 These policies include, but are not limited to: Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) or Confidential Mount Sinai Materials; Computer Use Policy; Use of Mount Sinai's Trademarks and Proprietary Information; Electronic Communications; Confidenti ality of the Medical Record; Camera and Video Recorder Use; Portable Electronic Devices; Human Resources Policies 13.5 (Electronic Mail/Email) and 13.6 (Internet Use); and all professionalism policies and codes of conduct. Policies not listed above that ar e in the Human Resources Manual, the Faculty Handbook, the House Staff Manual, the Student Handbook and the Bylaws of the Hospital Staff also apply. The following are fictional use -case examples of social media and blogging activities and an explanation o f their appropriateness as per the Mount Sinai Health System Social Media Guideline: 1. A patient attempts to \"friend\" an attending physician on Facebook. This is almost always inappropriate, unless the doctor -patient relationship has ended. Even after th e doctor - patient relationship has ended, it would be inappropriate to discuss health- related information. (Best Practice 3) 2. A patient comments on a Mount Sinai physician's blog and discloses protec ted health information with the expectation that the Mo unt Sinai physician will continue the discussion . Any health -related discussions by email with patients require a written consent. Similarly, social media discussion with a patient should not directly address health concerns of individual patients. (Best P ractice 3) 3. A medical student \"tweets\" that he just finished rounds with the residents on a patient and describes the clinical findings of that patient. It is difficult to be certain that information disclosed in the Twitter\u00ae post is not identifiable to that particular patient. The best type of posting would include very general information. Other posts by the same student could indicate his/her medical school and current rotation, leading to circumstances that indirectly identify the patient, such as by naming a very rare disease. (Best Practice 3) 4. A medical student writes in her blog, naming an attending physician who did minimal teaching on rounds and recommending that other students not take clinical electives with that physician. Legitimate critique of an educational activity is appropriate, so long as professionalism is maintained. There are more effective and less publ ic mechanisms for relaying this type of information, and the student may be counseled accordingly. (Best Practices 1, 2) 5. A graduate student posts to his \"wall\" on Facebook that half of the class was sleeping during Dr. X's lecture on biostatistics. This is very similar to the use case above. (Best Practices 1, 2) 6. A pediatric resident posts (on her Facebook wall) a pict ure of a baby who was just discharged from her service, expressing joy, best wishes to the family, and congratulating everyone involved in this excellent patient outcome. Without written patient/representative consent, this is a clear violation of patient confidentiality, even if the patient is not named. (Best Practice 3) 7. A laboratory technician blogs that the laboratory equipment he is using should have been replaced years ago and is unreliable. The public disclosure of such information increases the liability for the Health System and is clearly unprofessional. There are legitimate and confidential mechanisms for improving quality at the Health System. (Best Practices 1, 2) 78 8. A graduate student wearing a Mount Sinai t -shirt is tagged in a photo taken at a local bar and posted on a friend's Facebook page. The graduate student is clearly inebriated. The two issues are that: (1) the Mount Sinai logo identifies the affiliation to the institution; and (2) the unprofessional behavior of the student is available for all to see, including future employers and potential patients of Mount Sinai. The graduate student did not post the photo, but should do everything possible to have the photo removed and remove the tagging link to the student's own Facebook page . (Best Practices 2, 4) 9. A postdoctoral fellow blogs that her laboratory technician wears too much cologne, has terrible taste in clothes, and takes overly long lunch breaks. Thi s is an inappropriate forum and set of comments and demonstrates unprofessional behavior by the post -doctoral fellow. There are legitimate and confidential mechanisms for addressing valid concerns in the workplace. (Best Practices 1, 2) 10. An oncology nurse practitioner uses an alias and blogs that Mount Sinai has the lowest bone marrow transplantation complication rate in the world. This may be a violation of Federal Trade Commission regulations that prohibit false or unsubstantiated claims, and does not disclose the employee's material relationship to Mount Sinai. (Best Practice 6) 11. An applicant to the School of Medicine is given access to an Icahn School of Medicine blog to comment on the experience. The applicant writes that another medical school in NYC is obviously more prestigious and has better housing. Mount Sinai has no recourse against non- affiliated individuals. The administrator of the blog should have established policies and procedures for editorial procedures. If the blog posting meets these editorial guidelines, then the blog posting should remain. It is likely that others will debate the original comment and place Icahn School of Medicine's reputation and housing status in context. 12. A medical student creates a social media website to discuss medical knowledge (e.g., \"Cardiology Interest Group\" on Facebook\u00ae) This is a lea rning community environment, in which medical knowledge is exchanged, shared and discussed. While the goal is laudable, there are still risks. A disclaimer is necessary, since postings may be incorrect, taken out of context, or improperly referenced. The moderator should take precautions to prevent the posting of information potentially identifiable to a particular patient. (Best Practices 1, 3 ,6, 7) Addendum to the Social Media Policy As stated in the Instituti onal policy, posting personal images, experiences and information on public websites poses a set of unique challenges for all members of the Mount Sinai community. We have developed additional guidelines below to assist the navigation online relationships, sharing of information and the challenges that come with an online presence. 1. Student, Faculty and Staff Interaction. Students, Faculty and Staff should be respectful when requesting or contacting each other on social media. It is important to consider that the person being contacted may have professional/personal boundaries and may not consider relationships on social media to be appropriate. 2. Posting on social media . When posting on social media or viewing/sha ring/liking on these platforms, keep in mind that anyone may be able to view these mat erials (including those you are 79 friends with and potential future employers). Refer to the Institutional Policy above for more information. 3. Interaction on social media. By connecting on social medi a, you acknowledge that you are engaging with each other outside the professional boundaries of the educational environment. It is important to consider that individuals have differing viewpoints, and you should engage in respectful and professional conversations. STUDENT MISTREATMENT GUIDELINE The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is dedicated to providing its students, residents, faculty, staff and patients with an environment of respect , dignity, and support. All members of the Icahn School of Medicine community are responsible for protecting student rights as specified in our Studen t and Faculty Codes of Conduct and institutional policies. The Student Mistreatment Guideline (found in the ISMMS handbooks here ) supplements the institutional policies on harassment and grievances and sexual misconduct, will assist in developing and maintaining optimal learning environments, and encourages educators and students alike to accept their responsibilities as representatives of Icahn School of Medicine in their inte ractions with their colleagues, staff , and community members. Student mistreatment concerns will be han dled according to the following process: All student mistreatment related records will remain confidential and only de -identified data will be presented at mistreatment review meetings. Depending upon the severity or complexity of the mistreatment, or at the request of the affected student, the case may be referred to an appropriate group or department at the Icahn School of Medicine, including the Title IX Coordinator, Grievance Committee , Program Director, or the Deans. STUDENT GRIEVANCE POLICY Student s of the Graduate Program in Public Health are encouraged to bring forward grievances. Grievances are defined as dissatisfaction occurring when a student feels or thinks that an event or a condition affects them is unjust, inequitable, or creates unnecessa ry hardships. Grievances include, but are not limited to: academic problems that cannot be readily resolved with Course Directors (including but not exclusive: grading, coursework or degree requirement decisions); mistreatment by employees; wrongful assess ment or processing of fees; records or registration errors; and discrimination because of race, national origin, sex, marital status, religion, age or handicap. The grievance procedures described here do not apply to actions of professional misconduct (dishonest, unethical or irresponsible behavior), sexual harassment, suspension and dismissal for cause. Grievance Procedure All students and faculty are encouraged to resolve issues in an amiable and equitable manner as soon as they arise. Recognizing that this does not always happen, the following procedures are set forth for students to follow to seek resolution to grievances. All students enrolled in the Graduate Program in Public Health with grievances should follow these guidelines: 1. The initial step of the student grievance procedure is for the student to first try to seek an informal resolution or redress through discussions with the person(s) alleged to have caused the grievance. This meeting should be held as soon as the student first becomes aware of the act or conditions that are the basis for the grievance. 80 2. If, in the opinion of the student or faculty person, a satisfactory solution or relief has not been provided, the student or faculty person should discuss the grievance with the appropriate Track Advisor. 3. If the grievance is still not resolved, the student or faculty member should prepare a written narrative that describes details including the nature of the grievance, when it occurred and what steps have already been taken towards resolution . This information should be communicated promptly to the Program Director and/or the Assistant Program Director who will then bring it to the attention of the Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee. 4. The Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee, will re view the information, meet with those involved, investigate to gather all pertinent information, and share this information to the Academic Advisory Committee for review and recommended action. 5. Recommendation from the Academic Advisory Committee will be communicated to the Program Director. Based on the recommendation, the Program Director makes a final decision. All formal grievances will be tracked and every effort will be made to resolve them in a timely manner. Depending upon the severity or complexity of the grievance , or at the request of the affected student, the case may be referred to an appropriate group or department at the Icahn School of Medicine, including the Title IX Coordinator, Office of the Ombudsp erson, Program Director or the Deans. GIFT POLICY According to the policy of the Graduate Program in Public Health , faculty cannot accept any form of gift from the students. Likewise, students cannot accept any gift from the faculty. ADMINISTRATIVE REFERRAL TO HEALTH SERVICES ISMMS reserves the right to request an administrative referral to mental heal th services at any time for any reason (also known as an administrative psychiatric evaluation ). The request will be discussed with the student. Specific questions will be sent to the Director of Student Mental Health or the Senior Consulting Psychiatrist or Clinician for assessment. The Program Director will receive a written response, in the form of a password protected electronic file, from the clinician regarding the student. The response is password protected in the student's file. The purpose of the referral always stems from concern for the student and a request for information to help in academic counseling. Specific recommendations may be f orwarded to the School administration, which can then impose certain requirements on the student. Examples (not all inclusive) might include required intervals for therapy, mandated drug testing, repeat administrative evaluations, monitoring, and L eave of A bsence. Refusal to comply with an administrative evaluation or with recommendations stemming from an administrative evaluation is grounds for dismissal. These evaluations are never shared with outside entities unless legally subpoenaed. "}
