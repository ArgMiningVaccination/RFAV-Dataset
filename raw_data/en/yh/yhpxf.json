This document supercedes the relevant sections contained in the 1985 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Guideline for Handwashing and Environmental Control. 1 Because maximum effectiveness from disinfection and sterilization results from first cleaning and removing organic and inorganic materials, this document also reviews cleaning methods. The chemical disinfec tants discussed for pati ent-care peracetic acid, phenolics, quaternary ammonium compounds, and chlorine. The choice of disinfectant, concentration, and exposure time is based on the risk for infection associated with use of the equipment and other factors discussed in this guideline. The sterilization methods discussed include steam sterilization, ethylene oxide (ETO), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid. When properly used, these cleaning, disinf ection, and sterilization processes can reduce the risk for infection associated with use of invasive and noninvasive m edical and surgical devices. However, for these processes to be effective, health-care workers shoul d adhere strictly to the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization recommendations in this docum ent and to instructions on product labels. In addition to updated recommendations, new topics addressed in this guideline include 1) inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, bioterrorist agents, emerging pathogens, and bloodborne pathogens; 2) toxicologic, environmental, and occupati onal concerns associated with disinfection and sterilization practices; 3) disinfection of patient-care equipment used in ambulatory settings and home care; 4) new sterilization processes, such as hy drogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and 5) disinfection of complex medical instruments (e.g., endoscopes). 7Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 INTRODUCTION In the United States, approximately 46.5 milli on surgical procedures and even more invasive medical procedures\u2014including approximately 5 million gastrointestinal endoscopies\u2014are performed each year. 2 Each procedure involves contact by a medical device or surgical instrument with a patient's sterile tissue or mucous membranes. A major risk of all such procedures is the introduction of pathogens that can lead to infection. Failure to properly disinfect or sterilize equipment carries not only risk associated with breach of host barriers but also ri sk for person-to-person transmission (e.g., hepatitis B virus) and transmission of environmental pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). Disinfection and sterilization are essential for ens uring that medical and surgical instruments do not transmit infectious pathogens to patients. Becaus e sterilization of all patient-care items is not necessary, health-care policies must identify, primarily on the basis of the items' intended use, whether cleaning, disinfection, or sterilization is indicated. Multiple studies in many countries have documented lack of compliance with established guidelines for disinfection and sterilization. 3-6 Failure to comply with scientifically-based guidelines has led to numerous outbreaks. 6-12 This guideline presents a pragmatic approach to the judicious selection and proper use of disinfection and sterilization processes; the approach is based on well-designed studies assessing the efficacy (through laboratory investigations) and effectiveness (through clinical studies) of disinfection and sterilization procedures. METHODS This guideline resulted from a review of all MEDLINE articles in Eng lish listed under the MeSH headings of disinfection or sterilization (focusing on health-care equipm ent and supplies) from January 1980 through August 2006. References listed in these articles also were reviewed. Selected articles published before 1980 were reviewed and, if still relevant, included in the guideline. The three major peer- reviewed journals in infection control\u2014 American Journal of Infection Control, Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, and Journal of Hospital Infection \u2014were searched for relevant articles published from January 1990 through August 2006. Abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and Association for professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology , Inc. during 1997-2006 also were reviewed; however, abstracts were not used to support the recommendations. DEFINITION OF TERMS Sterilization describes a process that destroys or elim inates all forms of microbial life and is carried out in health-care facilities by physical or chemical methods. Steam under pressure, dry heat, EtO gas, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid chemic als are the principal sterilizing agents used in health-care facilities. Sterilization is intended to convey an absolut e meaning; unfortunately, however, some health professionals and the technical and comme rcial literature refer to \"disinfection\" as \"sterilization\" and items as \"partially sterile.\" When chemicals ar e used to destroy all forms of microbiologic life, they can be called chemical st erilants. These same germicides used for shorter exposure periods also can be part of the disinfection process (i.e., high-level disinfection). Disinfection describes a process that eliminates m any or all pathogenic microorganisms, except bacterial spores, on inanimate objects (Tables 1 and 2). In health-care setti ngs, objects usually are disinfected by liquid chemicals or wet pasteurization. Each of the various factors that affect the efficacy of 8Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 disinfection can nullify or limit the efficacy of the process. Factors that affect the efficacy of both disinfection and steriliz ation include prior cleaning of the object; organic and inorganic load present; type and level of microbial contamination; concentration of and exposure time to the germicide; physical nature of the object (e.g., crevices, hinges, and lumens); presence of biofilms; temperature and pH of the di sinfection process; and in some cases, relative humidity of the sterilization pr ocess (e.g., ethylene oxide). Unlike sterilization, disinfection is not sporicidal. A few disinfec tants will kill spores with prolonged exposure times (3-12 hours); these are called chemical sterilants . At similar concentrations but with shorter exposure periods (e.g., 20 minutes for 2% gl utaraldehyde), these same disinfectants will kill all microorganisms except large numbers of bacterial spores; they are called high-level disinfectants . Low- level disinfectants can kill most vegetative bacteria, some fungi , and some viruses in a practical period of time ( <10 minutes). Intermediate-level disinfectants might be cidal for mycobacte ria, vegetative bacteria, most viruses, and most fungi but do not necessarily kill bacterial spores. Germ icides differ markedly, primarily in their antimicrobial spectrum and rapidity of action. Cleaning is the removal of visible soil (e.g., organic and inorganic material) from objects and surfaces and normally is accomplished manually or mechanically using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is essential before high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on t he surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Decontamination removes pathogenic microorganisms from objects so they are safe to handle, use, or discard. Terms with the suffix cide or cidal for killing action also are commonly used. For example, a germicide is an agent that can kill microorganisms, particularly pathogenic organisms (\"germs\"). The term germicide includes both antisepti cs and disinfectants. Antiseptics are germicides applied to living tissue and skin; disinfectants are antimicrobials applied only to inani mate objects. In general, antiseptics are used only on the skin and not for surface disinfection, and disinfectants are not used for skin antisepsis because they can injure skin and other tissues. Vi rucide, fungicide, bactericide, sporicide, and tuberculocide can kill the type of mi croorganism identified by the prefix . For example, a bactericide is an agent that kills bacteria. 13-18 9Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 A RATIONAL APPROACH TO DISINFECTION AND STERILIZATION More than 30 years ago, Earle H. Spaulding devised a rational approach to disinfection and sterilization of patient -care items and equipment.14 This classification scheme is so clear and logical that it has been retained, refined, and successfully used by infection control professionals and others when planning methods for disinfection or sterilization. 1, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20 Spaulding believed the nature of disinfection could be understood readily if instrument s and items for patient care were categorized as critical, semicritical, and noncritical according to t he degree of risk for infection involved in use of the items. The CDC Guideline for Handwashing and Hospital Environmental Control 21, Guidelines for the Prevention of Transmission of Human Immunodeficien cy Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) to Health-Care and Public-Safety Workers22, and Guideline for Environmental Infection Control in Health- Care Facilities23 employ this terminology. Critical Items Critical items confer a high risk for infection if they are contaminated with any microorganism. Thus, objects that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system must be sterile because any microbial contamination could transmit disease. This category includes surgical instruments, cardiac and urinary catheters, implants, and ultrasound probes used in sterile body cavities . Most of the items in this category should be purchased as sterile or be sterilized with steam if possible. Heat-sensitive objects can be treated with EtO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma; or if other methods are unsuitable, by liquid chemical sterilants. Germicides categoriz ed as hydrogen peroxide with 0.23% per acetic acid, 0.2% per acetic acid, and 0.08% peracetic acid with 1.0% hydrogen peroxide. Liquid chem ical sterilants reliably produce sterility only if cleaning precedes treatment and if proper guidelines are followed regar ding concentration, contact time, temperature, and pH. Semicritical Items Semicritical items contact mucous membr anes or nonintact skin. This category includes respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipm ent, some endoscopes, laryngoscope blades 24, cystoscopes 25, anorectal manometry catheters, and diaphragm fitting rings. These medical devices should be free from all microorganisms; however, small numbers of bacterial spores are permissible. Intact mucous membranes, such as those of the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract, generally are resistant to infection by common bacterial spores but susceptible to other organisms, such as bacteria, mycobacteria, and viruses. Semicritical items minimally require high-level disinfection using chemical disinfectants. Gl utaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, ortho-phthalaldehyde, and peracetic acid with hydrogen peroxide are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are dependable high- level disinfectants provided the factors influencing germicidal proc edures are met (Table 1). When a disinfectant is selected for use wi th certain patient-care items, the chemical compatibility after extended use with the items to be disinfected also must be considered. High-level disinfection traditionally is defined as complete elimination of all microorganisms in or on an instrument, except for small numbers of bacte rial spores. The FDA definition of high-level disinfection is a sterilant used for a s horter contact time to achieve a 6-log 10 kill of an appropriate Mycobacterium species. Cleaning followed by high-leve l disinfection should eliminate enough pathogens to prevent transmission of infection . 26, 27 Laparoscopes and arthroscopes entering sterile tissue ideally should be sterilized between patients. However, in the United States, this equi pment sometimes undergoes only high-level disinfection between patients. 28-30 As with flexible endoscopes, these devic es can be difficult to clean and high-level disinfect or sterilize because of intricate device design (e.g., long narrow lumens, hinges). Meticulous 10Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 cleaning must precede any high-level disinfection or sterilization process. Although sterilization is preferred, no reports have been published of outbreaks re sulting from high-level disinfection of these scopes when they are properly cleaned and high-level di sinfected. Newer models of these instruments can withstand steam sterilization that for critical items would be preferable to high-level disinfection. Rinsing endoscopes and flushing channels with sterile water, filtered water, or tap water will prevent adverse effects associated with disinfectant retained in t he endoscope (e.g., disinfectant-induced colitis). Items can be rinsed and flushed using sterile water after high-level disinfection to prevent contamination with organisms in tap wate r, such as nontuberculous mycobacteria, 10, 31, 17, 36-38 Alternatively, a tapwater or filtered water (0.2 filter) rinse should be followed by an alcohol rinse and forced air drying. 28, 38-40 Forced-air drying markedly reduces bacterial contamination of st ored endoscopes, most likely by removing the wet environment favorable for bacterial growth. 39 After rinsing, items should be dried and stored (e.g., packaged) in a manner that protects them from recontamination. Some items that may come in contact with nonintact skin for a brief period of time (i.e., hydrotherapy tanks, bed side rails) ar e usually considered noncritical su rfaces and are disinfected with intermediate-level disinfectants (i .e., phenolic, iodophor, alcohol, chlorine) 23. Since hydrotherapy tanks have been associated with spread of infection, some facilities have chosen to disinfect them with recommended levels of chlorine 23, 41. In the past, high-level disinfection was re commended for mouthpieces and spirometry tubing (e.g., glutaraldehyde) but cleaning the interior surfac es of the spirometers was considered unnecessary. 42 This was based on a study that showed that m outhpieces and spirometry tubing become contaminated with microorganisms but there was no bacterial contami nation of the surfaces in side the spirometers. Filters have been used to prevent contam ination of this equipment distal to the filter; such filters and the proximal mouthpiece are changed between patients. Noncritical Items Noncritical items are those that come in contac t with intact skin but not mucous membranes. Intact skin acts as an effective barrier to most micr oorganisms; therefore, the st erility of items coming in contact with intact skin is \"not critical.\" In th is guideline, noncritical items are divided into noncritical patient care items and noncriti cal environmental surfaces 43, 44. Examples of noncritical patient-care items are bedpans, blood pressure cuffs, crutches and computers 45. In contrast to critical and some semicritical items, most noncritical reusable items may be decontaminated where they are used and do not need to be transported to a central processi ng area. Virtually no risk has been documented for transmission of infectious agents to patients through noncritical items 37 when they are used as noncritical items and do not contact non-intact skin and/or mucous membranes. Table 1 lists several low-level disinfectants that may be used for noncritical item s. Most Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)- registered disinfectants have a 10-minute label claim. However, multip le investigators have demonstrated the effectiveness of these disinfect ants against vegetative bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis ), viruses (e.g. poliovirus) at exposure times of 30-60 seconds46-64 Federal law requires all applicable label instructions on EPA-registered products to be followed (e.g., use-d ilution, shelf life, storage, material compatibility, safe use, and disposal). If the user selects exposure conditions (e .g., exposure time) that differ from those on the EPA- registered products label, the user assumes liability fo r any injuries resulting from off-label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under F ederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) 65. Noncritcal environmental surfaces include bed ra ils, some food utensils, bedside tables, patient furniture and floors. Noncritical environmental surf aces frequently touched by hand (e.g., bedside tables, 11Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 bed rails) potentially could contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of health-care workers or by contacting medical equipm ent that subsequently contacts patients 13, 46-48, 51, 66, 67. Mops and reusable cleaning cloths are regularly used to achieve low-level disinfection on environmental surfaces. However, they often are not adequately cleaned and disinfected, and if the water-disinfectant mixture is not changed regularly (e.g., after every three to four rooms, at no longer than 60-minute intervals), the mopping procedure actually can sp read heavy microbial contamination throughout the health-care facility 68. In one study, standard laundering provi ded acceptable decontamination of heavily contaminated mopheads but chemical disinfec tion with a phenolic was less effective. 68 Frequent laundering of mops (e.g., daily), therefore, is recommended. Single-use disposable towels impregnated with a disinfectant also can be used for low-level di sinfection when spot-cleaning of noncritical surfaces is needed45. Changes in Disinfection and Sterilization Since 1981 The Table in the CDC Guideline for Environmental Control prepared in 1981 as a guide to the appropriate selection and use of disinfectants has undergone several important changes (Table 1). 15 First, formaldehyde-alcohol has been deleted as a recommended chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectant because it is irritating and toxic and not commonly used. Second, several new chemical sterilants have been added, including hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid 58, 69, 70, and peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in combination. Third, 3% phenolics and iodophors have been deleted as high-level disinfectants because of their unproven efficacy against bacterial spores, M. tuberculosis, and/or some fungi. 55, 71 Fourth, isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol have been excluded as high-level disinfectants 15 because of their inability to inactivate bacterial spores and because of the inability of isopropyl alcohol to inactivate hydrophilic viruses (i.e., poliovirus, coxsackie 0.075% sodium phenate when diluted) has been deleted as a high-level disinfectant because this product was removed from the marketplace in December 1991 because of a lack of bactericidal activity in the presence of organic matter; a lack of fungicidal, tuberculocidal and sporicidal activity; and reduced virucidal activity. 49, 55, 56, 71, 73-79 Sixth, the exposure time required to achieve high-level disinfection has been changed from 10-30 minutes to 12 minutes or more depending on the FDA-cleared label claim and the scientific literature. 27, 55, 69, 76, 80-84 A glutaraldehyde and an ortho-phthalaldehyde have an FDA-cleared label claim of 5 minutes when used at 35oC and 25oC, respectively, in an automated endoscope reprocessor with FDA-cleared capability to maintain the solution at the appropriate temperature. 85 In addition, many new subjects have been added to the guideline. These include inactivation of emerging pathogens, bioterrorist agents, and bl oodborne pathogens; toxicologic, environmental, and occupational concerns associated with disinfection and sterilization practices; di sinfection of patient-care equipment used in ambulatory and home care; inacti vation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; new sterilization processes, such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and disinfection of complex medical instruments (e.g., endoscopes). 12Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 DISINFECTION OF HEALTHCARE EQUIPMENT Concerns about Implementing the Spaulding Scheme One problem with implementing the aforementi oned scheme is oversimplific ation. For example, the scheme does not consider problems with reproce ssing of complicated medical equipment that often is heat-sensitive or problems of inactivating certain types of infectious agents (e.g., prions, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD] agent). Thus, in so me situations, choosing a method of disinfection remains difficult, even after consideration of the categories of risk to patients. This is true particularly for a few medical devices (e.g., arthroscopes, laparoscopes) in the critical categor y because of controversy about whether they should be sterilized or high-level disinfected. 28, 86 Heat-stable scopes (e.g., many rigid scopes) should be steam sterilized. Some of these items cannot be steam sterilized because they are heat-sensitive; additionally, ster ilization using ethylene oxide (EtO ) can be too time-consuming for routine use between patients (new technologies, su ch as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and peracetic acid reprocessor, provide faster cycle times). Howeve r, evidence that sterilizati on of these items improves patient care by reducing the infection risk is lacking29, 87-91. Many newer models of these instruments can withstand steam sterilization, which for cr itical items is the preferred method. Another problem with implementing the Spaulding scheme is processing of an instrument in the semicritical category (e.g., endoscope) that would be us ed in conjunction with a critical instrument that contacts sterile body tissues. For example, is an endoscope used for upper gastrointestinal tract investigation still a semicritical item when used with sterile biopsy forceps or in a patient who is bleeding heavily from esophageal varices? Provided that high-level disinfection is achieved, and all microorganisms except bacterial spores have been re moved from the endoscope, the device should not represent an infection risk and should remain in the semicritical category 92-94 . Infection with spore- forming bacteria been reported from appr opriately high-level disinfected endoscopes. An additional problem with implementation of t he Spaulding system is t hat the optimal contact time for high-level disinfection has not been defined or varies among professional organizations, resulting in different strategies for disinfecting different types of semicritical items (e.g., endoscopes, applanation tonometers, endocavitary transducers, cryosurgical instruments, and diaphragm fitting rings). Until simpler and effective alternatives are identified for device disinfection in clinical settings, following this guideline, other CDC guidelines 1, 22, 95, 96 and FDA-cleared instructions for the liquid chemical sterilants/high-level disinfectants would be prudent. Reprocessing of Endoscopes Physicians use endoscopes to diagnose and tr eat numerous medical disorders. Even though endoscopes represent a valuable diagnostic and therapeut ic tool in modern medicine and the incidence of infection associated with their use reportedl y is very low (about 1 in 1.8 million procedures) 97, more healthcare-associated outbreaks have been linked to contaminated endoscopes than to any other medical device 6-8, 12, 98. To prevent the spread of health-car e-associated all heat-sensitive endoscopes (e.g., gastrointestinal endoscopes, br onchoscopes, nasopharygoscopes) must be properly cleaned and, at a minimum, subjected to high-level disi nfection after each use. High-level disinfection can be expected to destroy all microorganisms, although w hen high numbers of bacterial spores are present, a few spores might survive. Because of the types of body cavities they enter, flexible endoscopes acquire high levels of microbial contamination (bioburden) during each use 99. For example, the bioburden found on flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes after use has ranged from 105 colony forming units (CFU)/mL to 1010 CFU/mL, with the highest levels found in the suction channels 99-102. The average load on bronchoscopes before cleaning was 6.4x104 CFU/mL. Cleaning reduces the level of microbial contamination by 4-6 log 10 83, 103. Using human immunovirus (HIV)-contaminated endoscopes, several investigators have shown that cleaning completely eliminates the mi crobial contamination on the scopes 104, 105. Similarly, other investigators found that EtO steriliz ation or soaking in 2% glutaral dehyde for 20 minutes was effective only when the device first was properly cleaned 106. 13Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 FDA maintains a list of cleared liquid chemical st erilants and high-level disi nfectants that can be used to reprocess heat-sensitive medical devices, such as flexible endoscopes (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/germlab.ht ml). At this time, the FDA-cleared peroxide with 0.08% peracetic acid, and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide 85. These products have excellent antimicrobial activity; however, some oxidizing chemicals (e.g ., 7.5% hydrogen 1.0% hydrogen peroxide with 0.08% peracetic acid [la tter product is no longer marketed]) reportedly have caused cosmetic and functional damage to endoscopes 69. Users should check with device manufacturers for information about germicide compatibility with their device. If the germicide is FDA-cleared, then it is safe when used according to label directions; however, professional s should review the scientific literature for newly available data regarding human safety or materials co mpatibility. EtO sterilization of flexible endoscopes is infrequent because it requires a lengthy processi ng and aeration time (e.g., 12 hours) and is a potential hazard to staff and patients. The two products most commonly used for reprocessing endoscopes in the United States are glutaraldehyde and an automated, liquid chemical st erilization process that uses peracetic acid 107. The American Society for Gastrointe stinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommends glutaraldehyde solutions that do not contain surfactants because the soapy residues of surfactants are difficult to remove during rinsing 108. ortho-phthalaldehyde has begun to replace glutaraldehyde in many health-care facilities because it has several potentia l advantages over glutaraldehyde: is not known to irritate the eyes and nasal passages, does not requi re activation or exposure monitoring, and has a 12- minute high-level disinfection claim in the United States 69. Disinfectants that are not FDA-cleared and should not be used for reprocessing endoscopes in clude iodophors, chlorine solutions, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and phenolics. These solutions might still be in use outside the United States, but their use should be strongly disc ouraged because of lack of proven efficacy against all microorganisms or materials incompatibility. FDA clearance of the contact conditions listed on germicide labeling is based on the manufacturer's test results (http ://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/germl ab.html). Manufacturers test the product under worst-case conditions for germicide formulat ion (i.e., minimum recommended concentration of the active ingredient), and include organic soil. Typically manufacturers use 5% serum as the organic soil and hard water as examples of organic and inorganic c hallenges. The soil represents the organic loading to which the device is exposed during actual use and t hat would remain on the device in the absence of cleaning. This method ensures that the contact condi tions completely eliminate the test mycobacteria (e.g., 105 to 106 Mycobacteria tuberculosis in organic soil and dried on a scope) if inoculated in the most difficult areas for the disinfectant to penetrate and contact in the absence of cleaning and thus provides a margin of safety 109. For 2.4% glutaraldehyde that r equires a 45-minute immersion at 25\u00baC to achieve high-level disinfection (i.e., 100% kill of M. tuberculosis ). FDA itself does not conduct testing but relies solely on the disinfectant manufac turer's data. Data suggest that M. tuberculosis levels can be reduced by at least 8 log 10 with cleaning (4 log 10) 83, 101, 102, 110, followed by chemical disinfection for 20 minutes at 20oC (4 to 6 log 10) 83, 93, 111, 112. On the basis of these data, APIC 113, the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (SGNA) 38, 114, 115, the ASGE 108, American College of Chest Physicians 12, and a multi-society guideline 116 recommend alternative contact conditions with 2% glutaraldehyde to achieve high-level disinfection (e.g., that equipment be immersed in 2% glutaraldehyde at 20oC for at least 20 minutes for high-level disinfection). Federal regulations are to follow the FDA-cleared label claim for high- level disinfectants. The FDA-cleared labels for hi gh-level disinfection with >2% glutaraldehyde at 25oC range from 20-90 minutes, depending upon the product based on three tier testing which includes AOAC sporicidal tests, simulated use testi ng with mycobacterial and in-use testing. The studies supporting the efficacy of >2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at 20\u00baC assume adequate cleaning prior to disinfection, whereas the FDA-cleared label claim incorporates an added margin of safety to accommodate possible lapses in cleaning practices. Facilities that hav e chosen to apply the 20 minute duration at 20\u00baC have done so based on the IA recommendation in the July 2003 SHEA position paper, \"Multi-society Guideline for Reprocessing Flexible Gastrointestinal Endoscopes\" 19, 57, 83, 94, 108, 111, 116-121. 14Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Flexible endoscopes are particularly difficult to disinfect 122 and easy to damage because of their intricate design and delicate materials. 123 Meticulous cleaning must precede any sterilization or high- level disinfection of these instruments. Failure to perform good cleaning can result in sterilization or disinfection failure, and outbreaks of infection can occur. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of cleaning in experimental studi es with the duck hepatitis B virus (HBV) 106, 124, HIV 125and Helicobacter pylori . 126 of health-care-associated infe ctions related only to endoscopes through July 1992 found 281 infections transmitted by gastrointestinal endoscopy and 96 transmitted by bronchoscopy. The clinical s pectrum ranged from asymptomatic colonization to death. Salmonella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa repeatedly were identified as c ausative agents of infections transmitted by gastrointestinal endoscopy, and M. tuberculosis , atypical mycobacteria, and P. aeruginosa were the most common causes of infections transmitted by bronchoscopy 12. Major reasons for transmission were inadequate cleaning, improper selecti on of a disinfecting agent, and failure to follow recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures 6, 8, 37, 98, and flaws in endoscope design 127, 128 or automated endoscope reprocessors. 7, 98 Failure to follow established guidelines has continued to result in infections associated with gastrointestinal endoscopes 8 and bronchoscopes 7, 12. Potential device- associated problems should be reported to the FDA Center for Devices and Radiologic Health. One multistate investigation found that 23.9% of the bacterial cultures from the internal channels of 71 gastrointestinal endoscopes grew 100,000 colonies of bacteria after completion of all disinfection and sterilization procedures (nine of 25 facilities were using a product that has been removed from the marketplace [six facilities using 1:16 glutaral dehyde iodophor] or no disinfec ting agent) and before use on the next patient129. The incidence of postendoscopic procedure infections from an improperly processed endoscope has not been rigorously assessed. Automated endoscope reprocessors (AER) offer several advantages over manual reprocessing: they automate and standardize seve ral important reprocessing steps 130-132, reduce the likelihood that an essential reprocessing step will be skipped, and reduce per sonnel exposure to high-level disinfectants or chemical sterilants. Failure of AERs has been linked to outbreaks of infections 133 or colonization 7, 134, and the AER water filtration system might not be able to reliably provide \"sterile\" or bacteria-free rinse water135, 136. Establishment of correct connectors between the AER and the device is critical to ensure complete flow of disinfectants and rinse water 7, 137. In addition, some endoscopes such as the duodenoscopes (e.g., endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancr eatography [ERCP]) contain features (e.g., elevator-wire channel) that require a flushing pressu re that is not achieved by most AERs and must be reprocessed manually using a 2- to 5-mL syringe, until new duodenoscopes equipped with a wider elevator-channel that AERs can reli ably reprocess become available 132. Outbreaks involving removable endoscope parts 138, 139 such as suction valves and endoscopic accessories designed to be inserted through flexible endoscopes such as biopsy forceps emphasize the importance of cleaning to remove all foreign matter before high-level disinfection or sterilization. 140 Some types of valves are now available as single-use, disposable products (e.g., bronchosc ope valves) or steam sterilizable products (e.g., gastrointestinal endoscope valves). AERs need further development and redesign 7, 141, as do endoscopes 123, 142, so that they do not represent a potential source of infectious agents. Endoscopes employing disposable components (e.g., protective barrier devices or sheat hs) might provide an alternative to conventional liquid chemical high- level disinfection/sterilization 143, 144. Another new technology is a sw allowable camera-in-a-capsule that travels through the digestive tract and transmits color pictures of the small intestine to a receiver worn outside the body. This capsule currently does not replace colonoscopies . Published recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting endoscopic equipment should be strictly followed 12, 38, 108, 113-116, 145-148. Unfortunately, audits have shown that personnel do not consistently adhere to guidelines on reprocessing 149-151 and outbreaks of infection continue to occur. 152-154 To ensure 15Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 reprocessing personnel are properly trained, each person who reprocesses endoscopic instruments should receive initial and annual competency testing 38, 155. In general, endoscope disinfection or sterilization wi th a liquid chemical sterilant involves five steps after leak testing: 1. Clean: mechanically clean internal and external surfaces, including brushing internal channels and flushing each internal channel with water and a detergent or enzymatic cleaners (leak testing is recommended for endoscopes before immersion). 2. Disinfect: immerse (or chemical sterilant) and perfuse (eliminates air pockets and ensures contact of the germicide with the internal channels) disinfectant into all accessible channels, such as the suction/biopsy channel and air/water channel and expose for a time re commended for specific products. 3. Rinse: rinse the endoscope and all channels with sterile water, filtered water (commonly used with AERs) or tap water (i.e., high-quality potabl e water that meets federal clean water standards at the point of use). 4. Dry: rinse the insertion tube and inner channels with alcohol, and dry with forced air after disinfection and before storage. Store: store the endoscope in a way that prevent s recontamination and promotes drying (e.g., hung vertically). Drying the endoscope (steps 3 and 4) is essential to greatly reduce the chance of recontamination of the endoscope by microorganisms that can be present in the rinse water 116, 156. One study demonstrated that reprocessed endoscopes (i.e., air/water channel, suction/biopsy channel) generally were negative after 24 hours; 90% after 7 days [1 CFU of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in one channel]) for bacterial growth when st ored by hanging vertically in a ventilated cabinet157. Other investigators found all endoscopes were bacteria-free immediately after high-level disinfection, and only four of 135 scopes were positive during the subsequent 5-day assessment (skin bacteria cultured from endoscope surfaces). All flush-through samples remained sterile 158. Because tapwater can contain low levels of microorganisms159, some researchers have suggested that only sterile water (which can be prohibitively expensive) 160 or AER filtered water be used. The suggestion to use only sterile water or filtered water is not consistent with published guidelines that allow tapwater with an alcohol rinse and forced air-drying 38, 108, 113 or the scientific literature. 39, 93 In addition, no evidence of disease transmission has been found when a tap water ri nse is followed by an alcohol rinse and forced- air drying. AERs produce filtered water by pa ssage through a bacterial filter (e.g., 0.2 ). Filtered rinse water was identified as a source of bacterial cont amination in a study that cultured the accessory and suction channels of endoscopes and the internal chambers of AERs during 1996-2001 and reported 8.7% of samples collected during 1996-1998 had bacterial growth, with 54% being Pseudomonas species. After a system of hot water flushing of the piping (60\u00baC for 60 minutes daily) was introduced, the frequency of positive cultures fell to approximately 2% with only rare isolation of >10 CFU/mL 161. In addition to the endoscope reprocessing steps, a prot ocol should be developed that ensures the user knows whether an endoscope has been appropriately cl eaned and disinfected (e.g., using a room or cabinet for processed endoscopes only) or has not been reprocessed. When users leave endoscopes on movable carts, confusion can result about w hether the endoscope has been processed. Although one guideline recommended endoscopes (e.g., duodenoscopes) be reprocessed immediately before use 147, other guidelines do not require this activity 38, 108, 115 and except for the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN), professional organi zations do not recommended that reprocessing be repeated as long as the original processing is done co rrectly. As part of a quality assurance program, healthcare facility personnel can consider random bacterial surve illance cultures of processed endoscopes should be free of microbial pathogens except for small numbers of relatively avirulent microbes that represent exogenous environmental contami nation (e.g., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus , Bacillus species, diphtheroids). Although recommendations exist fo r the final rinse water used during endoscope reprocessing to be microbiologically cultured at least monthly 165, a microbiologic standard has not been 16Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 set, and the value of routine endoscope cultures has not been shown 166. In addition, neither the routine culture of reprocessed endoscopes nor the final rinse water has been validated by correlating viable counts on an endoscope to infection after an endosc opic procedure. If reprocessed endoscopes were cultured, sampling the endoscope would assess water qua lity and other important steps (e.g., disinfectant effectiveness, exposure time, cleaning) in the reproc essing procedure. A number of methods for sampling endoscopes and water have been described 23, 157, 161, 163, 167, 168. Novel approaches (e.g., detection of adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) to evaluat e the effectiveness of endoscope cleaning 169, 170 or endoscope reprocessing 171 also have been evaluated, but no met hod has been established as a standard for assessing the outcome of endoscope reprocessing. The carrying case used to transport clean and reprocessed endoscopes outside the health-care environment should not be used to store an endoscope or to transport the instrument within the health- care facility. A contaminated endoscope should never be placed in the carrying case because the case can also become contaminated. When the endoscope is removed from the case, properly reprocessed, and put back in the case, the case could recontam inate the endoscope. A cont aminated carrying case should be discarded (Olympus America, June 2002, written communication). Infection-control professionals should ensure that in stitutional policies are consistent with national guidelines and conduct infection-control rounds peri odically (e.g., at least annually) in areas where endoscopes are reprocessed to ensure policy comp liance. Breaches in policy should be documented and corrective action instituted. In in cidents in which endoscopes were not exposed to a high-level disinfection process, patients exposed to potentially contaminated endoscopes have been assessed for possible acquisition of HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). A 14-step method for managing a failure incident associated with high-level disinfection or sterilization has been described [Rutala WA, 2006 #12512]. The possible transmission of bloodborne and other infecti ous agents highlights the importance of rigorous infection control 172, 173. Laparoscopes and Arthroscopes Although high-level disinfection appears to be the minimum standard for processing laparoscopes and arthroscopes between patients 28, 86, 174, 175, this practice continues to be debated 89, 90, 176. However, neither side in the high-level disinf ection versus sterilization debate has sufficient data on which to base its conclusions. Proponents of high-le vel disinfection refer to membership surveys 29 or institutional experiences 87 involving more than 117,000 and 10,000 laparoscopic procedures, respectively, that cite a low risk for infection (<0. 3%) when high-level disinfection is used for gynecologic laparoscopic equipment. Only one infection in the membership survey was linked to spores. In addition, growth of common skin microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis , diphtheroids) has been documented from the umbilical area even after skin preparation with povidone-iodine and ethyl alcohol. Similar organisms were recovered in some instances from the pelvic serosal surfaces or from the laparoscopic telescopes, suggesting that the microorgani sms probably were carried from the skin into the peritoneal cavity 177, 178. Proponents of sterilization focus on the possibility of transmitting infection by spore-forming organisms. Researchers have proposed several reasons why sterility was not necessary for all laparoscopic equipment: only a limited number of organisms (usually <10) are introduced into the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopy; minimal damage is done to inner abdominal structures with little devitalized tissue; the peritoneal cavity tolerates small numbers of spore-forming bacteria; equipment is simple to clean and disinfect; surgical sterility is relative; the natural bioburden on rigid lumened devices is low 179; and no evidence exists that high-level disinfecti on instead of sterilization increases the risk for infection 87, 89, 90. With the advent of laparoscopic cholecys tectomy, concern about high-level disinfection is justifiable because the degree of tissue damage and bacterial contamination is greater than with laparoscopic procedures in gynecology. Failure to completely dissemble, clean, and high-level disinfect laparoscope parts has led to infections in patients180. Data from one study suggested that disassembly, cleaning, and proper reassembly of laparoscopic equipment used in gynecologic procedures before steam sterilization presents no risk for infection181. 17Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 As with laparoscopes and other equipment that enter sterile body sites, arthroscopes ideally should be sterilized before used. Older studies dem onstrated that these instruments were commonly (57%) only high-level disinfected in the United States 28, 86. A later survey (with a response rate of only 5%) reported that high-level disinfection was used by 31% and a sterilizat ion process in the remainder of the health-care facilities30 High-level disinfection rather t han sterilization presumably has been used because the incidence of infection is low and the few infections identified probably are unrelated to the use of high-level disinfection rather than sterilizat ion. A retrospective study of 12,505 arthroscopic procedures found an infection rate of 0.04% (five infections) when arthroscopes were soaked in 2% glutaraldehyde for 15-20 minutes. Four infections were caused by S. aureus ; the fifth was an anaerobic streptococcal infection 88. Because these organisms are very suscept ible to high-level disinfectants, such as 2% glutaraldehyde, the infections most likely originated from the patient's skin. Two cases of Clostridium perfringens arthritis have been reported when the arthroscope was disinfected with glutaraldehyde for an exposure time that is not effective against spores 182, 183. Although only limited data are available, the evidence does not demonstrate that high-level disinfection of arthroscopes and laparoscopes poses an infection risk to the patient. For example, a prospective study that compared the reproce ssing of arthroscopes and laparoscopes (per 1,000 procedures) with EtO sterilization to high-level di sinfection with glutaral dehyde found no statistically significant difference in infection risk between the two methods (i.e., EtO, 7.5/1,000 procedures; glutaraldehyde, 2.5/1,000 procedures) 89. Although the debate for high-level disinfection versus sterilization of laparoscopes and arthroscopes will go unsettled until well-designed, randomized clinical trials are published, this guideline should be followed 1, 17. That is, laparoscopes , arthroscopes, and other scopes that enter normally sterile ti ssue should be sterilized before each use; if this is not feasible, they should receive at least high-level disinfection. Tonometers, Cervical Diaphragm Fitting Rings, Cryosurgical Instruments, and Endocavitary Probes Disinfection strategies vary widely for other semicritical items (e.g., applanation tonometers, rectal/vaginal probes, cryosurgical instruments, and diaphragm fitting rings). FDA requests that device manufacturers include at least one validated cleaning and di sinfection/sterilization pr otocol in the labeling for their devices. As with all medications and devices, users should be familiar with the label instructions. One study revealed that no uniform technique was in use for disinfection of applanation tonometers, with disinfectant contact times vary ing from <15 sec to 20 minutes 28. In view of the potential for transmission of viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus [HSV], adenovirus 8, or HIV) 184 by tonometer tips, CDC recommended that the tonometer tips be wiped clean and disinfected for 5-10 minutes with either 3% hydrogen peroxide, 5000 ppm chlorine, 70% et hyl alcohol, or 70% isopropyl alcohol 95. However, more recent data suggest that 3% hydrogen peroxide and 70% isopropyl alcohol are not effective against adenovirus capable of causing epidemic keratoconjunctivitis and similar viruses and should not be used for disinfecting applanation tonometers 49, 185, 186. Structural damage to Schiotz tonometers has been observed with a 1:10 sodium hypochlorite (5,000 ppm chlorine) and 3% hydrogen peroxide187. After disinfection, the tonometer should be thoroughly rins ed in tapwater and air dried before use. Although these disinfectants and exposure time s should kill pathogens that can infect the eyes, no studies directly support this 188, 189. The guidelines of the American Academy of Ophthalmology for preventing infections in ophthalmology focus on onl y one potential pathogen: HIV. 190 Because a short and simple decontamination procedure is desirable in the clinic al setting, swabbing the tonometer tip with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe sometimes is practiced. 189 Preliminary reports sugges t that wiping the tonometer tip with an alcohol swab and then allowing the alcohol to evaporate might be effective in eliminating HSV, HIV, and adenovirus189, 191, 192. However, because these studies involved only a few replicates and were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, furt her studies are needed before this technique can be recommended. In addition, two reports have found t hat disinfection of pneumotonometer tips between uses with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe contributed to outbreaks of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis caused 18Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 by adenovirus type 8193, 194. Limited studies have evaluated disinfection techniques for other items that contact mucous membranes, such as diaphragm fitting rings, cryosurgical probes, trans esophageal echocardiography probes 195, flexible cystoscopes 196 or vaginal/rectal probes used in sonographic scanning. Lettau, Bond, and McDougal of CDC supported the recommendation of a diaphragm fitting ring manufacturer that involved using a soap-and-water wash follow ed by a 15-minute immersion in 70% alcohol96. This disinfection method should be adequate to inactivate HIV, HBV, and HSV even though alcohols are not classified as high-level disinfect ants because their activity against pi cornaviruses is somewhat limited72. No data are available regarding inactivation of human papillomavirus (HPV) by alcohol or other disinfectants because in vitro replication of comp lete virions has not been achieved. Thus, even though alcohol for 15 minutes should kill pathogens of relev ance in gynecology, no clinical studies directly support this practice. Vaginal probes are used in sonographic scanning. A vaginal probe and all endocavitary probes without a probe cover are semicritical devices because they have direct contact with mucous membranes (e.g., vagina, rectum, pharynx). While use of t he probe cover could be considered as changing the category, this guideline proposes use of a new condom/probe cover for the probe for each patient, and because condoms/probe covers can fail 195, 197-199, the probe also should be high-level disinfected. The relevance of this recommendation is reinforced with the findings that sterile transvaginal ultrasound probe covers have a very high rate of perforations even before use (0%, 25%, and 65% perforations from three suppliers). 199 One study found, after oocyte retrieval use, a very high rate of perforations in used endovaginal probe covers from two suppliers (75% and 81%) 199, other studies demonstrated a lower rate of perforations after use of condoms (2.0% and 0.9%) 197 200. Condoms have been found superior to commercially available probe covers for covering the ultrasound probe (1.7% for condoms versus 8.3% leakage for probe covers)201. These studies underscore the need fo r routine probe disinfection between examinations. Although most ultrasound manufacture rs recommend use of 2% glutaraldehyde for high- level disinfection of contaminated transvagi nal transducers, the this agent has been questioned 202 because it might shorten the life of the transducer and might have toxic effects on the gametes and embryos 203. An alternative procedure for disinfecting t he vaginal transducer involves the mechanical removal of the gel from the transducer, cleaning the transducer in soap and water, wiping the transducer with 70% alcohol or soaking it for 2 minutes in 500 ppm chlorine, and rinsing with tap water and air drying204. The effectiveness of this and other methods 200 has not been validated in either rigorous laboratory experiments or in clinical use. High-level disinfection wi th a product (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) that is not toxic to staff, patients, probes, and re trieved cells should be used until the effectiveness of alternative procedures against micr obes of importance at the cavitary site is demonstrated by well- designed experimental scientific studi es. Other probes such as rect al, cryosurgical, and transesophageal probes or devices also should be high- level disinfected between patients. Ultrasound probes used during surgical procedures also can contact sterile body sites. These probes can be covered with a sterile sheath to reduc e the level of contamination on the probe and reduce the risk for infection. However, because the sheath does not completely protect the probe, the probes should be sterilized between each patient use as with other critical items. If this is not possible, at a minimum the probe should be high-level disinfected and covered with a sterile probe cover. Some cryosurgical probes are not fully immers ible. During reprocessing, the tip of the probe should be immersed in a high-level disinfectant for the appropriate time; any other portion of the probe that could have mucous membrane contact can be disi nfected by immersion or by wrapping with a cloth soaked in a high-level disinfectant to allow the recommended contact time. After disinfection, the probe should be rinsed with tap water and dried before use. Health-care facilities that use nonimmersible probes should replace them as soon as possible with fully immersible probes. As with other high-level disinfection procedures, proper cleaning of probes is necessary to ensure the success of the subsequent disinfection 205. One study demonstrated t hat vegetative bacteria 19Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 inoculated on vaginal ultrasound probes decreased when the probes were cleaned with a towel 206. No information is available about either the level of c ontamination of such probes by potential viral pathogens such as HBV and HPV or their removal by cleaning (such as with a towel). Because these pathogens might be present in vaginal and rectal secreti ons and contaminate probes during use, high-level disinfection of the probes after such use is recommended. Dental Instruments Scientific articles and increas ed publicity about the potential for transmitting infectious agents in dentistry have focused attention on dental instruments as possible agents for pathogen transmission207, 208. The American Dental Association recommends that surgical and other instruments that normally penetrate soft tissue or bone (e.g., extraction forceps , scalpel blades, bone chisels, periodontal scalers, and surgical burs) be classified as critical devices that should be sterilized after each use or discarded. Instruments not intended to penetrate oral soft tiss ues or bone (e.g., amalgam condensers, and air/water syringes) but that could contact oral tissues are classified as semicritical , but sterilization after each use is recommended if the instru ments are heat-tolerant 43, 209. If a semicritical item is heat-sensitive, it should, at a minimum, be processed with high-level disinfection 43, 210. Handpieces can be contaminated internally with patient material and should be heat sterilized after each patient. Handpieces that cannot be heat sterilized should not be used. 211 Methods of sterilization t hat can be used for critical or semicritical dental instruments and materials that are heat-stable include steam under pressure (autoclave), chemical (formal dehyde) vapor, and dry heat (e.g., 320\u00baF for 2 hours). Dental professionals most commonly use the steam sterilizer 212. All three sterilization procedures can damage some dental instruments, including steam-sterilized hand pieces 213. Heat-tolerant alternatives are available for most clinical dental applications and are preferred43. CDC has divided noncritical surfaces in dental offices into clinical contact and housekeeping surfaces 43. Clinical contact surfaces are surfaces that might be touched frequently with gloved hands during patient care or that might become contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious material and subsequently contact instruments, hands, gloves, or devices (e.g., light handles, switches, dental X- ray equipment, chair-side computers). Barrier protecti ve coverings (e.g., clear plastic wraps) can be used for these surfaces, particularly those that are difficu lt to clean (e.g., light handles, chair switches). The coverings should be changed when visibly soiled or damaged and routinely (e.g., between patients). Protected surfaces should be disinf ected at the end of each day or if contamination is evident. If not barrier-protected, these surfaces should be disinfect ed between patients with an in termediate-disinfectant (i.e., EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with tubercu locidal claim) or low-level disinfectant (i.e., EPA- registered hospital disinfectant with an HBV and HIV label claim) 43, 214, 215. Most housekeeping surfaces need to be cleaned only with a detergent and water or an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant, depending of the nature of the surface and the type and degree of contamination. When housekeeping surfaces are vi sibly contaminated by blood or body substances, however, prompt removal and surface disinfection is a sound infection control practice and required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 43, 214. Several studies have demonstrated variability among dental practices while trying to meet these recommendations 216, 217. For example, 68% of respondents believed they were sterilizing their instruments but did not use appropriate chemical sterilants or exposure ti mes and 49% of respondents did not challenge autoclaves with biological indicators216. Other investigators using biologic indicators have found a high proportion (15%-65%) of positive spore tests after asse ssing the efficacy of sterilizers used in dental offices. In one study of Minnesota dent al offices, operator error, rather than mechanical malfunction218, caused 87% of sterilization failures. Comm on factors in the improper use of sterilizers include chamber overload, low temperature setting, inadequate exposure time, failure to preheat the sterilizer, and interruption of the cycle. Mail-return sterilization monitoring services use spor e strips to test sterilizers in dental clinics, but 20Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 delay caused by mailing to the test laboratory could potentially cause false-negativ es results. Studies revealed, however, that the post- sterilization time and temperature after a 7-day delay had no influence on the test results219. Delays (7 days at 27\u00baC and 37\u00baC, 3-day mail delay) did not cause any predictable pattern of inaccurate spore tests 220. Disinfection of HBV-, HCV-, HIV- or TB-Contaminated Devices The CDC disinfection of HBV-, HCV-, HIV- or TB-contaminated devices is appropriate because experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of high-level disinfectants to inactivate these and other pathogens that might contaminat e semicritical devices 61, 62, 73, 81, 105, 121, 125, 221-238. Nonetheless, some healthcare facilities have modified their disinfection procedures when endoscopes are used with a patient known or suspected to be infected with HBV, HIV, or M. tuberculosis 28, 239. This is inconsistent wi th the concept of Standard Prec autions that presumes all patients are potentially in fected with bloodborne pathogens228. Several studies have highlighted the inability to distinguish HBV- or HIV-infected pat ients from noninfected patients on clinical grounds240-242. In addition, mycobacterial infection is unlikely to be clinically apparent in many patients. In most instances, hospitals that altered their disinfec tion procedure used EtO sterilization on the endoscopic instruments because they believed this practice reduced the risk for infection 28, 239. EtO is not routinely used for endoscope sterilization because of the l engthy processing time. Endoscopes and other semicritical devices should be managed the same way regardless of whether the patient is known to be infected with HBV, HCV, HIV or M. tuberculosis . An evaluation of a manual disinfection proc edure to eliminate HCV from experimentally contaminated endoscopes provided some evidence t hat cleaning and 2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes should prevent transmission 236. A study that used experimentally contaminated hysteroscopes detected HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in one (3%) of 34 samples after cleaning with a detergent, but no samples were positive after treatment with a 2% glutaraldehyde solution for 20 minutes 120. Another study demonstrated complete elimination of HCV (as detected by PCR) from endoscopes used on chronically infected patients after cleaning and disinfection for 3-5 minutes in glutaraldehyde 118. Similarly, PCR was used to demonstrate complete elimination of HCV after standard disinfection of experimentally contaminated endoscopes 236 and endoscopes used on HCV- antibody-positive patients had no detectable HCV RNA after high-level disinfection 243. The inhibitory activity of a phenolic and a chlorine compound on HCV showed that the phenolic inhi bited the binding and replication of HCV, but the chlorine was ineffective, probably because of its lo w concentration and its neutralization in the presence of organic matter 244. Disinfection in the Hemodialysis Unit Hemodialysis systems include hemodialysis mach ines, water supply, water-treatment systems, and distribution systems. Du ring hemodialysis, patients have acquired bloodborne viruses and pathogenic bacteria 245-247. Cleaning and disinfection are important components of infection control in a hemodialysis center. EPA and FDA regulate disinfectant s used to reprocess hemodialyzers, hemodialysis machines, and water-treatment systems. Noncritical surfaces (e.g., dialysis bed or chair, countertops, external surfaces of dialysis machines, and equipment [scissors, hemostats, clamps , blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes]) should be disinfected with an EPA-registered disinfectant unless the item is visibl y contaminated with blood; in that case a tuberculocidal agent (or a disinfectant with specific label claims for HBV and HIV) or a 1:100 dilution of a hypochlorite solution (500-600 ppm free chlorine) should be used 246, 248. This procedure accomplishes two goals: it removes soil on a regul ar basis and maintains an environment that is consistent with good patient care. Hemodialyzers ar e disinfected with peracetic acid, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, heat pasteurization with ci tric acid, and chlorine-containing compounds 249. Hemodialysis systems usually are disinfected by chlorine-based disinfectants (e.g., sodium hypochlorite), aqueous 21Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 formaldehyde, heat pasteurization, ozone, or peracetic acid 250, 251. All products must be used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Some dialys is systems use hot-water disinfection to control microbial contamination. At its high point, 82% of U.S. chronic hemodial ysis centers were reprocessing (i.e., reusing) dialyzers for the same patient using high-level disinfection 249. However, one of the large dialysis organizations has decided to phase out reuse and, by 2002 the percentage of dialysis facilities reprocessing hemodialyzers had decreased to 63% 252. The two commonly used disinfectants to reprocess dialyzers were peracetic acid and fo rmaldehyde; 72% used peracetic and 20% used formaldehyde to disinfect hemodialyzers. Another 4% of the facilities used eit her glutaraldehyde or heat pasteurization in combination with citric acid 252. Infection-control recommendations, including disinfection and sterilization and the use of dedicated machines for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)- positive patients, in the hemodialysis setting were detailed in two reviews 245, 246. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation(AAMI) has published recommendations for the reuse of hemodialyzers253. Inactivation of Clostridium difficile The source of health-care-associated acquisition of Clostridium difficile in nonepidemic settings has not been determined. The environment and carriage on the hands of health-care personnel have been considered possible sources of infection 66, 254. Carpeted rooms occupied by a patient with C. difficile were more heavily contaminated with C. difficile than were noncarpeted rooms 255. Because C. difficile spore-production can increase when expos ed to nonchlorine-based cleaning agents and the spores are more resistant t han vegetative cells to commonl y used surface disinfectants256, some investigators have recommended use of dilute solutions of hypochlorite (1,600 ppm available chlorine) for routine environmental disinfecti on of rooms of patients with C. difficile -associated diarrhea or colitis 257, to reduce the incidence of C. difficile diarrhea 258, or in units with high C. difficile rates. 259 Stool samples of patients with symptomatic C. difficile colitis contain spores of the organism, as demonstrated by ethanol treatment of the stool to reduce the ov ergrowth of fecal flora when isolating C. difficile in the laboratory260, 261. C. difficile -associated diarrhea rates were shown to have decreased markedly in a bone-marrow transplant unit (from 8.6 to 3.3 cases per 1,000 patient -days) during a period of bleach disinfection (1:10 dilution) of environmental surfaces compared wi th cleaning with a quaternary ammonium compound. Because no EPA-registered products exist that are specific for inactivating C. difficile spores, use of diluted hypochlorite should be considered in units with high C. difficile rates. Acidified bleach and regular bleach (5000 ppm chlorine) can inactivate 106 C. difficile spores in <10 minutes 262. However, studies have shown that asymptomatic pati ents constitute an important reserv oir within the health-care facility and that person-to-person transmission is the princi pal means of transmission between patients. Thus, combined use of hand washing, barrier precautions , and meticulous environmental cleaning with an EPA- registered disinfectant (e.g., ger micidal detergent) should effectivel y prevent spread of the organism 263. Contaminated medical devices, such as col onoscopes and thermometers,can be vehicles for transmission of C. difficile spores 264. For this reason, investigators have studied commonly used disinfectants and exposure times to assess whether current practices c an place patients at risk. Data demonstrate that 2% glutaraldehyde 79, 265-267 and peracetic acid 267, 268 reliably kill C. difficile spores using exposure times of 5-20 minutes. ortho-Phthalaldehyde and > 0.2% peracetic acid (WA Rutala, personal communication, April 2006) also can inactivate >104 C. difficile spores in 10-12 minutes at 20\u00baC 268. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate at a concentration of 1000 ppm available chlorine achieved lower log 10 reduction factors against C. difficile spores at 10 min, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5, than 0.26% peracetic acid with log 10 reduction factors ranging from 2.7 to 6.0268. OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard In December 1991, OSHA promulgated a standard entitled \"Occupational Exposure to 22Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Bloodborne Pathogens\" to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens 214. One component of this requirement is that a ll equipment and environmental and working surfaces be cleaned and decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant after contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. Even though the OSHA standard does not specify the type of disinfectant or procedure, the OSHA original compliance document 269 suggested that a germicide must be tuberculocidal to kill the HBV. To follow the OS HA compliance document a t uberculocidal disinfectant (e.g., phenolic, and chlorine) would be needed to clean a blood spill. However, in February 1997, OSHA amended its policy and stated that EPA -registered disinfectants labeled as effective against HIV and HBV would be considered as appropriate disinfectants \". . . provided such surfaces have not become contaminated with agent(s) or volumes of or concentrations of agent(s) for which higher level disinfection is recommended.\" When bloodborne pathogens other than HBV or HIV are of concern, OSHA continues to require use of EPA-registered tuberculocidal disinfectants or hypochlorite solution (diluted 1:10 or 1:100 with water) 215, 228. Studies demonstrate that, in the pr esence of large blood spills, a 1:10 final dilution of EPA-registered hypochlorite solution init ially should be used to inactivate bloodborne viruses 63, 235 to minimize risk for infection to health-car e personnel from percutaneous injury during Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] Coronavirus) Emerging pathogens are of growing concern to the general public and infection-control professionals. Relevant pathogens include spiratory tuberculosis , and nontuberculous mycobacteria (e.g., M. chelonae ). The susceptibility of each of these pathogens to chemical disinfectants and sterilants has been studied. With the exceptions discussed below, all of these emerging pathogens are susceptible to currently available chemical disinfectants and sterilants 270. Cryptosporidium is resistant to chlorine at concentrations used in potable water. C. parvum is not completely inactivated by most disinfect ants used in healthcare including ethyl alcohol 271, glutaraldehyde 271, 272, 5.25% hypochlorite 271, peracetic acid 271, ortho-phthalaldehyde 271, phenol 271, 272, povidone-iodine 271, 272, and quaternary ammonium compounds271. The only chemical disinfectants and sterilants able to inactivate greater than 3 log 10 of C. parvum were 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide 271. Sterilization methods will fully inactivate C. parvum, including steam 271, EtO 271, 273, and hydrogen peroxide gas plasma271. Although most disinfectants are ineffective against C. parvum , current cleaning and disinfection practices appear satisfactory to prevent healthcare-associated transmission. For example, endoscopes are unlikely to be an important vehicle for transmitting C. parvum because the results of bacterial studies indicate mechanical cleaning will remove approximately 104 organisms, and drying results in rapid loss of C. parvum viability (e.g., 30 minutes, 2.9 log 10 decrease; and 60 minutes, 3.8 log 10 decrease) 271. Chlorine at ~1 ppm has been found capabl e of eliminating approximately 4 log 10 of E. coli O157:H7 within 1 minute in a suspension test64. Electrolyzed oxidizing water at 23oC was effective in 10 minutes in producing a 5-log 10 decrease in E. coli O157:H7 inoculated onto kitchen cutting boards274. The following disinfectants eliminated >5 log 10 of E. coli O157:H7 within 30 seconds: a quaternary ammonium compound, a hypochlorite (1:10 dilution of 5.25% bleach), and ethanol53. Disinfectants including chlorine compounds can reduce E. coli O157:H7 experimentally inoculated onto alfalfa seeds or sprouts 275, 276 or beef carcass surfaces277. Data are limited on the susceptibility of H. pylori to disinfectants. Using a suspension test, one study assessed the effectiveness of a variet y of disinfectants against nine strains of H. pylori 60. Ethanol (80%) and glutaraldehyde (0.5%) and sodium hypochlorite (150 ppm) kill ed all strains within 30 seconds. Both ethanol 23Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 (80%) and glutaraldehyde (0.5%) retained similar bacteri cidal activity in the presence of organic matter; the other disinfectants showed reduced bactericidal activi ty. In particular, the bactericidal activity of povidone-iodine (0.1%) and sodium hypochlorite (150 ppm) markedly decreased in the presence of dried yeast solution with killing times increased to 5 - 10 minutes and 5 - 30 minutes, respectively. Immersing biopsy forceps in formalin before obt aining a specimen does not affect the ability to culture H. pylori from the biopsy specimen 278. The following methods are ineffective for eliminating H. pylori from endoscopes: cleaning with soap and water 119, 279, immersion in 70% ethanol for 3 minutes280, instillation of 0.2% Hyamine solution281. The differing results with regard to the efficacy of ethyl alcohol against Helicobacter are unexplained. Cleaning followed by use of 2% alkali ne glutaraldehyde (or automated peracetic acid) has been demonstrated by culture to be effective in eliminating H. pylori 119, 279, 282. Epidemiologic investigations of patients who had undergone endo scopy with endoscopes mechanically washed and disinfected with 2.0%-2.3% glut araldehyde have revealed no evidence of person-to-person transmission of H. pylori 126, 283. Disinfection of experimentally inated endoscopes using 2% glutaraldehyde (10- minute, 20-minute, 45-minute exposure times) or the peracetic acid system (with and without active peracetic acid) has been demonstrated to be effective in eliminating H. pylori 119. H. pylori DNA has been detected by PCR in fluid flushed from endoscope channels after cleaning and disinfection with 2% glutaraldehyde 284. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In vitro experiments have demonstrated a >3.5-log 10 reduction in H. pylori after exposure to 0.5 mg/L of free chlorine for 80 seconds285. An outbreak of healthcare-associated rotavi rus gastroenteritis on a pediatric unit has been reported 286. Person to person through the hands of health-care workers was proposed as the mechanism of transmission. Prolonged survival of ro tavirus on environmental surfaces (90 minutes to >10 days at room temperature) and hands (>4 hour s) has been demonstrated. Rotavirus suspended in feces can survive longer 287, 288. Vectors have included hands, fomites, air, water, and food 288, 289. Products with demonstrated efficacy (>3 log 10 reduction in virus) against rotavirus within 1 quaternary ammonium compounds 59, 290-293. In a human challenge study, a disinfectant spray (0.1% ortho-phenylphenol and 79% ethanol), sodium hypochlorite (800 ppm a phenol-based product (14.7% diluted 1:256 in tapwater) w hen sprayed onto contaminat ed stainless steel disks , were effective in interrupting transfer of a human ro tavirus from stainless steel disk to fingerpads of volunteers after an exposure time of 3- 10 minutes . A quaternary ammonium product (7.05% quaternary ammonium compound diluted 1:128 in tapwate r) and tapwater allowed transfer of virus 52. No data exist on the inactivation of HPV by al cohol or other disinfectants because in vitro replication of complete virions has not been achieved. Similarly, little is known about inactivation of noroviruses (members of the family Caliciviridae and important causes of gastroenteritis in humans) because they cannot be grown in tissue culture. Improper disinfection of environmental surfaces contaminated by feces or vomitus of infected patients is believed to play a role in the spread of noroviruses in some settings 294-296. Prolonged survival of a norovirus surrogate (i.e., feline calicivirus virus [FCV], a closely related cultivable virus) has been demonstrated (e.g., at room temperature, FCV in a dried state survived for 21-18 days) 297. Inactivation studies with FC V have shown the effectiveness of chlorine, glutaraldehyde, and iodine-based products whereas the quaternary ammonium compound, detergent, and ethanol failed to inactivate the virus completely. 297 An evaluation of the effectiveness of several disinfectants against the feline calicivirus found that bleach diluted to 1000 ppm of available chlorine reduced infectivity of FCV by 4.5 logs in 1 minute. Other effective (log 10 reduction factor of >4 in virus) disinfectants included acce lerated hydrogen peroxide, 5,000 ppm (3 min); chlorine dioxide, 1,000 ppm chlorine (1 min); a mixture of four quaternary ammonium 2,470 ppm (10 min); 79% quaternary ammonium compound (3 min); and 75% ethanol (10 min) 298. A quaternary ammonium compound exhibited activity against feli ne calicivirus supensions dried on hard surface carriers in 10 minutes 299. Seventy percent ethanol and 70% 1-propanol reduced FCV by a 3-4-log 10 24Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 reduction in 30 seconds 300. CDC announced that a previously unrecognized human vi rus from the coronavirus family is the leading hypothesis for the cause of a described syndrome of SARS 301. Two coronaviruses that are known to infect humans cause one third of common colds and can cause gastroenteritis. The virucidal efficacy of chemical germicides against coronavirus has been investigated. A study of disinfectants against coronavirus 229E found several that were effe ctive after a 1-minute contact time; these included sodium hypochlorite (at a free chlorine concentra tion of 1,000 5,000 ppm), 70% ethyl and povidone-iodine (1% ethanol, benzalkonium and inactivated >3 logs of two animal cor onaviruses (mouse hepatitis vi rus, canine coronavirus) after a 10-minute exposure time 302. The activity of povidone-iodine has been demonstrated against human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 303. A study also showed complete inactivation of the SARS coronavirus by 70% ethanol and povidone-iodine wi th an exposure times of 1 minute and 2.5% glutaraldehyde with an exposure time of 5 minute 304. Because the SARS coronav irus is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least 1-2 days (WHO, 2003; http://www.who.int/csr/sars/surviv al_2003_05_04/en/index.html), surfaces mi ght be a possible source of contamination and lead to infection with the SARS coronavirus and should be disinfected. Until more precise information is available, environments in which SARS patients are housed should be considered heavily contaminated, and rooms and equipment should be thoroughly disinfected daily and after the patient is discharged. EPA-registered disinfect ants or 1:100 dilution of household bleach and water should be used for surface disinfection and disinfec tion on noncritical patient-care equipment. High-level disinfection and sterilization of semicritical and critical medical devic es, respectively, does not need to be altered for patients with known or suspected SARS. Free-living amoeba can be pathogenic and can harbor agents of pneumonia such as Legionella pneumophila . Limited studies have shown that 2% glut and peracetic acid do not completely inactivate Acanthamoeba polyphaga in a 20-minute exposure time for high-level disinfection. If amoeba are found to contaminate instruments and facilitat e infection, longer immersion times or other disinfectants may need to be considered 305. Inactivation of Bioterrorist Agents Publications have highlighted concerns about the potential for biological terrorism306, 307. CDC has categorized several agents as \"high priority\" bec ause they can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, cause high mortality, and ar e likely to cause public panic and social disruption 308. These agents include Bacillus anthracis (the cause of anthrax), Yersinia pestis (plague), variola major (smallpox), Clostridium botulinum A few comments can be made regarding the role of sterilization and disinfection of potential agents of bioterrorism 309. First, the susceptibility of these agents to germicides in vitro is similar to that of other related pathogens. For example, variola is similar to vaccinia 72, 310, 311 and B. anthracis is similar to B. atrophaeus (formerly B. subtilis)312, 313. B. subtilis spores, for instance, prov ed as resistant as, if not more resistant than, B. anthracis spores (>6 log 10 reduction of B. anthracis spores in 5 minutes with acidified bleach [5,250 ppm chlorine])313. Thus, one can extrapolate from the larger database available on the susceptibility of genetically similar organisms314. Second, many of the pot ential bioterrorist agents are stable enough in the environment that contaminated environmental surfac es or fomites could lead to transmission of agents such as B. anthracis , F. tularensis , variola major, C. botulinum toxin, and C. burnetti 315. Third, data suggest that current disinfecti on and sterilization practices are appropriate for managing patient-care equipment and environmental surfaces when potentia lly contaminated patients are evaluated and/or admitted in a health-care facility afte r exposure to a bioterrorist agent. For example, 25Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 sodium hypochlorite can be used for surface disinfection (see http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/ chemicals/bleachfactsheet.htm). In instances where the health- care facility is the site of a bioterrorist atta ck, environmental decontaminat ion might require special decontamination procedures (e.g., chlorine dioxide gas for B. anthracis spores). Because no antimicrobial products are registered for decontamination of biologic agents after a bioterrorist attack, EPA has granted a crises exemption for each product (see http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/ chemicals/bleachfactsheet.htm). Of only theoretical concern is the possibility that a bioterrorist agent could be engineered to be less susceptible to disinfection and sterilization processes 309. Toxicological, Environmental and Occupational Concerns Health hazards associated with the use of germi cides in healthcare vary from mucous membrane irritation to death, with the latter involving a ccidental injection by m entally disturbed patients316. Although their degrees of toxicity vary 317-320, all disinfectants should be used wi th the proper safety precautions 321 and only for the intended purpose. Key factors associated with assessing the heal th risk of a chemical exposure include the duration, intensity (i.e., how much chemical is involved), and route (e.g., skin, mucous membranes, and inhalation) of exposure. Toxicity can be acute or chr onic. Acute toxicity usually results from an accidental spill of a chemical substance. Exposure is sudden and often produces an emergency situation. Chronic toxicity results from repeated exposure to low levels of the chemical over a prolonged period. Employers are responsible for informing workers about the c hemical hazards in the workplace and implementing control measures. The OSHA Hazard Comm unication Standard (29 CF R 1910.1200, 1915.99, 1917.28, 1918.90, 1926.59, and 1928.21) requires manufacturers and importers of hazardous chemicals to develop Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each c hemical or mixture of chemicals. Employers must have these data sheets readily availabl e to employees who work with t he products to which they could be exposed. Exposure limits have been published for many chemicals used in health care to help provide a safe environment and, as relevant, are discussed in each section of this guideline. Only the exposure limits published by OSHA carry the legal force of regulations. OSHA pub lishes a limit as a time-weighted average (TWA), that is, the aver age concentration for a normal 8-hour work day and a 40-hour work week to which nearly all workers can be repeatedly exposed to a chemical without adverse health effects. For example, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) fo r EtO is 1.0 ppm, 8 hour TWA. The CDC National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (N IOSH) develops recommended exposure limits (RELs). RELs are occupational exposure limits recommended by NIOSH as being protective of worker health and safety over a working lifetime. This limit is fr equently expressed as a 40-hour TWA exposure for up to 10 hours per day during a 40-hour work week. These ex posure limits are designed for inhalation exposures. Irritant and allergic effects can occur below the ex posure limits, and skin contact can result in dermal effects or systemic absorption wi thout inhalation. The erence on Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIN) also provi des guidelines on exposure limits 322. Information about workplace exposures and methods to reduce them (e.g., work practices, engineeri ng controls, PPE) is available on the OSHA (http://www.osha. gov) and NIOSH (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh) websites. Some states have excluded or limited concentra tions of certain chemical germicides (e.g., glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and some phenols) from disposal through the sewer system. These rules are intended to minimize environmental harm. If heal th-care facilities exceed the maximum allowable concentration of a chemical (e.g., >5.0 mg/L), they have three options. Fi rst, they can switch to alternative products; for example, they can change from glutaraldehyde to another disinfectant for high-level disinfection or from phenolics to quaternary ammonium compounds for low-level disinfection. Second, the health-care facility can collect the disinfectant and di spose of it as a hazardous chemical. Third, the 26Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 facility can use a commercially available small-sca le treatment method (e.g., neutralize glutaraldehyde with glycine). Safe disposal of regulated chemicals is important throughout the medical community. For disposal of large volumes of spent solutions, user s might decide to neutralize the microbicidal activity before disposal (e.g., glutaraldehyde). Solutions can be neutralized by r eaction with chemicals such as sodium bisulfite 323, 324 or glycine 325. European authors have suggested that instrum ents and ventilation therapy equipment should be disinfected by heat rather than by chemicals. The concerns for chem ical disinfection include toxic side effects for the patient caused by chemical residues on the instrument or object, occupational exposure to toxic chemicals, and recontamination by rinsing the disinfectant with microbially contaminated tap water 326. Disinfection in Ambulatory Care, Home Care, and the Home With the advent of managed healthcare, increasi ng numbers of patients are now being cared for in ambulatory-care and home settings. Many pati ents in these settings might have communicable diseases, immunocompromising condi tions, or invasive devices. T herefore, adequate disinfection in these settings is necessary to provide a safe pat ient environment. Because the ambulatory-care setting (i.e., outpatient facility) provides the same risk for infection as the hospital, the Spaulding classification scheme described in this guideline should be followed (Table 1) 17. The home environment should be much safer than hospitals or ambulatory care. Epidemics should not be a problem, and cross-infection should be ra re. The healthcare provider is responsible for providing the responsible family member informati on about infection-control procedures to follow in the home, including hand hygiene, proper cleaning and di sinfection of equipment, and safe storage of cleaned and disinfected devices. Among the products recommended for home disinfection of reusable objects are bleach, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide. APIC recommends that reusable objects (e.g., tracheostomy tubes) that touch cous membranes be disinfected by immersion in 70% isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes or in 3% hydrogen peroxide fo r 30 minutes. Additionally, a 1:50 dilution of 5.25%- 6.15% sodium hypochlorite (household bleac h) for 5 minutes should be effective 327-329. Noncritical items (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, crutches) can be cleaned with a detergent. Blood spills should be handled according to OSHA regulations as previously described (see section on OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard). In general, sterilization of critical items is not practical in homes but theoretically could be accomplished by chemical sterilants or boiling. Si ngle-use disposable items can be used or reusable items sterilized in a hospital 330, 331. Some environmental groups advocate \"environmentally safe\" products as alternatives to commercial germicides in the home-care setting. T hese alternatives (e.g., ammonia, baking soda, vinegar, Borax, liquid detergent) are not register ed with EPA and should not be used for disinfecting because they are ineffective against S. aureus . Borax, baking soda, and detergents also are ineffective against Salmonella Typhi and E.coli; however, undiluted vinegar and ammonia are effective against S. Typhi and E.coli 53, 332, 333. Common commercial disinfectants desi gned for home use also are effective against selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria 53. Public concerns have been raised that the use of antimicrobials in the home can promote development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria 334, 335. This issue is unresol ved and needs to be considered further through scientific and clinical investigations. The public health benefits of us ing disinfectants in the home are unknown. However, some facts are known: many sites in the home kitchen and bathroom are microbially contaminated 336, use of hypochlorites markedly reduces bacteria 337, and good standards of hygiene (e.g., food hygiene, hand hygiene) c an help reduce infections in the home 338, 339. In addition, laboratory studies indicate that many commercially prepared household disinfectants are effective against common pathogens 53 and can interrupt surface-to-human transmission of pathogens 48. The \"targeted 27Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 hygiene concept\"\u2014which means ident ifying situations and areas (e.g., food-preparation surfaces and bathroom) where risk exists for transmission of pathogens\u2014may be a reasonable way to identify when disinfection might be appropriate 340. Susceptibility of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to Disinfectants As with antibiotics, reduced susceptibility (or ac quired \"resistance\") of bac teria to disinfectants can arise by either chromosomal gene mutation or acquisi tion of genetic material in the form of plasmids or transposons 338, 341-343, 344 , 345, 346. When changes occur in bacterial susceptibility that renders an antibiotic ineffective against an infection previously treatable by that antibiotic, the bacteria are referred to as \"resistant.\" In contrast, reduced susceptibility to disinfectants does not correlate with failure of the disinfectant because concentrations us ed in disinfection still greatly exceed the cidal level. Thus, the word \"resistance\" when applied to these changes is incorrect, and the preferr ed term is \"reduced susceptibility\" or \"increased tolerance\"344, 347. No data are available that show t hat antibiotic-resistant bacteria are less sensitive to the liquid chemical germicides than antib iotic-sensitive bacteria at currently used germicide contact conditions and concentrations. MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) are important health-care-associated agents. Some antiseptics and disinfectants have been known for y ears to be, because of MICs, somewhat less inhibitory to S. aureus strains that contain a plasmi d-carrying gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic gentamicin 344. For example, gentamicin resistance has been shown to also encode reduced susceptibility to propamidine, quaternar y ammonium compounds, and ethidium bromide 348, and MRSA strains have been found to be less susceptible than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strains to chlorhexidine, propamidine, and the quaternary ammonium compound cetrimide 349. In other studies, MRSA and MSSA strains have been equally sensitive to phenols and chlorhexidine, but MRSA strains were slightly more tolerant to quaternary ammonium compounds 350. Two gene families ( qacCD [now referred to as smr] and qacAB) are involved in providing protec tion against agents that are components of disinfectant formulations such as quaternary ammonium compounds. Staphylococci have been proposed to evade destruction because the protein specified by the qacA determinant is a cytoplasmic-membrane- associated protein involved in an e fflux system that actively reduc es intracellular accumulation of toxicants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, to intracellular targets 351. Other studies demonstrated that plasmid-mediat ed formaldehyde tolerance is transferable from Serratia marcescens to E. coli 352 and plasmid-mediated quaternary amm onium tolerance is transferable from S. aureus to E. coli .353. Tolerance to mercury and s ilver also is plasmid borne 341, 343-346. Because the concentrations of disinfectants used in practice are much higher than the MICs observed, even for the more tolerant strains, the clinical relevance of these observations is questionable. Several studies have found antibiotic-resistant hospital strains of common healthcare-associated pathogens (i.e., Enterococcus, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella S. aureus, and S. epidermidis ) to be equally susceptible to disinfec tants as antibiotic-sensitive strains 53, 354-356. The susceptibility of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus was similar to vancomycin-susceptible, MRSA 357. On the basis of these data, routine disinfec tion and housekeeping protocols do not need to be altered because of antibiotic resistance provided the disinfection method is effective 358, 359. A study that evaluated the efficacy of selected cleaning met hods (e.g., QUAT-sprayed cloth, and QUAT-immersed cloth) for eliminating VRE found that currently used di sinfection processes most likely are highly effective in eliminating VRE. However, surface disinfection must involve contact with all contaminated surfaces 358. A new method using an invisible flurorescent mark er to objectively evaluate the thoroughness of cleaning activities in patient rooms might lead to improvem ent in cleaning of all objects and surfaces but needs further evaluation 360. Lastly, does the use of antiseptics or disinfec tants facilitate the devel organisms? Evidence and reviews indi cate enhanced tolerance to disinfectants can be 28Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 developed in response to disinfectant exposure 334, 335, 346, 347, 361. However, the level of tolerance is not important in clinical terms because it is low and unlik ely to compromise the effe ctiveness of disinfectants of which much higher concentrations are used 347, 362. The issue of whether low-level tolerance to germi cides selects for antibiotic-resistant strains is unsettled but might depend on the mechanism by which to lerance is attained. For example, changes in the permeability barrier or efflux mechanisms mi ght affect susceptibility to both antibiotics and germicides, but specific changes to a target site might not. Some res earchers have suggested that use of disinfectants or antiseptics (e.g., triclosan) c ould facilitate development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms 334, 335, 363. Although evidence in laboratory studies indicates low-level resistance to triclosan, the concentrations of triclosan in these studies were low (generally <1 g/mL) and dissimilar from the higher levels used in antimicrobial products (2,000-20,000 g/mL) 364, 365. Thus, researchers can create laboratory-derived mutants that demonstrate reduced susceptibility to antiseptics or disinfectants. In some experiments, such bacteria have demonstr ated reduced susceptibility to certain antibiotics 335. There is no evidence that using antis eptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature or that such mutants survive in nature366. ). In addition, the action of antibiotics and the action of disinfectants differ fundamentally. An tibiotics are selectively toxic and generally have a single target site in bacteria, thereby inhibiting a specific biosynt hetic process. Germicides generally are considered nonspecific antimicrobials because of a multiplicity of toxic-effect mechanisms or target sites and are broader spectrum in the types of microorganisms against which they are effective 344, 347. The rotational use of disinfectants in some environments (e.g., pharmacy production units) has been recommended and practiced in an attempt to prevent development of resistant microbes 367, 368. There have been only rare case reports that appropriate ly used disinfectants have resulted in a clinical problem arising from the selection or development of nonsusceptible microorganisms 369. Surface Disinfection Is Surface Disinfection Necessary? The effective use of disinfectants is part of a multibarrier strategy to prevent health-care- associated infections. Surfaces are considered noncriti cal items because they contact intact skin. Use of noncritical items or contact with noncritical surfaces ca rries little risk of causing an infection in patients or staff. Thus, the routine use of germicidal chemicals to disinfect hospital floors and other noncritical items is controversial 370-375. A 1991 study expanded the Spaulding sc heme by dividing the noncritical environmental surfaces into housekeeping surfaces and medical equipment surfaces 376. The classes of disinfectants used on housekeeping and medical equipment surfaces can be similar. However, the frequency of decontaminating can vary (see Recommendat ions). Medical equipment surfaces (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, hemodialysis machi nes, and X-ray machines) can become contaminated with infectious agents and contribute to the spread of health-care-associated infections 248, 375. For this reason, noncritical medical equipment surfaces shoul d be disinfected with an EPA-registered low- or intermediate-level disinfectant. Use of a disinfectant will provide antimicr obial activity that is likely to be achieved with minimal additional cost or work. Environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside table) also could potentially contribute to cross- transmission by contamination of health-care personnel from hand contact with contaminated surfaces, medical equipment, or patients 50, 375, 377. A paper reviews the epidemiologic and microbiologic data (Table 3) regarding the use of disi nfectants on noncritical surfaces 378. Of the seven reasons to usie a disinfectant on noncritical surfaces, five are particularly noteworthy and support the use of a germicidal detergen t. First, hospital floors become contaminated with microorganisms from settling airborne bacteria: by contact with shoes, wheel s, and other objects; and occasionally by spills. The removal of microbes is a component in controling health-care-associated infections. In an investigation of the cleaning of hospi tal floors, the use of soap and water (80% reduction) was less effective in reducing the numbers of bacteria than was a phenolic di sinfectant (94%-99.9% 29Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 reduction) 379. However, a few hours after floor disinfecti on, the bacterial count was nearly back to the pretreatment level. Second, detergents become c ontaminated and result in seeding the patient's environment with bacteria. Investigators have shown that mop water becomes increasingly dirty during cleaning and becomes contaminated if soap and water is us ed rather than a disinfectant. For example, in one study, bacterial contamination in soap and water wi thout a disinfectant increased from 10 CFU/mL to 34,000 CFU/mL after cleaning a ward, whereas contami nation in a disinfectant solution did not change (20 CFU/mL) 380. Contamination of surfaces close to the pat ient that are frequently touched by the patient or staff (e.g., bed rails) could result in patient exposures0 381. In a study, using of detergents on floors and patient room furniture, increased bacterial contam ination of the patients' environmental surfaces was found after cleaning (average increase = 103.6 CFU/24cm2) 382. In addition, a P. aeruginosa outbreak was reported in a hematology-oncology unit associ ated with contamination of the surface cleaning equipment when nongermicidal cleaning solutions instead of disinfectants were used to decontaminate the patients' environment 383 and another study demonstrated the ro le of environmental cleaning in controlling an outbreak of Acinetobacter baumannii 384. Studies also have shown that, in situations where the cleaning procedure failed to eliminate contaminati on from the surface and the cloth is used to wipe another surface, the contamination is transferred to that surface and the hands of the person holding the cloth381, 385. Third, the CDC Isolation Guideline recommends that noncritical equipment contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions be cl eaned and disinfected after use. The same guideline recommends that, in addition to cleaning, disinf ection of the bedside equipment and environmental surfaces (e.g., bedrails, bedside tables, carts, commodes, door-knobs, and faucet handles) is indicated for certain pathogens, e.g., enterococci, which can survive in the inanimate environment for prolonged periods 386. Fourth, OSHA requires that surfaces contam inated with blood and other potentially infectious materials (e.g., amniotic, pleural fluid) be disinfect ed. Fifth, using a single product throughout the facility can simplify both training and appropriate practice. Reasons also exist for using a detergent alone on floors because noncritical surfaces contribute minimally to endemic health-care-associated infections 387, and no differences have been found in healthcare-associated infections rates when floors ar e cleaned with detergent rat her than disinfectant 382, 388, 389. However, these studies have been small and of short duration and suffer from low statistical power because the outcome\u2014healthcare-associated infe ctions\u2014is of low frequency. The low rate of infections makes the efficacy of an intervention statistically difficult to demonstrate. Because housekeeping surfaces are associated with the lowest risk for disease transmission, some researchers have suggested that either detergents or a disinfectant/detergent could be used 376. No data exist that show reduced healthcare-associated infection rates with use of surface disinfection of floors, but some data demonstrate reduced microbial load associated with t he use of disinfectants. Given this information; other information showing that envir onmental surfaces (e.g., bedside tabl e, bed rails) close to the patient and in outpatient settings 390 can be contaminated with epidemiologi cally important microbes (such as VRE and MRSA)47, 390-394; and data showing these organisms surv ive on various hospital surfaces 395, 396; some researchers have suggested that such surf aces should be disinfected on a regular schedule 378. Spot decontamination on fabrics that remain in hospita ls or clinic rooms while patients move in and out (e.g., privacy curtains) also should be considered. One study demonstrated the effectiveness of spraying the fabric with 3% hydrogen peroxide 397. Future studies should evaluate the level of contamination on noncritical environmental surfaces as a function of high and low hand contact and whether some surfaces (e.g., bed rails) near the patient with high contac t frequencies require more frequent disinfection. Regardless of whether a detergent or disinfectant is used on surfaces in a health-care facility, surfaces should be cleaned routinely and when dirty or soiled to provide an aesthetically pleasing environment and to prevent potentially contaminated objects from serving as a source for health-care-associated infections 398. The value of designing surfaces (e.g. hexyl- polyvinylpyridine) that kill bacteria on contact 399or have sustained antimicrobial activity 400 should be further evaluated. Several investigators have recognized heavy microbial contamination of wet mops and cleaning cloths and the potential for spread of such contamination 68, 401. They have shown that wiping hard surfaces with contaminated cloths can c ontaminate hands, equipment, and other surfaces 68, 402. Data 30Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 have been published that can be used to formulate effective policies for decontamination and maintenance of reusable cleaning cloths. For example, heat was the most reliable treatment of cleaning cloths as a detergent washing followed by drying at 80oC for 2 hours produced elimination of contamination. However, the dry heating proce ss might be a fire hazard if the mop head contains petroleum-based products or lint builds up within the equipment or vent hose (American Health Care Association, personal communication, March 2003). Alte rnatively, immersing t he cloth in hypochlorite (4,000 ppm) for 2 minutes produced no detectable surviving organisms in 10 of 13 cloths 403. If reusable cleaning cloths or mops are used, they should be decontaminated regularly to prevent surface contamination during cleaning with subsequent transfer of organisms from these surfaces to patients or equipment by the hands of health-care workers. Some hospitals have begun using a new mopping technique involving microfiber materials to clean floor s. Microfibers are densely constructed, polyester and polyamide (nylon) fibers, that are approximately 1/16 the thickness of a human hair. The positively charged microfibers attract dust (which has a negative charge) and are more absorbent than a conventional, cotton-loop mop. Microfiber materials also can be wet with disinfectants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds. In one study, the mi crofiber system tested demonstrated superior microbial removal compared with conventional string mops when used with a detergent cleaner (94% vs 68%). The use of a disinfectant did not improve the microbial eliminat ion demonstrated by the microfiber system (95% vs 94%). However, use of disinfectant significantly improved microbial removal when a conventional string mop was used (95% vs 68%)(WA Rutala, unpublished data, August 2006). The microfiber system also prevents t he possibility of transferring microbes from room to room because a new microfiber pad is used in each room. Contact Times for Surface Disinfectants An important issue concerning use of disinfectant s for noncritical surfaces in health-care settings is that the contact time specified on the label of t he product is often too long to be practically followed. The labels of most products registered by EPA for use against HBV, HIV, or M. tuberculosis specify a contact time of 10 minutes. Such a long contact time is not practical for disinfection of environmental surfaces in a health-care setting because most health-car e facilities apply a disinfectant and allow it to dry (~1 minute). Multiple scientific papers have demonstrat ed significant microbial reduction with contact times of 30 to 60 seconds 46-56, 58-64. In addition, EPA will approve a shortened contact time for any product for which the manufacturers will s ubmit confirmatory efficacy data. Currently, some EPA-registered disi nfectants have contact times of one to three minutes. By law, users must follow all applicable label instructions for EPA-registered products . Ideally, product users should consider and use products that have the s hortened contact time. However, disinfectant manufacturers also need to obtain EPA approval for shortened contact times so these products will be used correctly and effectively in the health-care environment. Air Disinfection Disinfectant spray-fog techniques for antimicrobial control in hospital rooms has been used. This technique of spraying of disinfectants is an unsatis factory method of decontaminating air and surfaces and is not recommended for general infection control in routine patient-care areas386. Disinfectant fogging is rarely, if ever, used in U.S. healthcare fa cilities for air and surface di sinfection in patient-care areas. Methods (e.g., filtration, ultraviolet germici dal irradiation, chlorine dioxide) to reduce air contamination in the healthcare setting are discussed in another guideline 23. Microbial Contamination of Disinfectants Contaminated disinfectants and antiseptics have been occasional vehicles of health-care infections and pseudoepidemics for more than 50 years. Published reports describing contaminated disinfectants and antiseptic solutions leading to heal th-care-associated infections have been summarized 31Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 404. Since this summary additional reports have been published 405-408. An examination of reports of disinfectants contaminated with microorganisms revealed noteworth y observations. Perhaps most importantly, high-level disinfect ants/liquid chemical sterilants hav e not been associated with outbreaks due to intrinsic or extrinsic c ontamination.Members of the genus Pseudomonas (e.g., P. aeruginosa ) are the most frequent isolates from contaminated disi nfectants\u2014recovered from 80% of contaminated products. Their ability to remain viable or grow in us e-dilutions of disinfectants is unparalleled. This survival advantage for Pseudomonas results presumably from their nutritional versatility, their unique outer membrane that constitutes an effective barrier to the passage of germicides, and/or efflux systems 409. Although the concentrated solutions of t he disinfectants have not been demonstrated to be contaminated at the point of manufacture, an undiluted phenolic can be contaminated by a Pseudomonas sp. during use 410. In most of the reports that describe illne ss associated with contam inated disinfectants, the product was used to disinfect patient-care equipm ent, such as cystoscopes, cardiac catheters, and thermometers. Germicides used as disinfectants that were reported to have been contaminated include chlorhexidine, quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolics, and pine oil. The following control measures should be instituted to reduce the frequency of bacterial growth in disinfectants and the threat of serious healthcare-associated infections from the use of such contaminated products 404. First, some disinfectants should not be d iluted; those that are diluted must be prepared correctly to achieve the manufacturers' recommended use-dilution. Second, infection-control professionals must learn from the liter ature what inappropriate activities result in extrinsic contamination (i.e., at the point of use) of germicides and trai n users to prevent recurrence. Common sources of extrinsic contamination of germicides in the reviewed literature are the water to make working dilutions, contaminated containers, and general contamination of the hospital areas where the germicides are prepared and/or used. Third, stock solutions of germicides must be stored as indicated on the product label. EPA verifies manufacturers' efficacy clai ms against microorganisms. These measures should provide assurance that products meeting the EPA regist ration requirements can achieve a certain level of antimicrobial activity when used as directed. 32Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 FACTORS AFFECTING THE EFFICACY OF DISINFECTION AND STERILIZATION The activity of germicides against microorgani sms depends on a number of factors, some of which are intrinsic qualities of the organism, others of which are the chemical and external physical environment. Awareness of these factors should lead to better use of disinfection and sterilization processes and will be briefly reviewed. More extensive consideration of these and other factors is available elsewhere 13, 14, 16, 411-413. Number and Location of Microorganisms All other conditions remaining constant, the larger the number of microbes, the more time a germicide needs to destroy all of them. Spaulding illust rated this relation when he employed identical test conditions and demonstrated that it took 30 minutes to kill 10 B. atrophaeus (formerly Bacillus subtilis ) spores but 3 hours to kill 100,000 Bacillus atrophaeus spores. This reinforces the need for scrupulous cleaning of medical instruments before disinfection and sterilizat ion. Reducing the number of microorganisms that must be inactivated through meticu lous cleaning, increases the margin of safety when the germicide is used according to the labeling and shortens the exposure time required to kill the entire microbial load. Researchers also have shown t hat aggregated or clumped cells are more difficult to inactivate than monodispersed cells 414. The location of microorganisms also must be cons idered when factors affecting the efficacy of germicides are assessed. Medical instruments with multiple pieces must be disassembled and equipment such as endoscopes that have crevic es, joints, and channels are more difficult to disinfect than are flat- surface equipment because penetration of the disinfectant of all parts of the equipment is more difficult. Only surfaces that directly cont act the germicide will be disinfected, so there must be no air pockets and the equipment must be completely immersed for t he entire exposure period. Manufacturers should be encouraged to produce equipment engineered for ease of cleaning and disinfection. Innate Resistance of Microorganisms Microorganisms vary greatly in their resistance to chemical germicides and sterilization processes (Figure 1) 342 Intrinsic resistance mechanisms in mi croorganisms to disinfectants vary. For example, spores are resistant to disinfectants because the spore c oat and cortex act as a barrier, mycobacteria have a waxy cell wall that prevents di sinfectant entry, and gram -negative bacteria possess an outer membrane that acts as a barri er to the uptake of disinfectants 341, 343-345. Implicit in all disinfection strategies is the cons ideration that the most resistant microbial subpopulation controls the sterilization or disinfection time. That is, to destr oy the most resistant ty pes of microorganisms (i.e., bacterial spores), the user needs to employ ex posure times and a concentration of germicide needed to achieve complete destruction. Exc ept for prions, bacterial spores possess the highest innate resistance to chemical germicides, followed by coccidia (e.g., Cryptosporidium ), mycobacteria (e.g., M. ), nonlipid small poliovirus, and coxsackievirus), fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, and Candida ), vegetative bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas ) and lipid or medium-size viruses (e.g., herpes, and HIV). The germicidal resistance ex hibited by the gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria is similar with some exceptions (e.g., P. aeruginosa which shows greater resistance to some disinfectants) 369, 415, 416. P. aeruginosa also is significantly more resistant to a variety of disinfectants in its \"naturally occurring\" state than are cells subcultured on laboratory media 415, 417. Rickettsiae, Chlamydiae , and mycoplasma cannot be placed in this scale of relative resistance because information about the efficacy of germicides against these agents is limited 418. Because these microorganisms contain lipid and are similar in structure and composit ion to other bacteria, they can be predicted to be inactivated by the same germicides that destroy lip id viruses and vegetative bac teria. A known exception to this supposition is Coxiella burnetti , which has demonstrated resistance to disinfectants 419. Concentration and Potency of Disinfectants With other variables constant, and with one exception (iodophors), the more concentrated the 33Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 disinfectant, the greater its efficacy and the shorter the time necessary to achieve microbial kill. Generally not recognized, however, is that a ll disinfectants are not similarly affected by concentration adjustments. For example, quaternary ammonium compounds and phenol have a concentration exponent of 1 and 6, respectively; thus, halving the concentration of a quaternary ammonium compound requires doubling its disinfecting time, but halving the concentration of a phenol solution requires a 64-fold (i.e., 26) increase in its disinfecting time 365, 413, 420. Considering the length of the disinfection time, which depends on the potency of the germicide, also is important. This was illustrated by Spaulding who demonstrated using the mucin-loop test that 70% isopropyl alcohol destroyed 10 4 M. tuberculosis in 5 minutes, whereas a simultaneous test with 3% phenolic required 2-3 hours to achieve the same level of microbial kill 14. Physical and Chemical Factors Several physical and chemical factors also infl uence disinfectant procedur es: temperature, pH, relative humidity, and water hardness. For example, the activity of most disinf ectants increases as the temperature increases, but some ex ceptions exist. Furthermore, too great an increase in temperature causes the disinfectant to degrade and weakens its ger micidal activity and thus might produce a potential health hazard. An increase in pH improves the antimicrobial ac tivity of some disinfectants (e.g., glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium compounds) but decreases the ant imicrobial activity of others (e.g., phenols, hypochlorites, and iodine). The pH influences the antim icrobial activity by altering the disinfectant molecule or the cell surface 413. Relative humidity is the single most import ant factor influencing the activity of gaseous disinfectants/sterilants, such as Et O, chlorine dioxide, and formaldehyde. Water hardness (i.e., high concentration of divalent cations) reduces the rate of kill of certain disinfectants because divalent cations (e.g., magnesium, calcium) in the hard water interact with the disinfectant to form insoluble precipitates 13, 421. Organic and Inorganic Matter Organic matter in the form of serum, blood, pus, or fecal or lubricant material can interfere with the antimicrobial activity of disinfectants in at l east two ways. Most commonly, interference occurs by a chemical reaction between the germicide and the organi c matter resulting in a complex that is less germicidal or nongermicidal, leaving less of the acti ve germicide available for attacking microorganisms. Chlorine and iodine disinfectants, in particular, are prone to such interaction. Alternatively, organic material can protect microorganisms from attack by acting as a physical barrier 422, 423. The effects of inorganic cont aminants on the sterilization process were studied during the 1950s and 1960s 424, 425. These and other studies show the pr otection by inorganic contaminants of microorganisms to all sterilization processes results from occlusion in salt crystals 426, 427. This further emphasizes the importance of meticulous cleaning of medical devices before any sterilization or disinfection procedure because both organic and inor ganic soils are easily removed by washing 426. Duration of Exposure Items must be exposed to the germicide for t he appropriate minimum contact time. Multiple investigators have demonstrated the effectiveness of low-level disinf ectants against vegetative bacteria (e.g., Listeria , Salmonella , VRE, MRSA), yeasts (e.g., Candida), mycobacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis ), and viruses (e.g., poliovirus) at exposure times of 30-60 seconds 46-64. By law, all applicable label instructions on EPA-registered products must be followed. If the user selects exposure conditions that differ from those on the EPA-register ed product label, the user assumes liability for any injuries resulting from off-label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) 34Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 All lumens and channels of endoscopic instruments must contact the disinfectant. Air pockets interfere with the disinfection proce ss, and items that float on the disinfectant will not be disinfected. The disinfectant must be introduced reliably into the in ternal channels of the device. The exact times for disinfecting medical items are somewhat elusive bec ause of the effect of t he aforementioned factors on disinfection efficacy. Certain contact times have pr oved reliable (Table 1), but, in general, longer contact times are more effective than shorter contact times. Biofilms Microorganisms may be protected from disinfec tants by production of thick masses of cells 428 and extracellular materials, or biofilms 429-435. Biofilms are microbial communities that are tightly attached to surfaces and cannot be easly removed. Once these masses form, microbes within them can be resistant to disinfectants by mult iple mechanisms, including physical characteristics of older biofilms, genotypic variation of the bacteria, microbial production of neutralizing enzymes, and physiologic gradients within the biofilm (e.g., pH). Bacteria with in biofilms are up to 1,000 times more resistant to antimicrobials than are the same bacteria in suspension 436. Although new decontamination methods 437 are being investigated for removing biofilms, chlori ne and monochloramines can effectively inactivate biofilm bacteria 431 438. Investigators have hypothesized that the glycocalyx-like cellular masses on the interior walls of polyvinyl chloride pipe would pr otect embedded organisms from some disinfectants and be a reservoir for continuous contamination 429, 430, 439. Biofilms have been found in whirlpools 440, dental unit waterlines441, and numerous medical devices (e.g., cont act lenses, pacemakers, hemodialysis systems, urinary catheters, c entral venous catheters, endoscopes) 434, 436, 438, 442. Their presence can have serious implications for immunocompromised patients and patients who have indwelling medical devices. Some enzymes 436, 443, 444 and detergents 436 can degrade biofilms or reduce numbers of viable bacteria within a biofilm, but no products are EPA-registered or FDA-cleared for this purpose. 35Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 CLEANING Cleaning is the removal of foreign material (e.g ., soil, and organic material) from objects and is normally accomplished using water with detergents or enzymatic products. T horough cleaning is required before high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere wi th the effectiveness of these processe s. Also, if soiled materials dry or bake onto the instruments, the removal process becomes more difficult and the disinfection or sterilization process less effective or ineffective. Surgical inst ruments should be presoaked or rinsed to prevent drying of blood and to soften or remove blood from the instruments. Cleaning is done manually in use areas without mechanical units (e.g., ultrasonic cleaners or washer-disinfectors) or for fragile or difficult-to-cl ean instruments. With manual cleaning, the two essential components are friction and fluidics. Friction (e.g., r ubbing/scrubbing the soiled area with a brush) is an old and dependable method. Fluidics (i.e., fluids under pr essure) is used to remove soil and debris from internal channels after brushing and when the desi gn does not allow passage of a brush through a channel 445. When a washer-disinfector is used, care should be taken in loading instruments: hinged instruments should be opened fully to allow adequate cont act with the detergent solution; stacking of instruments in washers should be avoided; and in struments should be disassembled as much as possible. The most common types of mechanical or aut omatic cleaners are ultrasonic cleaners, washer- decontaminators, washer-disinfectors, and washe r-sterilizers. Ultrasonic cleaning removes soil by cavitation and implosion in which waves of acoustic energy are propagated in aqueous solutions to disrupt the bonds that hold particulate matter to surf aces. Bacterial contamination can be present in used ultrasonic cleaning solutions (and other used detergent solutions) because these solutions generally do not make antibacterial label claims 446. Even though ultrasound alone does not significantly inactivate bacteria, sonication can act synergistically to increase the cidal efficacy of a disinfectant 447. Users of ultrasonic cleaners should be aware that the cleaning fl uid could result in endotoxin contamination of surgical instruments, which could c ause severe inflammatory reactions 448. Washer-sterilizers are modified steam sterilizers that cl ean by filling the chamber with wa ter and detergent through which steam passes to provide agitation. Instruments are subsequently rinsed and subjected to a short steam-sterilization cycle. Another washer-sterilizer employs rotating spray arms for a wash cycle followed by a steam sterilization cycle at 285 oF 449, 450. Washer-decontaminators/disinfectors act like a dishwasher that uses a combination of water circulation and detergent s to remove soil. These units sometimes have a cycle that subjects the instruments to a heat process (e.g., 93\u00baC for 10 minutes) 451. Washer-disinfectors are generally computer-controlled units for cleaning, disinfecting, and drying solid and hollow surgical and medical equipment. In one study, cleaning (measured as 5-6 log 10 reduction) was achieved on surfaces that had adequate contact with the water flow in the machine 452. Detailed information about cleaning and preparing supplies for terminal sterilization is provided by professional organizations 453, 454 and books 455. Studies have shown that manual and mechanical cleaning of endoscopes achieves approximately a 4- log10 reduction of contaminating organisms 83, 104, 456, 457. Thus, cleaning alone effectively reduces the number of microorganisms on contaminated equipment. In a quantitative analysis of residual protein contamination of reprocessed surgic al instruments, median levels of residual protein contamination per instrument for five trays were 267, 260, 163, 456, and 756 \u00b5g 458. In another study, the median amount of protein from reprocessed surgical instruments fr om different hospitals ranged from 8 \u00b5g to 91 \u00b5g 459. When manual methods were compared with automated methods for cleaning reusable accessory devices used for minimally invasive surgical procedures, the automated method was more efficient for cleaning biopsy forceps and ported and nonported laparoscopic devices and achieved a >99% reduction in soil parameters (i.e., protein, carbohydrate, hemoglobi n) in the ported and nonported laparoscopic devices 460, 461 For instrument cleaning, a neutral or near- neutral pH detergent solution commonly is used because such solutions generally provide the best ma terial compatibility profile and good soil removal. 36Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Enzymes, usually proteases, sometimes are added to neut ral pH solutions to assist in removing organic material. Enzymes in these formulations attack proteins that make up a large portion of common soil (e.g., blood, pus). Cleaning solutions also can contai n lipases (enzymes active on fats) and amylases (enzymes active on starches). Enzymatic cleaners ar e not disinfectants, and proteinaceous enzymes can be inactivated by germicides. As with all chemical s, enzymes must be rinsed from the equipment or adverse reactions (e.g., fever, residual amounts of hi gh-level disinfectants, proteinaceous residue) could result 462, 463. Enzyme solutions should be used in accor dance with manufacturer's instructions, which include proper dilution of the enzymatic detergent and contact with equipment for the amount of time specified on the label 463. Detergent enzymes can result in asthma or other allergic effects in users. Neutral pH detergent solutions that contain enzymes are compatible wi th metals and other materials used in medical instruments and are the best choice for cleaning delicate medical instruments, especially flexible endoscopes 457. Alkaline-based cleaning agents are used for processing medical devices because they efficiently disso lve protein and fat residues 464; however, they can be corrosive 457. Some data demonstrate that enzymatic cleaners ar e more effective than neutral detergents 465, 466 in removing microorganisms from surfaces but two more recent studies found no difference in cleaning efficiency between enzymatic and alkaline-based cleaners 443, 464. Another study found no significant difference between enzymatic and non-enzymatic cleaners in terms of microbial cleaning efficacy 467. A new non- enzyme, hydrogen peroxide-based formulation (not FDA- cleared) was as effective as enzymatic cleaners in removing protein, blood, carbohydrate, and endotoxin from surface test carriers468 In addition, this product effected a 5-log 10 reduction in microbial loads with a 3-minute exposure at room temperature 468. Although the effectiveness of high-level disinf ection and sterilization mandat es effective cleaning, no \"real-time\" tests exist that can be employed in a clinical setting to verify cleaning. If such tests were commercially available they could be used to ensure an adequate level of cleaning 469-472. ). The only way to ensure adequate cleaning is to conduct a reprocessing verification test (e.g., microbiologic sampling), but this is not routinely recommended 473. Validation of the cleaning processes in a laboratory-testing program is possible by microorganism detection, chemical detection for organic contaminants, radionuclide tagging, and chemical detection for specific ions 426, 471. During the past few years, data have been published describing use of an artificial soil, protein, endotoxin, X-ray contrast medium, or blood to verify the manual or automated cleaning process 169, 452, 474-478 and adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence and microbiologic sampling to eval uate the effectiveness of environmental surface cleaning170, 479. At a minimum, all instruments should be individually inspected and be visibly clean. 37Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 DISINFECTION Many disinfectants are used alone or in co mbinations (e.g., hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid) in the health-care setting. These include al cohols, chlorine and chlorine compounds, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, ortho-phthalaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, i odophors, peracetic acid, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Commercial formulat ions based on these chemicals are considered unique products and must be registered with EPA or clear ed by FDA. In most instances, a given product is designed for a specific purpose and is to be used in a certain manner. Therefore, users should read labels carefully to ensure the correct product is selected for the intended use and applied efficiently. Disinfectants are not interchangeable, and incorrect concentrations and inappropriate disinfectants can result in ex cessive costs. Because occupational diseases among cleaning personnel have been associated with use of several disinf ectants (e.g., formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and chlorine), precautions (e.g., gloves and proper ventilation) should be used to minimize exposure 318, 480, 481. Asthma and reactive airway disease can occu r in sensitized persons exposed to any airborne chemical, including germicides. Clinic ally important asthma can occur at levels below ceiling levels regulated by OSHA or recommended by NIOSH. The preferred method of control is elimination of the chemical (through engineering controls or subs titution) or relocation of the worker. The following overview of the performance characte ristics of each provides users with sufficient information to select an appropriate disinfectant for any item and use it in the most efficient way. Chemical Disinfectants Alcohol Overview. In the healthcare setting, \"alcohol\" refers to two water-soluble chemical compounds\u2014 alcohol\u2014that have gener ally underrated germicidal characteristics 482. FDA has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high-le vel disinfectant with alcohol as the main active ingredient. These alcohols are rapidly bactericidal ra ther than bacteriostatic against vegetative forms of bacteria; they also are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal but do not destroy bacterial spores. Their cidal activity drops sharply when diluted below 50% concentration, and the optimum bactericidal concentration is 60%-90% solutions in water (volume/volume) 483, 484. Mode of Action . The most feasible explanation for t he antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins. This me chanism is supported by the observa tion that absolute ethyl alcohol, a dehydrating agent, is less bactericidal than mixtures of alcohol and water because proteins are denatured more quickly in the presence of water 484, 485. Protein denaturation also is consistent with observations that alcohol destroys the dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli 486, and that ethyl alcohol increases the lag phase of Enterobacter aerogenes 487 and that the lag phase effect could be reversed by adding certain amino acids. The bacteriostatic action was believed c aused by inhibition of the production of metabolites essential for rapid cell division. Microbicidal Activity . Methyl alcohol (methanol) has the weakest bactericidal action of the alcohols and thus seldom is used in healthcare 488. The bactericidal activity of various concentrations of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) was examined against a variety of microorganisms in exposure periods ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour 483. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 30% to 100% (v/v), and Serratia marcescens, E, coli and Salmonella typhosa were killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 40% to 100%. The gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were slightly more resistant, being killed in 10 seconds by ethyl alcohol concentrations of 60%-95% . Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) was slightly more bactericidal than ethyl alcohol for E. coli and S. aureus 489. Ethyl alcohol, at concentrations of 60%-80%, is a potent virucidal agent inactivating all viruses (e.g., herpes, vaccinia, and infl uenza virus) and many hydrophilic viruses (e.g., 38Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and rotaviruses but not hepatitis A virus (HAV) 58 or poliovirus) 49. Isopropyl alcohol is not active against the nonlipid enteroviruses but is fully active against the lipid viruses 72. Studies also have demonstrated the ability of ethy l and isopropyl alcohol to inactivate the hepatitis B virus(HBV) 224, 225 and the herpes virus, 490 and ethyl alcohol to inactivate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 227, rotavirus, echovirus, and astrovirus 491. In tests of the effect of ethyl alcohol against M. tuberculosis , 95% ethanol killed the tubercle bacilli in sputum or water suspension within 15 seconds 492. In 1964, Spaulding stated that alcohols were the germicide of choice for tuberculocidal activity, and they should be the standard by which all other tuberculocides are compared. For example, he com pared the tuberculocidal activity of iodophor (450 ppm), a isopropanol ( 70%/volume) using the mucin-loop test (106 M. tuberculosis per loop) and determined the contact time s needed for complete destruction were 120-180 minutes, 45-60 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively. The mucin-loop test is a severe test developed to produce long survival times. Thus, these figures should not be extrapolated to the exposure times needed when these germicides are used on medical or surgical material 482. Ethyl alcohol (70%) was the most effectiv e concentration for killing the culture phases of the latter three organisms aerosolized onto various surfaces. The culture phase was more resistant to the action of ethyl alcohol and required about 20 minutes to disinfect the contaminated surface, compared wi th <1 minute for the tissue phase 493, 494. Isopropyl alcohol (20%) is effective in killing the cysts of Acanthamoeba culbertsoni (560) as are chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, and thimerosal 496. Uses . Alcohols are not recommended for sterilizing medical and surgical materials principally because they lack sporicidal action and they cannot penet rate protein-rich materials. Fatal postoperative wound infections with Clostridium have occurred when alcohols were used to sterilize surgical instruments contaminated with bacterial spores 497. Alcohols have been used effectively to disinfect oral and rectal thermometers498, 499, hospital pagers 500, scissors 501, and stethoscopes have been used to disinfect fiberoptic endoscopes 503, 504 but failure of this disinfectant have lead to infection 280, 505. Alcohol towelettes have been used for years to di sinfect small surfaces such as rubber stoppers of multiple-dose medication vials or vaccine bottles . Furthermore, alcohol occasionally is used to disinfect external surfaces of equipment (e.g., stethoscopes, ventilators, manual ventilation bags) 506, CPR manikins 507, ultrasound instruments 508 or medication preparation areas. Two studies demonstrated the effectiveness of 70% isopropyl alcohol to di sinfect reusable transducer heads in a controlled environment 509, 510. In contrast, three bloodstream infection outbreaks have been described when alcohol was used to disinfect transduc er heads in an intensive-care setting 511. The documented shortcomings of alcohols on equipment are that they damage the shellac mountings of lensed instruments, tend to swe ll and harden rubber and certain plastic tubing after prolonged and repeated use, bleach rubber and plastic tiles 482 and damage tonometer tips (by deterioration of the glue) after the equival ent of 1 working year of routine use 512. Tonometer biprisms soaked in alcohol for 4 days developed rough front surf aces that potentially could cause corneal damage; this appeared to be caused by weakening of the cement ing substances used to fabricate the biprisms 513. Corneal opacification has been reported when tonomet er tips were swabbed with alcohol immediately before measurement of intraocular pressure 514. Alcohols are flammable and consequently must be stored in a cool, well-ventilated area. They al so evaporate rapidly, making extended exposure time difficult to achieve unless the items are immersed. Chlorine and Chlorine Compounds Overview. Hypochlorites, the most widely used of t he chlorine disinfectants, are available as liquid (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) or solid (e.g., calcium hypochlorite). The most prevalent chlorine 39Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 products in the United States are aqueous solutions of 5.25%-6.15% sodium hypoc hlorite (see glossary), usually called household bleach. They have a broad spectr um of antimicrobial activity, do not leave toxic residues, are unaffected by water hardne ss, are inexpensive and fast acting 328, remove dried or fixed organisms and biofilms from surfaces465, and have a low incidence of serious toxicity 515-517. Sodium hypochlorite at the concentration used in household bl each (5.25-6.15%) can produce ocular irritation or oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric burns 318, 518-522. Other disadvantages of hypochlorites include corrosiveness to metals in high concentrations (>500 ppm), inactivation by organic matter, discoloring or \"bleaching\" of fabrics, release of toxic chlorine gas when mixed with ammonia or acid (e.g., household cleaning agents) 523-525, and relative stability 327. The microbicidal activity of chlorine is attributed largely to undissociated hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The disso ciation less microbicidal form (hypochlorite ion OCl-) depends on pH. The disinfecting efficacy of chlorine decreases with an increase in pH that parallels the conversion of undissociated HOCI to OCl- 329, 526. A potential hazard is production of the carcinogen bis(chloromethyl) ether when hypochlorite solutions contact formaldehyde 527 and the production of the animal carcinogen trihalomethane when hot water is hyperchlorinated 528. After reviewing environmental fate and ecologic data, EPA has determined the currently registered uses of hypochlorites will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to the environment 529. Alternative compounds that release chlori ne and are used in the health-care setting include demand-release chlorine dioxide, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, and chlora mine-T. The advantage of these compounds over the hypochlorit es is that they retain chlorine longer and so exert a more prolonged bactericidal effect. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate tabl ets are stable, and for two reasons, the microbicidal activity of solutions prepared from sodium dichloro isocyanurate tablets might be greater than that of sodium hypochlorite solutions containing the same total available chlorine. First, with sodium dichloroisocyanurate, only 50% of the tota l available chlorine is free (HOCl and OCl-), whereas the remainder is combined (monochloroisocyanurate or di chloroisocyanurate), and as free available chlorine is used up, the latter is released to restore the equilibrium. Second, solutions of sodium dichloroisocyanurate are acidic, whereas sodium hypochlorite solutions are alkaline, and the more microbicidal type of chlorine (HOCl) is believed to predominate 530-533. Chlorine dioxide-based disinfectants are prepared fresh as required by mixing the two components (base solution [citric acid with preservatives and corrosion inhibitors] and the activato r solution [sodium chlorite]). In vitro suspension tests showed that solutions containing about 140 ppm chlorine dioxide achieved a reduction factor exceeding 106 of S. aureus in 1 minute and of Bacillus atrophaeus spores in 2.5 minutes in the presence of 3 g/L bovine albumin. The potential for damaging equipment requires consideration because long-term use can damage the outer plastic coat of the insertion tube 534. In another study, chlorine dioxide solutions at either 600 ppm or 30 ppm killed Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare within 60 seconds after contact but contamination by organic material significantly affected the microbicidal properties535. The microbicidal activity of a new disinfec tant, water,\" has been examined The concept saline to create a disinf ectant or antiseptics is appealing because the basic materials of saline and electricity are inexpensiv e and the end product (i.e., water) does not damage the environment. The main products of this water are hypochlorous acid (e.g., at a concentration of about 144 mg/L) and chlorine. As with any germicide, the antimic robial activity of super oxidized water is strongly affected by the concentration of the acti ve ingredient (available free chlorine) 536. One manufacturer generates the disinfectant at the poi nt of use by passing a saline solution over coated titanium electrodes at 9 amps. The product generated has a pH of 5. 0-6.5 and an oxidation-reduc tion potential (redox) of >950 mV. Although superoxidized water is intended to be generated fresh at the point of use, when tested under clean conditions the disinfectant was effective within 5 minutes when 48 hours old 537. Unfortunately, the equipment required to produc e the product can be expensive because parameters such as pH, current, and redox potential must be closel y monitored. The solution is nontoxic to biologic tissues. Although the United Kingdom manufacturer claims the solution is noncorrosive and nondamaging to endoscopes and processing equipment, one flexible endoscope manufacturer (Olympus Key-Med, United Kingdom) has voided the warranty on the endoscopes if superoxidized water is used to disinfect them 538. As with any germicide formulation, the user should check with the device manufacturer for 40Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 compatibility with the germicide. Additional studies are needed to determine whether this solution could be used as an alternative to other disinfectants or antiseptics for hand washing, skin antisepsis, room cleaning, or equipment disinfection (e.g., endoscopes, dialyzers) 400, 539, 540. In October 2002, the FDA cleared superoxidized water as a high-level disinfec tant (FDA, personal communication, September 18, 2002). Mode of Action . The exact mechanism by which free chlorine destroys microorganisms has not been elucidated. Inactivation by chlorine can result fr om a number of factors: oxidation of sulfhydryl enzymes and amino chlorination of amino acids; loss of intracellular contents; decreased uptake of nutrients; inhibition of protein synthesis; components; decreased adenosine triphosphate production; breaks in DNA; and depressed DNA synthesis 329, 347. The actual microbicidal mechanism of ch lorine might involve a combination of these factors or the effect of chlorine on critical sites 347. Microbicidal Activity . Low concentrations of free available chlorine (e.g., HOCl, OCl-, and elemental chlorine-Cl 2) have a biocidal effect on mycoplasma (25 ppm) and vegetative bacteria (<5 ppm) in seconds in the absence of an organic load 329, 418. Higher concentrations (1,000 ppm) of chlorine are required to kill M. tuberculosis using the Association of Official Anal ytical Chemists (AOAC) tuberculocidal test 73. A concentration of 100 ppm will kill >99.9% of B. atrophaeus spores within 5 minutes 541, 542 and destroy mycotic agents in <1 hour 329. Acidified bleach and regular bleach (5,000 ppm chlorine) can inactivate 106 Clostridium difficile spores in <10 minutes 262. One study reported that 25 different viruses were inactivated in 10 minutes with 200 ppm available chlorine 72. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of diluted sodium hypochlorit e and other disinfectants to inactivate HIV 61. Chlorine (500 ppm) showed inhibition of Candida after 30 seconds of exposure 54. In experiments using the AOAC Use-Dilution Method, 100 ppm of free chlorine killed 106-107 S. aureus , Salmonella choleraesuis , and P. aeruginosa in <10 minutes 327. Because household bleach contains 5.25%-6.15% sodium hypochlorite, or 52,500-61,500 ppm available chlorine, a 1:1,000 53-62 ppm available chlorine, and a 1:10 dilution of household bleach provides about 5250-6150 ppm. Data are available for chlorine dioxide that support bactericidal, fungicidal, sporicidal, tuberculocidal, and virucidal label claims 543-546. A chlorine dioxide generator has been shown effective for decontaminating flexible endoscopes 534 but it is not currently FDA-cleared for use as a high- level disinfectant 85. Chlorine dioxide can be produced by mixing solutions, such as a solution of chlorine with a solution of sodium chlorite 329. In 1986, a chlorine dioxide product was voluntarily removed from the market when its use caused leakage of cellulose-bas ed dialyzer membranes, which allowed bacteria to migrate from the dialysis fluid side of the dialyzer to the blood side 547. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate at 2,500 ppm avail able chlorine is effective against bacteria in the presence of up to 20% plasma, compared with 10% plasma for sodium hypochlorite at 2,500 ppm 548. \"Superoxidized water\" has been tested against bacteri a, mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores 537, 539, 549. Freshly generated superoxidized water is rapidl y effective (<2 minutes) in achieving a 5-log 10 reduction of pathogenic microorganisms (i.e., M. tuberculosis , M. chelonae , poliovirus, HIV, faecalis, P. aeruginosa in the absence of organic loading. However, the biocidal activity of this disinfectant decreased subs tantially in the presence of organic material (e.g., 5% horse serum) 537, 549, 550. No bacteria or viruses were detected on artificially contaminated endoscopes after a 5-minut e exposure to superoxidized water 551 and HBV-DNA was not detected from any endoscope experim entally contaminated with HBV- positive mixed sera after a disinfectant exposure time of 7 minutes552. Uses . Hypochlorites are widely used in healthca re facilities in a variety of settings. 328 Inorganic chlorine solution is used for disinfecting tonometer heads 188 and for spot-disinfection of countertops and floors. A 1:10-1:100 dilution of 5.25%-6.15% sodium hypochlorite (i.e., household bleach) 22, 228, 553, 554 or 41Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 an EPA-registered tuberculo cidal disinfectant 17has been recommended for decontaminating blood spills. For small spills of blood (i.e., drops of blood) on noncritical surfaces, the area can be disinfected with a 1:100 dilution of 5.25%-6.15% sodi an tuberculocidal disinfectant. hypochlorites and other ger micides are substantially inacti vated in the presence of blood 63, 548, 555, 556, large spills of blood require that the surface be cleaned before an EPA-register ed disinfectant or a 1:10 (final concentration) solution of household bleach is applied 557. If a sharps injury is possible, the surface initially should be decontaminated 69, 318, then cleaned and disinfected (1:10 final concentration) 63. Extreme care always should be taken to prev ent percutaneous injury. At least 500 ppm available chlorine for 10 minutes is recommended for decontaminating CPR training manikins 558. Full-strength bleach has been recommended for self-disinfection of needles and syringes used for illicit-drug injection when needle-exchange programs are not available. The difference in the recommended concentrations of bleach reflects the difficulty of cleaning the in terior of needles and syringes and the use of needles and syringes for parenteral injection 559. Clinicians should not alter t heir use of chlorine on environmental surfaces on the basis of testing methodologies that do not simulate actual disinfection practices 560, 561. Other uses in healthcare include as an irrigating agent in endodontic treatment 562 and as a disinfectant for manikins, laundry, dental appliances, hydrotherapy tanks 23, 41, regulated medical waste before disposal 328, and the water distribution system in hemodi alysis centers and hemodialysis machines 563. Chlorine long has been used as the disinfectant in water treatment. Hyperchlorination of a Legionella -contaminated hospital water system 23 resulted in a dramatic decrease (from 30% to 1.5%) in the isolation of L. pneumophila from water outlets and a cessation of healthcare-associated Legionnaires' disease in an affected unit 528, 564. Water disinfection with monochlor amine by municipal water-treatment plants substantially reduced the risk fo r healthcare-associated Legionnaires disease 565, 566. Chlorine dioxide also has been used to control Legionella in a hospital water supply. 567 Chloramine T 568 and hypochlorites 41 have been used to disinfect hydrotherapy equipment. Hypochlorite solutions in tap water at a pH >8 stored at room temperature (23 \u00baC) in closed, opaque plastic containers can lose up to 40%-50% of t heir free available chlorine level over 1 month. Thus, if a user wished to have a solution containing 500 ppm of available chlorine at day 30, he or she should prepare a solution containing 1,000 ppm of chlori ne at time 0. Sodium hypochlorite solution does not decompose after 30 days when stored in a closed brown bottle 327. The use of powders, composed of a mixture of a chlorine-releasing agent with highly absorbent resin, for disinfecting spills of body fluids has been evaluated by laboratory tests and hospital ward trials. The inclusion of acrylic resin particles in formulati ons markedly increases the volume of fluid that can be soaked up because the resin can absorb 200-300 times it s own weight of fluid, depending on the fluid consistency. When experimental formulations c ontaining 1%, 5%, and 10% available chlorine were evaluated by a standardized surface test, those cont aining 10% demonstrated bactericidal activity. One problem with chlorine-releasing granules is that they can generate chlorine fumes when applied to urine 569. Formaldehyde Overview. Formaldehyde is used as a disinfectant and sterilant in both its liquid and gaseous states. Liquid formaldehyde will be considered briefly in this section, and the gaseous form is reviewed elsewhere 570. Formaldehyde is sold and used principally as a water-based solution called formalin, which is 37% formaldehyde by weight. aqueous is tuberculocide, fungicide, 72, 82, 571-573. OSHA indicated that formaldehy de should be handled in the workplace as a potential carcinogen and set an employee exposure standard for formaldehyde that limits an 8-hour time-weighted average exposure concentration of 0.75 ppm 574, 575. The standard includes a second permissible exposure limit in the form of a short-term exposure limit (STEL) of 2 ppm that is the maximum exposure allowed during a 15-minute period 576. Ingestion of formaldehyde can be fatal, and long-term exposure to low levels in the air or on the skin can cause asthma-like respiratory problems and skin irritation, such as dermatitis and itching. For thes e reasons, employees should have limited direct contact 42Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 with formaldehyde, and these considerat ions limit its role in sterilization and disinfection processes. Key provisions of the OSHA standard t hat protects workers from exposur e to formaldehyde appear in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1910.1048 (and equivalent regulations in states with OSHA-approved state plans) 577. Mode of Action . Formaldehyde inactivates microorganisms by alkylating the amino and sulfhydral groups of proteins and ring nitrogen atoms of purine bases 376. Microbicidal Activity . Varying concentrations of aqueous formaldehyde solutions destroy a wide range of microorganisms. Inactivation of poliovi rus in 10 minutes required an 8% concentration of formalin, but all other viruses tested were inactivated with 2% formalin 72. Four percent formaldehyde is a tuberculocidal agent, inactivating 104 M. tuberculosis in 2 minutes 82, and 2.5% formaldehyde inactivated about 107 Salmonella Typhi in 10 minutes in the presence of organic matter 572. The sporicidal action of formaldehyde was slower than that of glutaraldehyde in comparative tests with 4% aqueous formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehy de against the spores of B. anthracis 82. The formaldehyde solution required 2 hours of contact to achi eve an inactivation factor of 104, whereas glutaraldehyde required only 15 minutes. Uses . Although formaldehyde-alcohol is a chemical sterilant and formaldehyde is a high-level disinfectant, the health-care uses of formaldehyde are limited by its irritating fumes and its pungent odor even at very low levels (<1 ppm). For these reasons and others\u2014such as its role as a suspected human carcinogen linked to nasal cancer and lung cancer 578, this germicide is excluded from Table 1. When it is used, , direct exposure to employees generally is limited; however, excessive exposures to formaldehyde have been documented for employees of renal transplant units 574, 579, and students in a gross anatomy laboratory 580. Formaldehyde is used in the health-care setting to prepare viral vaccines (e.g., poliovirus and influenza); as an embalming agent; and to preserve anatomic specimens; and historically has been used to sterilize surgical in struments, especially when mixed with ethanol. A 1997 survey found that formaldehyde was used for reprocessing hemodialyzers by 34% of U.S. hemodialysis centers\u2014a 60% decrease from 1983 249, 581. If used at room temperature, a concentration of 4% with a minimum exposure of 24 hours is required to disi nfect disposable hemodialyzers reused on the same patient 582, 583. Aqueous formaldehyde solutions (1%-2%) also have been used to disinfect the internal fluid pathways of dialysis machines 583. To minimize a potential health hazard to dialysis patients, the dialysis equipment must be thoroughly rinsed and tested for residual formaldehyde before use. Paraformaldehyde, a solid polymer of formal dehyde, can be vaporized by heat for the gaseous decontamination of laminar flow biologic safety cabi nets when maintenance work or filter changes require access to the sealed portion of the cabinet. Glutaraldehyde Overview. Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high- level disinfectant and chemical sterilant 107. Aqueous solutions of glutar aldehyde are acidic and generally in this state are not sporicidal. Only when the soluti on is \"activated\" (made alkali ne) by use of alkalinating agents to pH 7.5-8.5 does the solution become sporicidal . Once activated, these solutions have a shelf- life of minimally 14 days because of the polymerization of the glutar aldehyde molecules at alkaline pH levels. This polymerization blocks the active sites (aldehyde groups) of the glut araldehyde molecules that are responsible for its biocidal activity. Novel glutaraldehyde formulations (e.g., acid glutaraldehyde, stabilized alkaline glutaraldehyde) produced in the pas t 30 years have overcome the problem of rapid loss of activity (e.g., use-lif e 28-30 days) while generally maintaining excellent microbicidal activity 584-588. However, antimicrobial activity depends not only on age but also on use conditions, such as dilution and organic stress. Manufac turers' literature for t hese preparations suggests the neutral or alkaline glutaraldehydes possess micr obicidal and anticorrosion properties superior to 43Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 those of acid glutaraldehydes, and a few pub lished reports substantiate these claims 542, 589, 590. However, two studies found no difference in the microbicidal activity of alkaline and acid glutaraldehydes 73, 591. The use of glutaraldehyde-based solutions in health-care facilities is widespread because of their advantages, including excellent biocidal properties; activity in the presence of organic matter (20% bovine serum); and noncorrosive action to endoscopic equipment, thermometers, rubber, or plastic equipment (Tables 4 and 5). Mode of Action . The biocidal activity of glutaraldehyde results from its alkylation of sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups of microorganism s, which alters RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis. The mechanism of action of glutaraldehy des are reviewed extensively elsewhere 592, 593. Microbicidal Activity . The in vitro inactivation of microorganisms by glutaraldehydes has been extensively investigated and reviewed 592, 593. Several investigators showed that >2% aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde, buffered to pH 7.5-8.5 with sodium bicarbonate effectively killed vegetative bacteria in <2 minutes; M. tuberculosis , fungi, and viruses in <10 minutes; and spores of Bacillus and Clostridium species in 3 hours 542, 592-597. Spores of C. difficile are more rapidly killed by 2% glutaraldehyde than are spores of other species of Clostridium and Bacillus 79, 265, 266. Microorganisms with substantial resistance to glutaraldehyde have been reported, including some 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution us ed to store porcine prosthetic heart valves 604. Two percent alkaline glutaraldehyde solution inactivated 10 5 M. tuberculosis cells on the surface of penicylinders within 5 minutes at 18\u00baC 589. However, subsequent studies82 questioned the mycobactericidal prowess of glutaraldehydes. Two perc ent alkaline glutaraldehyde has slow action (20 to >30 minutes) against M. tuberculosis and compares unfavorably with alcohols, formaldehydes, iodine, and phenol 82. Suspensions of M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. gordonae were more resistant to inactivation by a 2% alkaline glut araldehyde (estimated time to complete inactivation: ~60 minutes) than were virulent M. tuberculosis (estimated time to complete inactivation ~25 minutes) 605. The rate of kill was directly proportional to the temper ature, and a standardized suspension of M. tuberculosis could not be sterilized within 10 minutes 84. An FDA-cleared chemical steril ant containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde uses increased temperature (35\u00baC) to reduce the time required to achieve high-level disinfection (5 minutes) 85, 606, but its use is limited to automatic endosc ope reprocessors equipped with a heater. In another study employing membrane filt ers for measurement of mycobacteri cidal activity of 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde, complete inactivation was achieved within 20 minutes at 20\u00baC when the test inoculum was 106 M. tuberculosis per membrane 81. Several investigators 55, 57, 73, 76, 80, 81, 84, 605 have demonstrated that glutaraldehyde solutions inactivate 2.4 to >5.0 log 10 of M. tuberculosis in 10 minutes (including multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis ) and 4.0-6.4 log 10 of M. tuberculosis in 20 minutes. On the basis of these data and other studies, 20 minutes at room tem perature is considered the minimum exposure time needed to reliably kill Mycobacteria and other vegetative bacteria with >2% glutaraldehyde 17, 19, 27, 57, 83, 94, 108, 111, 117-121, 607 . Glutaraldehyde is commonly diluted during use, and studies showed a glutaraldehyde concentration decline after a few days of use in an automatic endoscope washer 608, 609. The decline occurs because instruments are not thoroughly dried and water is carried in with the instrument, which increases the solution's volume and dilutes its effective concentration 610. This emphasizes the need to ensure that semicritical equipment is disinfected with an acceptable concentration of glutaraldehyde. Data suggest that 1.0%-1.5% glutaraldehyde is the minimum effective concentration for >2% glutaraldehyde solutions when used as a high-level disinfectant 76, 589, 590, 609. Chemical test strips or liquid chemical monitors 610, 611 are available for determining whether an effective concentration of glutaraldehyde is present despite repeated use and d ilution. The frequency of testing should be based on how frequently the solutions are used (e.g., used daily , test daily; used weekly, test before use; used 30 times per day, test each 10th use), but the strips should not be used to extend the use life beyond the expiration date. Data suggest the chemicals in the test strip deteriorate with time 612 and a 44Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 manufacturer's expiration date should be placed on the bottles. The bottle of test strips should be dated when opened and used for the period of time indicated on the bottle (e.g., 120 days). The results of test strip monitoring should be documented. The glutar aldehyde test kits have been preliminarily evaluated for accuracy and range 612 but the reliability has been questioned 613. To ensure the presence of minimum effective concentration of the high-level disinfectant, manufacturers of some chemical test strips recommend the use of quality-control procedures to ensure the strips perform properly. If the manufacturer of the chemical test strip recommends a quality-control procedure, users should comply with the manufacturer's recommendations. The c oncentration should be considered unacceptable or unsafe when the test indicates a dilution below the product's minimum effective concentration (MEC) (generally to < 1.0%-1.5% glutaraldehyde) by t he indicator not changing color. A 2.0% glutaraldehyde-7.05% phenol-1.20% s odium phenate when diluted 1:16 is not recommended as a high- level disinfectant because it lacks bactericidal activity in the presence of organic matter and lacks tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and sporicidal activity 49, 55, 56, 71, 73-79, 614. In December 1991, EPA issued an order to stop the sale of all batches of this product because of efficacy data showing the product is not effective against spores and possibly other microorganisms or inanimate objects as claimed on the label 615. FDA has cleared a glutaraldehyde-phenol/ phenate concentrate as a high-level disinfectant that contains 1. 12% glutaraldehyde with 1.93% phenol/ phenate at its use concentration. FDA cleared glutaraldehyde st erilants that contain 2.4%-3.4% glutaraldehyde are used undiluted 606. Uses. Glutaraldehyde is used most commonly as a high-level disinfectant for medical equipment such as endoscopes 69, 107, 504, spirometry tubing, dialyzers 616, transducers, anesthesia and respiratory therapy equipment 617, hemodialysis proportioning and dialysate delivery systems 249, 618, and reuse of laparoscopic disposable plastic trocars 619. Glutaraldehyde is noncorrosive to metal and does not damage lensed instruments, rubber. or plastics. Glutaraldehyde should not be used for cleaning noncritical surfaces because it is too toxic and expensive. Colitis believed caused by glutaraldehyde ex posure from residual disinfecting solution in endoscope solution channels has been reported and is preventable by careful endoscope rinsing 318, 620- 630. One study found that residual glutaraldehyde le vels were higher and more variable after manual disinfection (<0.2 mg/L to 159.5 mg/L) than after automatic disinfection (0.2-6.3 Similarly, keratopathy and corneal decompensation were caused by ophthalmic instrument s that were inadequately rinsed after soaking in 2% glutaraldehyde 632, 633. Healthcare personnel can be exposed to elev ated levels of glutaraldehyde vapor when equipment is processed in poorly ventilated rooms, when spills occur, when glutaraldehyde solutions are activated or changed,634, or when open immersion baths are used. Acute or chronic exposure can result in skin irritation or dermatitis, mucous membrane i rritation (eye, nose, mouth), or pulmonary symptoms 318, 635-639. Epistaxis, allergic cont act dermatitis, asthma, and rhinitis also have been reported in healthcare workers exposed to glutaraldehyde 636, 640-647. Glutaraldehyde exposure should be monitored to ensure a safe work environment. Testing can be done by four techniques: a silica gel tube/gas ch cassette/high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an ultraviolet (UV) detector, a passive badge/HPLC, or a handheld glutaraldehyde air monitor 648. The silica gel tube and the DNPH-impregnated cassette are suitable for monitoring the 0.05 ppm ceiling limit. The passive badge, with a 0.02 ppm lim it of detection, is considered marginal at the Americal Council of Governmental Industrial Hygi enists (ACGIH) ceiling level. The ceiling level is considered too close to the glutaraldehyde meter's 0. 03 ppm limit of detection to provide confidence in the readings 648. ACGIH does not require a specific moni toring schedule for glutaraldehyde; however, a monitoring schedule is needed to ensure the level is le ss than the ceiling limit. For example, monitoring 45Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 should be done initially to determine glutaraldehyde le vels, after procedural or equipment changes, and in response to worker complaints 649. In the absence of an OSHA permissible exposure limit, if the glutaraldehyde level is higher than the ACGIH ceiling limit of 0.05 ppm, corrective action and repeat monitoring would be prudent 649. Engineering and work-practice controls that can be used to resolve these problems include ducted exhaust hoods, air systems that provide 7-15 air exchanges per hour, ductless fume hoods with absorbents for the glutaraldehyde vapor , tight-fitting lids on immersion baths, personal protection (e.g., nitrile or butyl rubber gloves but not natural latex gloves, goggles) to minimize skin or mucous membrane contact, and automated endoscope processors 7, 650. If engineering controls fail to maintain levels below the ceiling limit, institutions can consider the use of respirators (e.g., a half-face respirator with organic vapor cartridge 640 or a type \"C\" supplied air respirator wi th a full facepiece operated in a positive pressure mode) 651. In general, engineering controls are prefe rred over work-practice and administrative controls because they do not require active participation by the health-care worker. Even though enforcement of the OSHA ceiling limit was suspended in 1993 by the U.S. Court of Appeals 577, limiting employee exposure to 0.05 ppm (according to ACGIH) is prudent because, at this level, glutaraldehyde can irritate the eyes, throat, and nose 318, 577, 639, 652. If glutaraldehyde disposal through the sanitary sewer system is restricted, sodium bi sulfate can be used to neutralize the glutaraldehyde and make it safe for disposal. Hydrogen Peroxide Overview. The literature contains several accounts of the properties, germicidal effectiveness, and potential uses for stabilized hydrogen peroxide in the health-care setting. Published reports ascribe good germicidal activity to hydrogen peroxide and attest to its bactericidal, virucidal, sporicidal, and fungicidal properties 653-655. (Tables 4 and 5) The FDA website lis ts cleared liquid chemical sterilants and high-level disinfectants containing hydrogen peroxide and their cleared contact conditions. Mode of Action. Hydrogen peroxide works by producing destr uctive hydroxyl free radicals that can attack membrane lipids, DNA, and other essent ial cell components. Catalase, produced by aerobic organisms and facultative anaerobes t hat possess cytochrome system s, can protect cells from metabolically produced hydrogen peroxide by degradi ng hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. This defense is overwhelmed by the c oncentrations used for disinfection 653, 654. Microbicidal Activity . Hydrogen peroxide is active against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and spores 78, 654. A 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide demonstrated bactericidal and virucidal activity in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal activity in 5 minutes 656. Bactericidal effectiveness and stability of hydrogen peroxide in urine has been demonstrated against a variety of health-care-a ssociated pathogens; organisms with high cellular catalase activity (e.g., aureus , S. marcescens , and Proteus mirabilis ) required 30-60 minutes of exposure to 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for a 108 reduction in cell counts, whereas organisms with lower catalase activity (e.g., E. coli , Streptococcus species, and Pseudomonas species) required only 15 minutes' exposure 657. In an investigation of 3%, 10% , and 15% hydrogen peroxide for reducing spacecraft bacterial populati ons, a complete kill of 106 spores (i.e., Bacillus species) occurred with a 10% concentration and a 60-minute exposure time. A 3% concentration for 150 minutes killed 106 spores in six of seven exposure trials 658. A 10% hydrogen peroxide solution resulted in a 103 decrease in B. atrophaeus spores, and a >105 decrease when tested against 13 ot her pathogens in 30 minutes at 20\u00baC 659, 660. A 3.0% hydrogen peroxide solution was ineffe ctive against VRE after 3 and 10 minutes exposure times 661 and caused only a 2-log 10 reduction in the number of Acanthamoeba cysts in approximately 2 hours 662. A 7% stabilized hydrogen peroxide proved to be sporicidal (6 hours of exposure), mycobactericidal (20 minutes), fungici dal (5 minutes) at full strength, vi rucidal (5 minutes) and bactericidal (3 minutes) at a 1:16 dilution when a quantitative carrier test was used 655. The 7% solution of hydrogen peroxide, tested after 14 days of stress (in the form of germ-loaded carriers and respiratory therapy equipment), was sporicidal (>7 log 10 reduction in 6 hours), mycobactericidal (>6.5 log 10 reduction in 25 46Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 minutes), fungicidal (>5 log 10 reduction in 20 minutes), bactericidal (>6 log 10 reduction in 5 minutes) and virucidal (5 log 10 reduction in 5 minutes) 663. Synergistic sporicidal effe cts were observed when spores were exposed to a combination of hydrogen peroxide (5.9%-23.6%) and peracetic acid 664. Other studies demonstrated the antiviral activity of hydrogen peroxide against rhinovirus 665. The time required for inactivating three serotypes of rhinovirus using a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution was 6-8 minutes; this time increased with decreasing concentrations ( 18-20 minutes at 1.5%, 50-60 minutes at 0.75%). Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide from 6% to 25% show promise as chemical sterilants. The product marketed as a sterilant is a premixed, r eady-to-use chemical that contains 7.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.85% phosphoric acid (to maintain a low pH) 69. The mycobactericidal activity of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide has been corroborated in a st udy showing the inactivation of >105 multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis after a 10-minute exposure 666. Thirty minutes were required for >99.9% inactivation of poliovirus and HAV 667. Three percent and 6% hydrogen peroxide were unable to inactivate HAV in 1 minute in a carrier test 58. When the effectiveness of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide at 10 minutes was compared with 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde at 20 minutes in manual disinfection of endoscopes, no significant difference in germicidal activity was observed 668. ). No complaints were received from the nursing or medical staff regarding odor or toxici ty. In one study, 6% hydrogen peroxide (unused product was 7.5%) was more effective in the high-level di sinfection of flexible endoscopes than was the 2% glutaraldehyde solution 456. A new, rapid-acting 13.4% hydrogen per oxide formulation (that is not yet FDA-cleared) has demonstrated spor icidal, mycobactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal efficacy. Manufacturer data demonstrate that this solution sterilizes in 30 minutes and provides high-level disinfection in 5 minutes 669. This product has not been used long enough to evaluate material compatibility to endoscopes and other semicritical devices, and further assessment by instrument manufacturers is needed. Under normal conditions, hydrogen peroxide is ex tremely stable when properly stored (e.g., in dark containers). The decomposition or loss of potency in small containers is less than 2% per year at ambient temperatures 670. Uses. Commercially available 3% hydrogen peroxide is a stable and effective disinfectant when used on inanimate surfaces. It has been used in concent rations from 3% to 6% for disinfecting soft contact lenses (e.g., 3% 653, 671, 672, 673, fabrics 397, endoscopes 456. peroxide was effective in spot-d isinfecting fabrics in patients' rooms 397. Corneal damage from a hydrogen peroxide-soaked tonom eter tip that was not properly rinsed has been reported 674. Hydrogen peroxide also has been instilled in to urinary drainage bags in an attempt to eliminate the bag as a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination 675. Although the instillation of hydrogen peroxide into the bag reduced mi crobial contamination of the bag, this procedure did not reduce the incidence of catheter-associated bacteriuria 675. A chemical irritation resembling pseudomem branous colitis caused by either 3% hydrogen peroxide or a 2% glutaraldehyde has been reported 621. An epidemic of pseudomembrane-like enteritis and colitis in seven patients in a gastrointesti nal endoscopy unit also has been associated with inadequate rinsing of 3% hydr ogen peroxide from the endoscope 676. As with other chemical sterilants, diluti on of the hydrogen peroxide must be monitored by regularly testing the minimum effective concentration (i.e., 7.5%-6.0%). Compatibility testing by Olympus America of the 7.5% hydrogen per oxide found both cosmetic changes (e.g., discoloration of black anodized metal finishes) 69 and functional changes with the te sted endoscopes (Olympus, written communication, October 15, 1999). Iodophors Overview. Iodine solutions or tinctures long have been used by health professionals primarily as antiseptics on skin or tissue. Iodophors, on the other hand, have been used both as antiseptics and 47Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 disinfectants. FDA has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or hi gh-level disinfectants with iodophors as the main active ingredient. An iodophor is a combination of iodine and a solubilizing agent or carrier; the resulting complex provides a sustained-release re servoir of iodine and releases small amounts of free iodine in aqueous solution. The best-known and mo st widely used iodophor is povidone-iodine, a compound of polyvinylpyrrolidone with iodine. This product and other iodophors retain the germicidal efficacy of iodine but unlike iodine generally are nonsta ining and relatively free of toxicity and irritancy 677, 678. Several reports that documented intrinsic microbial contamination of antiseptic formulations of povidone-iodine and poloxamer-iodine 679-681 caused a reappraisal of the chemistry and use of iodophors682. \"Free\" iodine (I 2) contributes to the bactericidal ac tivity of iodophors and dilutions of iodophors demonstrate more rapid bactericidal action than does a full-strength povidone-iodine solution. The reason for the observation that dilution increases bactericidal activity is unclear, but dilution of povidone-iodine might weaken the iodine linkage to the carrier polymer with an accompanying increase of free iodine in solution 680. Therefore, iodophors must be diluted according to the manufacturers' directions to achieve antimicrobial activity. Mode of Action. Iodine can penetrate the cell wall of microorganisms quickly, and the lethal effects are believed to result from disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesis. Microbicidal Activity. Published reports on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of iodophors demonstrate that iodophors are bactericidal, mycobactericidal, and virucidal but can require prolonged contact times to kill certain fungi and bacterial spores 14, 71-73, 290, 683-686. Three brands of povidone-iodine solution have demonstrated more rapi d kill (seconds to minutes) of S. aureus and M. chelonae at a 1:100 dilution than did the stock solution 683. The virucidal activity of 75-150 ppm available iodine was demonstrated against seven viruses 72. Other investigators have ques tioned the efficacy of iodophors against poliovirus in the presence of organic matter 685and rotavirus SA-11 in distilled or tapwater 290. Manufacturers' data demonstrate that commercia l iodophors are they are virucidal, and bacte ricidal at their recommended use-dilution. Uses. Besides their use as an antiseptic, iodophors have been used for disinfecting blood culture bottles and medical equipment, such as hydrotherapy tanks, thermometers, and endoscopes. Antiseptic iodophors are not suitable for use as har d-surface disinfectants because of concentration differences. Iodophors formulated as antiseptics contain less free iodine than do those formulated as disinfectants 376. Iodine or iodine-based antiseptics shoul d not be used on silicone catheters because they can adversely affect the silicone tubing 687. Ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) Overview. Ortho-phthalaldehyde is a high-level disinfectant that received FDA clearance in October 1999. It contains 0.55% 1,2-benzenedicar boxaldehyde (OPA). OPA solution is a clear, pale- blue liquid with a pH of 7.5. (Tables 4 and 5) Mode of Action . Preliminary studies on the mode of action of OPA suggest that both OPA and glutaraldehyde interact with amino acids, proteins , and microorganisms. However, OPA is a less potent cross-linking agent. This is compensated for by the li pophilic aromatic nature of OPA that is likely to assist its uptake through the outer layers of mycobacteria and gram-negative bacteria 688-690. OPA appears to kill spores by blocking the spore germination process 691. Microbicidal Activity . Studies have demonstrated excellent microbicidal activity in vitro 69, 100, 271, 400, 692-703. For example, OPA has superior mycobactericidal activity (5-log 10 reduction in 5 minutes) to glutaraldehyde. The mean times required to produce a 6-log 10 reduction for M. bovis using 0.21% OPA was 6 minutes, compared with 32 mi nutes using 1.5% glutaraldehyde 693. OPA showed good activity against the mycobacteria tested, including the glutar aldehyde-resistant strains, but 0.5% OPA was not sporicidal with 270 minutes of expos ure. Increasing the pH from its unadjusted level (about 6.5) to pH 8 improved the sporicidal activity of OPA 694. The level of biocidal activity was directly related to the 48Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 temperature. A greater than 5-log 10 reduction of B. atrophaeus spores was observed in 3 hours at 35\u00baC, than in 24 hours at 20\u00baC. Also, with an exposure time <5 minutes, biocidal activity decreased with increasing serum concentration. However, effica cy did not differ when the exposure time was >10 minutes 697. In addition, OPA is effective (>5-log 10 reduction) against a wide range of microorganisms, including glutaraldehyde-re sistant mycobacteria and B. atrophaeus spores 694. The influence of laboratory adaptati on of test strains, such as P. aeruginosa , to 0.55% OPA has been evaluated. Resistant and multiresis tant strains increased substantially in susceptibility to OPA after laboratory adaptation (log 10 reduction factors increased by 0.54 and 0.91 for resistant and multiresistant strains, respectively) 704. Other studies have found nat urally occurring cells of P. aeurginosa were more resistant to a variety of disinfec tants than were subcultured cells 705. Uses. OPA has several potential advantages over gl utaraldehyde. It has excellent stability over a wide pH range (pH 3-9), is not a known i rritant to the eyes and nasal passages 706, does not require exposure monitoring, has a barely perceptible odor, and requires no activation. OPA, like glutaraldehyde, has excellent material compatibility. A potential dis advantage of OPA is that it stains proteins gray (including unprotected skin) and t hus must be handled with caution 69. However, skin staining would indicate improper handling that requires additional tr aining and/or personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, eye and mouth protection, and fluid-resistant gowns). OPA residues remaining on inadequately water-rinsed transesophageal echo probes can stain the patient's mouth 707. Meticulous cleaning, using the correct OPA exposure time (e.g., 12 minutes) and copious rinsing of the probe with water should eliminate this problem. The results of one study pr ovided a basis for a recommendation that rinsing of instruments disinfected with OPA will require at leas t 250 mL of water per channel to reduce the chemical residue to a level that will not compromi se patient or staff safety (<1 ppm) 708. Personal protective equipment should be worn when contaminated instruments, equipment, and chemicals are handled 400. In addition, equipment must be thoroughly rinsed to prev ent discoloration of a patient's skin or mucous membrane. In April 2004, the manufacturer of OPA dissemi nated information to users about patients who reportedly experienced an anaphylaxis-like reacti on after cystoscopy where the scope had been reprocessed using OPA. Of approximately 1 milli on urologic procedures performed using instruments reprocessed using OPA, 24 cases (17 cases in the United States, six in Japan, one in the United Kingdom) of anaphylaxis-like reactions have been reported after repeated cystoscopy (typically after four to nine treatments). Preventive measures include re moval of OPA residues by thorough rinsing and not using OPA for reprocessing urologic instrumentation used to treat patients with a history of bladder cancer (Nevine Erian, personal communication, June 4, 2004; Product Notification, Advanced Sterilization Products, April 23, 2004) 709. A few OPA clinical studies are available. In a clinical-use study, OPA exposure of 100 endoscopes for 5 minutes resulted in a >5-log 10 reduction in bacterial load. Furthermore, OPA was effective over a 14-day use cycle 100. Manufacturer data show that O PA will last longer in an automatic endoscope reprocessor before reaching its MEC limit (MEC after 82 cycles) than will glutaraldehyde (MEC after 40 cycles) 400. High-pressure liquid chromatography confirmed that OPA levels are maintained above 0.3% for at least 50 cycles 706, 710. OPA must be disposed in accordance with local and state regulations. If OPA disposal through the sani tary sewer system is restricted, glycine (25 grams/gallon) can be used to neutralize t he OPA and make it safe for disposal. The high-level disinfectant label claims for OPA solution at 20 \u00baC vary worldwide (e.g., 5 minutes in Europe, Asia, and Latin America; 10 minutes in Canada and Australia; and 12 minutes in the United States). These label claims differ worldwide bec ause of differences in the test methodology and requirements for licensure. In an automated endosc ope reprocessor with an FDA-cleared capability to maintain solution temperatures at 25\u00baC, the contact time for OPA is 5 minutes. 49Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Peracetic Acid Overview. Peracetic, or peroxyacetic, acid is characterized by rapid action against all microorganisms. Special advantages of peracetic acid are that it lacks harmful decomposition products (i.e., acetic acid, water, oxygen, hydrogen per oxide), enhances removal of organic material 711, and leaves no residue. It remains effective in the pres ence of organic matter and is sporicidal even at low temperatures (Tables 4 and 5). Peracetic acid can corrode copper, brass, bronze, plain steel, and galvanized iron but these effects can be reduced by additives and pH modifications. It is considered unstable, particularly when diluted; for example, a 1% solution loses half its strength through hydrolysis in 6 days, whereas 40% peracetic acid loses 1%-2% of its active ingredients per month 654. Mode of Action . Little is known about the mechanism of action of peracetic acid, but it is believed to function similarly to other oxidizing agents\u2014 that is, it denatures proteins, disrupts the cell wall permeability, and oxidizes sulfhydryl and sulfur bonds in proteins, enzymes , and other metabolites 654. Microbicidal Activity . Peracetic acid will inactivate gr am-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and yeasts in <5 minutes at <100 ppm. In the presence of organic matter, 200-500 ppm is required. For viruses, the dosage range is wide ( 12-2250 ppm), with poliovirus inactivated in yeast extract in with 1,500-2,250 ppm. In one study , 3.5% peracetic acid was ineffective against HAV after 1-minute exposure using a carrier test 58. Peracetic acid (0.26%) was effective (log 10 reduction factor >5) against all test strains of mycobacteria ( M. tuberculosis, M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum ) within 20-30 minutes in the presence or absence of an organic load 607, 712. With bacterial spores, 500-10,000 ppm (0.05%-1%) inactivate s spores in 15 seconds to 30 minutes using a spore suspension test 654, 659, 713-715. Uses. An automated machine using peracetic acid to chemically sterilize medical (e.g., endoscopes, arthroscopes), surgical, and dental instruments is used in the United States716-718. As previously noted, dental handpieces should be steam sterilized. The st erilant, 35% peracetic acid, is diluted to 0.2% with filtered water at 50\u00baC. Simulated-use trials have dem onstrated excellent microbicidal activity 111, 718-722, and three clinical trials have demonstrated bot h excellent microbial killing and no clinical failures leading to infection90, 723, 724. The high efficacy of the syst em was demonstrated in a comparison of the efficacies of the system wi th that of ethylene oxide. Only t he peracetic acid system completely killed 6 log 10 of M. chelonae, E. faecalis, and B. atrophaeus spores with both an organic and inorganic challenge722. An investigation that compared the co sts, performance, and maintenance of urologic endoscopic equipment processed by high-level disinf ection (with glutaraldehyde) with those of the peracetic acid system reported no c linical differences between the two sy stems. However, the use of this system led to higher costs than the high-level disinf ection, including costs for processing ($6.11 vs. $0.45 per cycle), purchasing and training ($24,845 vs. $16), installation ($5,800 vs. $0), and endoscope repairs vs. $445) 90. Furthermore, three clusters of infe ction using the peracetic acid automated endoscope reprocessor were linked to inadequately processed bronchoscopes when inappropriate channel connectors were used with the system 725. These clusters highlight the importance of training, proper model-specific endoscope connector system s, and quality-control procedures to ensure compliance with endoscope manufacturer recommendati ons and professional organization guidelines. An alternative high-level disinfectant available in the United Kingdom contains 0.35% peracetic acid. Although this product is rapidly effect ive against a broad range of microorganisms 466, 726, 727, it tarnishes the metal of endoscopes and is unstable, resulting in only a 24-hour use life 727. Peracetic Acid and Hydrogen Peroxide Overview. Two chemical sterilants are available that contain peracetic acid plus hydrogen peroxide (i.e., 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide peracetic acid 7.35% hy peroxide (Tables 4 and 5). Microbicidal Activity. The bactericidal properties of per acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide have been demonstrated 728. Manufacturer data demonstrated this combination of peracetic acid and 50Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 hydrogen peroxide inactivated all microorganisms except bacterial spores within 20 minutes. The 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide product effectively inac tivated glutaraldehyde-resistant mycobacteria729. Uses. The combination of peracetic acid hy drogen peroxide has been used for disinfecting hemodialyzers 730. The percentage of dialysis centers us ing a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectant for reprocessing dialyzers increased from 5% in 1983 to 56% in 1997249. Olympus America does not endorse use of 0.08% peracet ic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen perox ide (Olympus America, personal communication, April 15, 1998) on any Olympus endoscope because of cosmetic and functional damage and will not assume liability for chemical damage result ing from use of this product. This product is not currently available. FDA has cleared a newer chemic al sterilant with 0.23% peracetic acid and 7.35% hydrogen peroxide (Tables 4 and 5). After testing the 7.35% hydrogen peroxide and 0.23% peracetic acid product, Olympus America concluded it was not compatib le with the company's flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes; this conclusion was based on immersion st udies where the test insertion tubes had failed because of swelling and loosening of the black polymer layer of the tube (Olympus America, personal communication, September 13, 2000). Phenolics Overview. Phenol has occupied a prominent place in t he field of hospital disinfection since its initial use as a germicide by Lister in his pioneering work on antiseptic surgery. In the past 30 years, however, work has concentrated on the numerous phenol derivatives or phenolics and their antimicrobial properties. Phenol derivatives originate when a f unctional group (e.g., alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, halogen) replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring. Two phenol derivatives commonly found as constituents of hospita l disinfectants are ortho-phenylphenol and ortho-benzyl- para-chlorophenol. The antimicrobial properties of these compounds and many other phenol derivatives are much improved over those of the parent chemical. Phenolics are absorbed by porous materials, and the residual disinfectant can irritate tissue. In 1970, depigmentation of the skin was reported to be caused by phenolic germicidal detergents containing para-tertiary butylphenol and para-tertiary of Action . In high concentrations, phenol acts as a gross protoplasmic poison, penetrating and disrupting the cell wall and precipitating the cell proteins. Low concentrations of phenol and higher molecular-weight phenol derivatives cause bac terial death by inactivation of essential enzyme systems and leakage of essential metabolites from the cell wall 732. Microbicidal Activity . Published reports on the antimicr obial efficacy of commonly used phenolics showed they were bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and tuberculocidal 14, 61, 71, 73, 227, 416, 573, 732- 738. One study demonstrated little or a 12% ortho-phenylphenol failed to inactivate any of the three hydrophilic viruses after a 10-minute exposure time, although 5% phenol was lethal for these viruses 72. A (15% ort ho-phenylphenol and 6.3% par a-tertiary-amylphenol) inactivated all but one of 11 fungi tested 71. Manufacturers' data using the standardized AOAC methods demonstrate that commercial phenolics are not sporicidal but are tuberculocidal , fungicidal, virucidal, and bactericidal at their recommended use-dilution. Attempts to substantiate the bactericidal l abel claims of phenolics using the AOAC Use-Dilution Method occasionally have failed 416, 737. However, results from these same studies have varied dramatically among laborat ories testing identical products. Uses. Many phenolic germicides are EPA-registered as disinfectants for use on environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside tables, bedrails, and labor atory surfaces) and noncritical medical devices. Phenolics are not FDA-cleared as high-level disinfectants for use with semicritical items but could be used to preclean or decontaminate critical and semicrit ical devices before terminal sterilization or high- 51Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 level disinfection. The use of phenolics in nurseries has been questi oned because of hyperbilirubinemia in infants placed in bassinets where phenolic detergents were used 739. In addition, bilirubin levels were reported to increase in phenolic-exposed infants, compared with nonphenolic-exposed infants, when the phenolic was prepared according to the manufacturers' recommended dilution 740. If phenolics are used to clean nursery floors, they must be diluted as re commended on the product label. Phenolics (and other disinfectants) should not be used to clean infant bassinets and incubators while occupied. If phenolics are used to terminally clean infant bassinets and incubat ors, the surfaces should be rinsed thoroughly with water and dried before reuse of infant bassinets and incubators 17. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Overview. The quaternary ammonium compounds are wi dely used as disinfectants. Health- care-associated infections have been reported fr om contaminated quaternary ammonium compounds used to disinfect patient-care supplies or equipmen t, such as cystoscopes or cardiac catheters 741, 742. The quaternaries are good cleaning agents, but high water hardness 743 and materials such as cotton and gauze pads can make them less microbicidal because of insoluble precipitates or cotton and gauze pads absorb the active ingredients, respectively. One study showed a significant decline (~40%-50% lower at 1 hour) in the concentration of quaternaries released when cotton rags or cellulose-based wipers were used in the open-bucket system, compared with t he nonwoven spunlace wipers in the closed-bucket system 744 As with several other disinfectants (e.g ., phenolics, iodophors) gram-negative bacteria can survive or grow in them 404. Chemically, the quaternaries are organically s ubstituted ammonium compounds in which the nitrogen atom has a valence of 5, four of the substituent radicals (R1-R4) are alky l or heterocyclic radicals of a given size or chain length, and the fifth (X-) is a halide, sulfate, or similar radical 745. Each compound exhibits its own antimicrobial characteristi cs, hence the search for one compound with outstanding antimicrobial properties. Some of the chemical names of quater nary ammonium compounds used in healthcare are The new er quaternary ammonium compounds (i.e., fourth generation), referred to as twin-chain or dialkyl ammonium bromide), purportedly remain active in hard water and are tolerant of anionic residues 746. A few case reports have documented occupati onal asthma as a result of exposure to benzalkonium chloride 747. Mode of Action. The bactericidal action of the quaternaries has been attributed to the inactivation of energy-producing enzymes, denaturation of essential cell proteins, and disruption of the cell membrane746. Evidence exists that suppor ts these and other possibilities 745 748. Microbicidal Activity. Results from manufacturers' data sheets and from published scientific literature indicate that the quaternaries sold as hospi tal disinfectants are generally fungicidal, bactericidal, and virucidal against lipophilic (enveloped) viruses; they are not sporicidal and not tuberculocidal or virucidal against hydrophilic (nonenveloped) viruses14, 54-56, 58, 59, 61, 71, 73, 186, 297, 748, 749. The poor mycobactericidal activities of quat ernary ammonium compounds have been demonstrated 55, 73. Quaternary ammonium compounds (as well as 70% isopropyl alcohol, phenolic, and a chlorine- containing wipe effectively (>95%) remove and/or vancomycin-resistant Entercoccus P. aeruginosa ) from computer keyboards with a 5-second application time. No functional damage or cosmetic changes occurred to the computer keyboards after 300 applicati ons of the disinfectants 45. Attempts to reproduce the manufacturers' bactericidal and tuberculocidal claims using the AOAC 52Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 tests with a limited number of quaternary a mmonium compounds occasionally have failed 73, 416, 737. However, test results have varied extensivel y among laboratories testing identical products 416, 737. Uses. The quaternaries commonly are used in ordi nary environmental sanitation of noncritical surfaces, such as floors, furniture, and walls . EPA-registered quaternary ammonium compounds are appropriate to use for disinfecting medical equipment that contacts intact skin (e.g., blood pressure cuffs). 53Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 MISCELLANEOUS INACTIVATING AGENTS Other Germicides Several compounds have antimicrobial acti vity but for various reasons have not been incorporated into the armamentarium of health-care disinfectants. and the Tego disinfectant s. Two authoritative references examine these agents in detail 16, 412. A peroxygen-containing formulation had ma rked bactericidal action when used as a 1% weight/volume solution and virucidal activity at 3% 49, but did not have mycobactericidal activity at concentrations of 2.3% and 4% and exposur e times ranging from 30 to 120 minutes 750. It also required 20 hours to kill B. atrophaeus spores 751. A powder-based peroxygen compound for disinfecting contaminated spill was strongly and rapidly bactericidal 752. In preliminary studies, nanoemulsions (com posed of detergents and lipids in water) showed activity against vegetative bacteria, enveloped viruses and Candida . This product represents a potential agent for use as a topical biocidal agent. 753-755. New disinfectants that require fu rther evaluation include glucoprotamin 756, tertiary amines 703. and a light-activated antimicrobial coating 757. Several other disinfection technologies might have potential applications in the healthcare setting 758. Metals as Microbicides Comprehensive reviews of antisepsis 759, disinfection421, and anti-infective chemotherapy 760 barely mention the antimicrobial activity of heavy metals761, 762. Nevertheless, the anti-infective activity of some heavy metals has been known since antiquity. Heavy metals such as silver have been used for prophylaxis of conjunctivitis of the newborn, topi cal therapy for burn wounds, and bonding to indwelling catheters, and the use of heavy metals as antis eptics or disinfectants is again being explored 763. Inactivation of bacteria on stainless steel surfaces by zeolite ceramic coatings containing silver and zinc ions has also been demonstrated 764, 765. Metals such as silver, iron, and copper could be used for environm ental control, disinfection of water, or reusable medical devices or incorporated into medical devices (e.g., intravascular catheters) 400, 761-763, 766-770. A comparative evaluation of six disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity demonstrated that only the silver disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa 763. Preliminary data suggest metals are effective against a wide variety of microorganisms. Clinical uses of other hea vy metals include copper-8-quinolinolate as a (e.g., thimerosal [currently being removed from vaccines]) in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 762. Ultraviolet Radiation (UV) The wavelength of UV radiation ranges from 328 nm to 210 nm (3280 A to 2100 A). Its maximum bactericidal effect occurs at 240-280 nm. Mercury vapor lamps emit more than 90% of their radiation at 253.7 nm, which is near the maximum microbicidal activity 775. Inactivation of microorganisms results from destruction of nucleic acid through induction of thymine dimers. UV radiation has been employed in the disinfection of drinking water 776, air 775, titanium implants 777, and contact lenses778. Bacteria and viruses are more easily killed by UV light than are bacterial spores 775. UV radiation has several potential applications, but unfortunately its germicidal effe ctiveness and use is influenced by organic matter; wavelength; type of suspension; te mperature; type of microorganism; and UV intensity, which is affected by distance and dirty tubes779. The application of UV radiation in the health-care environment (i.e., 54Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 operating rooms, isolation rooms, and biologic safety cabinets) is limited to destruction of airborne organisms or inactivation of microorganisms on surfac es. The effect of UV radiation on postoperative wound infections was investigated in a double-blind, r andomized study in five university medical centers. After following 14,854 patients over a 2-year period, the investigators reported the overall wound infection rate was unaffected by UV radiation, although post operative infection in the \"refined clean\" surgical procedures decreased significantly (3.8%-2.9%) 780. No data support the use of UV lamps in isolation rooms, and this practice has caused at least one epidemic of UV-induced skin erythema and keratoconjunctivitis in hospital patients and visitors 781. Pasteurization Pasteurization is not a sterilization process; its purpose is to destroy all pathogenic microorganisms. However, pasteurization does not des troy bacterial spores. The time-temperature relation for hot-water pasteurization is generally ~70oC (158oF) for 30 minutes. The water temperature and time should be monitored as part of a quality-assurance program 782. Pasteurization of respiratory therapy 783, 784 and anesthesia equipment 785is a recognized alternative to chemical disinfection. The efficacy of this process has been tested using an i noculum that the authors believed might simulate contamination by an infected patien t. Use of a large inoculum (107) of P. aeruginosa or Acinetobacte r calcoaceticus in sets of respiratory tubing before pr ocessing demonstrated that machine-assisted chemical processing was more efficient than machine- assisted pasteurization with a disinfection failure rate of 6% and 83%, respectively 783. Other investigators found hot water disinfection to be effective (inactivation factor >5 log 10) against multiple bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria, for disinfecting reusable anesthesia or and washer-disinfectors are autom ated and closed equipment that clean and disinfect objects from bedpans and washbowls to surgical instruments and anesthesia tubes. Items such as bedpans and urinals can be cleaned and disinfected in flushi ng-disinfectors. They have a short cycle of a few minutes. They clean by flushing with warm water, possibly with a detergent, and then disinfect by flushing the items with hot water or with steam. Be cause this machine empties, cleans, and disinfects, manual cleaning is eliminated, fewer disposable it ems are needed, and fewer chemical germicides are used. A microbiologic evaluation of one washer/dis infector demonstrated complete inactivation of suspensions of E. faecalis or poliovirus 787. Other studies have shown that strains of Enterococcus faecium can survive the British Standard for heat disinfection of bedpans (80\u00baC for 1 minute). The significance of this finding with reference to the pot ential for enterococci to survive and disseminate in the health-care environment is debatable 788-790. These machines are available and used in many European countries. Surgical instruments and anesthesia equipment ar e more difficult to clean. They are run in washer-disinfectors on a longer cycle of approximat ely 20-30 minutes with a detergent. These machines also disinfect by hot water at approximately 90 \u00baC 791. 55Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR DISINFECTANTS AND STERILANTS Before using the guidance provided in this docum ent, health-care workers should be aware of the federal laws and regulations that govern the sale, distribution, and use of disinf ectants and sterilants. In particular, health-care workers need to know what r equirements pertain to them when they apply these products. Finally, they should understand the relative roles of EPA, FDA, and CDC so the context for the guidance provided in this document is clear. EPA and FDA In the United States, chemical germicides formulat ed as sanitizers, disinfectants, or sterilants are regulated in interstate commerce by the Antimicrobi als Division, Office of Pesticides Program, EPA, under the authority of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947, as amended 792. Under FIFRA, any substance or mixture of substances in tended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate any pest (including microorganisms but excluding those in or on living humans or animals) must be registered before sale or distribution. To obtain a registration, a manufacturer must submit specific data about the safety and effectivene ss of each product. For example, EPA requires manufacturers of sanitizers, disinfec tants, or chemical sterilants to te st formulations by using accepted methods for microbiocidal activity, stability, and toxicity to animals and humans. The manufacturers submit these data to EPA along with proposed l abeling. If EPA concludes the product can be used without causing \"unreasonable adverse effects,\" then the product and its labeling are registered, and the manufacturer can sell and distribute the product in the United States. FIFRA also requires users of products to follow explicitly the labeling directions on each product. The following standard statement appears on all labels under the \"Directions for Use\" heading: \"It is a violation of federal law to use this product in a m anner inconsistent with its labeling.\" This statement means a health-care worker must follow the safety precautions and use directions on the labeling of each registered product. Failure to follow the specified use-d ilution, contact time, method of application, or any other condition of use is considered a misuse of t he product and potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA. In general, EPA regulates disinfectants and ster ilants used on environmental surfaces, and not those used on critical or semicritical medical devic es; the latter are regulated by FDA. In June 1993, FDA and EPA issued a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" that divided responsibility for review and surveillance of chemical germicides between the two agencies. U nder the agreement, FDA regulates liquid chemical sterilants used on critical and semicritical devices , and EPA regulates disinfectants used on noncritical surfaces and gaseous sterilants 793. In 1996, Congress passed the F ood Quality Protection Act (FQPA). This act amended FIFRA in regard to several types of products regulated by both EPA and FDA. One provision of FQPA removed regulation of liquid chem ical sterilants used on critical and semicritical medical devices from EPA's jurisdiction, and it now rests solely with FDA 792, 794. EPA continues to register nonmedical chemical sterilants. FDA and EPA have considered the impact of FQPA, and in January 2000, FDA published its final guidance doc ument on product submissions and labeling. Antiseptics are considered antimicrobial drugs us ed on living tissue and thus are regulated by FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. FDA regulates liqui d chemical sterilants and high-level disinfectants intended to process critical and semicritical dev ices. FDA has published recommendations on the types of test methods that manufacturers should subm it to FDA for 510[k] clearance for such agents. CDC At CDC, the mission of the Coordinating Center fo r Infections Diseases is to guide the public on how to prevent and respond to infect ious diseases in both health-care settings and at home. With respect to disinfectants and sterilants, part of CDC's role is to inform the public (in this case healthcare personnel) of current scientific evidence pertaining to these products, to comment about their safety and efficacy, and to recommend which chemicals might be most appropr iate or effective for specific microorganisms and settings. 56Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Test Methods The methods EPA has used for registration ar e standardized by the AOAC International; however, a survey of scientific liter ature reveals a number of problems wi th these tests that were reported during 1987-1990 58, 76, 80, 428, 736, 737, 795-800 that cause them to be neit her accurate nor reproducible 416, 737. As part of their regulatory authority, EPA and FD A support development and validation of methods for assessing disinfection claims 801-803. For example, EPA has supported the work of Dr. Syed Sattar and coworkers who have developed a two-tier quantitative test to chemical germicides 701, 803. EPA is accepting label claims against hepatitis B viru s (HBV) using a surrogate organism, the duck HBV, to quantify disinfectant activity 124, 804. EPA also is accepting labeling claims against hepatitis C virus using the bovine viral diarrhea virus as a surrogate. For nearly 30 years, EPA also performed intramur al preregistration and postregistration efficacy testing of some chemical disinfec tants in its own laboratories. In 1982, this was stopped, reportedly for budgetary reasons. At that time, manufacturers did not need to have microbiologic activity claims verified by EPA or an independent testing laboratory when regist ering a disinfectant or chemical sterilant 805. This occurred when the frequency of contaminated germici des and infections secondary to their use had increased 404. Investigations demonstrating that interlabor atory reproducibility of test results was poor and manufacturers' label claims were not verifiable 416, 737 and symposia sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology 800 heightened awareness of these problems and reconfirmed the need to improve the AOAC methods and reinstate a microbiol ogic activity verification program. A General Accounting Office report entitled Disinfectants: EPA Lacks Assurance They Work 806 seemed to provide the necessary impetus for EPA to initiate corre ctive measures, including cooperative agreements to improve the AOAC methods and independent verification te sting for all products labeled as sporicidal and disinfectants labeled as tuberculoci dal. For example, of 26 sterilant products tested by EPA, 15 were canceled because of product failure . A list of products registered with EPA and labeled for use as sterilants or tuberculocides or against HIV and/ or HBV is available through EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm . Organizations (e.g., Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) are working to st andardize requirements for germicide testing and registration. Neutralization of Germicides One of the difficulties associated with evaluati ng the bactericidal activity of disinfectants is prevention of bacteriostasis from disinfectant residues carried over into the subculture media. Likewise, small amounts of disinfectants on environmental surfaces can make an accurate bacterial count difficult to get when sampling of the health-care environm ent as part of an epidemiologic or research investigation. One way these problems may be overco me is by employing neutralizers that inactivate residual disinfectants 807-809. Two commonly used neutralizing media for chemical disinfectants are Letheen Media and D/E Neutralizing Media. The former contains lecithin to neutralize quaternaries and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) to neutralize phenolics, formalin, and, with lecithin, ethanol. The D/E media will neutralize a broad spec trum of antiseptic and disinfectant chemicals, including quaternary ammonium compounds, phenols, iodine and chlorine compounds, mercurials, formaldehyde, and glutaraldehyde 810. A review of neutralizers used in germicide testing has been published808. 57Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 STERILIZATION Most medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are heat stable and therefore undergo heat, primarily steam, sterilization. However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low- temperature sterilization. Ethylene oxide gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture- sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 year s, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization systems (e.g., hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, perac etic acid immersion, ozone) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices. This section reviews sterilization technologies used in healthcare and makes recommendations for their optim um performance in the processing of medical devices 1, 18, 811-820. Sterilization destroys all microorganisms on the surf ace of an article or in a fluid to prevent disease transmission associated with the use of that item. While the use of inadequately sterilized critical items represents a high risk of transmitti ng pathogens, documented transmission of pathogens associated with an inadequately sterilized cr itical item is exceedingly rare 821, 822. This is likely due to the wide margin of safety associated with the sterilizat ion processes used in healthcare facilities. The concept of what constitutes \"sterile \" is measured as a probability of ster ility for each item to be sterilized. This probability is commonly referred to as the st erility assurance level (SAL) of the product and is defined as the probability of a single viable microorgani sm occurring on a product after sterilization. SAL is normally expressed a 10-n. For example, if the probability of a spore surviving were one in one million, the SAL would be 10-6 823, 824. In short, a SAL is an estimate of le thality of the entire sterilization process and is a conservative calculat ion. Dual SALs (e.g., 10-3 SAL for blood culture tubes, drainage bags; 10-6 SAL for scalpels, implants) have been used in the United States for many years and the choice of a 10-6 SAL was strictly arbitrary and not associated with any adverse outcomes (e.g., patient infections) 823. Medical devices that have contact with sterile body tissues or fluids are c onsidered critical items. These items should be sterile when used because any mi crobial contamination could result in disease transmission. Such items include surgical instrum ents, biopsy forceps, and implanted medical devices. If these items are heat resistant, the recommended sterilization process is steam sterilization, because it has the largest margin of safety due to its reliability, consistency, and lethality. However, reprocessing heat- and moisture-sensitive items requires use of a low-temperature sterilization technology (e.g., ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, peracetic acid) 825. A summary of the advantages and disadvantages for commonly used sterilization technologies is presented in Table 6. Steam Sterilization Overview. Of all the methods available for sterilizati on, moist heat in the form of saturated steam under pressure is the most widely used and the most dependable. Steam sterilization is nontoxic, inexpensive 826, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and r apidly heats and penetrates fabrics (Table 6) 827. Like all sterilization processes, steam sterilization has some deleter ious effects on some materials, including corrosion and combustion of lubr icants associated with dental handpieces212; reduction in ability to transmit light associated with laryngoscopes828; and increased hardening time (5.6 fold) with plaster- cast 829. The basic principle of steam sterilization, as accomplished in an autoclave, is to expose each item to direct steam contact at the required temperat ure and pressure for the specified time. Thus, there are four parameters of steam steriliz ation: steam, pressure, temperature, and time. The ideal steam for sterilization is dry saturated steam and entrained water (dryness fraction > 97%)813, 819. Pressure serves as a means to obtain the high temperatures nece ssary to quickly kill microorganisms. Specific temperatures must be obtained to ensure the microbi cidal activity. The two common steam-sterilizing temperatures are 121oC (250oF) and 132oC (270oF). These temperatures ( and other high temperatures) 830 must be maintained for a minimal time to kill mi croorganisms. Recognized minimum exposure periods for sterilization of wrapped healthcare supplies are 30 minutes at 121oC (250oF) in a gravity displacement 58Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 sterilizer or 4 minutes at 132oC (270oC) in a prevacuum sterilizer (Table 7). At constant temperatures, sterilization times vary depending on the type of item (e.g., metal versus rubber, plastic, items with lumens), whether the item is wrapped or unwrapped, and the sterilizer type. The two basic types of steam st erilizers (autoclaves) are the gr avity displacement autoclave and the high-speed prevacuum sterilizer. In the former, st eam is admitted at the top or the sides of the sterilizing chamber and, because the st eam is lighter than air, forces air out the bottom of the chamber through the drain vent. The gravity displacement autoclaves are primarily used to process laboratory media, water, pharmaceutical products, regulated m edical waste, and nonporous articles whose surfaces have direct steam contact. For gravity displacement sterilizers the penetration time into porous items is prolonged because of incomplete air elimination. This point is illustrated with the decontamination of 10 lbs of microbiological waste, which requires at least 45 minutes at 121 oC because the entrapped air remaining in a load of waste greatly re tards steam permeation and heating efficiency831, 832. The high- speed prevacuum sterilizers are similar to the gravity di splacement sterilizers except they are fitted with a vacuum pump (or ejector) to ensure air removal from the sterilizing chamber and load before the steam is admitted. The advantage of using a vacuum pum p is that there is nearly instantaneous steam penetration even into porous loads. The Bowie-Dick test is used to detect air leaks and inadequate air removal and consists of folded 100% cotton surg ical towels that are clean and preconditioned. A commercially available Bowie-Dick-type test sheet shoul d be placed in the center of the pack. The test pack should be placed horizontally in the front, botto m section of the sterilizer rack, near the door and over the drain, in an otherwise empty chamber and run at 134 oC for 3.5 minutes813, 819. The test is used each day the vacuum-type steam sterilizer is used, before the first processed load. Air that is not removed from the chamber will interfere with steam contact. Smaller disposable test packs (or process challenge devices) have been devised to replace the sta ck of folded surgical towels for testing the efficacy of the vacuum syst em in a prevacuum sterilizer. 833 These devices are \"designed to simulate product to be sterilized and to constitute a def ined challenge to the sterilization process\"819, 834. They should be representative of the load and simu late the greatest challenge to the load835. Sterilizer vacuum performance is acceptable if the sheet inside the te st pack shows a uniform color change. Entrapped air will cause a spot to appear on the test sheet, due to the inability of the steam to reach the chemical indicator. If the sterilizer fails the Bowie-Dick test, do not use the sterilizer until it is inspected by the sterilizer maintenance personnel and passes the Bowie-Dick test813, 819, 836. Another design in steam sterilization is a steam flush-pressure pulsing process, which removes air rapidly by repeatedly alternating a steam flush and a pressure pulse above atmospheric pressure. Air is rapidly removed from the load as with the prevacuum sterilizer, but air leaks do not affect this process because the steam in the sterilizing chamber is always above atmospheric pressure. Typical sterilization temperatures and times are 132 oC to 135oC with 3 to 4 minutes exposure time for porous loads and instruments827, 837. Like other sterilization system s, the steam cycle is monitor ed by mechanical, chemical, and biological monitors. Steam sterilizers usually are moni tored using a printout (or graphically) by measuring temperature, the time at the temperature, and pressure . Typically, chemical indicators are affixed to the outside and incorporated into the pack to monitor t he temperature or time and temperature. The effectiveness of steam sterilization is monitored wi th a biological indicator containing spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus ). Positive spore test results are a relatively rare event 838 and can be attributed to operator error, inadequate steam delivery839, or equipment malfunction. Portable (table-top) steam sterilizers are used in outpatient, dental, and rural clinics 840. These sterilizers are designed for small instruments, such as hypodermic syringes and needles and dental instruments. The ability of the sterilizer to reach physical parameters necessary to achieve sterilization should be monitored by mechanical, chemical, and biological indicators. 59Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Microbicidal Activity . The oldest and most recognized agent for inactivation of microorganisms is heat. D-values (time to reduce the surviving population by 90% or 1 log 10) allow a direct comparison of the heat resistance of microorganisms. Because a D- value can be determined at various temperatures, a subscript is used to designate t he exposure temperature (i.e., D 121C). D 121C-values for Geobacillus stearothermophilus used to monitor the steam sterilization process range from 1 to 2 minutes. Heat- resistant nonspore-forming bacteria, yeasts, and fungi have such low D 121C values that they cannot be experimentally measured841. Mode of Action . Moist heat destroys microorganisms by the irreversible coagulation and denaturation of enzymes and structural proteins. In support of this fact, it has been found that the presence of moisture significantly affects the coagulat ion temperature of proteins and the temperature at which microorganisms are destroyed. Uses . Steam sterilization should be used whenever possi ble on all critical and semicritical items that are heat and moisture resistant (e.g., steam sterilizable respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment), even when not essential to prevent pat hogen transmission. Steam sterilizers also are used in healthcare facilities to decontaminate microbiological waste and sharps containers 831, 832, 842 but additional exposure time is required in the grav ity displacement sterilizer for these items. Flash Sterilization Overview. \"Flash\" steam sterilization was origi nally defined by Underwood and Perkins as sterilization of an unwrapped object at 132 oC for 3 minutes at 27-28 lbs. of pressure in a gravity displacement sterilizer843. Currently, the time required for flash sterilization depends on the type of sterilizer and the type of item (i.e., porous vs non-porous items)(see Table 8). Although the wrapped method of sterilization is preferred for the reasons listed below, correctly performed flash sterilization is an effective process for the steriliz ation of critical medical devices844, 845. Flash sterilization is a modification of conventional steam sterilization (either gravity, prevacuum , or steam-flush pressure-pulse) in which the flashed item is placed in an open tray or is placed in a specially designed, covered, rigid container to allow for rapid penetration of steam. Historically, it is not recommended as a routine sterilization method because of the lack of timely biological indicators to monitor performance, absence of protective packaging following sterilization, possibility for contamination of processed items during transportation to the operating rooms, and the steriliz ation cycle parameters (i.e., time, temperature, pressure) are minimal. To address some of thes e concerns, many healthcare facilities have done the following: placed equipment for flash sterilization in clos e proximity to operating rooms to facilitate aseptic delivery to the point of use (usually the sterile field in an ongoing surgical procedure); extended the exposure time to ensure lethality comparable to sterilized wrapped items (e.g., 4 minutes at 132 oC)846, 847; used biological indicators that provide results in 1 hour for flash-sterilized items846, 847; and used protective packaging that permits steam penetration812, 817-819, 845, 848. Further, some rigid, reusable sterilization container systems have been designed and validated by the container manufacturer for use with flash cycles. When sterile items are open to air, they w ill eventually become contaminated. Thus, the longer a sterile item is exposed to air, the greater the number of microorganisms that will settle on it. Sterilization cycle parameters for flash sterilizat ion are shown in Table 8. A few adverse events have been associated with flash sterilization. When evaluating an increased incidence of neurosurgical infections, the in vestigators noted that surgical instruments were flash sterilized between cases and 2 of 3 craniotomy infe ctions involved plate implants that were flash sterilized 849. A report of two patients who received burns during surgery from instruments that had been flash sterilized reinforced the need to develop policies and educate staff to prevent the use of instruments hot enough to cause clinical burns850. Staff should use precautions to prevent burns with potentially hot instruments (e.g., transport tray using heat-protective gloves). Patient burns may be prevented by either air-cooling the instruments or immersion in sterile liquid (e.g., saline). Uses. Flash sterilization is considered acceptable for processing cleaned pati ent-care items that 60Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 cannot be packaged, sterilized, and stored before use. It also is used when there is insufficient time to sterilize an item by the preferred package method. Flash sterilization should not be used for reasons of convenience, as an alternative to purchasing additional instrument sets, or to save time817. Because of the potential for serious infections, flash sterilizat ion is not recommended for implantable devices (i.e., devices placed into a surgically or naturally formed cavity of the hum an body); however, flash sterilization may be unavoidable for some devices (e.g., orthopedic screw, plates). If flash sterilization of an implantable device is unavoidable, recordkeeping (i.e ., load identification, patient's name/hospital identifier, and biological indicator result) is essentia l for epidemiological tracking (e.g., of surgical site infection, tracing results of biological indicators to patients who received the it em to document sterility), and for an assessment of the reliability of the ster ilization process (e.g., evaluation of biological monitoring records and sterilization maintenance reco rds noting preventive maintenance and repairs with dates). Low-Temperature Sterilization Technologies Ethylene oxide (ETO) has been widely used as a low-temperature sterilant since the 1950s. It has been the most commonly used process for steriliz ing temperature- and moisture-sensitive medical devices and supplies in healthcare institutions in t he United States. Two types of ETO sterilizers are available, mixed gas and 100% ETO. Until 1995, ethylene oxide sterilizers combined ETO with a chloroflourocarbon (CFC) stabilizing agent, most commonl y in a ratio of 12% ETO mixed with 88% CFC (referred to as 12/88 ETO). For several reasons, healthcare personnel have been exploring the use of new low-temperature sterilization technologies 825, 851. First, CFCs were phased out in De cember 1995 under provisions of the Clean Air Act 852. CFCs were classified as a Class I substance under the Clean Air Act because of scientific evidence linking them to destruction of the earth's ozone layer. Sec ond, some states (e.g., California, New York, Michigan) require the use of ETO abatement technology to reduce the amount of ETO being released into ambient air from 90 to 99. 9% depending on the state. Third, OSHA regulates the acceptable vapor levels of ETO (i.e., 1 ppm averaged over 8 hours) due to concerns that ETO exposure represents an occupational hazard318. These constraints have led to the development of alternative technologies for low-temperature sterilization in the healthcare setting. Alternative technologies to ETO with chlorofl uorocarbon that are currently available and cleared by the FDA for medical equipment include 100% ETO; ETO with a different stabilizing gas, such as carbon dioxide or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC); immersion in peracetic acid; hydrogen peroxide gas plasma; and ozone. Technologies under development for use in healthcare facilities, but not cleared by the FDA, include vaporized hydrogen peroxide, vapor phase peracetic acid, gaseous chlorine dioxide, ionizing radiation, or pulsed light 400, 758, 853. However, there is no guarantee that these new sterilization technologies will receive FDA clearance for use in healthcare facilities. These new technologies should be compared agai nst the characteristics of an ideal low- temperature (<60 oC) sterilant (Table 9). 851 While it is apparent that all technologies will have limitations (Table 9), understanding the limitations imposed by restrictive device designs (e.g., long, narrow lumens) is critical for proper application of new sterilization technology 854. For example, the development of increasingly small and complex endoscopes presents a difficult challenge for current sterilization processes. This occurs because microorganisms must be in direct contact with the sterilant for inactivation to occur. Several peer-reviewed scient ific publications have dat a demonstrating concerns about the efficacy of several of the low-temperatur e sterilization processes (i.e., gas plasma, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, ETO, peracetic acid), particula rly when the test organisms are challenged in the presence of serum and salt and a narrow lumen vehicle469, 721, 825, 855, 856. Factors shown to affect the efficacy of sterilization are shown in Table 10. Ethylene Oxide \"Gas\" Sterilization Overview. ETO is a colorless gas that is flamm able and explosive. The four essential 61Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 parameters (operational ranges) are: gas concentra tion (450 to 1200 mg/l); temperature (37 to 63oC); relative humidity (40 to 80%)(water molecules carry ETO to reactive sites); and exposure time (1 to 6 hours). These influence the effectiveness of ETO sterilization814, 857, 858. Within certain limitations, an increase in gas concentration and temper ature may shorten the time necessa ry for achieving sterilization. The main disadvantages associated with ETO are the lengthy cycle time, the cost, and its potential hazards to patients and staff; the main adv antage is that it can sterilize heat- or moisture- sensitive medical equipment without deleterious effe cts on the material used in the medical devices (Table 6). Acute exposure to ETO may result in irritation (e.g., to skin, eyes, gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts) and central nervous system depression859-862. Chronic inhalation has been linked to the formation of cataracts, cognitive im pairment, neurologic dysfunction, and disabling polyneuropathies860, 861, 863-866. Occupational exposure in healthcare facilities has been linked to hematologic changes 867 and an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and various cancers318, 868-870. ETO should be considered a known human carcinogen871. The basic ETO sterilization cycle consists of five stages (i.e ., preconditioning and humidification, gas introduction, exposure, evacuation, and air wa shes) and takes approximately 2 1/2 hrs excluding aeration time. Mechanical aeration for 8 to 12 hours at 50 to 60 oC allows desorption of the toxic ETO residual contained in exposed absorbent materials. Most modern ETO sterilizers combine sterilization and aeration in the same chamber as a continuous pr ocess. These ETO models minimize potential ETO exposure during door opening and load transfer to the aerat or. Ambient room aeration also will achieve desorption of the toxic ETO but requires 7 days at 20oC. There are no federal regulations for ETO sterilizer emission; however, many states have promulgated emission-control regulations814. The use of ETO evolved when few alternatives existed for sterilizing heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices; however, favorable properties (T able 6) account for its continued widespread use 872. Two ETO gas mixtures are available to replace ETO-chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) mixtures for large capacity, tank-supplied sterilizers. The ETO-carbon dioxide (CO 2) mixture consists of 8.5% ETO and 91.5% CO 2. This mixture is less expensive than ET O-hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), but a disadvantage is the need for pressure vessels rated for steam sterilization, because higher pressures (28-psi gauge) are required. The other mixture, which is a drop-in CF C replacement, is ETO mixed with HCFC. HCFCs are approximately 50-fold less damaging to the earth's ozone layer than are CFCs. The EPA will begin regulation of HCFC in the year 2015 and will terminate production in the year 2030. Two companies provide ETO-HCFC mixtures as drop-in replacement for CFC-12; one mixture consists of 8.6% ETO and 91.4% HCFC, and the other mixt ure is composed of 10% ETO and 90% HCFC 872. An alternative to the pressurized mixed gas ETO systems is 100% ETO. The 100% ETO sterilizers using unit-dose cartridges eliminate t he need for external tanks. ETO is absorbed by many materials. For this reason, following sterilization the item must undergo aeration to remove residual ETO. Guidelines have been promulgated regarding allowable ETO limits for devices that depend on how the device is us ed, how often, and how long in order to pose a minimal risk to patients in normal product use 814. ETO toxicity has been established in a variety of animals. Exposure to ETO can cause eye pain, sore throat, difficulty breathing and blurred visi on. Exposure can also cause dizziness, nausea, headache, convulsions, blisters and vomiting and coughing 873. In a variety of in vitro and animal studies, ETO has been demonstrated to be carcinogenic. ET O has been linked to spontaneous abortion, genetic damage, nerve damage, peripheral paralysis, mu scle weakness, and impaired thinking and memory873. Occupational exposure in healthcare facilities has been linked to an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and various cancers318. Injuries (e.g., tissue burns) to patients have been associated with ETO residues in implants used in surgical procedures874. Residual ETO in capillary flow dialysis membranes has been shown to be neurotoxic in vitro875. OSHA has established a PEL of 1 ppm airborne ETO in the workplace, expressed as a TWA for an 8-hour work shi ft in a 40-hour work week. The \"action level\" for ETO is 0.5 ppm, expressed as an 8-hour TWA, and the s hort-term excursion limit is 5 ppm, expressed as 62Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 a 15-minute TWA814. For details of the requirements in OSHA's ETO standard for occupational exposures, see Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1910.1047873. Several personnel monitoring methods (e.g., charcoal tubes and passive sampling devices) are in use814. OSHA has established a PEL of 5 ppm for ethylene chlorohydrin (a toxic by-product of ETO) in the workplace876. Additional information regarding use of ETO in health care facilities is available from NIOSH. Mode of Action . The microbicidal activity of ETO is considered to be the result of alkylation of protein, DNA, and RNA. Alkylation, or the replacement of a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group, within cells prevents normal cellular metabolism and replication877. Microbicidal Activity . The excellent microbicidal activity of ETO has been demonstrated in several studies 469, 721, 722, 856, 878, 879 and summarized in published reports877. ETO inactivates all microorganisms although bacterial spores (especially B. atrophaeus ) are more resistant than other microorganisms. For this reason B. atrophaeus is the recommended biological indicator. Like all sterilization processes, the effectiveness of ETO sterilization can be altered by lumen length, lumen diameter, inorgani c salts, and organic materials 469, 721, 722, 855, 856, 879. For example, although ETO is not used commonly for reprocessing endoscopes28, several studies have shown failure of ETO in inactivating contaminating spores in endoscope channels 855or lumen test units 721, 879 and residual ETO levels averaging 66.2 ppm even after the standard degassing time456. Failure of ETO also has been observed when dental handpieces were contaminated with Streptococcus mutans and exposed to ETO880. It is recommended that dental handpieces be steam sterilized. Uses. ETO is used in healthcare facilities to steriliz e critical items (and sometimes semicritical items) that are moisture or heat sensitiv e and cannot be sterilized by steam sterilization. Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma Overview. New sterilization technology based on pl asma was patented in 1987 and marketed in the United States in 1993. Gas plasmas have been referr ed to as the fourth state of matter (i.e., liquids, solids, gases, and gas plasmas). Gas plasma s are generated in an enclosed chamber under deep vacuum using radio frequency or microwave energy to excite the gas molecules and produce charged particles, many of which are in the form of free radicals. A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and is a highly reactive species. The pr oposed mechanism of action of this device is the production of free radicals within a plasma field that are capable of interacting with essential cell components (e.g., enzymes, nucleic acids) and thereby disrupt the metabolism of microorganisms. The type of seed gas used and the depth of the vacuum are two important variables that can determine the effectiveness of this process. In the late 1980s the first hydrogen peroxide gas plasma system for sterilization of medical and surgical devices was field-tested. According to t he manufacturer, the steriliz ation chamber is evacuated and hydrogen peroxide solution is injected from a cassette and is vaporized in the sterilization chamber to a concentration of 6 mg/l. The hydrogen peroxide vapor diffuses through the chamber (50 minutes), exposes all surfaces of the load to the sterilant, and initiates the inactivation of microorganisms. An electrical field created by a radio frequency is app lied to the chamber to create a gas plasma. Microbicidal free radicals (e.g., hydroxyl and hydroper oxyl) are generated in the plasma. The excess gas is removed and in the final stage (i.e., vent) of t he process the sterilization chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure by introduction of high-efficiency filtered air. T he by-products of the cycle (e.g., water vapor, oxygen) are nontoxic and eliminate the need for aeration. Thus, the sterilized materials can be handled safely, either for immediate use or stor age. The process operates in the range of 37-44 oC and has a cycle time of 75 minutes. If any moisture is present on the objects the vacuum will not be achieved and the cycle aborts856, 881-883. A newer version of the unit improves sterilizer efficacy by using two cycles with a hydrogen 63Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 peroxide diffusion stage and a plasma stage per sterilization cycle. This revision, which is achieved by a software modification, reduces total processing time from 73 to 52 minutes. The manufacturer believes that the enhanced activity obtained with this system is due in part to the pressure changes that occur during the injection and diffusion phases of the process and to the fact that the process consists of two equal and consecutive half cycles, each with a separate injection of hydrogen peroxide. 856, 884, 885 This system and a smaller version 400, 882 have received FDA 510[k] clearanc e with limited application for sterilization of medical devices (Table 6). The bi ological indicator used with this system is Bacillus atrophaeus spores851. The newest version of the unit, which employs a new vaporiz ation system that removes most of the water from the hydrogen perox ide, has a cycle time from 28-38 minutes (see manufacturer's literature for dev ice dimension restrictions). Penetration of hydrogen peroxide vapor into long or narrow lumens has been addressed outside the United States by the use of a diffusion enhancer . This is a small, breakable glass ampoule of concentrated hydrogen peroxide (50%) with an elastic connector that is inserted into the device lumen and crushed immediately before sterilization470, 885. The diffusion enhancer has been shown to sterilize bronchoscopes contaminated with Mycobacteria tuberculosis886. At the present time, the diffusion enhancer is not FDA cleared. Another gas plasma system, which differs from the above in several important ways, including the use of peracetic acid-acetic acid-hydrogen per oxide vapor, was removed from the marketplace because of reports of corneal destruction to patients when ophthal mic surgery instruments had been processed in the sterilizer 887, 888. In this investigation, exposure of potentially wet ophthalmologic surgical instruments with small bores and brass components to the plasma gas led to degradation of the brass to copper and zinc888, 889. The experimenters showed that when rabbit eyes were exposed to the rinsates of the gas plasma-sterilized instruments, corneal decom pensation was documented. This toxicity is highly unlikely with the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma process since a toxic, soluble form of copper would not form (LA Feldman, written communication, April 1998). Mode of Action. This process inactivates microorganism s primarily by the combined use of hydrogen peroxide gas and the generation of free radicals (hydroxyl and hydroproxyl free radicals) during the plasma phase of the cycle. Microbicidal Activity . This process has the ability to inactivate a broad range of microorganisms, including resistant bacterial spor es. Studies have been conducted against vegetative bacteria (including mycobacteria), yeasts , fungi, viruses, and bacterial spores 469, 721, 856, 881-883, 890-893. Like all sterilization processes, the effectiveness can be altered by lumen length, lumen diameter, inorganic salts, and organic materials469, 721, 855, 856, 890, 891, 893. Uses. Materials and devices that cannot tolerate hi gh temperatures and humidity, such as some plastics, electrical devices, and corrosion-suscept ible metal alloys, can be sterilized by hydrogen peroxide gas plasma. This method has been compatible with most (>95%) medical devices and materials tested 884, 894, 895. Peracetic Acid Sterilization Overview. Peracetic acid is a highly biocidal oxidizer that maintains its efficacy in the presence of organic soil. Peracetic acid removes surface contaminants (primarily pr otein) on endoscopic tubing 711, 717. An automated machine using peracetic acid to sterilize medical, surgical, and dental instruments chemically (e.g., endoscopes, arthroscopes) was intr oduced in 1988. This microprocessor-controlled, low-temperature sterilization method is commonly used in the United States107. The sterilant, 35% peracetic acid, and an anticorrosive agent are supplied in a single-dose container. The container is punctured at the time of use, immediately prior to closing the lid and initiating the cycle. The concentrated peracetic acid is dilut ed to 0.2% with filtered water (0.2 m) at a temperature of approximately 50oC. The diluted peracetic acid is circul ated within the chamber of the machine and 64Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 pumped through the channels of the endoscope for 12 minutes, decontaminating exterior surfaces, lumens, and accessories. Interchangeable trays are avail able to permit the processing of up to three rigid endoscopes or one flexible endoscope. Connectors are available for most types of flexible endoscopes for the irrigation of all channels by directed flow. Rigid endoscopes are placed within a lidded container, and the sterilant fills the lumens either by immersi on in the circulating steril ant or by use of channel connectors to direct flow into the lumen(s) (see below for the importance of channel connectors). The peracetic acid is discarded via the sewer and the inst rument rinsed four times with filtered water. Concern has been raised that filtered wate r may be inadequate to maintain sterility 896. Limited data have shown that low-level bacterial contamination may fo llow the use of filtered water in an AER but no data has been published on AERs using the peracetic acid system161. Clean filtered air is passed through the chamber of the machine and endoscope channels to remove excess water719. As with any sterilization process, the system can only ster ilize surfaces that can be contact ed by the sterilant. For example, bronchoscopy-related infections occurred when bronchoscopes were processed using the wrong connector155, 725. Investigation of these incidents re vealed that bronchoscopes were inadequately reprocessed when inappropriate c hannel connectors were used and when there were inconsistencies between the reprocessing instructions provided by the manufacturer of the bronchoscope and the manufacturer of the automatic endoscope reprocessor155. The importance of channel connectors to achieve sterilization was also shown for rigid lumen devices137, 856. The manufacturers suggest the use of biological monitors ( G. stearothermophilus spore strips) both at the time of installation and routinely to ensur e effectiveness of the process. The manufacturer's clip must be used to hold the strip in the designated spot in the machine as a broader clamp will not allow the sterilant to reach the spores trapped under it897. One investigator reported a 3% failure rate when the appropriate clips were used to hold the spore strip within the machine718. The use of biological monitors designed to monitor either steam sterilization or ETO for a liquid chemical sterilizer has been questioned for several reasons including spore wash-off from t he filter paper strips which may cause less valid monitoring898-901. The processor is equipped with a conductivi ty probe that will automatically abort the cycle if the buffer system is not detec ted in a fresh container of the perac etic acid solution. A chemical monitoring strip that detects that the active ingredi ent is >1500 ppm is available for routine use as an additional process control. Mode of Action. Only limited information is availabl e regarding the mechanism of action of peracetic acid, but it is thought to function as other oxidizing agents, i.e., it denatures proteins, disrupts cell wall permeability, and oxidizes sulfhydral and sulfur bonds in proteins, enzymes, and other metabolites 654, 726. Microbicidal Activity. Peracetic acid will inactivate gram -positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and yeasts in <5 minutes at <100 ppm. In the presence of organic matter, 200-500 ppm is required. For viruses, the dosage range is wide (12-2250 ppm ), with poliovirus inactivated in yeast extract in 15 minutes with 1500 to 2250 ppm. Bacterial spores in suspension are inactivated in 15 seconds to 30 minutes with 500 to 10,000 ppm (0.05 to 1%)654. Simulated-use trials have dem onstrated microbicidal activity 111, 718-722 and three clinical trials have demonstrated both microbial killing and no clinical failures leading to infection90, 723, 724. Alfa and co- workers, who compared the peracetic acid system with ETO, demonstrated the high efficacy of the system. Only the peracetic acid syst em was able to completely chelonae , Enterococcus faecalis , both an organic and inorganic challenge722. Like other sterilization processes, t he efficacy of the process can be diminished by soil challenges 902 and test conditions856. Uses . This automated machine is used to chemic ally sterilize medical (e.g., GI endoscopes) and surgical (e.g., flexible endoscopes) instruments in the Unit ed States. Lumened endoscopes must be connected to an appropriate channel connec tor to ensure that the sterilant has direct contact with the contaminated lumen. 137, 856, 903 Olympus America has not listed this system as a compatible product for 65Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 use in reprocessing Olympus bronchoscopes and gas trointestinal endoscopes (Olympus America, January 30, 2002, written communication). Microbicidal Activity of Low-Temperature Sterilization Technologies Sterilization processes used in the United States must be cleared by FDA, and they require that sterilizer microbicidal performance be tested under simulated-use conditions904. FDA requires that the test article be inoculated with 106 colony-forming units of the most resistant test organism and prepared with organic and inorganic test loads as would occur afte r actual use. FDA requires manufacturers to use organic soil (e.g., 5% fetal calf serum), dried onto the device with the inoculum, to represent soil remaining on the device following marginal cleaning. However, 5% fetal calf serum as a measure of marginal cleaning has not been validated by measurem ents of protein load on devices following use and the level of protein removal by various cleaning methods. The inocula must be placed in various locations of the test articles, including those least favorable to penetration and contact with the sterilant (e.g., lumens). Cleaning before sterilization is not a llowed in the demonstration of sterilization efficacy904. Several studies have evaluated the relative microbicidal efficacy of these low-temperature sterilization technologies (Table 11). These studies have either tested the activity of a sterilization process against specific microorganisms 892, 905, 906, evaluated the microbicidal acti vity of a singular technology 711, 719, 724, 855, 879, 882-884, 890, 891, 907 or evaluated the comparative effectiv of several sterilization technologies271, 426, 469, 721, 722, 856, 908, 909. Several test methodologies use stainle ss steel or porcelain carriers that are inoculated with a test organism. Commonly us ed test organisms include vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, and spores of Bacillus species. The available data dem onstrate that low-temperature sterilization technologies are able to provide a 6-log 10 reduction of microbes when inoculated onto carriers in the absence of salt and serum. However, tests can be constructed such that all of the available sterilization technologies are unable to reliably achieve complete inactivation of a microbial load. 425, 426, 469, 721, 856, 909 For example, almost all of the sterilizati on processes will fail to reliably inactivate the microbial load in the presence of salt and serum469, 721, 909. The effect of salts and serums on the sterilization process were studied initially in the 1950s and 1960s 424, 910. These studies showed that a high concentration of crystalline-type materials and a low protein content provided greater protection to s pores than did serum with a high protein content426. A study by Doyle and Ernst demonstrated resistance of s pores by crystalline material applied not only to low-temperature sterilization technology but also to steam and dry heat425. These studies showed that occlusion of Bacillus atrophaeus spores in calcium carbonate crysta ls dramatically increased the time required for inactivation as follows: 10 seconds to 150 minutes for steam (121oC), 3.5 hours to 50 hours for dry heat (121oC), 30 seconds to >2 weeks for ETO (54oC). Investigators have corroborated and extended these findings469, 470, 721, 855, 908, 909. While soils containing both organic and inorganic materials impair microbial killing, soils that contain a high inor ganic salt-to-protein ratio favor crystal formation and impair sterilization by occlusion of organisms425, 426, 881. Alfa and colleagues demonstrated a 6-log 10 reduction of the microbial inoculum of porcelain penicylinders using a variety of vegetative and spore-forming organisms (Table 11)469. However, if the bacterial inoculum was in tissue-culture medium supplemented with 10% serum, only the ETO 12/88 and ETO-HCFC sterilization mixtures could sterilize 95% to 97% of the penicylinder carriers. The plasma and 100% ETO sterilizer demonstrated significantly reduced ac tivity (Table 11). For all sterilizers evaluated using penicylinder carriers (i.e., ETO 12/88, 100% ETO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma), there was a 3- to 6-log 10 reduction of inoculated bacteria even in the pr esence of serum and salt. For each sterilizer evaluated, the ability to inactivate microorganisms in the presence of salt and serum was reduced even further when the inoculum was placed in a narrow-lu men test object (3 mm diameter by 125 cm long). Although there was a 2- to 4-log 10 reduction in microbial kill, less than 50% of the lumen test objects were sterile when processed using any of the sterilizat ion methods evaluated exc ept the peracetic acid immersion system (Table 11)721. Complete killing (or 6-log of Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium chelonei , and Bacillus atrophaeus spores in the presence of salt and serum and lumen test objects was observed only for the peracetic acid immersion system. 66Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 With respect to the results by Alfa and coworkers469, Jacobs showed that the use of the tissue culture media created a technique-induced sterilization failure426. Jacobs et al. showed that microorganisms mixed with tissue culture media, used as a surrogate body fluid, formed physical crystals that protected the microorganisms used as a chall enge. If the carriers were exposed for 60 sec to nonflowing water, the salts dissolved and the protective effect dis appeared. Since any device would be exposed to water for a short period of time during t he washing procedure, these protective effects would have little clinical relevance426. Narrow lumens provide a challenge to some lo w-temperature sterilization processes. For example, Rutala and colleagues showed that, as lum en size decreased, increased failures occurred with some low-temperature sterilization technologies. Ho wever, some low-temperature processes such as ETO-HCFC and the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma proc ess remained effective even when challenged by a lumen as small as 1 mm in the absence of salt and serum 856. The importance of allowing the sterilant to come into contact with the inoculated carrier is demonstrated by comparing the results of two invest igators who studied the peracetic acid immersion system. Alfa and coworkers demonstrated excellent ac tivity of the peracetic acid immersion system against three test organisms using a narrow-lumen devic e. In these experiments, the lumen test object was connected to channel irrigators, which ensured t hat the sterilant had direct contact with the contaminated carriers 722. This effectiveness was achieved through a combination of organism wash-off and peracetic acid sterilant killing the test organisms722. The data reported by Rutala et al. demonstrated failure of the peracetic acid immersion system to eliminate Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores from a carrier placed in a lumen test object. In these experiments, the lumen test unit was not connected to channel irrigators. The authors attributed the failure of the peracetic acid immersion system to eliminate the high levels of spores from the cent er of the test unit to the inability of the peracetic acid to diffuse into the center of 40-cm long, 3-mm diameter tubes. Th is may be caused by an air lock or air bubbles formed in the lumen, impeding the flow of the sterilant through the long and narrow lumen and limiting complete access to the Bacillus spores 137, 856. Experiments using a channel connector specifically designed for 1-, 2-, and 3-mm lumen test units with the peracetic acid immersion system were completely effective in eliminating an inoculum of 106 Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores7. The restricted diffusion environment that exists in the test conditions woul d not exist with flexible scopes processed in the peracetic acid immersion system, because the scopes are connected to channel irrigators to ensure that the sterilant has direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Alfa and asso ciates attributed the efficacy of the peracetic acid immersion system to the ability of the liquid chemical process to dissolve salts and remove protein and bacteria due to the flushing action of the fluid722. Bioburden of Surgical Devices In general, used medical devices are contam inated with a relatively low bioburden of organisms179, 911, 912. Nystrom evaluated medical instruments used in general surgical, gynecological, orthopedic, and ear-nose-throat operations and found t hat 62% of the instrum ents were contaminated with <101 organisms after use, 82% with <102, and 91% with <103. After being washed in an instrument washer, more than 98% of the instruments had <101 organisms, and none >102 organisms911. Other investigators have published similar findings179, 912. For example, after a standard cleaning procedure, 72% of 50 surgical instruments contained <101 organisms, 86% <102, and only 6% had >3 X 102912. In another study of rigid-lumen medical devices, the bioburden on both the inner and outer surface of the lumen ranged from 101 to 104 organisms per device. After cleani ng, 83% of the devices had a bioburden 102 organisms179. In all of these studies, the contaminati ng microflora consisted mainly of vegetative bacteria, usually of low pat hogenicity (e.g., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus )179, 911, 912. An evaluation of the microbial load on used critic al medical devices such as spinal anesthesia needles and angiographic catheters and sheaths demons trated that mesophilic microorganisms were detected at levels of 101 to 102 in only two of five needles. The bioburden on used angiographic 67Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 catheters and sheath introducers exceeded 103 CFUs on 14% (3 of 21) and 21% (6 of 28), respectively907. Effect of Cleaning on Sterilization Efficacy The effect of salt and serum on the efficacy of low-temperature sterilization technologies has raised concern regarding the margin of safety of these technologies. Experiment s have shown that salts have the greatest impact on protec ting microorganisms from killing426, 469. However, other studies have suggested that these concerns may not be clinically relevant. One study evaluated the relative rate of removal of inorganic salts, organic soil, and microorganisms from medical devices to better understand the dynamics of the cleaning process426. These tests were conducted by inoculating Alfa soil (tissue- culture media and 10% fetal bovine serum) 469 containing 106 G. stearothermophilus spores onto the surface of a stainless-steel scalpel bl ade. After drying for 30 minutes at 35oC followed by 30 minutes at room temperature, the samples were placed in water at room temperature. The blades were removed at specified times, and the concentration of total pr otein and chloride ion was measured. The results showed that soaking in deionized water for 60 seconds resulted in a >95% release rate of chloride ion from NaCl solution in 20 seconds, Alfa soil in 30 seconds, and fetal bovine serum in 120 seconds. Thus, contact with water for short periods, even in the presence of protein, r apidly leads to dissolution of salt crystals and complete inactivation of spores by a low-temperature ster ilization process (Table 10). Based on these experimental data, cleaning procedures would eliminate the detrimental effect of high salt content on a low-temperature sterilization process. These articles 426, 469, 721 assessing low-temperature sterilization technology reinforce the importance of meticulous cleaning before sterilization. These data support the critical need for healthcare facilities to develop rigid protocols for cl eaning contaminated objects before sterilization 472. Sterilization of instruments and medical devices is compromised if the process is not preceded by meticulous cleaning. The cleaning of any narrow-lumen medical dev ice used in patient care presents a major challenge to reprocessing areas. While attenti on has been focused on flexible endoscopes, cleaning issues related to other narrow-lumen medical devices such as sphinctertomes have been investigated 913. This study compared manual cleaning with that of automated cleaning with a narrow-lumen cleaner and found that only retro-flushing with the narrow lumen cleaner provided adequate cleaning of the three channels. If reprocessing was delayed for more than 24 hours, retro-flush cleaning was no longer effective and ETO sterilization failure was det ected when devices were held for 7 days 913. In another study involving simulated-use cleaning of laparoscopic devices, Alfa found that minimally the use of retro- flushing should be used during cleaning of non-ported laparoscopic devices914. Other Sterilization Methods Ionizing Radiation. Sterilization by ionizing radiation, primarily by cobalt 60 gamma rays or electron accelerators, is a low-temperature ster ilization method that has been used for a number of medical products (e.g., tissue for transplantation, phar maceuticals, medical devices). There are no FDA- cleared ionizing radiation sterilization processes for use in healthcare facilities. Because of high sterilization costs, this method is an unfavorabl e alternative to ETO and plasma sterilization in healthcare facilities but is suitable for large-scale sterilization. Some deleterious effects on patient-care equipment associated with gamma radiation include induced oxidation in polyethylene 915 and delamination and cracking in polyethylene knee bearings916. Several reviews 917, 918 dealing with the sources, effects, and application of ionizing radiation may be referred to for more detail. Dry-Heat Sterilizers . This method should be used only for materials that might be damaged by moist heat or that are impenetrable to moist heat (e .g., powders, petroleum produc ts, sharp instruments). The advantages for dry heat include the following: it is nontoxic and does not harm the environment; a dry heat cabinet is easy to install and has relatively low operating costs; it penetrates materials; and it is noncorrosive for metal and sharp instruments. The di sadvantages for dry heat are the slow rate of heat penetration and microbial killing makes this a time-consuming method. In addition, the high temperatures 68Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 are not suitable for most materials919. The most common time-temperature relationships for sterilization with hot air sterilizers are 170oC (340oF) for 60 minutes, 160oC (320oF) for 120 minutes, and 150oC (300oF) for 150 minutes. B. atrophaeus spores should be used to monitor the sterilization process for dry heat because they are more resistant to dry heat than are G. stearothermophilus spores. The primary lethal process is considered to be oxidation of cell constituents. There are two types of dry-heat sterilizers: the st atic-air type and the forced-air type. The static- air type is referred to as the oven-ty pe sterilizer as heating coils in the bottom of the unit cause the hot air to rise inside the chamber via gravity convection. This type of dry-heat steriliz er is much slower in heating, requires longer time to reach sterilizing tem perature, and is less uniform in temperature control throughout the chamber than is the forced-air type. T he forced-air or mechanical convection sterilizer is equipped with a motor-driven blower that circulates heated air throughout the chamber at a high velocity, permitting a more rapid transfer of energy from the air to the instruments920. Liquid Chemicals . Several FDA-cleared liquid chemical sterilants include indications for sterilization of medical devices (Tables 4 and 5)69. The indicated contact times range from 3 hours to 12 hours. However, except for a few of the products, the contact time is based only on the conditions to pass the AOAC Sporicidal Test as a sterilant and not on simulated use testing with devices. These solutions are commonly used as high-level disinfect ants when a shorter processing time is required. Generally, chemical liquid sterilants cannot be monitor ed using a biological indicator to verify sterility899, 900. The survival kinetics for thermal sterilizat ion methods, such as steam and dry heat, have been studied and characterized extensively, whereas the kinetics for sterilization with liquid sterilants are less well understood 921. The information that is available in the literature suggests that sterilization processes based on liquid chemical sterilants, in general, may not convey the same sterility assurance level as sterilization achieved using thermal or physical methods 823. The data indicate that the survival curves for liquid chemical sterilants may not exhibit log-linear kinetics and the shape of the survivor curve may vary depending of the formulation, chemical nature and stability of the liquid chem ical sterilant. In addition, the design of the AOAC Sporicidal Test does not provide quantification of the microbial challenge. Therefore, sterilization with a liquid chemical sterilant may not convey the same sterility assurance as other sterilization methods. One of the differences between thermal and liquid c hemical processes for sterilization of devices is the accessibility of microorganisms to the sterilant. Heat can penetrate barriers, such as biofilm, tissue, and blood, to attain organism kill, whereas liqui ds cannot adequately penetrate these barriers. In addition, the viscosity of some liquid chemical ster ilants impedes their access to organisms in the narrow lumens and mated surfaces of devices 922. Another limitation to sterilization of devices with liquid chemical germicides is the post- processing environment of the devic e. Devices cannot be wrapped or adequately contained during processing in a liquid chem ical sterilant to maintain sterility following processing and during storage. Furthermore, devices ma y require rinsing following exposure to the liquid chemical sterilant with water that ty pically is not sterile. Therefore, due to the inherent limitations of using liquid chemical sterilants, their us e should be restricted to reprocessi ng critical devices that are heat- sensitive and incompatible with other sterilization methods. Several published studies compare the sporicidal effect of liquid chemical germicides against spores of Bacillus and Clostridium 78, 659, 660, Performic Acid. Performic acid is a fast-acting spor icide that was incorporated into an automated endoscope reprocessing system400. Systems using performic acid are not currently FDA cleared. Filtration . Although filtration is not a lethalit y-based process and is not an FDA-cleared sterilization method, this technology is used to remove bacteria from t hermolabile pharmaceutical fluids 69Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 that cannot be purified by any other means. In order to remove bacteria, the membrane pore size (e.g., 0.22 m) must be smaller than the bacteria and uniform throughout923. Some investigators have appropriately questioned whether the removal of microor ganisms by filtration really is a sterilization method because of slight bacterial passage through filters, viral passage through filters, and transference of the sterile filtrate into the final container under aseptic conditions entail a risk of contamination924. Microwave. Microwaves are used in medicine for disi nfection of soft contact lenses, dental instruments, dentures, milk, and urinary cathet ers for intermittent self-catheterization925-931. However, microwaves must only be used with products that are compatible (e.g., do not melt) 931. Microwaves are radio-frequency waves, which are usually used at a frequency of 2450 MHz. The microwaves produce friction of water molecules in an alternating electrical field. The intermolecular friction derived from the vibrations generates heat and some authors believe t hat the effect of microwaves depends on the heat produced while others postulate a nonthermal lethal effect932-934. The initial reports showed microwaves to be an effective microbicide. The microwaves pr oduced by a \"home-type\" mi (2.45 GHz) bacterial cu ltures, mycobacteria, viruses, and G. stearothermophilus spores within 60 seconds to 5 minutes depending on the challenge organism933, 935-937. Another study confirmed these resuIts but also found that higher power microw aves in the presence of water may be needed for sterilization932. Complete destruction of Mycobacterium bovis was obtained with 4 minutes of microwave exposure (600W, 2450 MHz)937. The effectiveness of microwave ovens for different sterilization and disinfection purposes should be tested and demonstrated as test conditions affect the results (e.g., presence of water, microwave power). Sterilization of metal instruments can be accomplished but requires certain precautions. 926. Of concern is that home-type microwave ovens may not have even distribution of microwave energy over the entire dry device (there may be hot and cold spots on solid medical devices); hence there may be areas that are not sterilized or disinfected. The use of microwave ovens to disinfect intermittent-use catheters al so has been suggested. Researchers found that test bacteria (e.g., E. coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Candida albicans ) were eliminated from red rubber catheters within 5 minutes 931. Microwaves used for sterilization of medical devices have not been FDA cleared. Glass Bead \"Sterilizer\" . Glass bead \"sterilization\" uses small glass beads (1.2-1.5 mm diameter) and high temperature (217 oC -232oC) for brief exposure times (e .g., 45 seconds) to inactivate microorganisms. These devices have been used fo r several years in the dental profession938-940. FDA believes there is a risk of infection with this device because of potential failure to sterilize dental instruments and their use should be discontinued until the device has received FDA clearance. Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP\u00ae). Hydrogen peroxide solutions have been used as chemical sterilants for many years. However, the VHP \u00ae was not developed for the sterilization of medical equipment until the mid-1980s. One method for delivering VHP to the reaction site uses a deep vacuum to pull liquid hydrogen peroxide (30-35% c oncentration) from a disposable cartridge through a heated vaporizer and then, following vaporization, into the sterilization chamber. A second approach to VHP delivery is the flow-through approac h in which the VHP is carried into the sterilization chamber by a carrier gas such as air using either a slight negativ e pressure (vacuum) or slight positive pressure. Applications of this technology include vacuum syst ems for industrial sterilization of medical devices and atmospheric systems for decontaminating for large and small areas853. VHP offers several appealing features that include rapid cycle time (e.g., 30-45 mi nutes); low temperature; environmentally safe by- products (H 2O, oxygen [O 2]); good material compatibility; and ease of operation, installation and monitoring. VHP has limitations including that cellu lose cannot be processed; nylon becomes brittle; and VHP penetration capabilities are less than those of ETO. VHP has not been cleared by FDA for sterilization of medical devices in healthcare facilities. The feasibility of utilizing vapor-phase hy drogen peroxide as a surface decontaminant and sterilizer was evaluated in a centri fuge decontamination application. In this study, vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide was shown to possess significant sporicidal activity 941. In preliminary studies, hydrogen 70Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 peroxide vapor decontamination has been found to be a highly effective method of eradicating MRSA, Serratia marcescens, Clostridium botulinum spores and Clostridium difficile from rooms, furniture, surfaces and/or equipment; however, further investigat ion of this method to demonstrate both safety and effectiveness in reducing infection rates are required942-945. Ozone. Ozone has been used for years as a drinki ng water disinfectant. Ozone is produced when O 2 is energized and split into two monatomic (O 1) molecules. The monatomic oxygen molecules then collide with O 2 molecules to form ozone, which is O 3. Thus, ozone consists of O 2 with a loosely bonded third oxygen atom that is readily available to attach to, and oxidize, other molecules. This additional oxygen atom makes ozone a powerful oxidant that destroys microorganisms but is highly unstable (i.e., half-life of 22 mi nutes at room temperature). A new sterilization process, which uses ozone as the sterilant, was cleared by FDA in August 2003 for processing reusable medical devices. The sterilizer creates its own steril ant internally from USP grade oxygen, steam-quality water and electricity; t he sterilant is converted back to oxygen and water vapor at the end of the cycle by a passing through a catalyst before being exhausted into the room. The duration of the sterilization cycle is about 4 h and 15 m, and it occurs at 30-35 oC. Microbial efficacy has been demonstrated by achieving a SAL of 10-6 with a variety of microorganisms to include the most resistant microorganism, Geobacillus stearothermophilus . The ozone process is compatible with a wide range of commonly used materials including stainless steel, titanium, anodized aluminum, ceramic, glass, silica, PVC, Teflon, silicone, polypropylene, polyethylene and acrylic. In addition, rigid lumen dev ices of the following diameter and length can be processed: internal diameter (ID): > 2 mm, length 25 cm; ID > 3 mm, length 47 cm; and ID > 4 mm, length 60 cm. The process should be safe for use by the operat or because there is no handling of the sterilant, no toxic emissions, no residue to aerate, and low oper ating temperature means there is no danger of an accidental burn. The cycle is monitored using a self-contained biological indicator and a chemical indicator. The sterilization chamber is small, about 4 ft 3 (Written communication, S Dufresne, July 2004). A gaseous ozone generator was investigated fo r decontamination of rooms used to house patients colonized with MRSA. The results demons trated that the device te sted would be inadequate for the decontamination of a hospital room 946. Formaldehyde Steam . Low-temperature steam with formaldehy de is used as a low-temperature sterilization method in many countries, particula rly in Scandinavia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The process involves the use of formalin, which is vaporized into a formaldehyde gas that is admitted into the sterilization chamber. A formaldehyde concent ration of 8-16 mg/l is generated at an operating temperature of 70-75oC. The sterilization cycle consists of a series of stages that include an initial vacuum to remove air from the chamber and load, fo llowed by steam admission to the chamber with the vacuum pump running to purge the chamber of air and to heat the load, followed by a series of pulses of formaldehyde gas, followed by steam. Formaldehyde is removed from the sterilizer and load by repeated alternate evacuations and flushing with steam and air. This system has some advantages, e.g., the cycle time for formaldehyde gas is faster than that for ETO and the cost per cycle is relatively low. However, ETO is more penetrating and operates at lower tem peratures than do steam/formaldehyde sterilizers. Low-temperature steam formaldehyde sterilization has been found effectiv e against vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, B. atrophaeus and G. stearothermophilus spores and Candida albicans947-949. Formaldehyde vapor cabinets also may be used in healthcare facilities to sterilize heat-sensitive medical equipment 950. Commonly, there is no circulati on of formaldehyde and no temperature and humidity controls. The release of gas from parafor maldehyde tablets (placed on the lower tray) is slow and produces a low partial pressure of gas. The microbicidal quality of this procedure is unknown951. 71Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Reliable sterilization using formaldehyde is achieved when performed with a high concentration of gas, at a temperature between 60o and 80oC and with a relative humidity of 75 to 100%. Studies indicate that formaldehyde is a mutagen and a potential human carcinogen, and OSHA regulates formaldehyde. The permissible exposure limit for formaldehyde in work areas is 0.75 ppm measured as a 8-hour TWA. The OSHA standard in cludes a 2 ppm STEL (i.e., maximum exposure allowed during a 15-minute period). As with the ETO standard, the formaldehy de standard requires that the employer conduct initial monitoring to identif y employees who are exposed to formaldehyde at or above the action level or STEL. If this exposure level is maintained, employers may discontinue exposure monitoring until there is a change that coul d affect exposure levels or an employee reports formaldehyde-related signs and symptoms 269, 578. The formaldehyde steam st erilization system has not been FDA cleared for use in healthcare facilities. Gaseous chlorine dioxide. A gaseous chlorine dioxide system for sterilization of healthcare products was developed in the late 1980s 853, 952, 953. Chlorine dioxide is not mutagenic or carcinogenic in humans. As the chlorine dioxide concentration incr eases, the time required to achieve sterilization becomes progressively shorter. For example, only 30 minutes were required at 40 mg/l to sterilize the 106 B. atrophaeus spores at 30o to 32oC954. Currently, no gaseous chlorine dioxide system is FDA cleared. Vaporized Peracetic Acid . The sporicidal activity of peracet ic acid vapor at 20, 40, 60, and 80% relative humidity and 25oC was determined on Bacillus atrophaeus spores on paper and glass surfaces. Appreciable activity occurred within 10 minutes of expos ure to 1 mg of peracetic acid per liter at 40% or higher relative humidity955. No vaporized peracetic ac id system is FDA cleared. Infrared radiation . An infrared radiation prototype sterilizer was investigated and found to destroy B. atrophaeus spores. Some of the possible advantages of infrared technology include short cycle time, low energy consumption, no cycle residuals, and no toxicologic or environmental effects. This may provide an alternative technology for sterilization of selected heat-resistant in struments but there are no FDA-cleared systems for use in healthcare facilities 956. The other sterilization technologies mentioned above may be used for sterilization of critical medical items if cleared by the FDA and ideally, the microbicidal effectiveness of the technology has been published in the scientific literature. The selecti on and use of disinfectants, chemical sterilants and sterilization processes in the healthcare field is dy namic, and products may become available that are not in existence when this guideline was written. As newer disinfectants and ster ilization processes become available, persons or committees responsible for selecting disinfectants and sterilization processes should be guided by products cleared by FDA and EPA as well as information in the scientific literature. Sterilizing Practices Overview. The delivery of sterile products for us e in patient care depends not only on the effectiveness of the sterilization pr ocess but also on the unit design, decontamination, disassembling and packaging of the device, loading the sterilizer, monitoring, sterilant quality and quantity, and the appropriateness of the cycle for the load contents, and other aspects of device reprocessing. Healthcare personnel should perform most cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing of patient-care supplies in a central processing department in order to more easily contro l quality. The aim of central processing is the orderly processing of medical and surgical instruments to protect patients from infections while minimizing risks to staff and preserving the val ue of the items being reprocessed 957. Healthcare facilities should promote the same level of efficiency and safety in the preparation of supplies in other areas (e.g., operating room, respiratory therapy) as is practiced in central processing. Ensuring consistency of sterilization practice s requires a comprehensive program that ensures operator competence and proper methods of cleaning and wrapping instruments, loading the sterilizer, 72Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 operating the sterilizer, and monitoring of the entire process. Furthermore, care must be consistent from an infection prevention standpoint in all patient-care settings, such as hospital and outpatient facilities. Sterilization Cycle Verification. A sterilization process should be verified before it is put into use in healthcare settings. All steam, ETO, and ot her low-temperature sterilizers are tested with biological and chemical indicators upon installation, when the sterilizer is relocated, redesigned, after major repair and after a sterilization failure has occurr ed to ensure they are functioning prior to placing them into routine use. Three consecutive empty steam cycles are run with a biological and chemical indicator in an appropriate test package or tray. Each type of steam cycle used for sterilization (e.g., vacuum-assisted, gravity) is tested separately. In a prevacuum steam sterilizer three consecutive empty cycles are also run with a Bowie-Dick test. The st erilizer is not put back into use until all biological indicators are negative and chemical indica tors show a correct end-point response811-814, 819, 958. Biological and chemical indicator testing is also done for ongoing quality assurance testing of representative samples of actual products being sterilized and product testing when major changes are made in packaging, wraps, or load configuration. Biological and chemical indicators are placed in products, which are processed in a full load. When three consecutiv e cycles show negative biological indicators and chemical indicators with a correct end point response, you can put the change made into routine use 811-814, 958. Items processed during the three evaluation cycles should be quarantined until the test results are negative. Physical Facilities. The central processing area(s) ideally should be divided into at least three areas: decontamination, packaging, and sterilization and storage. Physic al barriers should separate the decontamination area from the other sections to contain contamination on used items. In the decontamination area reusable contaminated supplies (and possibly disposable items that are reused) are received, sorted, and decontaminated. T he recommended airflow pattern should contain contaminates within the decontamination area and minimi ze the flow of contaminates to the clean areas. The American Institute of Architects 959 recommends negative pressure and no fewer than six air exchanges per hour in the decontamination area ( AAMI recommends 10 air changes per hour) and 10 air changes per hour with positive pressure in the sterilizer equipment room. The packaging area is for inspecting, assembling, and packaging clean, but not st erile, material. The sterile storage area should be a limited access area with a controlled temperature (may be as high as 75oF) and relative humidity (30- 60% in all works areas except sterile storage, where the relative humidity should not exceed 70%)819. The floors and walls should be constructed of materials capable of withstanding chemical agents used for cleaning or disinfecting. Ceilings and wall surfaces should be constructed of non-shedding materials. Physical arrangements of processing areas are presented schematically in four references 811, 819, 920, 957. Cleaning. As repeatedly mentioned, items must be cleaned using water with detergents or enzymatic cleaners 465, 466, 468 before processing. Cleaning reduces the bioburden and removes foreign material (i.e., organic residue and inorganic salts) that interferes with the sterilization process by acting as a barrier to the sterilization agent179, 426, 457, 911, 912. Surgical instruments are generally presoaked or prerinsed to prevent drying of blood and tissue. Precleaning in patient-care areas may be needed on items that are heavily soiled with fece s, sputum, blood, or other material. Items sent to central processing without removing gross soil may be difficult to cl ean because of dried secretions and excretions. Cleaning and decontamination should be done as s oon as possible after items have been used. Several types of mechanical cleaning machines (e.g., utensil washer-sanitizer, ultrasonic cleaner, washer-sterilizer, dishwasher, washer-disinfecto r) may facilitate cleaning and decontamination of most items. This equipment often is automated and may increase productivity, improve cleaning effectiveness, and decrease worker exposure to blood and body flui ds. Delicate and intricate objects and heat- or moisture-sensitive articles may require careful cl eaning by hand. All used items sent to the central processing area should be considered contaminated ( unless decontaminated in the area of origin), handled with gloves (forceps or tongs are so metimes needed to avoid exposure to sharps), and decontaminated by one of the aforementioned methods to render them safer to handle. Items composed 73Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 of more than one removable part should be disassembled. Care should be taken to ensure that all parts are kept together, so that reasse mbly can be accomplished efficiently811. Investigators have described the degree of cleanliness by visual and microscopic examination. One study found 91% of the instrum ents to be clean visually but, when examined microscopically, 84% of the instruments had residual debris. Sites that contained residual debris included junctions between insulating sheaths and activating mechanisms of lapar oscopic instruments and articulations and grooves of forceps. More research is needed to understand the clinical significance of these findings 960 and how to ensure proper cleaning. Personnel working in the decontamination ar ea should wear household-cleaning-type rubber or plastic gloves when handling or cleaning contami nated instruments and devices. Face masks, eye protection such as goggles or full-length facesh ields, and appropriate gowns should be worn when exposure to blood and contaminated fluids may occur (e.g., when manually cleaning contaminated devices) 961. Contaminated instruments are a source of microorganisms that could inoculate personnel through nonintact skin on the hands or through contact wi th the mucous membranes of eyes, nose, or mouth214, 811, 813. Reusable sharps that have been in contac t with blood present a special hazard. Employees must not reach with their gloved hands into trays or containers that hold these sharps to retrieve them214. Rather, employees should use engineering cont rols (e.g., forceps) to retrieve these devices. Packaging. Once items are cleaned, dried, and inspected, those requiring sterilization must be wrapped or placed in rigid containers and should be arr anged in instrument trays/baskets according to the guidelines provided by the AAM I and other professional organizations 454, 811-814, 819, 836, 962. These guidelines state that hinged inst ruments should be opened; items with removable parts should be disassembled unless the device manufacturer or researcher s provide specific instructions or test data to the contrary181; complex instruments should be prepared and sterilized according to device manufacturer's instructions and test data; devices with concave surfaces should be positioned to facilitate drainage of water; heavy items should be positioned not to damage delicate items; and the weight of the instrument set should be based on the design and density of the instruments and t he distribution of metal mass811, 962. While there is no longer a specified sterilizat ion weight limit for surgical sets, heavy metal mass is a cause of wet packs (i.e., moisture inside t he case and tray after completion of the sterilization cycle)963. Other parameters that may influence drying ar e the density of the wraps and the design of the set964. There are several choices in methods to maintain sterility of surgical instruments, including rigid containers, peel-open pouches (e.g., self-sealed or heat-sealed plastic and paper pouches), roll stock or reels (i.e., paper-plastic combinations of tubing desi gned to allow the user to cut and seal the ends to form a pouch) 454 and sterilization wraps (woven and nonwoven). Healthcare facilities may use all of these packaging options. The packaging material must allow penetration of the sterilant, provide protection against contact contamination during handli ng, provide an effective barrier to microbial penetration, and maintain the sterility of the processed item after sterilization 965. An ideal sterilization wrap would successfully address barrier effectiveness, penetrability (i.e., allows sterilant to penetrate), aeration (e.g., allows ETO to dissipate), ease of use, drapeability, flexibility, puncture resistance, tear strength, toxicity, odor, waste dis posal, linting, cost, and transparency966. Unacceptable packaging for use with ETO (e.g., foil, polyvinylchloride, and polyvinylidene chlorine [kitchen-type transparent wrap]) 814 or hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (e.g., linens and paper) should not be used to wrap medical items. In central processing, double wrapping c an be done sequentially or nonsequentially (i.e., simultaneous wrapping). Wrapping should be done in such a manner to avoid tenting and gapping. The sequential wrap uses two sheets of the standard ster ilization wrap, one wrapped after the other. This procedure creates a package within a package. The nonsequential process uses two sheets wrapped at the same time so that the wrapping needs to be per formed only once. This latter method provides 74Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 multiple layers of protection of surgical instrum ents from contamination and saves time since wrapping is done only once. Multiple layers are still common practice due to the rigors of handling within the facility even though the barrier efficacy of a single sheet of wrap has improved over the years966. Written and illustrated procedures for preparation of items to be packaged should be readily available and used by personnel when packaging procedures are performed 454. Loading . All items to be sterilized should be arranged so all surfaces will be directly exposed to the sterilizing agent. Thus, loading procedures must allow for free circulation of steam (or another sterilant) around each item. Historically, it was recommended that muslin fabric packs should not exceed the maximal dimensions, weight, and density of 12 inc hes wide x 12 inches high x 20 inches long, 12 lbs, and 7.2 lbs per cubic foot, respectively . Due to the variety of textiles and metal/plastic containers on the market, the textile and metal/plastic container m anufacturer and the sterilizer manufacturers should be consulted for instructions on pack preparation and density parameters819. There are several important basic principles for loading a sterilizer: allow for proper sterilant circulation; perforated trays should be placed so the tray is parallel to the shelf; nonperforated containers should be placed on their edge (e.g., basins); small it ems should be loosely placed in wire baskets; and peel packs should be placed on edge in perforated or mesh bottom racks or baskets 454, 811, 836. Storage . Studies in the early 1970s suggested that wrapped surgical trays remained sterile for varying periods depending on the type of material used to wrap the trays. Safe storage times for sterile packs vary with the porosity of the wrapper and stor age conditions (e.g., open versus closed cabinets). Heat-sealed, plastic peel-down pouches and wrapped pa cks sealed in 3-mil (3/1000 inch) polyethylene overwrap have been reported to be sterile for as long as 9 months after sterilization. The 3-mil polyethylene is applied after sterilization to ex tend the shelf life for infrequently used items967. Supplies wrapped in double-thickness muslin comprising four laye rs, or equivalent, remain sterile for at least 30 days. Any item that has been sterilized should not be used after the expiration date has been exceeded or if the sterilized package is wet, torn, or punctured. Although some hospitals continue to date ever y sterilized product and use the time-related shelf- life practice, many hospitals have switched to an event -related shelf-life practice. This latter practice recognizes that the product should remain sterile until some event causes the item to become contaminated (e.g., tear in packaging, packaging becomes wet, seal is broken)968. Event-related factors that contribute to the contaminat ion of a product include bioburden (i.e., the amount of contamination in the environment), air movement, traffic, location, hum idity, insects, vermin, flooding, storage area space, open/closed shelving, temperature, and the properties of the wrap material966, 969. There are data that support the event-related shelf-life practice970-972. One study examined the effect of time on the sterile integrity of paper envelopes, peel pouches, and nylon sleeves. The most important finding was the absence of a trend toward an increased rate of cont amination over time for any pack when placed in covered storage971. Another evaluated the effectiveness of event-related outdating by microbiologically testing sterilized items. During t he 2-year study period, all of the items tested were sterile972. Thus, contamination of a sterile item is event-related and the probability of contamination increases with increased handling973. Following the sterilization process, medical and surgical devices must be handled using aseptic technique in order to prevent contamination. St erile supplies should be stored far enough from the floor (8 to 10 inches), the ceiling (5 inches unless near a sprinkler head [18 inches from sprinkler head]), and the outside walls (2 inches) to allow for adequate air circulation, ease of cleaning, and compliance with local fire codes (e.g., supplies must be at least 18 inches from sprinkler heads). Medical and surgical supplies should not be stored under sinks or in other lo cations where they can become wet. Sterile items that become wet are considered contaminated because mo isture brings with it microorganisms from the air and surfaces. Closed or covered cabinets are ideal but open shelving may be used for storage. Any package that has fallen or been dropped on the floor must be inspected for damage to the packaging and 75Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 contents (if the items are breakable). If the package is heat-sealed in impervious plastic and the seal is still intact, the package should be considered not c ontaminated. If undamaged, items packaged in plastic need not be reprocessed. Monitoring. The sterilization procedure should be monitor ed routinely by using a combination of mechanical, chemical, and biological indicators to evaluate the sterilizing condi tions and indirectly the microbiologic status of the process ed items. The mechanical monitors for steam sterilization include the daily assessment of cycle time and temperature by ex amining the temperature record chart (or computer printout) and an assessment of pressure via the pressure gauge. The mechanical monitors for ETO include time, temperature, and pressure recorders that provide data via computer printouts, gauges, and/or displays 814. Generally, two essential elements for ET O sterilization (i.e., the gas concentration and humidity) cannot be monitored in healthcare ETO sterilizers. Chemical indicators are convenient, are i nexpensive, and indicate that the item has been exposed to the sterilization process. In one study, c hemical indicators were more likely than biological indicators to inaccurately indicate sterilization at marginal sterilization times (e.g., 2 minutes) 847. Chemical indicators should be used in conjunction with biological indicators, but based on current studies should not replace them because they indicate steriliz ation at marginal sterilization time and because only a biological indicator consisting of resistant spor es can measure the microbial killing power of the sterilization process. 847, 974. Chemical indicators are affixed on t he outside of each pack to show that the package has been processed through a sterilization cycle, but these indicators do not prove sterilization has been achieved. Preferably, a chemical indicato r also should be placed on the inside of each pack to verify sterilant penetration. Chemical indicators us ually are either heat-or c hemical-sensitive inks that change color when one or more sterilization parameters (e.g., steam-time, temperature, and/or saturated steam; ETO-time, temperature, relative humidity and/or ETO concentration) are present. Chemical indicators have been grouped into five classes based on their ability to monitor one or multiple sterilization parameters 813, 819. If the internal and/or external indicator suggests inadequate processing, the item should not be used815. An air-removal test (Bowie-Dick Test) must be performed daily in an empty dynamic-air-removal sterilizer (e.g., prevac uum steam sterilizer) to ensure air removal. Biological indicators are recognized by most author ities as being closest to the ideal monitors of the sterilization process 974, 975 because they measure the sterilization process directly by using the most resistant microorganisms (i.e., Bacillus spores), and not by merely te sting the physical and chemical conditions necessary for sterilization. Since the Bacillus spores used in biological indicators are more resistant and present in greater numbers than are the common microbial contaminants found on patient-care equipment, the demonstration that the biological indicator has been inactivated strongly implies that other potential pathogens in the load have been killed 844. An ideal biological monitor of the sterilization process should be easy to use, be inexpensive, not be subject to exogenous contamination, provide positiv e results as soon as possible after the cycle so that corrective action may be accomplished, and provide positive results only when the sterilization parameters (e.g., steam-time, temper ature, and/or saturated steam; ETO-time, temperature, relative humidity and/or ETO concentration) are inadequate to kill microbial contaminates 847. Biological indicators are the only process indicators that directly monitor the lethality of a given sterilization process. Spores used to monitor a st erilization process have demonstrated resistance to the sterilizing agent and are more resistant than the bioburden found on medical devices 179, 911, 912. B. atrophaeus spores (106) are used to monitor ETO and dry heat, and G. stearothermophilus spores (105) are used to monitor steam sterilization, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid sterilizers. G. stearothermophilus is incubated at 55-60oC, and B. atrophaeus is incubated at 35-37oC. Steam and low temperature sterilizers (e.g., hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, peracetic acid) should be monitored at least weekly with the appropriate comme rcial preparation of spores . If a sterilizer is used frequently (e.g., several loads per day), daily use of biological indicators allows earlier discovery of 76Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 equipment malfunctions or procedural errors and thus minimizes the extent of patient surveillance and product recall needed in the event of a positive biological indicator811. Each load should be monitored if it contains implantable objects. If feasible, implantable items should not be used until the results of spore tests are known to be negative. Originally, spore-strip biological indicators r equired up to 7 days of incubation to detect viable spores from marginal cycles (i.e., when few spor es remained viable). The next generation of biological indicator was self-contained in plastic vials containing a spore-coated paper strip and a growth media in a crushable glass ampoule. This indicator had a maximum incubation of 48 hours but significant failures could be detected in 24 hours. A rapid-readout biological indi cator that detects the presence of enzymes of G. stearothermophilus by reading a fluorescent product produced by the enzymatic breakdown of a nonfluorescent substrate has been ma rketed for the more than 10 years. Studies demonstrate that the sensitivit y of rapid-readout tests for steam sterilization (1 hour for 132 oC gravity sterilizers, 3 hrs for 121oC gravity and 132oC vacuum sterilizers) parallels that of the conventional sterilization-specific biological indicators 846, 847, 976, 977 and the fluorescent rapid readout results reliably predict 24- and 48-hour and 7-day growth978. The rapid-readout biological indicator is a dual indicator system as it also detects acid metabo lites produced during growth of the G. stearothermophilus spores. This system is different from the indicator system consisting of an enzyme system of bacterial origin without spores. Independent comparativ e data using suboptimal sterilizati on cycles (e.g., reduced time or temperature) with the enzyme-based indicator system have not been published979. A new rapid-readout ETO biological indicator has been designed for rapid and reliable monitoring of ETO sterilization processes. The indicator has been cleared by the FDA for use in the United States 400. The rapid-readout ETO biological indicator detects the presence of B. atrophaeus by detecting a fluorescent signal indicating the acti vity of an enzyme present within the B. atrophaeus organism, beta- glucosidase. The fluorescence indicates the presence of an active spore-associated enzyme and a sterilization process failure. This indicator also det ects acid metabolites pr oduced during growth of the B. atrophaeus spore. Per manufacturer's data, the enzym e always was detected whenever viable spores were present. This was expected because the enzyme is relatively ETO resistant and is inactivated at a slightly longer exposure time than the spore. The rapid-readout ETO biological indicator can be used to monitor 100% ETO, and ETO-HCFC mixture sterilizat ion cycles. It has not been tested in ETO-CO 2 mixture sterilization cycles. The standard biological indicator used for monito ring full-cycle steam sterilizers does not provide reliable monitoring flash sterilizers 980. Biological indicators specifically designed for monitoring flash sterilization are now available, and studies comparing them have been published846, 847, 981. Since sterilization failure can occur (about 1% for steam) 982, a procedure to follow in the event of positive spore tests with steam sterilization has been provided by CDC and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN). The 1981 CDC recommendation is that \"objects, other than implantable objects, do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the steam sterilizer or the sterilization procedur e is defective.\" The rationale for this recommendation is that single positive spore tests in sterilizers occur sporadically. T hey may occur for reasons such as slight variation in the resistance of the spores 983, improper use of the sterilizer, and laboratory contamination during culture (uncommon with self-contained spore tests). If the mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure in the steam sterilizer) and chemical (internal and/or external) indicators suggest that the sterilizer was functioning properly, a single positive spore test probabl y does not indicate sterilizer malfunction but the spore test should be repeated immediately 983. If the spore tests remain pos itive, use of the sterilizer should be discontinued until it is serviced1. Similarly, AORN states that a single positive spore test does not necessarily indicate a sterilizer failure. If the test is positive, the sterilizer should immediately be rechallenged for proper use and function. Items, ot her than implantable ones, do not necessarily need to be recalled unless a sterilizer malfunction is found. If a sterilizer malfunction is discovered, the items must be considered nonsterile, and the items from t he suspect load(s) should be recalled, insofar as 77Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 possible, and reprocessed 984. A suggested protocol for management of positive biological indicators is shown in Table 12839. A more conservative approach also has been recommended 813 in which any positive spore test is assumed to represent st erilizer malfunction and requires that all materials processed in that sterilizer, dating from the sterilization cycle having t he last negative biologic indicator to the next cycle showing satisfactory biologic indicator challenge results, must be considered nonsterile and retrieved, if possible, and reprocessed. Th is more conservative approach should be used for sterilization methods other than steam (e.g., ETO, hy drogen peroxide gas plasma). However, no action is necessary if there is strong evidence for the biological indicator being defective 983 or the growth medium contained a Bacillus contaminant985 . If patient-care items were used before retrieval, the infection control professional should assess the risk of infection in collaboration with central processing, surgical services, and risk management staff. The factors that should be considered include the chem ical indicator result (e.g., nonreactive chemical indicator may indicate temperature not achieved); the results of other biological indicators that followed the positive biological indicator (e.g., positive on Tuesday, negative on Wednesday); the parameters of the sterilizer associated with the pos itive biological indicator (e.g., reduced time at correct temperature); the time-temperature chart (or printout); and the mi crobial load associated with decontaminated surgical instruments (e.g., 85% of decontaminated surgical in struments have less than 100 CFU). The margin of safety in steam sterilization is suffici ently large that there is minimal in fection risk associated with items in a load that show spore growth, especially if the item was proper ly cleaned and the temperature was achieved (e.g., as shown by acceptable chemical indi cator or temperature chart). There are no published studies that document disease transmission via a nonretrieved surgical instrument following a sterilization cycle with a positive biological indicator. False-positive biological indicators may occur fr om improper testing or faulty indicators. The latter may occur from improper storage, processing, produc t contamination, material failure, or variation in resistance of spores. Gram stain and subculture of a positive biological indicator may determine if a contaminant has created a false-positive result 839, 986. However, in one incident, the broth used as growth medium contained a contaminant, B. coagulans, which resulted in broth turbidity at 55oC985. Testing of paired biological indicators from different manuf acturers can assist in assessing a product defect839. False-positive biological indicators due to extrinsi c contamination when usi ng self-contained biological indicators should be uncommon. A biological indicato r should not be considered a false-positive indicator until a thorough analysis of the entire steriliz ation process shows this to be likely. The size and composition of the biological indi cator test pack should be standardized to create a significant challenge to air removal and sterilant penetration and to obtain interpretable results. There is a standard 16-towel pack recommended by AAMI for steam sterilization 813, 819, 987 consisting of 16 clean, preconditioned, reusable huck or absorbent surgical towe ls each of which is appr oximately 16 inches by 26 inches. Each towel is folded lengthwise into thir ds and then folded widthwise in the middle. One or more biological indicators are placed between the eight and ninth towels in the approximate geometric center of the pack. When the towels are fol ded and placed one on top of another, to form a stack (approximately 6 inch height) it should weigh approximately 3 pounds and should have a density of approximately 11.3 pounds per cubic foot813. This test pack has not gained universal use as a standard pack that simulates the actual in-use conditions of steam sterilizers. Commercially available disposable test packs that have been shown to be equivalent to the AAMI 16 towel test pack also may be used. The test pack should be placed flat in an otherwise fully loaded sterilizer chamber, in the area least favorable to sterilization (i.e., the area representing the greatest challenge to the biological indicator). This area is normally in the front, bottom secti on of the sterilizer, near the drain 811, 813. A control biological indicator from the lot used for testing should be left unexposed to the sterilant, and then incubated to verify the presterilization viability of the test spores and proper incubation. The most conservative approach would be to use a control for each run; however, less fr equent use may be adequate (e.g., weekly). There also is a routine test pack for ETO where a biological indi cator is placed in a plastic syringe with plunger, then placed in the folds of a clean surgical towel, and wrapped. Alternatively, commercially available disposal 78Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 test packs that have been shown to be equivalent to t he AAMI test pack may be used. The test pack is placed in the center of the sterilizer load814. Sterilization records (mechanical, chemical, and biological) should be retained for a time period in compliance with standards (e.g., Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Facilities requests 3 years) and state and federal regulations. In Europe, biological monitors are not used routinely to monitor the sterilization process. Instead, release of sterilizer items is based on monitoring the phy sical conditions of the ster ilization process that is termed \"parametric release.\" Parametric release requi res that there is a defined quality system in place at the facility performing the sterilization and that t he sterilization process be validated for the items being sterilized. At present in Europe, parametric releas e is accepted for steam, dry heat, and ionizing radiation processes, as the physical conditions are understood and can be monitored directly 988. For example, with steam sterilizers the load could be monitored with pr obes that would yield data on temperature, time, and humidity at representative locations in the chamber and compared to the specifications developed during the validation process. Periodic infection control rounds to areas using sterilizers to standardize the sterilizer's use may identify correctable variances in operator competence; documentation of steriliz ation records, including chemical and biological indicator test results; sterilizer maintenance and wrapping; and load numbering of packs. These rounds also may identify improvement activities to ensure that operators are adhering to established standards 989. 79Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 REUSE OF SINGLE-USE MEDICAL DEVICES The reuse of single-use medical devices began in t he late 1970s. Before this time most devices were considered reusable. Reuse of single-use devices increased as a cost-saving measure. Approximately 20 to 30% of U.S. hospitals reported t hat they reuse at least one type of single-use device. Reuse of single-use devices involv es regulatory, ethical, medical, legal and economic issues and has been extremely controversial for more than two decades990. The U.S. public has expressed increasing concern regarding the risk of infection and injury when reusing medical devices intended and labeled for single use. Although some investigators have demonstrated it is safe to reuse disposable medical devices such as cardiac electrode catheters, 991-993 additional studies are needed to define the risks 994 and document the benefits. In August 2000, FDA re leased a guidance document on single-use devices reprocessed by third parties or hospitals995. In this guidance document, FDA states that hospitals or third-party reprocessors will be considered \"manufacturers\" and regulat ed in the same manner. A reused single-use device will have to comply with the same regulatory requirements of the device when it was originally manufactured. This document presents FDA's intent to enforce premarket submission requirements within 6 months (February 2001) for cl ass III devices (e.g., cardiovascular intra-aortic balloon pump, transluminal coronary angioplasty cathet er); 12 months (August 2001) for class II devices (e.g., blood pressure cuff, bronchoscope biopsy forc eps); and 18 months (February 2002) for class I devices (e.g., disposable medical scissors, ophthalmi c knife). FDA uses tw o types of premarket requirements for nonexempt class I and II devices, a 510( k) submission that may have to show that the device is as safe and effective as the same devic e when new, and a premarket approval application. The 510(k) submission must provide scient ific evidence that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. FDA allowed hospitals a year to comply with the nonprem arket requirements (registration and listing, reporting adverse events associated with m edical devices, quality system regulations, and proper labeling). The options for hospitals are to stop repr ocessing single-use devices, comply with the rule, or outsource to a third-party reprocessor. FDA guidance document does not apply to permanently implantable pacemakers, hemodialyzers, opened but unus ed single-use devices, or healthcare settings other than acute-care hospitals. The reuse of singl e use medical devices continues to be an evolving area of regulations. For this reason, healthcare workers should refer to FDA for the latest guidance (www.fda.gov)996. 80Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 CONCLUSION When properly used, disinfection and sterilization can ensure the safe use of invasive and non- invasive medical devices. However, current disi nfection and sterilization guide lines must be strictly followed. 81Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 WED-BASED DISINFECTION AND STERILIZATION RESOURCES Additional information about disinfection and sterilization is available at the following dedicated websites: Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland http://www.fda.gov/dcrh/ode/germlab.html Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/sterile.html University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina http://www.disinfectionandsterilization.org 82Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DISINFECTION AND ST ERILIZATION IN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES A. Rationale The ultimate goal of the Recommendations fo r Disinfection and Sterilization in Health-Care Facilities, 2008, is to reduce rates of health-care-associated infections through appropriate use of both disinfection and sterilization. Each recommendation is categorized according to scientific evidence, theoretical rationale, applicability, and federal regulations. Examples are included in some recommendations to aid the reader; however, these ex amples are not intended to define the only method of implementing the recommendation. The CDC system for categorizi ng recommendations is defined in the following (Rankings) section. B. Rankings Category IA . Strongly recommended for implementati on and strongly supported by well-designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies. Category IB . Strongly recommended for implementati on and supported by some experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies, and by a strong theoretical rationale. Category IC. Required by state or federal regulations . Because of state differences, readers should not assume that the absence of an IC recommendation implies the absence of state regulations. Category II . Suggested for implementation and supported by suggestive clinical or epidemiologic studies or by a theoretical rationale. No recommendation . Unresolved issue. These include practices for which insufficient evidence or no consensus exists regarding efficacy. C. Recommendations 1. Occupational Health and Exposure a. Inform each worker of the possible health effect s of his or her exposure to infectious agents (e.g., hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and/or chemicals (e.g., EtO, formaldehyde). The information shoul d be consistent with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements and identify the areas and tasks in which potential exists for exposure. Category II, IC 214, 320, 959, 997, 998 b. Educate health-care workers in the selection and proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Category II, IC c. Ensure that workers wear appropriate PPE to preclude exposure to infectious agents or chemicals through the respiratory system, skin, or mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. PPE can include gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection. The exact type of PPE depends on the infectious or chemical agent and the anticipated duration of exposure. The employer is responsible for making such equipment and training available. Category II, IC . 214, 997- 999 d. Establish a program for monitoring occupati onal exposure to regulated chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde, EtO) that adheres to state and federal regulations. Category II, IC . 997, 1000, 1001 e. Exclude healthcare workers with weeping dermatitis of hands from direct contact with patient- care equipment. Category IB . 1002, 1003 2. Cleaning of Patient-Care Devices a. In hospitals, perform most cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of patient-care devices in a central processing department in order to more easily control quality. Category II . 454, 836, 959 b. Meticulously clean patient-care items with water and detergent, or with water and enzymatic cleaners before high-level disinfec tion or sterilization procedures. Category IB . 6, 104-106, 124, 179, 424-426, 436, 465, 471, 911-913, 1004 i. Remove visible organic residue (e.g., residue of blood and tissue) and inorganic salts with cleaning. Use cleaning agents t hat are capable of removing visible organic and inorganic residues. Category IB . 424-426, 466, 468, 469, 471, 908, 910 83Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 ii. Clean medical devices as soon as practical after use (e.g., at the point of use) because soiled materials become dried ont o the instruments. Dried or baked materials on the instrument make the removal process more difficult and the disinfection or sterilization proce ss less effective or ineffective. Category IB . 55, 56, 59, 291, 465, 1005, 1006 c. Perform either manual cleaning (i.e., using fric tion) or mechanical cleaning (e.g., with ultrasonic cleaners, washer-disinfector, washer-sterilizers). Category IB . 426, 456, 471, 999 d. If using an automatic washer/d isinfector, ensure that the unit is used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Category IB . 7, 133, 155, 725 e. Ensure that the detergents or enzymatic cleaners selected are compatible with the metals and other materials used in medical instruments. En sure that the rinse step is adequate for removing cleaning residues to levels that will not inte rfere with subsequent di sinfection/sterilization processes. Category II . 836, 1004 f. Inspect equipment surfaces for breaks in int egrity that would impair either cleaning or disinfection/sterilization. Discard or repair equipment that no longer functions as intended or cannot be properly cleaned, and disinfected or sterilized. Category II . 888 g. 3. Indications for Sterilization, High-Level Disinfection, and Low-Level Disinfection a. Before use on each patient, sterilize critical medical and surgical devices and instruments that enter normally sterile tissue or the vascular system or through which a sterile body fluid flows (e.g., blood). See recommendation 7g for exceptions. Category IA . 179, 497, 821, 822, 907, 911, 912 b. Provide, at a minimum, high-level tubes, anesthesia breathing circuits, and respiratory therapy equipment) that touches either mucous membranes or nonintact skin. Category IA . 6-8, 17, 20, 99, 101, 108, 113-115, 129, 138, 139, 147, 152-154, 471, 1007 c. disinfection for noncritical patient-care surfaces (e.g., bedrails, over-the-bed table) and equipment (e.g., blood pressure cuff) that touch intact skin (see Recommendation 5g). Category II . 17, 46-48, 50-52, 67, 68, 372, 373, 378, 382, 401 4. Selection and Use of Low-Level Disinfect ants for Noncritical Patient-Care Devices a. Process noncritical patient-care devices using a disinfectant and the c oncentration of germicide listed in Table 1. Category IB . 17, 46-48, 50-52, 67, 68, 378, 382, 401 b. Disinfect noncritical medical devices (e.g., bl ood pressure cuff) with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant using the label's safety precautions and use directions. Most EPA-registered hospital disinfectants have a label contact time of 10 minut es. However, multiple scientific studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hospital disinfect ants against pathogens with a contact time of at least 1 minute. By law, all applicable label instructions on EPA-registered products must be followed. If the user selects exposure conditions that differ from those on the EPA-registered product label, the user assumes liability from any injuries resulting from off-label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA. Category IB . 17, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53-57, 59, 60, 62-64, 355, 378, 382 c. Ensure that, at a minimum, noncritical patient -care devices are disinfected when visibly soiled and on a regular basis (such as after use on eac h patient or once daily or once weekly). Category II. 378, 380, 1008 d. If dedicated, disposable devices are not avail able, disinfect noncritical patient-care equipment after using it on a patient who is on contact precautions before using this equipment on another patient. Category IB . 47, 67, 391, 1009 5. Cleaning and Disinfecting Environm ental Surfaces in Healthcare Facilities a. Clean housekeeping surfaces (e.g., floors, tabl etops) on a regular basis, when spills occur, and when these surfaces are visibly soiled. Category II . 23, 378, 380, 382, 1008, 1010 b. Disinfect (or clean) environmental surfaces on a r egular basis (e.g., daily, three times per week) and when surfaces are visibly soiled. Category II . 378, 380, 402, 1008 c. Follow manufacturers' instructions fo r proper use of disinfecting (or detergent) products --- such as recommended use-dilution, material compat ibility, storage, shelf-life, and safe use and 84Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 disposal. Category II . 327, 365, 404 d. Clean walls, blinds, and window curtains in pati ent-care areas when these surfaces are visibly contaminated or soiled. Category II . 1011 e. Prepare disinfecting (or detergent) solutions as needed and replace these with fresh solution frequently (e.g., replace floor mopping solution ev ery three patient rooms, change no less often than at 60-minute intervals), according to the facility's policy. Category IB . 68, 379 f. Decontaminate mop heads and cleaning cloths regul arly to prevent contamination (e.g., launder and dry at least daily). Category II . 68, 402, 403 g. Use a one-step process and an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant designed for housekeeping purposes in patient care areas where 1) uncertainty exists about the nature of the soil on the surfaces (e.g., blood or body fluid contamination ve rsus routine dust or dirt ); or 2) uncertainty exists about the presence of multidrug resi stant organisms on such surfaces. See 5n for recommendations requiring cleaning and disi nfecting blood-contaminated surfaces. Category II . 23, 47, 48, 51, 214, 378, 379, 382, 416, 1012 h. Detergent and water are adequate for cleaning surfaces in nonpatient-care areas (e.g., administrative offices). Category II. 23 i. Do not use high-level disinfectants/liquid chem ical sterilants for disinfection of non-critical surfaces. Category IB . 23, 69, 318 j. Wet-dust horizontal surfaces regularly (e.g., daily, three time s per week) using clean cloths moistened with an EPA-registered hospital disinfec tant (or detergent). Pr epare the disinfectant (or detergent) as recommended by the manufacturer. Category II . 68, 378, 380, 402, 403, 1008 k. Disinfect noncritical surfaces with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant according to the label's safety precautions and use directions. Most EPA-registered hospital disinfectants have a label contact time of 10 minutes. However, many sci entific studies have demons trated the efficacy of hospital disinfectants against pathogens with a contact time of at least 1 minute. By law, the user must follow all applicable label instructions on EPA-registered products. If the user selects exposure conditions that differ from those on t he EPA-registered product label, the user assumes liability for any injuries resulting from off-label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA. Category II, IC . 17, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53-57, 59, 60, 62-64, 355, 378, 382 l. Do not use disinfectants to clean infant bassinets and incubators while these items are occupied. If disinfectants (e.g., phenolics) are used for the terminal cleaning of infant bassinets and incubators, thoroughly rinse the surfaces of t hese items with water and dry them before these items are reused. Category IB . 17, 739, 740 m. Promptly clean and decontaminate spills of blood and other potentially infectious materials. Discard blood-contaminated items in co mpliance with federal regulations. Category IB, IC . 214 n. For site decontamination of spills of blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM), implement the following procedures. Use prot ective gloves and other PPE (e.g., when sharps are involved use forceps to pick up sharps, and discard these items in a puncture-resistant container) appropriate for this task. Disinfect areas contaminated with blood spills using an EPA- registered tuberculocidal agent, a registered ger micide on the EPA Lists D and E (i.e., products with specific label claims for HIV or H BV or freshly diluted hypochlorite solution. Category II, IC . 214, 215, 557, 1013 If sodium hypochlorite solutions ar e selected use a 1:100 dilution (e.g., dilution of a 525-615 ppm available chlorine) to decontaminate nonporous surfaces after a small spill (e.g., <10 mL) of either blood or OPIM. If a spill involves large amounts (e.g., >10 mL) of blood or OPIM, or involves a culture spill in the laboratory, use a 1:10 dilution for the first applic ation of hypochlorite solution before cleaning in order to reduce the risk of infection during the cleaning process in the event of a sharp injury. Follow this decontamination process with a terminal disinfection, using a 1:100 dilution of sodium hypochlorite. Category IB, IC . 63, 215, 557 o. If the spill contains large amounts of blood or body fluids, clean the visible matter with disposable absorbent material, and discard the contaminated materials in appropriate, labeled containment. Category II, IC. 44, 214 p. Use protective gloves and ot her PPE appropriate for this task. Category II, IC . 44, 214 85Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 q. In units with high rates of endemic Clostridium difficile infection or in an outbreak setting, use dilute solutions of 5.25%-6.15% sodium hypochl orite (e.g., 1:10 dilution of household bleach) for routine environmental disinfection. Currently, no products are EPA -registered specifically for inactivating C. difficile spores. Category II . 257-259 r. If chlorine solution is not prepared fresh daily, it can be stored at room temperature for up to 30 days in a capped, opaque plastic bottle with a 50% reduction in chlorine concentration after 30 days of storage (e.g., 1000 ppm chlorine [approximat ely a 1:50 dilution] at day 0 decreases to 500 ppm chlorine by day 30). Category IB . 327, 1014 s. An EPA-registered sodium hypochlorite product is preferred, but if such products are not available, generic versions of sodium hypochlor ite solutions (e.g., household chlorine bleach) can be used. Category II. 44 6. Disinfectant Fogging a. Do not perform disinfectant fogging for routine purposes in patient-care areas. C ategory II . 23, 228 7. High-Level Disinfection of Endoscopes a. To detect damaged endoscopes, test each flexible endoscope for leaks as part of each reprocessing cycle. Remove from clinical use any instrument that fails the leak test, and repair this instrument. Category II . 113, 115, 116 b. Immediately after use, meticulously clean the endoscope with an enzymatic cleaner that is compatible with the endoscope. Cleaning is necessary before both automated and manual disinfection. Category IA . 83, 101, 104-106, 113, 115, 116, 124, 126, 456, 465, 466, 471, 1015 c. Disconnect and disassemble endoscopic com ponents (e.g., suction valves) as completely as possible and completely immerse all components in the enzymatic cleaner. Steam sterilize these components if they are heat stable. Category IB . 115, 116, 139, 465, 466 d. Flush and brush all accessible channels to remove all organic (e.g., blood, tissue) and other residue. Clean the external surfaces and accessori es of the devices by using a soft cloth or sponge or brushes. Continue brushing until no debris appears on the brush. Category IA 6, 17, 108, 113, 115, 116, 137, 145, 147, 725, 856, 903. e. Use cleaning brushes appropriate for the size of the endoscope channel or port (e.g., bristles should contact surfaces). Cleaning items (e.g., br ushes, cloth) should be disposable or, if they are not disposable, they should be thoroughly cleaned and either high-level disinfected or sterilized after each use. Category II . 113, 115, 116, 1016 f. Discard enzymatic cleaners (or detergents) after each use because they are not microbicidal and, therefore, will not retard microbial growth. Category IB . 38, 113, 115, 116, 466 g. Process endoscopes (e.g., arthroscopes, cysto scope, laparoscopes) that pass through normally sterile tissues using a sterilization procedure before each use; if this is not feasible, provide at least high-level disinfection. High-level di sinfection of arthroscopes, laparoscopes, and cytoscopes should be followed by a sterile water rinse. Category IB . 1, 17, 31, 32, 35, 89, 90, 113, 554 h. Phase out endoscopes that are critical item s (e.g., arthroscopes, laparoscopes) but cannot be steam sterilized. Replace these endoscopes with steam sterilizable instruments when feasible. Category II . i. Mechanically clean reusable accessories inserted into endoscopes (e.g., bi opsy forceps or other cutting instruments) that break the mucosal barrier (e.g., ultrasonically clean biopsy forceps) and then sterilize these items between each patient. Category IA . 1, 6, 8, 17, 108, 113, 115, 116, 138, 145, 147, 153, 278 j. Use ultrasonic cleaning of reusable endoscopic accessories to remove soil and organic material from hard-to-clean areas. Category II . 116, 145, 148 k. Process endoscopes and accessories that contact mucous membranes as semicritical items, and use at least high-level disinfection after use on each patient. Category IA . 1, 6, 8, 17, 108, 113, 115, 116, 129, 138, 145-148, 152-154, 278 l. Use an FDA-cleared sterilant or high-level disinf ectant for sterilization or high-level disinfection (Table 1). Category IA . 1, 6-8, 17, 85, 108, 113, 115, 116, 147 m. After cleaning, use formulations containi ng glutaraldehyde, glutaraldehyde with phenol/phenate, 86Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 ortho-phthalaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and both hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid to achieve high-level disinfection followed by rinsing and drying (see Table 1 for recommended concentrations). Category IB . 1, 6-8, 17, 38, 85, 108, 113, 145-148 n. Extend exposure times beyond the minimum effectiv e time for disinfecting semicritical patient- care equipment cautiously and conservative ly because extended exposure to a high-level disinfectant is more likely to damage delicate and intricate instruments such as flexible endoscopes. The exposure times vary among t he Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared high-level disinfectants (Table 2). Category IB . 17, 69, 73, 76, 78, 83 o. Federal regulations are to follow the FDA-cleared label claim for high-level disinfectants. The FDA-cleared glutaraldehyde at 25oC range from 20-90 minutes, depending upon the product based on three tier testing which includes AOAC sporicidal tests, simulated use testing with mycobacterial and in-use testing. Category IC . p. Several scientific studies and professional organizations support the efficacy of >2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at 20\u00baC; that efficacy assumes adequate cleaning prior to disinfection, whereas the FDA-cleared label clai m incorporates an added margin of safety to accommodate possible lapses in cleaning practice s. Facilities that have chosen to apply the 20 minute duration at 20\u00baC have done so based on the IA recommendation in the July 2003 SHEA position paper, \"Multi-society Guideline for Reprocessing Flexible Gastrointestinal Endoscopes 12, 17, 19, 26, 27, 49, 55, 57, 58, 60, 73, 76, 79-81, 83-85, 93, 94, 104-106, 110, 111, 115-121, 124, 125, 233, 235, 236, 243, 265, 266, 609 q. When using FDA-cleared high-level disinfectants, use manufacturers' recommended exposure conditions. Certain products may require a shorter exposure time (e.g., 0.55% ortho- phthalaldehyde for 12 minutes at 20oC, 7.35% hydrogen peroxide plus 0.23% peracetic acid for 15 minutes at 20oC) than glutaraldehyde at room temperat ure because of their rapid inactivation of mycobacteria or reduced exposure time becaus e of increased mycobactericidal activity at elevated temperature (e.g., 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 5 minutes at 35oC). Category IB . 83, 100, 689, 693, 694, 700 r. Select a disinfectant or chemical sterilant that is compatible with the device that is being reprocessed. Avoid using reprocessi ng chemicals on an endoscope if the endoscope manufacturer warns against using these chemical s because of functional damage (with or without cosmetic damage). Category IB . 69, 113, 116 s. Completely immerse the endoscope in the hi gh-level disinfectant, and ensure all channels are perfused. As soon as is feasible, phase out nonimmersible endoscopes. Category IB . 108, 113-116, t. After high-level disinfection, rinse endoscopes and flush channels with sterile water, filtered water, or tapwater to prevent adverse effects on patients associated with disinfectant retained in the endoscope (e.g., disinfectant induced colitis). Fo llow this water rinse with a rinse with 70% - 90% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. Category IB . 17, 31-35, 108, 113, 115, 116, 134, 145-148, 620-622, 624-630, 1017 u. After flushing all channels with alcohol, pur ge the channels using forced air to reduce the likelihood of contamination of the endoscope by waterborne pathogens and to facilitate drying.

After st erilizing or high-level disinfecting the water bottle, fill it with sterile water. Category IB . 10, 31-35, 113, 116, 1017 y. Maintain a log for each procedure and record the following: patient's name and medical record number (if available), procedure, date, endoscopi st, system used to reprocess the endoscope (if more than one system could be used in the r eprocessing area), and serial number or other identifier of the endoscope used. Category II . 108, 113, 115, 116 z. Design facilities where endoscopes are used and di sinfected to provide a safe environment for healthcare workers and patients. Use air-exchange equipment (e.g., the ventilation system, out- exhaust ducts) to minimize exposure of all persons to potentially toxic vapors (e.g., 87Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 glutaraldehyde vapor). Do not ex ceed the allowable limits of the vapor concentration of the chemical sterilant or high-level disinf ectant (e.g., those of ACGIH and OSHA). Category IB, IC . 116, 145, 318, 322, 577, 652 aa. Routinely test the liquid sterilant/high-level di sinfectant to ensure minimal effective concentration of the active ingredient. Check the solution each day of use (or more frequently) using the appropriate chemical indicator (e.g., glutaraldehyde chemical indicator to test minimal effective concentration of glutaraldehyde) and document the results of this te sting. Discard the solution if the chemical indicator shows the concentration is less than the minimum effective concentration. Do not use the liquid sterilant/high-level disi nfectant beyond the reus e-life recommended by the manufacturer (e.g., 14 days for ortho-phthalaldehyde). Category IA . 76, 108, 113, 115, 116, 608, 609 bb. Provide personnel assigned to reprocess endo scopes with device-specific reprocessing instructions to ensure proper cleaning and high-le vel disinfection or sterilization. Require competency testing on a regular basis (e.g., begi nning of employment, annually) of all personnel who reprocess endoscopes. Category IA . 6-8, 108, 113, 115, 116, 145, 148, 155 cc.

Make PPE(e.g., gloves, gowns, eyewear, face ma sk or shields, respiratory protection devices) available and use these items appropriately to pr otect workers from exposure to both chemicals and microorganisms (e.g., HBV). Category IB, IC . 115, 116, 214, 961, 997, 998, 1020, 1021 ee. If using an automated endoscope reprocessor (AER), place the endoscope in the reprocessor and attach all channel connectors according to the AER manufacturer's instructions to ensure exposure of all internal surfaces to the high-level disinfectant/chemical sterilant. Category IB . 7, 8, 115, 116, 155, 725, 903 ff. If using an AER, ensure the endoscope can be effect ively reprocessed in the AER. Also, ensure any required manual cleaning/disinfecting steps ar e performed (e.g., elevator wire channel of duodenoscopes might not be effectivel y disinfected by most AERs). Category IB . 7, 8, 115, 116, 155, 725 gg. Review the FDA advisories and t he scientific literature for reports of deficiencies that can lead to infection because design flaws and improper oper ation and practices have compromised the effectiveness of AERs.

No recommendation is made regarding the r eprocessing of an endoscope again immediately before use if that endoscope has been processed a fter use according to the recommendations in this guideline. Unresolved issue . 157 oo. Compare the reprocessing instructions pr ovided by both the endoscope's and the AER's manufacturer's instructions and reso lve any conflicting recommendations. Category IB . 116, 155 8. Management of Equipment and Surfaces in Dentistry a. Dental instruments that penetrate soft tiss ue or bone (e.g., extraction forceps, scalpel blades, bone chisels, periodontal scalers, and surgical bur s) are classified as critical and should be 88Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 sterilized after each use or discarded. In addition, after each use, sterilize dental instruments that are not intended to penetrate oral soft tissue or bone (e.g., amalgam condensers, air-water syringes) but that might contact oral tiss ues and are heat-tolerant, although classified as semicritical. Clean and, at a minimum, high-leve l disinfect heat-sensitive semicritical items. Category IA . 43, 209-211 b. Noncritical clinical contact surfaces, such as uncovered operat ory surfaces (e.g., countertops, switches, light handles), should be barrier-protected or disinfected between patients with an intermediate-disinfectant (i.e., EPA-registered hospita l disinfectant with a tuberculocidal claim) or low-level disinfectant (i.e., EPA-registered hos pital disinfectant with HIV and HBV claim). Category IB . 43, 209-211 c. Barrier protective coverings can be used for noncriti cal clinical contact su rfaces that are touched frequently with gloved hands during the delivery of patient care, that are likely to become contaminated with blood or body substances, or that are difficult to clean. Change these coverings when they are visibly soiled, when they become damaged, and on a routine basis (e.g., between patients). Disinf ect protected surfaces at the end of the day or if visibly soiled. Category II. 43, 210 9. Processing Patient-Care Equipment Cont aminated with Bloodborne Pathogens Enterococci, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), or Bioterrorist Agents a. Use standard sterilization and disinfection procedures for patient-care equipment (as recommended in this guideline), because these procedures are adequate to sterilize or disinfect instruments or devices contaminated with blood or other body fluids from persons infected with bloodborne pathogens or emerging pathogens, with the exception of prions. No changes in these procedures for cleaning, disinfecting, or st erilizing are necessary for removing bloodborne and emerging pathogens other than prions. Category IA . 22, 53, 60-62, 73, 79-81, 105, 118-121, 125, 126, 221, 224-234, 236, 244, 265, 266, 271-273, 279, 282, 283, 354-357, 666 10. Disinfection Strategies fo r Other Semicritical Devices a. Even if probe covers have been used, clean and high- level disinfect other semicritical devices such as rectal probes, vaginal probes, and cryosurgic al probes with a product that is not toxic to staff, patients, probes, and retrieved germ cells (if applicable). Use a high-level disinfectant at the FDA-cleared exposure time. (See Recommendations 7o and 11e for exceptions.) Category IB . 6-8, 17, 69 b. When probe covers are available, use a probe co ver or condom to reduce the level of microbial contamination. Category II . 197-201 Do not use a lower category of disinfection or cease to follow the appropriate disinfectant recommendations when using probe covers because these sheaths and condoms can fail. Category IB 197-201 c. After high-level disinfection, rinse all items. Use sterile water, filtered water or tapwater followed by an alcohol rinse for semicritical equipment t hat will have contact with mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract (e .g., nose, pharynx, esophagus). Category II . 10, 31-35, 1017 d. There is no recommendation to use sterile or filtered water rather than tapwater for rinsing semicritical equipment that contact the mucous membranes of the rectum (e.g., rectal probes, anoscope) or vagina (e.g., vaginal probes). Unresolved issue. 11 e. Wipe clean tonometer tips and then disinfect them by immersing for 5-10 minutes in either 5000 ppm chlorine or 70% ethyl alcohol. None of thes e listed disinfectant products are FDA-cleared high-level disinfectants. Category II . 49, 95, 185, 188, 293 11. Disinfection by Healthcare Personnel in Ambulatory Care and Home Care a. Follow the same classification scheme descri bed above (i.e., that critical devices require sterilization, semicritical devices require high-level disinfection, and noncritical equipment 89Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 requires low-level disinfection) in the ambulatory-care (outpatient medical/surgical facilities) setting because risk for infection in this setting is similar to that in the hospital setting (see Table 1). Category IB . 6-8, 17, 330 b. When performing care in the home, clean and disinfect reusable objects that touch mucous membranes (e.g., tracheostomy 1:50 dilution of hypochlorite (household bleach) nutes), 70% isopropyl alcohol (5 minutes), or 3% hydrogen peroxide (30 minutes) because the hom e environment is, in most instances, safer than either hospital or ambulatory care setti ngs because person-to-person transmission is less likely. Category II . 327, 328, 330, 331 c. Clean noncritical items that would not be shar ed between patients (e.g., crutches, blood pressure cuffs) in the home setting with a detergent or commercial household disinfectant. Category II . 53, 330 12. Microbial Contamination of Disinfectants a. Institute the following control measures to r educe the occurrence of cont aminated disinfectants: 1) prepare the disinfectant correctly to achi eve the manufacturer's recommended use-dilution; and 2) prevent common sources of extrinsic c ontamination of germicides (e.g., container contamination or surface contami nation of the healthcare environment where the germicide are prepared and/or used). Category IB . 404, 406, 1024 13. Flash Sterilization a. Do not flash sterilize implanted surgical devices unless doing so is unavoidable. Category IB . 849, 850 b. Do not use flash sterilization for convenienc e, as an alternative to purchasing additional instrument sets, or to save time. Category II. 817, 962 c. When using flash sterilization, make sure the following parameters are met: 1) clean the item before placing it in the sterilizing container (that are FDA cleared for use with flash sterilization) or tray; 2) prevent exogenous contami nation of the item during transpor t from the sterilizer to the patient; and 3) monitor sterilizer function with mechanical, chemical, and biologic monitors. Category IB . 812, 819, 846, 847, 962 d. Do not use packaging materials and containers in flash sterilization cycles unless the sterilizer and the packaging material/container are designed for this use. Category IB . 812, 819, 1025 e. When necessary, use flash sterilization for patient-care items that will be used immediately (e.g., to reprocess an inadvert ently dropped instrument). Category IB . 812, 817, 819, 845 f. When necessary, use flash sterilization for processing patient-care items that cannot be packaged, sterilized, and stored before use. Category IB . 812, 819 14. Methods of Sterilization a. Steam is the preferred method for sterilizing critical medical and surgical instruments that are not damaged by heat, steam, pressure, or moisture. Category IA . 181, 271, 425, 426, 827, 841, 1026, 1027 b. Cool steam- or heat-sterilized items before t hey are handled or used in the operative setting. Category IB . 850 c. Follow the sterilization times, temperat ures, and other operating parameters (e.g., gas concentration, humidity) recommended by the manufacturers of the instruments, the sterilizer, and the container or wrap used, and that are cons istent with guidelines published by government agencies and professional organizations. Category IB . 811-814, 819, 825, 827, 841, 1026-1028 d. Use low-temperature sterilization technologies (e.g., EtO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma) for reprocessing critical patient-care equipment that is heat or moisture sensitive. Category IA 469, 721, 825, 856, 858, 878, 879, 881, 882, 890, 891, 1027. e. Completely aerate surgical and medical items that have been sterilized in the EtO sterilizer (e.g., polyvinylchloride tubing requires 12 hours at 50oC, 8 hours at 60oC) before using these items in patient care. Category IB . 814 f. Sterilization using the peracetic acid immersion system can be used to sterilize heat-sensitive 90Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 immersible medical and surgical items. Category IB . 90, 717-719, 721-724 g. Critical items that have been sterilized by the peracetic acid immersion process must be used immediately (i.e., items are not completely pr otected from contamination, making long-term storage unacceptable). Category II . 817, 825 h. Dry-heat sterilization (e.g., 340oF for 60 minutes) can be used to sterilize items (e.g., powders, oils) that can sustain high temperatures. Category IB . 815, 827 i. Comply with the sterilizer manufacturer's inst ructions regarding the sterilizer cycle parameters (e.g., time, temperature, concentration). Category IB . 155, 725, 811-814, 819 j. Because narrow-lumen devices provide a c hallenge to all low-temperature sterilization technologies and direct contact is necessary for the sterilant to be effe ctive, ensure that the sterilant has direct contact with contaminated su rfaces (e.g., scopes proce ssed in peracetic acid must be connected to channel irrigators). Category IB . 137, 725, 825, 856, 890, 891, 1029 15. Packaging a. Ensure that packaging materials are compatib le with the sterilization process and have received FDA 510[k] clearance. Category IB . 811-814, 819, 966 b. Ensure that packaging is sufficiently strong to resist punctures and tears to provide a barrier to microorganisms and moisture. Category IB. 454, 811-814, 819, 966 16. Monitoring of Sterilizers a. Use mechanical, chemical, and biologic monitors to ensure the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Category IB . 811-815, 819, 846, 847, 975-977 b. Monitor each load with mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure) and chemical (internal and external) indicators. If the internal chemical indicator is visible, an external indicator is not needed. Category II . 811-815, 819, 846, 847, 975-977, 980 c. Do not use processed items if the mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure) or chemical (internal and/or external) indica tors suggest inadequate processing. Category IB 811-814, 819. d. Use biologic indicators to monitor the effect iveness of sterilizers at least weekly with an FDA- cleared commercial preparation of spores (e.g., Geobacillus stearothermophilus for steam) intended specifically for the type and cycle parameters of the sterilizer. Category IB . 1, 811, 813-815, 819, 846, 847, 976, 977 e. After a single positive biologic indicator used wi th a method other than steam sterilization, treat as nonsterile all items that have been processed in that sterilizer, dating from the sterilization cycle having the last negative biol ogic indicator to the next cycle showing satisfactory biologic indicator results. These nonsterile items s hould be retrieved if possible and reprocessed. Category II . 1 f. After a positive biologic indicator with steam steriliz ation, objects other than implantable objects do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the sterilizer or the sterilization procedure is defective as determined by maintenance personnel or inappropriate cycle settings. If additional spore tests remain positive, consider the items nonsterile and recall and reprocess the items from the implicated load(s) . Category II . 1 g. Use biologic indicators for every load c ontaining implantable items and quarantine items, whenever possible, until the bi ologic indicator is negative. Category IB . 811-814, 819 17. Load Configuration. a. Place items correctly and loosely into the basket, shelf, or cart of the sterilizer so as not to impede the penetration of the sterilant. Category IB . 445, 454, 811, 813, 819, 836 18. Storage of Sterile Items a. Ensure the sterile storage area is a well-vent ilated area that provides protection against dust, moisture, insects, and temperature and humidity extremes. Category II . 454, 819, 836, 969 b. Store sterile items so the packaging is not compromised (e.g., punctured, bent). Category II . 454, 816, 819, 968, 969, 1030 91Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 c. Label sterilized items with a load number that i ndicates the sterilizer used, the cycle or load number, the date of sterilization, and, if applicable, the expiration date. Category IB . 811, 812, 814, 816, 819 d. The shelf life of a packaged sterile item depends on the quality of the wrapper, the storage conditions, the conditions during transport, the amount of handling, and other events (moisture) that compromise the integrity of the package. If event-related storage of sterile items is used, then packaged sterile items can be used indefinitel y unless the packaging is compromised (see f and g below). Category IB . 816, 819, 836, 968, 973, 1030, 1031 e. Evaluate packages before use for loss of integr ity (e.g., torn, wet, punctured). The pack can be used unless the integrity of the packaging is compromised. Category II. 819, 968 f. If the integrity of the packaging is compro mised (e.g., torn, wet, or punctured), repack and reprocess the pack before use. Category II . 819, 1032 g. If time-related storage of sterile items is used, label the pack at the time of sterilization with an expiration date. Once this dat e expires, reprocess the pack. Category II . 819, 968 19. Quality Control a. Provide comprehensive and intensive training for all staff assigned to reprocess semicritical and critical medical/surgical instruments to ens ure they understand the impor tance of reprocessing these instruments. To achieve and maintain com petency, train each member of the staff that reprocesses semicritical and/or critical inst ruments as follows: 1) provide hands-on training according to the institutional policy for reprocessi ng critical and semicritical devices; 2) supervise all work until competency is documented for eac h reprocessing task; 3) conduct competency testing at beginning of employment and regularly thereafter (e.g., annually); and 4) review the written reprocessing instructions regularly to ens ure they comply with t he scientific literature and the manufacturers' instructions. Category IB. 6-8, 108, 114, 129, 155, 725, 813, 819 b. Compare the reprocessing instructions (e.g ., for the appropriate use of endoscope connectors, the capping/noncapping of specific lumens) prov ided by the instrument manufacturer and the sterilizer manufacturer and resolve any conflicti ng recommendations by communicating with both manufacturers. Category IB . 155, 725 c. Conduct infection control rounds periodically (e.g., annually) in high-risk reprocessing areas (e.g., the Gastroenterology Clinic, Central Processing) ; ensure reprocessing instructions are current and accurate and are correctly implemented. Do cument all deviations from policy. All stakeholders should identify what corre ctive actions will be implemented. Category IB. 6-8, 129 d. Include the following in a quality control progr am for sterilized items: a sterilizer maintenance contract with records of service; a system of process monitoring; air-removal testing for prevacuum steam sterilizers; visual inspection of packaging materials; and traceability of load contents. Category II 811-814, 819. e. For each sterilization cycle, record the type of sterilizer and cy cle used; the load identification number; the load contents; the ex posure parameters (e.g., time and temperature); the operator's name or initials; and the results of mechani cal, chemical, and biological monitoring. Category II 811-814, 819. f. Retain sterilization records (mechanical, chemical , and biological) for a time period that complies with standards (e.g., 3 years), statutes of limitations, and state and federal regulations. Category II, IC . 1033 g. Prepare and package items to be sterilized so that sterility can be achieved and maintained to the point of use. Consult the Asso ciation for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation or the manufacturers of surgical instruments, steriliz ers, and container systems for guidelines for the density of wrapped packages. Category II . 811-814, 819 h. Periodically review policies and procedures for sterilization. Category II . 1033 i. Perform preventive maintenance on sterilizer s by qualified personnel who are guided by the manufacturer's instruction. Category II . 811-814, 819 92Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 20. Reuse of Single-Use Medical Devices a. Adhere to the FDA enforcement document for si ngle-use devices reproce ssed by hospitals. FDA considers the hospital that reprocesses a singl e-use device as the manufacturer of the device and regulates the hospital using the same standards by which it regulates the original equipment manufacturer. Category II, IC . 995 93Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 1. Monitor adherence to high-level disinfection and/or sterilization guidelines for endoscopes on a regular basis. This monitoring should include ensur ing the proper training of persons performing reprocessing and their adherence to all endosc ope reprocessing steps, as demonstrated by competency testing at commencem ent of employment and annually. 2. Develop a mechanism for the occupational heal th service to report all adverse health events potentially resulting from exposure to disinfec tants and sterilants; review such exposures; and implement engineering, work practice, and PPE to prevent future exposures. 3. Monitor possible sterilization failures that resulted in instrument recall. Assess whether additional training of personnel or equipment maintenance is required. 94Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors gratefully acknowledge Eva P. Clontz, M.S., for her assistance in referencing this guideline. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee thanks the following experts for reviewing a draft of this guideline: Martin S. Favero, Ph.D., Syed A. Sattar, Ph.D., A. Denver Russell, D.Sc., and Martin Exner, M.D. The opinions of the reviewer s might not be reflected in all the recommendations contained in this document. 95Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 GLOSSARY Action level : concentration of a regulated substance (e.g ., ethylene oxide, formaldehyde) within the employee breathing zone, above which OSHA requirements apply. Activation of a sterilant : process of mixing the contents of a c hemical sterilant that come in two containers (small vial with the activator solution; container of the chemical ) Keeping the two chemicals separate until use extends the s helf life of the chemicals. Aeration: method by which ethylene oxide (EtO) is re moved from EtO-sterilized items by warm air circulation in an enclosed cabinet s pecifically designed for this purpose. Antimicrobial agent : any agent that kills or suppresse s the growth of microorganisms. Antiseptic: substance that prevents or a rrests the growth or action of microorganisms by inhibiting their activity or by destroying them. The term is used especially for preparations applied topically to living tissue. Asepsis : prevention of contact with microorganisms. Autoclave: device that sterilizes instruments or other obj ects using steam under pressure. The length of time required for sterilization depends on temperature, vacuum, and pressure. Bacterial count : method of estimating the number of bacteria per unit sample. The term also refers to the estimated number of bacteria per unit sample, us ually expressed as number of colony-forming units. Bactericide : agent that kills bacteria. Bioburden : number and types of viable microorganisms with which an item is contaminated; also called bioload or microbial load . Biofilm : accumulated mass of bacteria and extracellular ma terial that is tightly adhered to a surface and cannot be easily removed. Biologic indicator : device for monitoring the sterilization process. The device consists of a standardized, viable population of microorganisms (usually bacterial spores) known to be resistant to the sterilization process being monitored. Biologic indicators ar e intended to demonstrate whether conditions were adequate to achieve sterilization. A negat ive biologic indicator does not prov e that all items in the load are sterile or that they were all ex posed to adequate sterilization conditions. Bleach : Household bleach (5.25% or 6.00%-6.15% sodium hypochlorite depending on manufacturer) usually diluted in water at 1:10 or 1:100. Approximate dilutions are 1.5 c ups of bleach in a gallon of water for a 1:10 dilution (~6,000 ppm) and 0.25 cup of bleach in a gallon of water for a 1:100 dilution (~600 ppm). Sodium hypochlorite products that make pesticidal claims, such as sanitization or disinfection, must be registered by EPA and be labeled with an EPA Registration Number. Bleach Solution Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Bowie-Dick test : diagnostic test of a sterilizer's ability to re move air from the chamber of a prevacuum steam sterilizer. The air-removal or Bowie-Di ck test is not a test for sterilization. Ceiling limit : concentration of an airborne chemical cont aminant that should not be exceeded during any part of the workday. If instantaneous monitoring is not feasible, the ceiling must be assessed as a 15- minute time-weighted average exposure. Centigrade or Celsius : a temperature scale (0 oC = freezing point of water; 100oC = boiling point of water at sea level). Equivalents mentioned in the guideline are as follows: 20oC = 273oF. For other temperatures the formula is: Fo = (Co x 9/5) + 32 or Co = (Fo -32) x 5/9. Central processing or Central service department : the department within a health-care facility that processes, issues, and controls professional s upplies and equipment, both sterile and nonsterile, for some or all patient-care areas of the facility. Challenge test pack : pack used in installation, qualificati on, and ongoing quality assurance testing of health-care facility sterilizers. Chemical indicator : device for monitoring a sterilization process. The device is designed to respond with a characteristic chemical or physical change to one or more of the physical conditions within the sterilizing chamber. Chemical indicators are intended to detect potential sterilization failures that could result from incorrect packaging, incorrect loading of the sterilizer, or malfuncti ons of the sterilizer. The \"pass\" response of a chemical indicator does not prove the item accompanied by the indicator is necessarily sterile. The Association for the Advanc ement of Medical Instrumentation has defined five classes of chemical indicators: Class 1 (process indi cator); Class 2 (Bowie-Dick test Class 3 (single-parameter indicator); Class 4 (multi-paramet er indicator); and Class 5 (integrating indicator). Contact time : time a disinfectant is in direct contact with the surface or item to be disinfected For surface disinfection, this period is framed by the applicati on to the surface until complete drying has occurred. Container system, rigid container : sterilization containment device designed to hold medical devices for sterilization, storage, transportation, and aseptic presentation of contents. Contaminated : state of having actual or potential contact with microorganisms. As used in health care, the term generally refers to the presence of micr oorganisms that could produce disease or infection. Control, positive : biologic indicator, from the same lot as a test biologic indicator, that is left unexposed to the sterilization cycle and then incubated to verify the viability of the test biologic indicator. Cleaning: removal, usually with detergent and water or enzyme cleaner and water, of adherent visible soil, blood, protein substances, mi croorganisms and other debris from t he surfaces, crevices, serrations, joints, and lumens of instruments, devices, and equi pment by a manual or mechanical process that prepares the items for safe handli ng and/or further decontamination. Culture: growth of microorganisms in or on a nutrient m edium; to grow microorganisms in or on such a medium. Culture medium : substance or preparation used to grow and cultivate microorganisms. Cup: 8 fluid ounces. 97Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Decontamination: according to OSHA, \"the use of physical or chemical means to re move, inactivate, or destroy bloodborne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal\" [29 CFR 1910.1030]. In health-care facilities, the term generally refers to all pathogenic organisms. Decontamination area : area of a health-care facility designated fo r collection, retention, and cleaning of soiled and/or contaminated items. Detergent : cleaning agent that makes no antimicrobial clai ms on the label. They comprise a hydrophilic component and a lipohilic component and can be divided in to four types: anionic, cationic, amphoteric, and non-ionic detergents. Disinfectant : usually a chemical agent (but sometimes a physical agent) that destr oys disease-causing pathogens or other harmful microorganisms but might not kill bacterial spores. It refers to substances applied to inanimate objects. EPA groups disinfectants by product label claims of \"limited,\" \"general,\" or \"hospital\" disinfection. Disinfection: thermal or chemical destruction of pathogenic and other types of microorganisms. Disinfection is less lethal than sterilizati on because it destroys most recognized pathogenic microorganisms but not necessarily all micr obial forms (e.g., bacterial spores).

Efficacy has been demonstrated in laboratory tests against either Salmonella choleraesuis or Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Lipid virus: virus surrounded by an envelope of lipoprotein in addition to the usual core of nucleic acid surrounded by a coat of protein. This type of virus (e.g ., HIV) is generally easily inactivated by many types of disinfectants. Also called enveloped or lipophilic virus . Low-level disinfectant : agent that destroys all ative bacteria (except tubercle bacilli), lipid viruses, some nonlipid viruses, and some fungi, but not bacterial spores. Mechanical indicator : devices that monitor the sterilizati on process (e.g., graphs, gauges, printouts).

Microbicide: any substance or mixture of substances that effect ively kills microorganisms. 99Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Microorganisms : animals or plants of microscopic size. As used in health care, generally refers to bacteria, fungi, viruses, and bacterial spores. Minimum effective concentration (MEC) : the minimum concentration of a liquid chemical germicide needed to achieve the claimed microbicidal activity as determined by dose-response testing. Sometimes used interchangeably with minimum recommended concentration . Muslin : loosely woven (by convention, 140 threads per square inch), 100% cotton cloth. Formerly used as a wrap for sterile packs or a surgical drape. Fabric wraps used currently cons ist of a cotton-polyester blend. Mycobacteria : bacteria with a thick, waxy coat that makes them more resistant to chemical germicides than other types of vegetative bacteria. Nonlipid viruses : generally considered more resistant to i nactivation than lipid viruses. Also called nonenveloped or hydrophilic viruses. One-step disinfection process : simultaneous cleaning and disinfection of a noncritical surface or item. Pasteurization: process developed by Louis Pasteur of heati ng milk, wine, or other liquids to 65-77 oC (or the equivalent) for approximately 30 minutes to kill or markedly reduce the number of pathogenic and spoilage organisms other than bacterial spores. Parametric release : declaration that a product is sterile on the basis of physical and/or chemical process data rather than on sample testing or biologic indicator results.

Can be constructed of stainless steel, porcelain, glass, or other ma terials and are approximately 8 x 10 mm in diameter. Permissible exposure limit (PEL ): time-weighted average maximum concentration of an air contaminant to which a worker can be exposed, acco rding to OSHA standards. Usually calculated over 8 hours, with exposure considered over a 40-hour work week. Personal protective equipment (PPE ): specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. General work clothes (e .g., uniforms, pants, shirts) not intended to function as protection against a hazard are not considered to be PPE. Parts per million (ppm): common measurement for concentrations by volume of trace contaminant gases in the air (or chemicals in a liquid); 1 vo lume of contaminated gas per 1 million volumes of contaminated air or 1\u00a2 in $10,000 both equal 1 ppm. Parts per million = \u00b5g/mL or mg/L. Prions : transmissible pathogenic agents that cause a va riety of neurodegenerative diseases of humans and animals, including sheep and goats, bovine spongifo rm encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease in humans. They are unlike any other infectious pathogens because they are composed of an abnormal conformational isoform of a normal cellular protein, the prion prot ein (PrP). Prions are extremely resistant to inactivation by st erilization processes and disinfecting agents. Process challenge device (PCD) : item designed to simulate product to be sterilized and to constitute a defined challenge to the sterilization process and us ed to assess the effective performance of the process. A PCD is a challenge test pack or test tr ay that contains a biol ogic indicator, a Class 5 integrating indicator, or an enzyme-only indicator. QUAT : abbreviation for quaternary ammonium compound , a surface-active, water-soluble disinfecting 100Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 substance that has four carbon atoms link ed to a nitrogen atom through covalent bonds. Recommended exposure limit (REL): occupational exposure limit recommended by NIOSH as being protective of worker health and safety over a working lifetime. Frequently expressed as a 40-hour time- weighted-average exposure for up to 10 hours per day during a 40-work week. Reprocess: method to ensure proper disinfection or ster ilization; can include: cleaning, inspection, wrapping, sterilizing, and storing. Sanitizer : agent that reduces the number of bacterial contaminants to safe levels as judged by public health requirements. Commonly used with substances applied to inanimate objects. According to the protocol for the official sanitizer test, a sanitizer is a chemical that kills 99. 999% of the specific test bacteria in 30 seconds under t he conditions of the test. Shelf life : length of time an undiluted or use dilution of a product can remain active and effective. Also refers to the length of time a sterilized product (e.g., ster ile instrument set) is expected to remain sterile. Spaulding classification : strategy for reprocessing contam inated medical devices. The system classifies a medical device as critical, semicritical, or noncritical on the basis of risk to patient safety from contamination on a device. The system also established three levels of germicidal activity (sterilization, high-level disinfection, and low-level disinfection) for st rategies with the three classes of medical devices (critical, semicritical, and noncritical). Spore: relatively water-poor round or elliptical re sting cell consisting of condensed cytoplasm and nucleus surrounded by an impervious cell wall or coat. Spor es are relatively resistant to disinfectant and sterilant activity and drying condi tions (specifically in the genera Bacillus and Clostridium ). Spore strip : paper strip impregnated with a known population of spores that meets the definition of biological indicators. Steam quality : steam characteristic reflecting the dryness fr action (weight of dry steam in a mixture of dry saturated steam and entrained water) and the level of noncondensable gas (air or other gas that will not condense under the conditions of temperature and pressure used during the sterilization process). The dryness fraction (i.e., the proportion of complete ly dry steam in the steam being considered) should not fall below 97%. Steam sterilization : sterilization process that uses satura ted steam under pressure for a specified exposure time and at a specified temperature, as the sterilizing agent. Steam sterilization, dynamic air removal type : one of two types of sterilizat ion cycles in which air is removed from the chamber and the load by a series of pressure and vacuum excursions (prevacuum cycle) or by a series of steam flushes and pressu re pulses above atmospheric pressure (steam-flush- pressure-pulse cycle). Sterile or Sterility : state of being free from all living microorgani sms. In practice, usually described as a probability function, e.g., as the probability of a microorganism surviving sterilization being one in one million. Sterility assurance level (SAL) : probability of a viable microorganism being present on a product unit after sterilization. Usually expressed as 10 -6; a SAL of 10-6 means <1/1 million chance that a single viable microorganism is present on a sterilized item. A SAL of 10-6 generally is accepted as appropriate for items intended to contact compromised tissue (i.e., tissue that has lost the integrity of the natural body barriers). The sterilizer manufacturer is responsible for ensur ing the sterilizer can achieve the desired SAL. The 101Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 user is responsible for monitoring the performance of the sterilizer to ensure it is operating in conformance to the manufacturer's recommendations. Sterilization : validated process used to render a product free of all forms of viable microorganisms. In a sterilization process, the presence of microorganisms on any individual it em can be expressed in terms of probability. Although this probability can be reduced to a very low number, it can never be reduced to zero. Sterilization area : area of a health-care facility designed to house sterilization equipment, such as steam ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, or ozone sterilizers. Sterilizer : apparatus used to sterilize medical devices, equipm ent, or supplies by direct exposure to the sterilizing agent. Sterilizer, gravity-displacement type : type of steam sterilizer in which incoming steam displaces residual air through a port or drain in or near the bottom (usually) of the sterilizer chamber. Typical operating temperatures are 121-123 oC (250-254oF) and (270-275oF). Sterilizer, prevacuum type : type of steam sterilizer that depends on one or more pressure and vacuum excursions at the beginning of the cycle to remove ai r. This method of operation results in shorter cycle times for wrapped items because of the rapid remova l of air from the chamber and the load by the vacuum system and because of the usually higher operating temperature (132-135 oC [270-275oF]; 141- 144oC [285-291oF]). This type of sterilizer generally provi des for shorter exposure time and accelerated drying of fabric loads by pulling a further vacuum at the end of the sterilizing cycle. Sterilizer, steam-flush pressure-pulse type : type of sterilizer in whic h a repeated sequence consisting of a steam flush and a pressure pulse removes air from the sterilizing chamber and processed materials using steam at above atmospheric pressure (no vac uum is required). Like a prevacuum sterilizer, a steam-flush pressure-pulse sterilizer rapidly removes air from the sterilizing chamber and wrapped items; however, the system is not susceptible to air lea ks because air is removed with the sterilizing chamber pressure at above atmospheric pressure . Typical operating temperatures are (285-291oF). reduces the surface tension of wate r or the tension at the interface between water and another liquid; a wetting agent found in many sterilants and disinfectants. Tabletop steam sterilizer : a compact gravity-displacement steam sterilizer that has a chamber volume of not more than 2 cubic feet and that generates its own steam when distilled or deionized water is added. Time-weighted average (TWA) : an average of all the concentrations of a chemical to which a worker has been exposed during a specific sampling time, r eported as an average over the sampling time. For example, the permissible exposure lim it for ethylene oxide is 1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. Exposures above the ppm limit are permitted if they are compensated for by equal or longer exposures below the limit during the 8-hour workday as long as they do not exc eed the ceiling limit; short-term exposure limit; or, in the case of ethylene oxide, ex cursion limit of 5 ppm averaged ov er a 15-minute sampling period. Tuberculocide : an EPA-classified hospital disinfectant that also kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tubercle bacilli). EPA has registered approximately 200 tuberculocides. Such agents also are called mycobactericides . Use-life : the length of time a diluted product can remain ac tive and effective. The stability of the chemical and the storage conditions (e.g., temperature and pres ence of air, light, organic matter, or metals) 102Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 103determine the use-life of antimicrobial products. Vegetative bacteria : bacteria that are devoid of spores and us ually can be readily inactivated by many types of germicides. Virucide: an agent that kills viruses to make them noninfective.

As newer disinfectants become available, persons or committees responsible for selecti ng disinfectants and sterilizati on processes should be guided by products cleared by the FDA and the EPA as well as information in the scientific literature. 104Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 A, Heat sterilization, incl uding steam or hot air (see manufacturer's re commendations, steam sterilization processing time from 3-30 minutes) B, Ethylene oxide gas (see manufacturer's recommendations, gener ally 1-6 hours processing time plus aeration time of 8-12 hours at 50-60oC) C, Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (see manufacturer's recomm endations for internal diamet er and length restrictions, processing time between 45-72 minutes). D, Glutaraldehyde-based formulations ( >2% glutaraldehyde, caution should be exercised with a high-level disinfection claim of 5 minutes at 35oC. E, Ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) 0.55% F, Hydrogen peroxide 7.5% (will corrode copper, zinc, and brass) G, Peracetic acid, concentration variable but 0.2% or greater is sporicidal.

Follow the FDA-cleared high-level disinfection clai m. Ten-minute exposure is not adequate to disinfect many objects, especially those that are difficult to clean because they have narrow channels or other areas that can harbor organic material and bacteria. Twenty-minute exposure at 20oC is the minimum time needed to reliably kill M. tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria with a 2% glutaraldehyde. So me high-level disinfectants have a reduced exposure time (e.g., ortho-phthalaldehyde at 12 minutes at 20oC) because of their rapid activi ty against mycobacteria or reduced exposure time due to increased mycobacte ricidal activity at el evated temperature (e.g., 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 5 minutes at 35oC, 0.55% OPA at 5 min at 25oC in automated endoscope reprocessor). 3 Tubing must be completely filled for high-level disinfection and liquid chemical sterilization; care must be taken to avoid entrapment of air bubbles during immersion. 4 Material compatibility should be investigated when appropriate. 5 A concentration of 1000 ppm available chlorine should be cons idered where cultures or c oncentrated preparations of microorganisms have spilled (5.25% to 6.15% household bleach diluted 1:50 provides > 1000 ppm available chlorine). This solution may corrode some surfaces. 6 Pasteurization (washer-disinfector) of re spiratory therapy or anesthesia equipment is a recognized alternative to high- level disinfection. Some data challenge t he efficacy of some pasteurization units. 7 Thermostability should be investigated when appropriate. 8 Do not mix rectal and oral thermometers at any stage of handling or processing. 9 By law, all applicable label instructions on EPA-registered products must be followed. If the user selects exposure conditions that differ from those on t he EPA-registered products label, the user assumes liability from any injuries resulting from off-label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA. 105Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Table 2. Properties of an ideal disinfectant. Broad spectrum: should have a wi de antimicrobial spectrum Fast acting: should produce a rapid kill Not affected by environmental factors: should be active in the presence of organic matter (e.g., blood, sputum, feces) and compatible with soaps, detergents, and other chemicals encountered in use Nontoxic: should not be harmful to the user or patient Surface compatibility: shoul d not corrode instruments and metallic surfaces and should not cause the deterioration of cloth, rubber, plastics, and other materials Residual effect on treated surfaces: should leave an antimicrobial film on the treated surface Easy to use with clear label directions Odorless: should have a pleasant odor or no odor to facilitate its routine use Economical: should not be prohibitively high in cost Solubility: should be soluble in water Stability: should be stable in concentrate and use-dilution Cleaner: should have good cleaning properties Environmentally friendly: should not damage the environment on disposal Modified from Molinari1035. 106Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Table 3. Epidemiologic evidence associated with the use of surface disinfectants or detergents on noncritical environmental surfaces. Justification for Use of Disinfectants for Noncritical Environmental Surfaces Surfaces may contribute to transmission of epidemio logically important microbes (e.g., vancomycin- resistant Enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus , viruses) Disinfectants are needed for surfaces contaminated by blood and other potentially infective material Disinfectants are more effective than det ergents in reducing microbial load on floors Detergents become contaminated and result in s eeding the patient's environment with bacteria Disinfection of noncritical equipment and surfaces is recommended for patients on isolation precautions by the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention. Advantage of using a single product for decontamination of noncritical surfaces, both floors and equipment Some newer disinfectants have per sistent antimicrobial activity Justification for Using a Detergent on Noncritical Environmental Surfaces Noncritical surfaces contribute minimally to endemic healthcare-associated infections No difference in healthcare-associated infection rates when floors are cleaned with detergent versus disinfectant No environmental impact (aquatic or te rrestrial) issues with disposal No occupational health exposure issues Lower costs Use of antiseptics/disinfec tants selects for antibioti c-resistant bacteria (?)

Factors affecting the efficacy of sterilization. Factors Effect Cleaning1 Failure to adequately clean instrument re sults in higher bioburden, protein load, and salt concentration. These w ill decrease sterilization efficacy. Bioburden1 The natural bioburden of used surgical devices is 100 to 103 organisms (primarily vegetative bacteria), which is substantially below the 105-106 spores used with biological indicators. Pathogen type Spore-forming organisms are most resistant to sterilization and are the test organisms required for FDA clearance. Ho wever, the contaminating microflora on used surgical instruments consists mainly of vegetative bacteria. Protein1 Residual protein decreases efficacy of sterilization. However, cleaning appears to rapidly remove protein load. Salt1 Residual salt decreases efficacy of st erilization more than does protein load. However, cleaning appears to rapidly remove salt load. Biofilm accumulation1 Biofilm accumulation reduces efficacy of sterilization by impairing exposure of the sterilant to the microbial cell. Lumen length Increasing lumen length impairs ster ilant penetration. May require forced flow through lumen to achieve sterilization. Lumen diameter Decreasing lumen diameter impai rs sterilant penetration. May require forced flow through lumen to achieve sterilization. Restricted flow Sterilant must come into cont act with microorganisms. Device designs that prevent or inhibit this contact (e.g ., sharp bends, blind lumens) will decrease sterilization efficacy. Device design and construction Materials used in construction may affect compatibility with different sterilization processes and affect sterilization efficacy. Design issues (e.g., screws, hinges) will also affect sterilization efficacy.

The lumen test unit was a straight stainless steel tube. 116Table 12. Suggested protocol for management of positive biological indicator in a steam sterilizer. 1. Take the sterilizer out of service. Noti fy area supervisor and infection control department. 2. Objects, other than implantable objects, do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the sterilizer or the sterilization proc edure is defective. As soon as possible, repeat biological indicator test in three consecutive steriliz er cycles. If additional spore tests remain positive, the items should be considered nonsterile, and s upplies processed since the last acceptable (negative) biological indicator should be recalled. The items from the suspect load(s) should be recalled and reprocessed. 3. Check to ensure the sterilizer was used correctly (e .g., verify correct time and temperature setting). If not, repeat using appropriate settings and recall and reprocess all inadequately processed items. 4. Check with hospital maintenance for irregularities (e.g., electrical) or changes in the hospital steam supply (i.e., from standard >97% steam, <3% moisture). Any abnormalities should be reported to the person who performs sterilizer maintenance (e.g., medical engineering, sterilizer manufacturer). 5. Check to ensure the correct biological indicator was used and appropriately interpreted. If not, repeat using appropriate settings. If steps 1 through 5 resolve the problem 6. If all three repeat biological indicators from th ree consecutive sterilizer cycles (step 2 above) are negative, put the steriliz er back in service. If one or both biological indicators are positive, do one or more of the following until problem is resolved. 7. A. Request an inspection of the equipm ent by sterilizer maintenance personnel. B. Have hospital maintenance inspect the steam supply lines. C. Discuss the abnormalities with the sterilizer manufacturer. D. Repeat the biological indicator using a different manufacturer's indicator. If step 7 does not resolve the problem Close sterilizer down until the manufacturer can assure that it is operating properly. Retest at that time with biological indicators in three consecutive sterilizer cycles. Modified from Bryce. 839 Disclosure of Financial Interests and Relationships (2000- July 2004) William A.

The following developments led to revision of the 1996 guideline: 1. The transition of healthcare delivery from primarily acute care hospitals to other healthcare settings (e.g., home care, am bulatory care, free- standing specialty care sites, long-term care) created a need for recommendations that can be applied in all healthcare settings using common principles of infection control practice, yet can be modified to reflect setting-specific needs. Accordingly, the revised guideline addresses the spectrum of healthcare delivery settings. Furthermore, the term \"nosocomial infe ctions\" is replaced by \"healthcare\u00ad associated infections\" (HAI s) to reflect t he changing patterns in healthcare delivery and difficulty in determining the geographic site of exposure to an infectious agent and/or acquisition of infection. 2. The emergence of new pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Avian influenza in humans), renewed concern for evolving known pathogens (e.g., C. difficile, noroviruses, community- associated MRSA [CA-MRSA]), developm ent of new therapies (e.g., gene therapy), and increasing concern for the threat of bioweapons attacks, established a need to address a broader scope of issues than in previous isolation guidelines. 3. The successful experience with Standard Precautions, first recommended in the 1996 guideline, has led to a reaffirmation of this approach as the foundation for preventing transmission of infectious agents in all healthcare settings. New additions to the recommendations for Standard Precautions are Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette and safe injection practices, including the use of a mask when performing certain high-risk, prolonged procedures involving spinal canal punctures (e.g., myelography, epidural anesthesia). The need for a recommendation for Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette grew out of observations during the SARS outbreaks w here failure to implement simple source control measures with patients, visitors, and healthcare personnel with respiratory symptoms may have contributed to SARS co ronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmission. The recommended practices have a strong evidence base. The continued occurrence of outbreaks of hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses in ambulatory settings indicated a need to re -iterate safe injection practice recommendations as part of Standard Pr ecautions. The addition of a mask for certain spinal injections grew from re cent evidence of an associated risk for developing meningitis caused by respiratory flora. 4. The accumulated evidence that environm ental controls decrease the risk of life- threatening fungal infections in the mo st severely immunocompromised patients (allogeneic hematopoietic ste m-cell transplant patients) led to the update on the components of the Protecti ve Environment (PE). 5. Evidence that organizational characterist ics (e.g., nurse staffing levels and composition, establishment of a safety culture) influence healthcare personnel adherence to recommended infection cont rol practices, and therefore are important factors in preventing transmissi on of infectious agents, led to a new 7 emphasis and recommendations for administrative involvement in the development and support of in fection control programs. 6. Continued increase in the incidence of HAIs caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in all healthcar e settings and the expanded body of knowledge concerning prevention of tr ansmission of MDROs created a need for more specific recommendations for surveillance and control of these pathogens that would be practical and effective in various types of healthcare settings. This document is intended for use by infection control staff, healthcare epidemiologists, healthcare administrators, nurse s, other healthcare providers, and persons responsible for developing, implementing, and ev aluating infection control prog rams for healthcare settings across the continuum of care. The reader is referred to other guidelines and websites for more detailed information and for recommendations concerning specialized infection control problems. Parts I - III: Review of the Scientific Data Re garding Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings Part I reviews the relevant scientific literature that supports the recommended prevention and control practices. As with the 1996 guideline, the modes and factors that infl uence transmission risks are described in detail. New to the section on transmission are discussions of bioaerosols and of how droplet and airborne transmission may contribute to infection trans mission. This became a concern during the SARS outbreaks of 2003, when transmission associated with aerosol-generating procedures was observed. Also new is a definition of \"epidemio logically important organisms\" that was developed to assist in the identification of clusters of infections that require investigation (i.e. mu ltidrug-resistant organisms, C. difficile) . Several other pathogens that hold special infect ion control interest (i.e., norovirus, SARS, Category A bioterrorist agents, prions, monkeypox, and the hemorrhagic fever viruses) also are discussed to present new information and infecti on control lessons learned from experience with these agents. This section of the guideli ne also presents information on infection risks associated with specific healthcare settings and patient populations. Part II updates information on the basic principles of hand hygi ene, barrier precautions, safe work practices and isolation practices that were included in previous guidelines. However, new to this guideline, is important information on healthcare system components that influence transmission risks, including t hose under the influence of healthcare administrators. An important administrative priority that is described is the need for appropriate infection control staffing to meet the ever-expanding role of infection control professionals in the moder n, complex healthcare system . Evidence presented also demonstrates another administrative concern, the importance of nurse staffing levels, including numbers of appropriate ly trained nurses in ICUs for preventing HAIs. The role of the clinical microbiology laboratory in supporti ng infection control is described to emphasize the need for this service in healthcare facilites. Other factors that influence transmission risks are discussed i.e., healthcare worker adherence to recommended infection control practices, organizational safety culture or climate, educ ation and training Discussed for the first time in an isolation guideline is surveillance of healthcare-associated infections. The information presented will be usef ul to new infection control professionals as 8 well as persons involved in designing or res ponding to state programs fo r public reporting of HAI rates. Part III describes each of the categories of precautions developed by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Co mmittee (HICPAC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and provides guidance for their application in various healthcare settings. The categories of Tr ansmission-Based Precautions are unchanged from those in the 1996 guideline: Contact, Droplet, and Air borne. One important change is the recommendation to don the indicated pers onal protective equipment (gowns, gloves, mask) upon entry into the patient's room for patients who are on Contact and/or Droplet Precautions since the nature of the interact ion with the patient cannot be predicted with certainty and contaminated envir onmental surfaces are importa nt sources for transmission of pathogens. In addition, the Protective Environment ( PE) for allogeneic hem atopoietic stem cell transplant patients, descr ibed in previous guide lines, has been updated. Tables, Appendices, and other Information There are several tables that summarize im portant information: 1) a summary of the evolution of this document; 2) guidance on using empiric isolation precautions according to a clinical syndrome; 3) a summary of infe ction control recommendations for category A agents of bioterrorism; 4) components of St andard Precautions and recommendations for their application; 5) components of the Protective Environment; and 6) a glossary of definitions used in this guideline. New in this guideline is a figure that shows a recommended sequence for donning and removing per sonal protective equipment used for isolation precautions to optimize safety and prevent self-contam ination during removal. Appendix A: Type and Duration of Precauti ons Recommended for Selected Infections and Conditions Appendix A consists of an updated alphabetical list of most infectious agents and clinical conditions for which isolation precautions are recommended. A preamble to the Appendix provides a rationale for recommending the use of one or more Transmission-Based Precautions, in addition to Standard Precauti ons, based on a review of the literature and evidence demonstrating a real or potential risk for person-to-person transmission in healthcare settings.The type and duration of recommended precautions are presented with additional comments concerning the use of adjunctive measures or other relevant considerations to prevent transmission of the s pecific agent. Relevant citations are included. Pre- Publication of th e Guideline on Preventing Transmission of MDROs New to this guideline is a comprehensive review and detailed recommendations for prevention of transmission of MDROs. This portion of the guideline was published electronically in October 2006 and updated in November, 2006 (Siegel JD, Rhinehart E, Jackson M, Chiarello L and HICPAC. Management of Multidrug-Resist ant Organisms in Healthcare Settings 2006 www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf ), and is considered a part of the Guideline for Isolation Precautions. Th is section provides a detailed review of the complex topic of MDRO contro l in healthcare settings and is intended to provide a context for evaluation of MDRO at individual healthcare se ttings. A rationale and 9 institutional requirements for developing an effective MDRO control program are summarized. Although the focus of this guideline is on measures to prevent transmission of MDROs in healthcare settings, information conc erning the judicious use of antimicrobial agents is presented since such practices are intricat ely related to the size of the reservoir of MDROs which in turn influences transmission (e.g. colonization pressure). There are two tables that summarize reco mmended prevention and control practices using the following seven categories of interventions to control MDROs: administrative measures, education of healthcare personnel, judicious anti microbial use, surveillance, infection control precautions, environmental measures, and decol onization. Recommendations for each category apply to and are adapted for the various healthcare settings. With the increasing incidence and prevalence of MDROs, all healthcare facilities must prioritize effective control of MDRO transmission. Facilities should identify prevalent MDROs at the facility, implement control measures, assess the effectiveness of c ontrol programs, and demonstrate decreasing MDRO rates. A set of intens ified MDRO prevention interventions is presented to be added 1) if the incidence of transmission of a target MDRO is NOT decreasing despite implementation of basic MDRO infect ion control measures, and 2) when the first case(s) of an epidemiologically important MDRO is identified within a healthcare facility. Summary This updated guideline responds to changes in healthcare delivery and addresses new concerns about transmission of infectious agent s to patients and healthcare workers in the United States and infection contro l. The primary objective of the guideline is to improve the safety of the nation's healthcare deliver y system by reducing the rates of HAIs. 10 Abbreviations Used in the Guideline AIIR Airborne infection isolation room CDC Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention CF Cystic fibrosis ESBL Extended spectrum beta-lactamases FDA Food and Drug Administration HAI Healthcare-associated infections HBV Hepatitis B virus HCV Hepatitis C virus HEPA High efficiency parti culate air [filtration] HICPAC Healthcare Infection Cont rol Practices Advisory Committee HIV Human immunodeficiency virus HCW Healthcare worker HSCT Hematopoetic stem-cell transplant ICU Intensive care LTCF mmittee Clinical Laboratory Standards NICU Neonatal intensive care unit NIOSH National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, CDC NNIS National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance NSSP Nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Administration PICU Pediatric intensive care unit PPE Personal protective equipment RSV Respiratory syncytial virus SARS Severe acquired respiratory syndrome vCJD variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease VRE Vancomycin-resistant enterococci WHO World Health Organization 11 Part I: Review of Scientific Data Regarding Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings I.A. Evolution of the 2007 Document The Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Pr eventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2007 builds upon a series of isolation and infection prevention documents promul gated since 1970. These previous documents are summarized and referenced in Table 1 and in Part I of the 1996 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals 1. Objectives and methods The objectives of this guideline are to 1) provide infection control recommendations for all components of the healthcare delivery system, including hospitals, long-term care facilities, ambulatory care, home care and hospice; 2) reaffirm Standard Precaut ions as the foundation for preventing transmission during patient care in a ll healthcare settings; 3) reaffirm the importance of implementi ng Transmission-Based Precautions based on the clinical presentation or syndrome and likely pathogens until the infectious etiology has been determined (Table 2); and 4) provide epidemio logically sound and, whenever possible, evidence-based recommendations. This guideline is designed for use by individuals who are charged with administering infection control programs in hospitals and other healthcare settings. The information also will be useful for other healthcare personnel, healthcare administrators, and anyone needing information about infection control measures to prevent transmi ssion of infectious agents. Commonly used abbreviations are provided on page 12 and terms used in the guideline are defined in the Glossary (page 137). Med-line and Pub Med were used to sear ch for relevant studies published in English, focusing on those published since 1996. Much of the evidence cited for preventing transmission of infectious agent s in healthcare settings is derived from studies that used \"quasi-experim ental designs\", also referred to as nonrandomized, pre- post-intervention study designs 2. Although these types of studies can provide valuable information regarding the effectiveness of various interventions, several factors decrease the certainty of a ttributing improved outcome to a specific intervention. These include: difficulties in controlling for important confounding variabl es; the use of multiple interventions during an outbreak; and results that are explained by the statistical principle of regression to the mean, (e.g., improvement ov er time without any intervention) 3. Observational studies remain relevant and have been used to evaluate infection control interventions 4, 5. The quality of studies, consistency of results and correlation with results from randomized, controlled trials when available were considered during the lit erature review and assi gnment of evidence-based categories (See Part IV: Recommendations ) to the recommendations in this guideline. Several authors have summarized properties to consider when evaluating studies for the purpose of det ermining if the results should change practice or in designing new studies 2, 6, 7. 12 Changes or clarifications in terminology This guideline contains four changes in terminology from the 1996 guideline: \u0083 The term nosocomial infection is retained to refer only to infections acquired in hospitals. The term healthcare-associated infection (HAI) is used to refer to infections associated with healthcare delivery in any setting (e.g., hospitals, l ong-term care facilities, ambulatory settings, home care). This term reflects the inabilit y to determine with certainty where the pathogen is acquired since patients may be colonized with or exposed to potential pathogens outside of the heal thcare setting, before receiving health care, or may develop infecti ons caused by those pathogens when exposed to the conditions associated with delivery of healthcare. Additionally, patients frequently move among the various settings within a healthcare system 8. \u0083 A new addition to the practice re commendations for Standard Precautions is Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette . While Standard Precautions generally apply to the recommended pr actices of healthcare personnel during patient care, Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette applies broadly to all persons who enter a healthca re setting, including healthcare personnel, patients and visitors. Thes e recommendations evolved from observations during the SARS epidemic that failure to implement basic source control measures with patients, visitors, and healthcare personnel with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection may have contributed to SARS coronavirus (SAR S-CoV) transmission. This concept has been incorporated into CDC planning documents for SARS and pandemic influenza 9, 10. \u0083 The term \"Airborne Precautions\" has been supplemented with the term \"Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) \" for consistency with the Guidelines for Environmental Infecti on Control in Healthcare Facilities 11, the Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health-Care Settings 200512 and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) guidelines for desi gn and construction of hospitals, 2006 13 \u0083 A set of prevention measures termed Protective Environment has been added to the precautions used to prev ent HAIs. These measures, which have been defined in other guidelines , consist of engineering and design interventions that decrease the risk of exposure to environmental fungi for severely immunocompromised allogeneic hematiopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients during their highest risk phase, usually the first 100 days post transplant, or longer in the presence of graft-versus-host disease 11, 13-15. Recommendations for a Protective Environment apply only to acute care hospitals that provide care to HSCT patients. Scope This guideline, like its predecessors, focuses primarily on interactions between patients and healthcare providers. The Guidelines for the Prevention of MDRO Infection were published separatel y in November 2006, and are available online at www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/index.html. Several other HICPAC 13 guidelines to prevent transmission of infectious agents associated with healthcare delivery are cited; e.g., Guideline for Hand Hygiene , Guideline for Environmental Infection Control , Guideline for Prevention of Healthcare- Associated Pneumonia , and Guideline for Infection Control in Healthcare Personnel 11, 14, 16, 17. In combination, these provide comprehensive guidance on the primary infection cont rol measures for ensuring a safe environment for patients and healthcare personnel. This guideline does not discuss in detail s pecialized infection control issues in defined populations that are addressed elsewhere, (e.g., Recommendations for Preventing Transmission of Infections among Chronic Hemodialysis Patients , Guidelines for Preventing the Transmissi on of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities 2005 , Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health- Care Settings and Infection Control Recommendations for Patients with Cystic Fibrosis 12, 18-20. An exception has been made by including abbreviated guidance for a Protective Environment used fo r allogeneic HSCT recipients because components of the Protecti ve Environment have been more completely defined since publication of the Guidelines for Preventing Opportunistic Infections Among HSCT Recipients in 2000 and the Guideline for Environmental Infection Control in Healthcare Facilities 11, 15. I.B. Rationale for Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions in healthcare settings Transmission of infectious agents within a healthcare setting requires three elements: a source (or reservoir) of in fectious agents, a susceptible host with a portal of entry receptive to the agen t, and a mode of transmission for the agent. This section describes the interrelationshi p of these elements in the epidemiology of HAIs. I.B.1. Sources of infectious agents Infectious agents transmitted during healthcare derive primarily from human sources but inanimate environmental sources also are implicated in transmissi on. Human reservoirs include patients 20-28, healthcare personnel 29-35 17, 36-39, and household members and other visitors 40-45. Such source individuals may have active infections, may be in the asymptomatic and/or incubat ion period of an infectious disease, or may be transiently or chronically colonized with pathogenic microorganisms, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The endogenous flora of patients (e.g., bacteria residing in the respiratory or gastrointe stinal tract) also are the source of HAIs 46-54. I.B.2. Susceptible hosts Infection is the result of a complex interrelationship between a potential host and an infectious agent. Most of the factors that influence infection and the occurrence and seve rity of disease are related to the host. However, characteristics of the hos t-agent interaction as it relates to 14 pathogenicity, virulence and antigenicity are also importan t, as are the infectious dose, mechanisms of disease pr oduction and route of exposure 55. There is a spectrum of possible outcomes following exposure to an infectious agent. Some persons exposed to pathogenic microorgani sms never develo p symptomatic disease while others become severely ill and even die. Some individuals are prone to becoming transiently or permanently colonized but remain asymptomatic. Still others progress from colonization to symptomatic disease either immediately following exposure, or after a period of asymptomatic colonization. The immune state at the ti me of exposure to an infectious agent, interaction between pathogens, and virulence factors intrinsic to the agent are important predictors of an indi viduals' outcome. Host factors such as extremes of age and underlying disease (e.g. diabetes 56, 57), human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome [HIV/AIDS] 58, 59, malignancy, and transplants 18, 60, 61 can increase susceptibility to infection as do a variety of medications that alter the normal flora (e.g., antimicr obial agents, gastric acid suppressants, corticosteroids, antir ejection drugs, antineoplastic agents, and immunosuppressive drugs). Surgical pr ocedures and radiation therapy impair defenses of the skin and other involved organ systems. Indwelling devices such as urinary catheters, endot racheal tubes, central venous and arterial catheters 64 and synthetic implants facilitate devel opment of HAIs by allowing potential pathogens to bypass local defenses that would ordinarily impede their invasion and by providing surfaces for developm ent of bioflms that may facilitate adherence of microorganism s and protect from antimicrobial activity 65. Some infections associated with invasive procedur es result from transmission within the healthcare facility; others arise from the patient's endogenous flora 46-50. High-risk patient populations with noteworthy risk fa ctors for infection are discussed further in Sections I.D, I.E., and I.F. I.B.3. Modes of transmission Several classes of pathogens can cause infection, including bacteria, viruses, f ungi, parasites, and prions. The modes of transmission vary by type of organism and some infectious agents may be transmitted by more than one route: some are transmitted primar ily by direct or indirect contact, (e.g., Herpes simplex virus [HSV], respiratory syncytial virus, Staphylococcus aureus ), others by the droplet, (e.g., influenza virus, B. pertussis) or airborne routes (e.g., M. tuberculosis) . Other infectious agents, such as bloodborne viruses (e.g., hepatitis B and C viruses [HBV, HCV] and HIV are transmitted rarely in healthcare settings , via percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure. Importantly, not all infectious agents are transmitted from person to person. These are distinguished in Appendix A. The three principal routes of transmission are summarized below. I.B.3.a . Contact transmission The most common mode of transmission, contact transmission is divided into tw o subgroups: direct contact and indirect contact. 15 I.B.3.a.i. Direct contact transmission Direct transmission occurs when microorganisms are transferred from one infected person to another person without a contaminated intermediate object or person. Opportunities for direct contact transmission between pati ents and healthcare personnel have been summarized in the Guideline for Infection Control in Healthcare Personnel, 1998 17 and include: blood or other blood-containing body fluids from a patient directly enters a caregiver's body through contact with a mucous membrane 66 or breaks (i.e., cuts, abrasions) in the skin 67. mites from a scabies-infested pati ent are transferred to the skin of a caregiver while he/she is having direct ungloved contact with the patient's skin 68, 69. a healthcare provider develops herpetic whitlow on a finger after contact with HSV when providing oral care to a patient without using gloves or HSV is transmitted to a pat ient from a herpetic whitlow on an ungloved hand of a healthcare worker (HCW) 70, 71. I.B.3.a.ii. Indirect contact transmission Indirect transmission involves the transfer of an infectious agent through a contaminated intermediate object or person. In the absence of a point-source out break, it is difficult to determine how indirect transmission occurs. However, extensive evidence cited in the Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings suggests that the contaminated hands of healthcare personnel are important contributors to indirect contact transmission 16. Examples of opportunities for indirect contact transmission include: Hands of healthcare personnel may transmit pathogens after touching an infected or colonized body site on one patient or a contaminated inanimate object, if hand hygiene is not performed before touching another patient.72, 73. Patient-care devices (e.g., electronic thermometers, glucose monitoring devices) may transmit pathogens if devices contaminated with blood or body fluids are shar ed between patients without cleaning and disinfecting between patients 74 75-77 . Shared toys may become a vehicle fo r transmitting respiratory viruses (e.g., respirator y syncytial virus 24, 78, 79 or pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa 80) among pediatric patients. Instruments that are inadequat ely cleaned between patients before disinfection or sterilization (e.g., e ndoscopes or surgical instruments) 81-85 or that have manufa cturing defects that interfere with the effectiveness of reprocessing 86, 87 may transmit bacterial and viral pathogens. Clothing, uniforms, laboratory coats, or isolation gowns used as personal protective equipment (PPE) , may become contaminated with potential pathogens after care of a patient colonized or in fected with an infectious agent, (e.g., MRSA 88, VRE 89, and C. difficile 90. Although contaminated clothing has not been 16 implicated directly in transmission, the potential exists for soiled garments to transfer infectious agents to successive patients. I.B.3.b. Droplet transmission Droplet transmission is , technically, a form of contact transmission, and some infectious agents transmitted by the droplet route also may be transmitted by the direct and i ndirect contact routes. However, in contrast to contact transmission, re spiratory droplets carrying infectious pathogens transmit infection when they travel directly from the respiratory tract of the infectious individual to susceptib le mucosal surfaces of the recipient, generally over short distances, necessita ting facial protection. Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks 91, 92 or during procedures such as suct ioning, endotracheal intubation, 93-96, cough induction by chest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation 98, 99. Evidence for droplet transmission comes from epidemiological studies of disease outbreaks 100-103, experimental studies 104 and from information on aerosol dynamics 91, 105. Studies have shown that the nasal mucosa, conjunctivae and less frequently the mouth, are susceptible po rtals of entry for respiratory viruses 106. The maximum distance for droplet transmission is currently unresolved, although pathogens transmitted by the dr oplet route have not been transmitted through the air over long distances, in contrast to the airborne pathogens discussed below. Historically, the area of defined risk has been a distance of < 3 feet around the patient and is based on epide miologic and simulated studies of selected infections 103, 104. Using this distance for donning masks has been effective in preventing transmission of in fectious agents via the droplet route. However, experimental studies with smallpox 107, 108 and investigations during the global SARS outbreaks of 2003 101 suggest that droplets from patients with these two infections could reach persons located 6 feet or more from their source. It is likely that the distance droplets travel depends on the velocity and mechanism by which respiratory droplets are propel led from the source, the density of respiratory secretions, environmental fact ors such as temper ature and humidity, and the ability of the pathogen to maintain infectivity over that distance 105. Thus, a distance of < 3 feet around the patient is best viewed as an example of what is meant by \"a short distance from a pat ient\" and should not be used as the sole criterion for deciding when a mask should be donned to protect from droplet exposure. Based on these considerations, it may be prudent to don a mask when within 6 to 10 feet of the patient or upon entry into t he patient's room, especially when exposure to emerging or highly viru lent pathogens is likely. More studies are needed to improve under standing of droplet transmission under various circumstances. Droplet size is another variable under discussion. Droplets traditionally have been defined as being >5 \u00b5m in size. Dr oplet nuclei, particles arising from desiccation of suspended droplets, have been associated with airborne transmission and defined as < 5 \u00b5m in size 105 , a reflection of the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis which is not generalizeable to other organisms. Observations of particle dynamics hav e demonstrated that a range of droplet sizes, including those with diameters of 30\u00b5m or greater, can remain suspended 17 in the air 109 . The behavior of droplets and droplet nuclei affect recommendations for preventing transmissi on. Whereas fine airborne particles containing pathogens that are able to rema in infective may transmit infections over long distances, requiring AIIR to prev ent its dissemination within a facility; organisms transmitted by the droplet route do not remain infective over long distances, and therefore do not require special air handling and ventilation. Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis 110 , influenza virus 23, adenovirus 111 112, 113, group A streptococcus 114, and Neisseria meningitidis 95, 103, 115. Although respiratory syncytial virus may be transmitt ed by the droplet route, direct contact with infected respiratory secretions is the most important determinant of transmission and consistent adherence to Standard plus Contact Precautions prevents transmission in healthcare settings 24, 116, 117. Rarely, pathogens that are not transmitted routinely by the droplet route are dispersed into the air over shor t distances. For example, although S. aureus is transmitted most frequently by the contact route, viral upper respiratory tract infection has been associated wit h increased dispersal of S. aureus from the nose into the air for a distance of 4 feet under both outbreak and experimental conditions and is known as the \"cloud baby\" and \"cloud adult\" phenomenon118-120 . I.B.3.c. Airborne transmission transmission occurs by dissemination of either airbor ne droplet nuclei or small pa rticles in the respirable size range containing infectious agents that remain infective over time and distance (e.g., spores of Aspergillus spp, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ). Microorganisms carried in this manner may be dispersed over long distances by air currents and may be inhaled by susceptible individuals who have not had face-to-face contact with (or been in the same room with) the infectious individual 121-124 . Preventing the spread of pathogens that are tran smitted by the airborne route requires the use of special air handl ing and ventilation systems (e.g., AIIRs) to contain and then safely remove the infectious agent 11, 12. Infectious agents to which this applies include Mycobacterium tuberculosis 124-127, rubeola virus (measles) 122, and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox) 123. In addition, published data suggest the possibility that variola virus (smallpox) may be transmitted over long distances through the air under unusual circumstances and AIIRs are recommended for this agent as well; however , droplet and contact routes are the more frequent routes of tr ansmission for smallpox 108, 128, 129. In addition to AIIRs, respiratory protection with N IOSH certified N95 or higher level respirator is recommended for healthcare personnel entering the AIIR to prevent acquisition of airborne infectious agents such as M. tuberculosis 12. For certain other respiratory infe ctious agents, such as influenza 130, 131 and rhinovirus 104, and even some gastrointestinal viruses (e.g., norovirus 132 and rotavirus 133 ) there is some evidence that the pathogen may be transmitted via small-particle aerosols, under natural and experimental conditions. Such transmission has occurred over distances lo nger than 3 feet but within a defined 18 airspace (e.g., patient room), suggesting that it is unlikely that these agents remain viable on air currents that travel long distances. AIIRs are not required routinely to prevent transmi ssion of these agents. Addi tional issues concerning examples of small particle aerosol transmission of agents that are most frequently transmitted by the droplet route are discussed below. I.B.3.d. Emerging issues concerning airb orne transmission of infectious agents. I.B.3.d.i. Transmission from patients The emergence of SARS in 2002, the importation of monkeypox into the Unit ed States in 2003, and the emergence of avian influenza present challenges to the assignment of is olation categories because of conflicting information and unc ertainty about possible routes of transmission. Although SARS-CoV is transmitted primarily by contact and/or droplet routes, airborne transmission over a limited distance (e.g. within a room), has been suggested, though not proven 134-141. This is true of other infectious agents such as influenza virus 130 and noroviruses 132, 142, 143. Influenza viruses are transmitted primarily by close contact with respiratory droplets 23, 102 and acquisition by healthcare personnel has been prevented by Droplet Precautions, even when positive pressure r ooms were used in one center 144 However, inhalational transmission could not be exclu ded in an outbreak of influenza in the passengers and crew of a single aircraft 130. Observations of a protective effect of UV lights in preventing influenza among patients with tuber culosis during the influenza pandemic of 1957-'58 have been used to suggest airborne transmission 145, 146. In contrast to the strict interpretation of an airbor ne route for transmission (i.e., long distances beyond the patient room environment), short distance transmission by small particle aerosols generated under specific circumstances (e.g., during endotracheal intubation) to persons in the immediate area near the patient has been demonstrated. Also , aerosolized particles <100 m can remain suspended in air when room air current velocities exceed the terminal settling velocities of the particles 109. SARS-CoV transmission has been associated with endotracheal intubation, noninvasive positiv e pressure ventilation, and cardio\u00ad pulmonary resuscitation 93, 94, 96, 98, 141. Although the most frequent routes of transmission of noroviruses are contact and food and waterborne routes, several reports suggest that noroviruses may be transmitted through aerosolization of infectious particles from vomitus or fecal material 142, 143, 147, 148. It is hypothesized that the aerosolized particles are i nhaled and subsequently swallowed. Roy and Milton proposed a new classification for aerosol transmission when evaluating routes of SARS transmission: 1) obligate: under natural conditions, disease occurs following transmission of the agent only through inhalation of small particle aerosols (e .g., tuberculosis); 2) preferential : natural infection results from transmission through multiple routes , but small particle aerosols are the predominant route (e.g. meas les, varicella); and 3) opportunistic : agents that naturally cause disease through other r outes, but under spec ial circumstances 19 may be transmitted via fine particle aerosols 149. This conceptual framework can explain rare occurrences of air borne transmission of agents that are transmitted most frequently by other routes (e.g., smallpox, SARS, influenza, noroviruses). Concerns about unknown or possible rout es of transmission of agents associated with severe disease and no known treatment often result in more extreme prevention strategies than may be necessary; therefore, recommended precautions could change as the epidemio logy of an emerging infection is defined and controversial issues are resolved. I.B.3.d.ii. Transmission from the environment Some airborne infectious agents are derived from the environment and do not usually involve person-to\u00ad person transmission. For example, anthrax spores present in a finely milled powdered preparation can be aerosolized from contaminated environmental surfaces and inhaled into the respiratory tract 150, 151. Spores of environmental fungi (e.g., Aspergillus spp.) are ubiquitous in the environment and may cause disease in immunocompromised patients who inhale aerosolized (e.g., via construction dust) spores 152, 153. As a rule, neither of these organisms is subsequently transmitted from infected pat ients. However, there is one well- documented report of person- to-person transmission of Aspergillus sp. in the ICU setting that was most likey due to the aerosolization of spores during wound debridement 154. A Protective Environment refers to isolation practices designed to decrease the risk of exposure to environmental fungal agents in allogeneic HSCT patients 11, 14, 15, 155-158. Environmental sources of respirator y pathogens (eg. Legionella) transmitted to humans through a common aerosol source is distinct from direct patient-to\u00ad patient transmission. I.B.3.e. Other sources of infection Transmission of infection from sources other than infectious individual s include those associated with common environmental sources or vehicles (e.g. contaminated food, water, or medications (e.g. intravenous fluids). Although Aspergillus spp. have been recovered from hospital water systems 159, the role of water as a reservoir for immunosuppressed patients remains uncertain. Vectorborne transmission of infectious agents from mos quitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin also can occur in healthcare settings. Prevention of vector borne transmission is not addressed in this document. I.C. Infectious agents of special infection control interest for healthcare settings Several infectious agents with important infection control implications that either were not discussed extensively in previ ous isolation guide lines or have emerged recently are discussed below. These ar e epidemiologically important organisms (e.g., C. difficile ), agents the hemorrhagic fever vi ruses. Experience with these agents has broadened the understanding of modes of transmission and effective 20 preventive measures. These agents are included for purposes of information and, for some (i.e., SARS-CoV, monkey pox), because of the lessons that have been learned about preparedness planning and responding effectively to new infectious agents . I.C.1. Epidemiologically important organisms Any infectious agents transmitted in healthcare settings ma y, under defined conditions, become targeted for control because they are epidemiologica lly important. C. difficile is specifically discussed below because of wide recognition of its current importance in U.S. healthcare facilitie s. In determining what constitutes an \"epidemiologically im portant organism\", the follo wing characteristics apply: A propensity for transmission withi n healthcare facilities based on published reports and the occurrence of temporal or geographic clusters of > 2 patients, (e.g., C..difficile , streptococcus). A single case of healthcare-associated invasive disease caused by certain pathogens (e.g., gr oup A streptococcus post-operatively 14, 163 160, in burn units 161, or in a LTCF 162; Legionella sp. , Aspergillus sp. 164 ) is generally considered a tri gger for investigation and enhanced control measures because of the risk of additional cases and severity of illness associated with these infections. Antimicrobial resistance Resistance to first-line therapies (e.g., MRSA, VISA, VRSA, VRE, ESBL- producing organisms). Common and uncommon microorgani sms with unusual patterns of resistance within a facility (e.g., the first isolate of Burkholderia cepacia complex or Ralstonia spp. in non-CF patients or a quinolone-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a facility). Difficult to treat because of innate or acquired resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents (e.g., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp. ). Association with serious clinical di sease, increased morbidity and mortality (e.g., MRSA and MSSA, group A streptococcus) A newly discovered pathogen C.difficile C. difficile is a spore-forming gram positive anaerobic bacillus that was first isolated fr om stools of neonates in 1935 165 and identified as the most commonly identified causative agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in 1977 166. This pathogen is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and has been responsible for many large outbreaks in healthcare settings that were ex tremely difficult to control. Important factors that contribute to healthcare-a ssociated outbreaks in clude environmental contamination, persistence of spores for prolonged periods of time, resistance of spores to routinely used disinfectants and antiseptics, hand carriage by healthcare personnel to other patients, and exposure of pat ients to frequent courses of antim icrobial agents 167 . Antimicrobials most frequently associated 21 with increased risk of C. difficile include third generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, vancomyci n, and fluoroquinolones. Since 2001, outbreaks and sporadic cases of C. difficile with increased morbidity and mortality have been observed in several U.S. states, Canada, England and the Netherlands 168-172. The same strain of C. difficile has been implicated in these outbreaks 173. This strain, toxinotype III, North American PFGE type 1, and PCR-ribotype 027 (NAP1/027). has been found to hyperproduce toxin A (16 fold increase) and toxin B (23 fold increase) compared with isolates from 12 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresisPFGE types. A recent survey of U.S. infectious disease physicians found that 40% perceiv ed recent increases in the incidence and severity of C. difficile disease 174. Standardization of testing methodology and surveillance definitions is needed for accu rate comparisons of trends in rates among hospitals 175. It is hypothesized that the incidence of disease and apparent heightened transmissibility of this new strain may be due, at least in part, to the greater producti on of toxins A and B, increasing the severity of diarrhea and resulting in more environm ental contamination. Considering the greater morbidity, morta lity, length of stay, and costs associated with C. difficile disease in both acute care and long term care facilities, control of this pathogen is now even more important than previ ously. Prevention of transmission focuses on syndromic application of Contact Precautions for patients with diarrhea, accurate identification of patients, env ironmental measures (e.g., rigorous cleaning of patient rooms) and consistent hand hygiene. Use of soap and water, rather than alcohol based handrubs, for mechanical re moval of spores from hands, and a bleach-containing disinf ectant (5000 ppm) for environmental disinfection, may be valuable when there is transmission in a healthcare facility. See Appendix A for sp ecific recommendations. I.C.1. b. Multidrug-Resistant Organisms (MDROs) In general, MDROs are defined as microorganisms - pr edominantly bacteria - that are resistant to one or more classes of antimicrobial agents 176. Although the names of certain MDROs suggest resistance to only one agent (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], vancomycin resistant enteroc occus [VRE]), these pathogens are usually resistant to all but a few commerc ially available antimic robial agents. This latter feature defines MDROs that ar e considered to be epidemiologically important and deserve special attention in healthcare facilities177. Other MDROs of current concern include multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP) which is resistant to penicillin and other broad- spectrum agents such as extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs); and strains of S. aureus that are intermediate or resistant to vancomycin (i.e., VISA and VRSA)178-197 198 . MDROs are transmitted by the same r outes as antimicrobial susceptible infectious agents. Patient-to-patient tr ansmission in healthcare settings, usually via hands of HCWs, has been a major fact or accounting for the increase in MDRO incidence and prevalence, especia lly for MRSA and VRE in acute care 22 facilities199-201 . Preventing the emergence and transmission of these pathogens requires a comprehensive approach that includes administrative involvement and measures (e.g., nurse staffing, communication systems, performance improvement processes to ensure adherence to recommended infection control measures), education and training of medical and other healthcare personnel, judicious antibiotic use, comprehens ive surveillance for targeted MDROs, application of infection c ontrol precautions during pat ient care, environmental measures (e.g., cleaning and disinfection of the patient care environment and equipment, dedicated single- patient-use of non-critical equipment), and decolonization therapy when appropriate. The prevention and control of MDROs is a national priority - one that requires that all healthcare facilities and agencies assume responsibility and participate in community-wide control programs 176, 177. A detailed discussion of this topic and recommendations for prevention was published in 2006 may be found at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf I.C.2. Agents of bioterrorism CDC has designated the agents that cause anthrax, smallpox, plague, tularemia, vi ral hemorrhagic fevers, and botulism as Category A (high priority) because t hese agents can be easily disseminated environmentally and/or transmitted from person to person; can cause high mortality and have the potential for major public health impact; might cause public panic and social disruption; and require special action for public health preparedness 202. General information relevant to infection control in healthcare settings for Category A agents of bioterrorism is summarized in Table 3. Consult www.bt.cdc.gov for additional, updated Ca tegory A agent information as well as information concerning Category B and C agents of bioterrorism and updates. Category B and C agents are im portant but are not as readily disseminated and cause less morbidity and mort ality than Category A agents. Healthcare facilities confront a diff erent set of issues when dealing with a suspected bioterrorism event as com pared with other communicable diseases. An understanding of the epidemiology, m odes of transmission, and clinical course of each disease, as well as carefully drafted plans that provide an approach and relevant websites and other resources for disease-specific guidance to healthcare, administrative, and support personnel, are essential for responding to and managing a bioterrorism event. Infection control issues to be addressed include: 1) identifying persons who may be exposed or infected; 2) preventing transmission among patients, healthcare personnel, and visitors; 3) providing treatment, chemoprophylaxis or vaccine to potentially large numbers of people; 4) protecting the envir onment including the logist ical aspects of securing sufficient numbers of AIIRs or designating areas for patient cohorts when there are an insufficient number of AIIRs ava ilable;5) providing adequate quantities of appropriate personal protective equipment; and 6) identifying appropriate staff to care for potentially infectious patients (e.g., vaccinated healthcare personnel for 23 care of patients with smallpox). The re sponse is likely to differ for exposures resulting from an intentional release compared with naturally occurring disease because of the large number persons that can be exposed at the same time and possible differences in pathogenicity. A variety of sources offer guidance for the management of persons exposed to the most likely agents of bioterrori sm. Federal agency websites (e.g., www.usamriid.army.mil/publications/index.html , www.bt.cdc.gov ) and state and county health department web sites should be consulted for the most up-to-date information. Sources of information on specific agents include: anthrax 203; smallpox 204-206; plague 207, 212. I.C.2.a. Pre-event administration of smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine to healthcare personnel Vaccination of personnel in preparation for a possible smallpox exposure has important infection control implications 213-215. These include the need for meticulous screening for vaccine contraindications in persons who are at increased risk for adv erse vaccinia events; containment and monitoring of the vaccination site to prevent transmission in the healthcare setting and at home; and the management of patients with vaccinia-related adverse events 216, 217. The pre-event U.S. smallpox vaccination program of 2003 is an example of the effectiveness of carefully developed recommendations for both screening potential vaccinees for contra indications and vaccination site care and monitoring. Approxim ately 760,000 individuals were vaccinated in the Department of Defense and 40,000 in the civilian or public health populations from December 2002 to February 2005, including approximately 70,000 who worked in healthcare settings. There were no cases of eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, fetal vaccinia, or c ontact transfer of vaccinia in healthcare settings or in military workplaces 218, 219. Outside the healthcare setting, there were 53 cases of contact transfer from military vaccinees to close personal contacts (e.g., bed partners or contacts during participation in sports such as wrestling 220). All contact transfers were from individuals who were not following recommendations to cover their vaccinatio n sites. Vaccinia virus was confirmed by culture or PCR in 30 cases, and two of the confirmed cases resulted from tertiary transfer. All recipients, includi ng one breast-fed infant, recovered without complication. Subsequent studies using viral culture and PCR techniques have confirmed the effectiveness of semipe rmeable dressings to contain vaccinia 221\u00ad 224. This experience emphasizes the importance of ensuring that newly vaccinated healthcare personnel adhere to recommended vaccination-site care, especially if they are to care for hi gh-risk patients. Recommendations for pre- event smallpox vaccination of healthcare personnel and vaccinia-related infection control recommendations are published in the MMWR 216, 225 with updates posted on the CDC bioterrorism web site 205. I.C.3. Prions Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, degenerative, neurologic disorder of humans with an incidence in the United States of approximately 1 person/million population/year 226, 227 24 (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/cjd/cjd.htm ). CJD is believed to be caused by a transmissible proteinaceous infectious agent termed a prion. Infectious prions of a host-encoded glycoprotein known as the prion protein. The incubation period (i.e., time between exposure and and onset of symptoms) varies from two years to many decades. However, death typically occurs within 1 year of the onset of symptoms. A pproximately 85% of CJD cases occur sporadically with no known environmental source of infection and 10% are familial. Iatrogenic transmission has occurr ed with ng from treatment with human cadaveric pituitary-der ived growth hormone or gonadotropin 228, 229, from implantation of contami nated human dura mater grafts 230 or from corneal transplants 231). Transmission has been linked to the use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments or stereotactic electroencephalogram electrodes 232, 233 , 234 , 235. Prion diseases in animals include scrapi e in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow disease\") in catt le, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk 236. BSE, first recognized in t he United Kingdom (UK) in 1986, was associated with a major epidem ic among cattle that had consumed contaminated meat and bone meal. The possible transmission of BSE to hum ans causing variant CJD (vCJD) was first described in 1996 and subsequent ly found to be associated with consumption of BSE-contaminated cattl e products primarily in the United Kingdom. There is strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal association between the caus ative agent of BSE and vCJD 237. Although most cases of vCJD have been reported from the UK, a few cases also have been reported from Europe, Japan, Canada, and the United States. Most vCJD cases worldwide lived in or visited the UK dur ing the years of a large outbreak of BSE (1980-96) and may have consumed contam inated cattle products during that time (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/cjd /cjd.htm). Although there has been no indigenously acquired vCJD in the United States, the sporadic occurrence of BSE in cattle in North America has height ened awareness of the possibility that such infections could occur and have l ed to increased surveillance activities. Updated information may be found on the following website: www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/cjd/cjd.htm . The public health impact of prion diseases has been reviewed 238. vCJD in humans has different clinical and pathologic characteristics from sporadic or classic CJD 239, including the following: 1) younger median age at death: 28 (range 16-48) vs. 68 years; 2) longer duration of illness: median 14 months vs. 4-6 months; 3) increased frequency of s ensory symptoms and early psychiatric symptoms with delayed onset of frank neurologic signs; and 4) detection of prions in tonsillar and other lymphoid tissues from vCJD patients but not from sporadic CJD patients 240. Similar to sporadic CJD, there have been no reported cases of direct human-to-human transmission of vCJD by casual or environmental contact, droplet, or ai rborne routes. Ongoing blood safety surveillance in the U.S. has not detected sporadic CJD transmission through 25 blood transfusion 241-243 . However, bloodborne transmission of vCJD is believed to have occurred in two UK patients 244, 245. The following FDA websites provide information on steps that are being taken in the US to protect the blood supply from CJD and vCJD: http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/cjdvcjd.htm ; http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/cjdvcjdq&a.htm . Standard Precautions are used when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CJD or vCJD. However, s pecial precautions are recommended for tissue handling in the histology labo ratory and for conducting an autopsy, embalming, and for contact with a body that has undergone autopsy 246. Recommendations for reprocessing surgical instruments to prevent transmission of CJD in healthcare settings have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and are curr ently under review at CDC. Questions concerning notification of pati ents potentially exposed to CJD or vCJD through contaminated instruments and bloo d products from patients with CJD or vCJD or at risk of having vCJD may aris e. The risk of transmission associated with such exposures is believed to be extremely low but may vary based on the specific circumstance. Therefore consul tation on appropriate options is advised. The United Kingdom has developed several documents that clinicians and patients in the US may find useful (http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topi cs_az/cjd/information_documents.htm ). I.C.4. Severe Acute Respir atory Syndrome (SARS) SARS is a newly discovered respiratory disease that emer ged in China late in 2002 and spread to several countries 135, 140; Mainland China, Hong K ong, Hanoi, Singapore, and Toronto were affected significantly. SARS is caused by SARS CoV, a previously unrecognized member of t he coronavirus family 247, 248. The incubation period from exposure to the onset of symptoms is 2 to 7 days but can be as long as 10 days and uncommonly even longer 249. The illness is initially difficult to distinguish from other common respiratory infections. Signs and symptoms usually include fever >38.0oC and chills and rigors, sometimes accompanied by headache, myalgia, and mild to severe respiratory symptoms. Radiographic finding of atypical pneumonia is an import ant clinical indicato r of possible SARS. Compared with adults, children have been affected less frequently, have milder disease, and are less likel y to transmit SARS-CoV 135, 249-251. The overall case fatality rate is approximately 6.0%; underlying disease and advanced age increase the risk of mortality ( www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_05_07a/en/ ). Outbreaks in healthcare settings, wit h transmission to large numbers of healthcare personnel and patients have been a striking feat ure of SARS; undiagnosed, infectious patients and visitors were important initiators of these outbreaks 21, 252-254. The relative contribution of pot ential modes of transmission is not precisely known. There is ample evidence for droplet and contact transmission 96, 101, 113; however, opportunistic air borne transmission cannot be excluded 101, 135-139, 149, 255. For example, exposu re to aerosol-generating 26 procedures (e.g., endotracheal intubation, suctioning) was associated with transmission of infection to large numbers of healthcare personnel outside of the United States 93, 94, 96, 98, 253.Therefore, aerosolization of small infectious particles generated during these and other similar procedures could be a risk factor for transmission to others within a multi-bed room or shared airspace. A review of the infection control literature gener ated from the SARS outbreaks of 2003 concluded that the greatest risk of transmission is to those who have close contact, are not properly trained in use of protective infection control procedures, do not consistently use PPE; and that N95 or higher respirators may offer additional protection to those exposed to aerosol- generating procedures and high risk activities 256, 257. Organizational and individual factors that affected adherence to infection control practice s for SARS also were identified 257. Control of SARS requires a coordinat ed, dynamic response by multiple disciplines in a healthcare setting 9. Early detection of cases is accomplished by screening persons with symptoms of a respiratory infection for history of travel to areas experiencing community transmissi on or contact wit h SARS patients, followed by implementation of Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette (i.e., placing a mask over the patient's nose and mouth) and physical separation from other patients in common waiting areas.The precise combination of precautions to protect healthcare personnel has not been determined. At the time of this publication, CDC recommends Standard Pr ecautions, with emphasis on the use of hand hygiene, Contact Precautions wit h emphasis on environmental cleaning due to the detection of SARS CoV RNA by PCR on surfaces in rooms occupied by SARS patients 138, 254, 258, Airborne Precautions , including use of fit-tested NIOSH-approved N95 or higher level respirators, and eye protection 259. In Hong Kong, the use of Droplet and Contact Pr ecautions, which included use of a mask but not a respirator, was effectiv e in protecting healthcare personnel113. However, in Toronto, consistent use of an N95 resp irator was slightly more protective than a mask 93. It is noteworthy that there was no transmission of SARS-CoV to public hospital workers in Vietnam despite inconsistent use of infection control measures, including use of PPE, which sugge sts other factors (e.g., severity of disease, frequency of high risk procedures or events, environmental features) may influence opportunities for transmission 260. SARS-CoV also has been transmitted in the laboratory setting through breaches in recommended laboratory practices. Research laboratories where SARS-CoV was under investigation were the source of most cases repor ted after the first series of outbreaks in the winter and spring of 2003 261, 262. Studies of the SARS outbreaks of 2003 and transmissions that o ccurred in the laboratory re-affirm the effectiveness of recommended infection c ontrol precautions and highlight the importance of consistent adherence to these measures. Lessons from the SARS outbreaks are useful for planning to respond to future public health crises, such as pandemic influenza and biote rrorism events. Surveillance for cases among patients and healthcare personnel, ensuring availability of adequate supplies and staffi ng, and limiting access to healthcare 27 facilities were important factors in the response to SARS that have been summarized 9. Guidance for infection control pr ecautions in various settings is available at www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars. I.C.5. Monkeypox Monkeypox is a rare viral disease found mostly in the rain forest countries of Central and West Africa. The disease is caused by an orthopoxvirus that is similar in appearanc e to smallpox but causes a milder disease. The only recognized outbreak of human monkeypox in the United States was detected in June 2003 after several people became ill following contact with sick pet prairie dogs. Infecti on in the prairie dogs was subsequently traced to their contact with a shipment of animals from Africa, including giant Gambian rats 263. This outbreak demonstrates t he importance of recognition and prompt reporting of unusual disease presentations by clinicians to enable prompt identification of the etiol ogy; and the potential of epizootic diseases to spread from animal reservoirs to humans th rough personal and occupational exposure 264 . Limited data on transmission of monkey pox are available. Transmission from infected animals and humans is believed to occur primarily through direct contact with lesions and respiratory secretions; airborne transmission from animals to humans is unlikely but cannot be excluded, and may have occurred in veterinary practices (e.g., during administration of nebulized medications to ill prairie dogs 265). Among humans, four instances of mo nkeypox transmission within hospitals have been reported in Africa among children, usually related to sharing the same ward or bed 266, 267. Additional recent literatur e documents transmission of Congo Basin monkeypox in a hospital compound for an extended number of generations 268 . There has been no evidence of airbor ne or any other person-to-person transmission of monkeypox in the United States, and no new cases of monkeypox have been identified since the outbreak in June 2003 269. The outbreak strain is a clade of monkeypox distinct from the Congo Basin clade and may have different epidemiologic pr operties (including human-to-human transmission potential) from monkey pox strains of the Congo Basin 270; this awaits further study. Smallpox vaccine is 85% protective against Congo Basin monkeypox 271. Since there is an associated case fatality rate of < 10%, administration of smallpox vaccine within 4 days to individuals who have had direct exposure to patients or ani mals with monkeypox is a reasonable consideration 272. For the most current information on monkeypox, see www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/clinicians.htm . I.C.6. Noroviruses Noroviruses, formerly referred to as Norwalk-like viruses, are members of the Caliciviridae family. These agents are transmitted via contaminated food or wate r and from person-to-pers on, causing explosive outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease 273. Environmental contamination also has been documented as a contributing fact or in ongoing transmission during outbreaks 274, 275. Although noroviruses cannot be propagated in cell culture, 28 DNA detection by molecular diagnostic techniques has facilitated a greater appreciation of their role in out breaks of gastrointestinal disease 276. Reported outbreaks in hospitals 132, 142, 277, nursing homes 275, 278-283, cruise ships 284, 285, hotels 143, 147, schools 148, and large crowded shelters established for hurricane evacuees 286, demonstrate their highly contagious nature, the disruptive impact they have in healthcare facilities and the community, and the difficulty of controlling outbreaks in settings wher e people share common facilites and space. Of note, there is nearly a 5 fold increase in the risk to patients in outbreaks where a patient is the index case compared with exposure of patients during outbreaks where a staff member is the index case 287. The average incubation peri od for gastroenteritis caused by noroviruses is 12-48 hours and the clinical c ourse lasts 12-60 hours 273. Illness is characterized by acute onset of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and/or diarrhea. The disease is largely self-limited; rarely , death caused by severe dehydration can occur, particularly among the elderl y with debilitating health conditions. The epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks shows that even though primary cases may result from exposure to a fecally-c ontaminated food or water, secondary and tertiary cases often result from person- to-person transmission that is facilitated by contamination of fomites 273, 288 and dissemination of infectious particles, especially during the process of vomiting 132, 142, 143, 147, 148, 273, 279, 280. Widespread, persistent and inapparent contamination of the env ironment and fomites can make outbreaks extremely difficult to control 147, 275, 284.These clinical observations and the detection of norovirus DNA on horizontal surfaces 5 feet above the level that might be touched normally suggest that, under certain circumstances, aerosolized particles may travel distances beyond 3 feet 147. It is hypothesized that infectious particles ma y be aerosolized from vomitus, inhaled, and swallowed. In addition, individuals who are responsible for cleaning the environment may be at increased risk of in fection. Development of disease and transmission may be facilitated by the lo w infectious dose (i.e., <100 viral particles) 289 and the resistance of these viru ses to the usual cleaning and disinfection agents (i .e., may survive < 10 ppm chlorine) 290-292. An alternate phenolic agent that was shown to be effe ctive against feline calicivirus was used for environmental cleaning in one outbreak 275, 293. There are insufficient data to determine the efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs against noroviruses when the hands are not visibly soiled 294. Absence of disease in certain individuals during an outbreak may be explained by protection from infection conferred by the B histo-blood group antigen 295. Consultation on outbreaks of gastroenteritis is available through CDC's Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases 296. I.C.7. Hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFV) The hemorrhagic fever viruses are a mixed group of viruses that cause seri ous disease with high fever, skin rash, bleeding diathesis, and in some cases, high mortality; the disease caused is referred to as viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). Among the more commonly known HFVs are Fever virus (Bunyaviridae), 29 and Dengue and Yellow feve r viruses (Flaviviridae) 212, 297. These viruses are transmitted to humans via contact with infe cted animals or via arthropod vectors. While none of these viruses is endemic in the United States, outbreaks in affected countries provide potential opportu nities for importation by infected humans and animals. Furthermore, there are concerns that some of these agents could be used as bioweapons 212. Person-to-person transmission is documented for Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Crimean- Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. In resource-limited healthcare settings, trans mission of these agents to healthcare personnel, patients and visitors has been described and in some outbreaks has accounted for a large proportion of cases 298-300. Transmissions within households also have occurred among individuals who had direct contact with ill persons or their body fluids, but not to those who did not have such contact 301. Evidence concerning the transmission of HFVs has been summarized 212, 302. Person-to-person transmission is associat ed primarily with di rect blood and body fluid contact. Percutaneous exposure to c ontaminated blood carries a particularly high risk for transmission and increased mortality 303, 304. The finding of large numbers of Ebola viral particles in t he skin and the lumina of sweat glands has raised concern that transmi ssion could occur from direct contact with intact skin though epidemiologic evidence to support this is lacking 305. Postmortem handling of infected bodies is an important risk for transmission 301, 306, 307. In rare situations, cases in which the mode of transmission was unexplained among individuals with no known direct contact , have led to speculation that airborne transmission could have occurred 298. However, airborne transmission of naturally occurring HFVs in humans has not been seen. In one study of airplane passengers exposed to an in-flight index case of Lassa fever, there was no transmission to any passengers308 . In the laboratory setting, animals have been infected experiment ally with Marburg or Ebola viruses via direct inoculati on of the nose, mout h and/or conjunctiva 309, 310 and by using mechanically gener ated virus-containing aerosols 311, 312. Transmission of Ebola virus among laborat ory primates in an animal facility has been described 313. Secondarily infected animals were in individual cages and separated by approximately 3 meters. Although the possibi lity of airborne transmission was suggested, the authors were not able to exclude droplet or indirect contact transmission in this incidental observation. Guidance on infection control precautions for HVFs that are transmitted person- to-person have been published by CDC 1, 211 and by the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies 212. The most recent recommendations at the time of publication of this document we re posted on the CDC website on 5/19/05 314. Inconsistencies among the various recommendations have raised questions about the appropriate precautions to use in U.S. hospitals. In less developed countries, outbreaks of HFVs have been controlled with basic hygiene, barrier precautions, safe injection practices, and safe burial practices 299, 306. The preponderance of evidence on HFV transmission indicates that Standard, Contact and Droplet Precautions with eye pr otection are effective in protecting 30 healthcare personnel and visitors who may attend an infected patient. Single gloves are adequate for routine patient care; double-gloving is advised during invasive procedures (e.g., surgery) that pose an increased risk for blood exposure. Routine eye protection (i.e. goggl es or face shield) is particularly important. Fluid-resistant gowns should be worn for all patient contact. Airborne Precautions are not required for routine patient care; however, use of AIIRs is prudent when procedures that could generate infectious aerosols are performed (e.g., endotracheal intubation, broncho scopy, suctioning, involving oscillating saws). N95 or higher level respirators may provide added protection for individuals in a room dur ing aerosol-generating procedures (Table 3, Appendix A). When a patient with a syndrome consistent with hemorrhagic fever also has a history of travel to an endemic area, precautions are initiated upon presentation and then modified as mo re information is obtained (Table 2). Patients with hemorrhagic fever syndrome in the setting of a suspected bioweapon attack should be managed using Airborne Precautions, including AIIRs, since the epidemiology of a pot entially weaponized hemorrhagic fever virus is unpredictable. I.D. Transmission risks associated with specific types of healthcare settings Numerous factors influence differences in transmission risks among the various healthcare settings. These include the popul ation characteristics (e.g., increased susceptibility to infections, type and preval ence of indwelling devices), intensity of care, exposure to environmental sour ces, length of stay, and frequency of interaction between patients/residents with each other and with HCWs. These factors, as well as organizational prio rities, goals, and resources, influence how different healthcare settings adapt trans mission prevention guidelines to meet their specific needs 315, 316. Infection control management decisions are informed by data regarding institutional experienc e/epidemiology, trends in community and institutional HAIs, local, regional, and national epidemiology, and emerging infectious disease threats. I.D.1. Hospitals Infection transmission risks are pr esent in all hospital settings. However, certain hospital settings and patient populations have unique conditions that predispose patients to in fection and merit special mention. These are often sentinel sites for the emergence of new tr ansmission risks that may be unique to that setting or pr esent opportunities for transmi ssion to other settings in the hospital. I.D.1.a. Intensive Care Units Intensive care units (I CUs) serve patients who are immunocompromised by disease state and/or by treatment modalities, as well as patients with major trauma, respiratory failure and other life-threatening conditions (e.g., myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, overdoses, strokes, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, hepatic failure, multi-organ system failure, and the extremes of age). Although ICUs account for a relatively 31 small proportion of hospitalized patients, infections acquired in these units accounted for >20% of all HAIs 317. In the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) system, 26.6% of HA Is were reported from ICU and high risk nursery (NICU) patients in 2002 (NNI S, unpublished data). This patient population has increased suscept ibility to colonization and infection, especially with MDROs and Candida sp. 318, 319, because of underlying diseases and conditions, the invasive medical devices and technology used in their care (e.g. central venous catheters and other intravascular devices, mechanical left ventricular a ssist devices), the frequency of contact with healthcare personnel, prolonged length of stay, and prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents 320-331. Furthermore, adverse patient outcomes in this setting are more severe and are associated with a higher mortality 332. Outbreaks associated with a variety of bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens due to common- source and person-to-person transmissi ons are frequent in adult and pediatric ICUs 31, 333-336, 337 , 338 . I.D.1.b. Burn Units Burn wounds can provide optimal conditions for colonization, infection, and transmission of pathogens; infection acquired by burn patients is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality 320, 339, 340. In patients with a burn injury involving > 30% of the total body surface area (TBSA), the risk of invasive burn wound infect ion is particularly high 341, 342. Infections that occur in patients with burn injury involving <30% TBSA are usually associated with the use of invasive devices. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus , MRSA, enterococci, including VRE, gram-negat ive bacteria, and candida are prevalent pathogens in burn infections 53, 340, 343-350 and outbreaks of these organisms have been reported 351-354. Shifts over time in the predominance of pathogens causing infections among burn patients often l ead to changes in burn care practices 343, 355-358. Burn wound infections caused by Aspergillus sp. or other environmental molds may result from ex posure to supplies contaminated during construction 359 or to dust generated during construction or other environmental disruption 360. Hydrotherapy equipment is an important environmental reservoir of gram-negative organisms. Its use for burn care is discouraged based on demonstrated associations between use of contaminated hydrotherapy equipment and infections. Burn wound infections and colonization, as well as bloodstream infections, caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa 361, A. baumannii 362, and MRSA 352 have been associated with hydrother apy; excision of burn wounds in operating rooms is preferred. Advances in burn care, specifically early excision and grafting of the burn wound, use of topical antimicrobial agents, and institution of early enteral feeding, have led to decreased infectious complications. Other advances have included prophylactic antimicrobial usage, select ive digestive decontamination (SDD), and use of antimicrobial-coated catheters (A CC), but few epidemiologic studies and no efficacy studies have been performed to show the relative benefit of these 357measures . 32 There is no consensus on the most effectiv e infection control practices to prevent transmission of infections to and from pat ients with serious burns (e.g., single- bed rooms 358, laminar flow 363 and high efficiency particulate air filtration [HEPA] 360 or maintaining burn patients in a separ ate unit without exposure to patients or equipment from other units 364). There also is controversy regarding the need for and type of barrier precautions for r outine care of burn patients. One retrospective study demonstrated effica cy and cost effectiveness of a simplified barrier isolation protocol for wound colonization, emphasizing handwashing and use of gloves, caps, masks and plastic impermeable aprons (rather than isolation gowns) for direct patient contact 365 . However, there have been no studies that define the most effective combination of infection control precautions for use in burn settings. Prospective studies in this area are needed. I.D.1.c. Pediatrics Studies of the epidemiol ogy of HAIs in children have identified unique infection control issues in this population 63, 64, 366-370. Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients and the lowest birthweight babies in the high- risk nursery (HRN) monitored in the NNI S system have had high rates of central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections 64, 320, 369-372. Additionally, there is a high prevalence of community -acquired infections among hospitalized infants and young children who have not yet become immune either by vaccination or by natural infection. The result is more patients and their sibling visitors with transmissible infections present in pediatric healthcare settings, especially during seasonal ep idemics (e.g., pertussis 36, 40, 41, respiratory viral infections including those caused by RSV 24, influenza viruses 373, parainfluenza virus 374, 34, varicella [chickenpox] 377, and rotavirus 38, 378). Close physical contact between healthcare personnel and infants and young children (eg. cuddling, feeding, playi ng, changing soiled diapers, and cleaning copious uncontrolled respiratory secret ions) provides abundant opportunities for transmission of infectious material . Practices and behaviors such as congregation of children in play areas wher e toys and bodily secretions are easily shared and family members rooming-in with pediatric patients can further increase the risk of transmission. Pa thogenic bacteria have been recovered from toys used by hospitalized patients 379; contaminated bath toys were implicated in an outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa on a pediatric oncology unit 80. In addition, several patient factors increase the likelihood that infection will result from exposure to pathogens in healthca re settings (e.g., im maturity of the neonatal immune system, lack of previ ous natural infection and resulting immunity, prevalence of patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, congenital anatomic anomalies, and use of life-saving invasive devices in neontal and pediat ric intensive care units) 63. There are theoretical concerns that infection risk will increase in association with innovative practices used in the NICU for the purpose of impr oving developmental outcomes, Such factors include co-bedding 380 and kangaroo care 381 that may increase opportunity for skin-to-skin exposure of multiple gestation infants to each other and to their mothers, respectively; although infection risk smay actually be 33 reduced among infants receiving kangaroo care 382. Children who attend child care centers 383, 384 and pediatric rehabilitation units 385 may increase the overall burden of antimicrobial resi stance (eg. by MRSA [CA-MRSA]) 386-391 . Patients in chronic care facilities may have increased rates of colonization with resistant GNBs and may be sources of introduction of resistant organisms to acute care settings 50. I.D.2. Nonacute healthcare settings Healthcare is provided in various settings outside of hospitals including facilities, su ch as long-term care facilities (LTCF) (e.g. nursing homes), homes for the dev elopmentally disabled, settings where behavioral health services are provided, rehabilitation centers and hospices392 . In addition, healthcare may be provi ded in nonhealthcare settings such as workplaces with occupational health clinics, adult day care centers, assisted living facilities, homeless shelters, jails and prisons, school clinics and infirmaries. Each of these settings has unique circumstances and population risks to consider when designing and implementing an infection control program. Several of the most common settings and their particular challenges are discussed below. While this Guidelin e does not address each setting, the principles and strategies provided ma y be adapted and applied as appropriate. I.D.2.a. Long-term care The designation LTCF applies to a diverse group of residential settings, ranging from institutions for the devel opmentally disabled to nursing homes for the elderly and pediatric chronic-care facilities 393-395. Nursing homes for the elderly predominate num erically and frequently represent long- term care as a group of facilities. Appr oximately 1.8 million Americans reside in the nation's 16,500 nursing homes 396. Estimates of HAI rates of 1.8 to 13.5 per 1000 resident-care days have been report ed with a range of 3 to 7 per 1000 resident-care days in the more rigorous studies 397-401. The infrastructure described in the Department of Veterans Affairs nursing home care units is a promising example for the development of a nat ionwide HAI surveillance system for LTCFs 402. LCTFs are different from other healthcare settings in that elderly patients at increased risk for infection are brought together in one setting and remain in the facility for extended periods of time; for most residents, it is their home. An atmosphere of community is fostered and residents share common eating and living areas, and participate in vari ous facility-sponsored activities 403, 404. Since able residents interact freely with each ot her, controlling transmission of infection in this setting is challenging 405. Residents who are colonized or infected with certain microorganisms are, in some case s, restricted to their room. However, because of the psychosocial risks associat ed with such restriction, it has been recommended that psychosocial needs be bal anced with infection control needs in the LTCF setting 406-409. Documented LTCF outbreaks have been caused by various viruses (e.g., influenza virus 35, 410-412, rhinovirus 413, adenovirus (conjunctivitis) 414, norovirus 278, 279 275, 281) and bacteria, including group A streptococcus 162, B. pertussis 415, non-susceptible S. pneumoniae 197, 198, other MDROs, and Clostridium difficile 416) These pathogens can lead to substantial 34 morbidity and mortality, and increased me dical costs; prompt detection and implementation of effective c ontrol measures are required. Risk factors for infection are prevalent among LTCF residents 395, 417, 418. Age- related declines in immunity may affect responses to immunizations for influenza and other infectious agents, and increas e susceptibility to tuberculosis. Immobility, incontinence, dysphagia, underlying chronic diseases, poor functional status, and age-related skin changes increase susceptibility to urinary, respiratory and cutaneous and soft tissue infe ctions, while malnutrition can impair wound healing 419-423. Medications (e.g., drugs that affect level of consciousness, immune function, gastric acid secretions, and normal flora, including antimicrobial therapy) and invasive devices (e.g., urinary catheters and feeding tubes) heighten susceptibility to infection and colonization in LTCF residents 424-426. Finally, limited functional status and total dependence on healthcare personnel for activities of daily living have been identified as independent risk factors for infection 401, 417, 427 and for colonization with MRSA 428, 429 and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae 430. Several position papers and review articles have been published that provide guidance on various aspects of infection contro l and antimicrobial resistance in LTCFs 406-408, 431-436. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have established regulatio ns for the prevention of infection in LTCFs 437. Because residents of LTCFs are hospi talized frequently, they can transfer pathogens between LTCFs and healthcare facilit ies in which they receive care 8, 438-441. This is also true for pediatric long-term care populations. Pediatric chronic care facilities have been associated with importing extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant, gram- negative bacilli into one PICU 50. Children from pediatric rehabilitation units may contri bute to the reservoir of community- associated MRSA 385, 389-391. I.D.2.b. Ambulatory Care In the past decade, healthcare delivery in the United States has shifted from the acute, inpat ient hospital to a variety of ambulatory and community-based settings, including t he home. Ambulatory care is provided in hospital-based outpatient clinics, nonhospital-based clinics and physician offices, public health clinics, free-standi ng dialysis centers, ambulatory surgical centers, urgent care centers, and many others. In 2000, there were 83 million visits to hospital outpatient clinics and more than 823 million visits to physician offices 442; ambulatory care now accounts for most patient encounters with the health care system 443. In these settings, adapting transmission prevention guidelines is challenging because pat ients remain in common areas for prolonged periods waiting to be seen by a healthcare provider or awaiting admission to the hospital, examination or treatment rooms are turned around quickly with limited cleaning, and infect ious patients may not be recognized immediately. Furthermore, immunoco mpromised patients often receive chemotherapy in infusion rooms where t hey stay for extended periods of time along with other types of patients. 35 There are few data on the risk of HAIs in ambulatory care settings, with the exception of hemodialysis centers 18 , 444, 445. Transmission of infections in outpatient settings has been reviewed in three publications 446-448. Goodman and Solomon summarized 53 clusters of infe ctions associated with the outpatient setting from 1961-1990 446. Overall, 29 clusters were associated with common source transmission from contaminated solutions or equipment, 14 with person- to-person transmission from or in volving healthcare personnel and ten associated with airborne or droplet transmission among patients and healthcare workers. Transmission of bloodborne pat hogens (i.e., hepatitis B and C viruses and, rarely, HIV) in outbreaks, sometimes involving hundreds of patients, continues to occur in ambulatory settings . These outbreaks often are related to common source exposures, usually a cont aminated medical device, multi-dose vial, or intravenous solution 82, 449-453. In all cases, transmission has been attributed to failure to adhere to fundamental infection control principles, including safe injection practices and aseptic technique.This subject has been reviewed and recommended infection control and safe injection practices summarized 454. Airborne transmission of M.tuberculosis and measles in ambulatory settings, most frequently emergency dep artments, has been reported 34, 127, 446, 448, 455-457. Measles virus was transmitted in physici an offices and other outpatient settings during an era when immunization rates we re low and measles outbreaks in the community were occurring regularly 34, 122, 458. Rubella has been transmitted in the outpatient obstetric setting 33; there are no published reports of varicella transmission in the outpatient setti ng. In the ophthalmology setting , adenovirus type via incompletely disinfected ophthalmology equi pment and/or from healthcare workers to patients, presumably by contaminated hands 17, 446, 448, 459-462. If transmission in outpatient settings is to be prevented, screening for potentially infectious symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, especially those who may be at risk for transmitting airborne infectious agents (e.g., M. tuberculosis, varicella-zoster virus, rubeola [measles]), is necessary at the start of the initial patient encounter. Upon identification of a potentially infectious patient, implementation of prevention measur es, including prompt separation of potentially infectious patients and implementation of appropriate control measures (e.g., Respiratory Hygiene/ Cough Etiquette and Transmission-Based Precautions) can decrease transmission risks 9, 12. Transmission of MRSA and VRE in outpatient settings has not been r eported, but the association of CA\u00ad MRSA in healthcare personnel working in an outpatient HIV clinic with environmental CA-MRSA contamination in t hat clinic, suggests the possibility of transmission in that setting 463. Patient-to-patient transmission of Burkholderia species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in outpatient clinics for adults and children with cystic fibrosis has been confirmed 464, 465. I.D.2.c. Home Care Home care in the United Stat es is delivered by over 20,000 provider agencies that in clude home health agencies, hospices, durable medical equipment providers, home infusion therapy services, and personal care and 36 support services providers. Home care is provided to patients of all ages with both acute and chronic conditions. The scope of services ranges from assistance with activities of daily living and physical and occupational therapy to the care of wounds, infusion therapy, and chronic am bulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The incidence of infection in home care patients, other t han those associated with infusion therapy is not well studied 466-471 . However, data collection and calculation of infection rates hav e been accomplished for central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections in patients receiving home infusion therapy 470-474 and for the risk of blood contact through percutaneous or mucosal exposures, demonstrating that surve illance can be performed in this setting 475. Draft definitions for home care as sociated infections have been developed 476. Transmission risks during home care are presumed to be minimal. The main transmission risks to home care patients are from an infectious healthcare provider or contaminated equipment; pr oviders also can be exposed to an infectious patient during home visits. Sinc e home care involves patient care by a limited number of personnel in settings wit hout multiple patients or shared equipment, the potential reservoir of pat hogens is reduced. Infections of home care providers, that could pose a risk to home care patients include infections transmitted by the airborne or droplet r outes (e.g., chickenpox, tuberculosis, influenza), and skin infestations (e.g., scabies 69 and lice) and infections (e.g.,impetigo) transmitted by direct or indirect contact. There are no published data on indirect transmission of MDROs fr om one home care patient to another, although this is theoretical ly possible if contaminated equipment is transported from an infected or colonized patient and used on another patient. Of note, investigation of the first case of VISA in homecare 186 and the first 2 reported cases of VRSA 178, 180, 181, 183 found no evidence of tr ansmission of VISA or VRSA to other home care re cipients. Home health care also may contribute to antimicrobial resistance; a review of outpatient vancomycin use found 39% of recipients did not receive the antibioti c according to recommended guidelines 477. Although most home care agencies impl ement policies and procedures to prevent transmission of organisms, the current approach is based on the adaptation of the 1996 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals 1 as well as other professional guidance 478, 479. This issue has been very challenging in the home care industry and practice has been inconsistent and frequently not evidence-based. For example, many hom e health agencies continue to observe \"nursing bag technique,\" a practice that prescribes the use of barriers between the nursing bag and environmental surfaces in the home 480. While the home environment may not always appear clean, the use of barriers between two non\u00ad critical surfaces has been questioned 481, 482. Opportunites exist to conduct research in home care related to infection transmission risks 483. I.D.2.d. Other sites of healthcare delivery Facilities that are not primarily healthcare settings but in which health care is delivered include clinics in correctional facilities and shelters. Both settings can have suboptimal features, 37 such as crowded conditions and poor v entilation. Economically disadvantaged individuals who may have chronic illnesses and healthcare problems related to alcoholism, injection drug use, poor nutrition, and/or inadequate shelter often receive their primary healthcare at sites such as these 484. Infectious diseases of special concern for transmission incl ude tuberculosis, scabies, respiratory infections (e.g., N. meningitides, S. HCV, syphilis, gonorrhea), hepatitis A virus (HAV), diarrheal agents such as norovirus, and foodborne diseases 286, 485-488. A high index of suspicion fo r tuberculosis and CA-MRSA in these populations is needed as outbreaks in these settings or among the populations they serve have been reported 489-497. Patient encounters in these types of fac ilities provide an opportunity to deliver recommended immunizations and screen for M. tuberculosis infection in addition to diagnosing and treating acute illnesses 498. Recommended infection control measures in these non-traditional areas designated for healthcare delivery are the same as for other ambulatory care se ttings. Therefore, these settings must be equipped to observe Standard Precautions and, when indicated, Transmission-based Precautions. I.E. Transmission risks associated wi th special patient populations As new treatments emerge for complex diseases, unique infection control challenges associated with special patient populatio ns need to be addressed. I.E.1. Immunocompromised patients Patients who have congenital primary immune deficiencies or acquired di sease (eg. treatment-induced immune deficiencies) are at increased risk for numerous types of infections while receiving healthcare and may be locat ed throughout the healthcare facility. The specific defects of the immune system determine the types of infections that are most likely to be acquired (e.g., viral infections are associated with T-cell defects and fungal and bacterial infections occur in patients who are neutropenic). As a general group, immunocompr omised patients can be cared for in the same environment as other patients; however, it is always advisable to minimize exposure to other patients with transmissi ble infections such as influenza and other respiratory viruses 499, 500. The use of more intense chemotherapy regimens for treatment of childhood l eukemia may be associated with prolonged periods of neutropenia and suppression of other components of the immune system, extending the period of infect ion risk and raising the concern that additional precautions may be indicated for select groups 501, 502. With the application of newer and more intense i mmunosuppressive therapies for a variety of medical conditions (e.g., rheumatologic disease 503, 504, inflammatory bowel disease 505), immunosuppressed patients are likely to be more widely distributed throughout a healthcare facility rather than localized to single patient units (e.g. 38 hematology-oncology). Guidelines for prevent ing infections in certain groups of immunocompromised pati ents have been published 15, 506, 507. Published data provide evi dence to support placing allogeneic HSCT patients in a Protective Environment 15, 157, 158. Also, three guidelines have been developed that address the special requirements of these immunocom promised patients, including use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and engineering controls to create a Protective Environment for the pr evention of infections caused by Aspergillus spp. and other environmental fungi 11, 14, 15. As more intense chemotherapy regimens associated with prolonged periods of neutropenia or graft-versus-host disease are implemented, the period of risk and duration of environmental protection may need to be prolon ged beyond the traditional 100 days 508. I.E.2. Cystic fibrosis patients Patients with cystic fibr osis (CF) require special consideration when developing infection control guidelines. Compared to other patients, CF patients require additional protection to prevent transmission from contaminated respirat ory therapy equipment 509-513. Infectious agents such as Burkholderia cepacia complex and P. aeruginosa 464, 465, 514, 515 have unique clinical and prognostic significance. In CF patients, B. cepacia infection has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality 516-518, while delayed acquisition of chronic P.aeruginosa infection may be associated with an improved long-term clinical outcome 519, 520. Person-to-person transmission of B. cepacia complex has been demonstrated among children 517 and adults 521 with CF in healthcare settings 464, 522, during various social contacts 523, most notably attendance at camps for patients with CF 524, and among siblings with CF 525. Successful infection control measures used to prevent transmission of respiratory secretions include segregation of CF patients from each other in ambulatory and hospital settings (including use of private rooms with separ ate showers), environmental decontamination of surfaces and equipment contaminated with re spiratory secretions , elimination of group chest physiotherapy sessions, and disbanding of CF camps 97, 526. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation published a consensus document with evidence-based recommendations for infection c ontrol practices for CF patients 20. I.F. New therapies associated with pot entially transmissible infectious agents I.F.1. Gene therapy Gene therapy has has been attempted using a number of different viral vectors, including no nreplicating retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno\u00ad associated viruses, and rep lication-competent strains of poxviruses. Unexpected adverse events have restricted the prev alence of gene therapy protocols. The infectious hazards of gene therapy are theoretical at this time, but require meticulous surveillance due to the possibl e occurrence of in vivo recombination 39 and the subsequent emergence of a transmissible genetically altered pathogen. Greatest concern attends the use of rep lication-competent viruses, especially vaccinia. As of the time of publication, no reports have described transmission of a vector virus from a gene therapy recipi ent to another individual, but surveillance is ongoing. Recommendations for monitoring infection control issues throughout the course of gene therapy trials have been published 527-529 . I.F.2. Infections transmitted through blood, organs and other tissues The potential hazard of transmitting infectious pathogens through biologic products is a small but ever present risk, despi te donor screening. Reported infections transmitted by transfusion or transplantat ion include West Nile Virus infection 530 cytomegalovirus infection 531, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease 230, hepatitis C 532, infections with Clostridium spp. 533 and group A streptococcus disease 537, lymphocytic choriomeningitis 538, and rabies 539, 540. Therefore, it is import ant to consider receipt of biologic products when evaluating patients for potentia l sources of infection. I.F.3. Xenotransplantation The transplantation of nonhuman cells, tissues, and organs into humans potentially exposes patients to zoonotic pathogens. Transmission of known zoonotic infections (e.g., trichinosis from porcine tissue), constitutes one concern, but also of concer n is the possibility that transplantation of nonhuman cells, tissues, or organs may tr ansmit previously unknown zoonotic infections (xenozoonoses) to immunos uppressed human recipients. Potential infections that might accompany trans plantation of porcine organs have been described 541 . Guidelines from the U.S. P ublic Health Service address many infectious diseases and infection contro l issues that surround the developing field of xenotransplantation 542); work in this area is ongoing. 40 Part II: Fundamental elements needed to prevent transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings II.A. Healthcare system components that influence the effectiveness of precautions to prevent transmission II.A.1. Administrative measures Healthcare organizations can demonstrate a commitment to preventing transmission of infectious agents by incorporating infection control into the objectives of the organization's patie nt and occupational safety programs 543-547. An infrastructure to gu ide, support, and monitor adherence to Standard and Transmi ssion-Based Precautions 434, 548, 549 will facilitate fulfillment of the organization' s mission and achievement of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization's patient safety goal to decrease HAIs 550. Policies and procedures that explain how Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions are applied, including systems used to identify and communicate information about pati ents with potentially transmissible infectious agents, are e ssential to ensure the success of these measures and may vary according to the char acteristics of the organization. A key administrative measure is provis ion of fiscal and human resources for maintaining infection control and occupational health programs that are responsive to emerging needs. Specif ic components include bedside nurse 551 and infection prevention and control professional (ICP) staffing levels 552, inclusion of ICPs in facility construction and design decisions 11, clinical microbiology laboratory support 553, 554, adequate supplies and equipment including facility ventilation systems 11, adherence monitoring 555, assessment and correction of system failures that contribute to transmission 556, 557, and provision of feedback to healthcare personnel and senior administrators 434, 548, 549, 558. The positive influence of instituti onal leadership has been demonstrated repeatedly in studies of HCW adherence to recommended hand hygiene practices 176, 177, 434, 548, 549, 559-564. Healthcare administrator involvement in infection control processes can impr ove administrators' awareness of the rationale and resource requirements fo r following recommended infection control practices. Several administrative factors may affect the transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings: institutional culture, individual worker behavior, and the work environment. Each of these areas is suitable for performance improvement monitoring and incorporation into t he organization's patient safety goals 543, 544, 546, 565. 41 II.A.1.a.Scope of work and staffing needs fo r infection control professionals The effectiveness of infection surveillance and control programs in preventing nosocomial infections in United States hospitals was assessed by the CDC through the Study on the Efficacy of No socomial Infection Control (SENIC Project) conducted 1970-76 566. In a representative sample of US general hospitals, those with a trained infection control physician or microbiologist involved in an infection control program, and at least one infection control nurse per 250 beds, were associated with a 32% lo wer rate of four infections studied (CVC-associated bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonias, catheter-related urinary tract infections, and surgical site infections). Since that landmark study was published, responsibilities of ICPs have expanded commensurate with the growing complexity of the healthcare system, the patient populations served, and the increasing numbers of medical procedures and devices used in all types of healthcare settings. The scope of work of ICPs was first assessed in 1982 567-569 by the Certification B oard of Infection Control (CBIC), and has been re-assessed ever y five years since that time 558, 570-572. The findings of these task analyses have been used to develop and update the Infection Control Certificati on Examination, offered for t he first time in 1983. With each survey, it is apparent that the role of the ICP is growing in complexity and scope, beyond traditional infection control activities in acute care hospitals. Activities currently assigned to ICPs in response to emerging challenges include: 1) surveillance and infection prevention at facilities other than acute care hospitals e.g., ambulatory clinics, day su rgery centers, long term care facilities, rehabilitation centers, home care; 2) oversight of employee health services related to infection prevention, e.g. assessment of risk and administration of recommended treatment following exposure to infectious agents, tuberculosis screening, influenza vaccination, respir atory protection fit testing, and administration of other vaccines as indicated, such as smallpox vaccine in 2003; 3) preparedness planning for annual influen za outbreaks, pandemic influenza, SARS, bioweapons attacks; 4) adherence monitoring for selected infection control practices; 5) oversight of risk assessment and implementation of prevention measures associ ated with construction and r enovation; 6) prevention of transmission of MDROs; 7) evaluation of new medical pr oducts that could be associated with increased infe ction risk. e.g.,intravenous infusion materials; 9) communication with the public, facility staff, and state and local health departments concerning infection control-related issues; and 10) participation in local and multi-center research projects 434, 549, 552, 558, 573, 574. None of the CBIC job analyses addressed specific staffing requirements for the identified tasks, although the surve ys did include information about hours worked; the 2001 survey included the number of ICPs assigned to the responding facilities 558 . There is agreement in the literature that 1 ICP per 250 acute care beds is no longer adequate to meet current infection control needs; a Delphi project that assessed staffing needs of infection control programs in the 21 st century concluded that a ratio of 0.8 to 1.0 ICP per 100 occupied acute care beds is an appropriate level of staffing 552. A survey of participants in the National 42 Nosocomial Infections Surveillance ( NNIS) system found the average daily census per ICP was 115 316. Results of other studies have been similar: 3 per 500 beds for large acute care hospitals, 1 per 150-250 beds in long term care facilities, and 1.56 per 250 in small rural hospitals 573, 575. The foregoing demonstrates that infection control st affing can no longer be based on patient census alone, but rather must be det ermined by the scope of the program, characteristics of the pat ient population, complexity of the healthcare system, tools available to assist personnel to perform essential tasks (e.g., electronic tracking and laboratory support for surv eillance), and unique or urgent needs of the institution and community 552. Furthermore, appropriate training is required to optimize the quality of work performed 558, 572, 576. II.A.1.a.i. Infection Control Nurse Liaison Designating a bedside nurse on a patient care unit as an infection control liaison or \"link nurse\" is reported to be an effective adjunct to enhance infect ion control at the unit level 577-582. Such individuals receive training in basic infection control and have frequent communication with the ICPs, but maintain their primary role as bedside caregiver on their units. The infecti on control nurse liaison increases the awareness of infection control at the unit leve l. He or she is especially effective in implementation of new policies or contro l interventions because of the rapport with individuals on the unit, an understanding of unit-specific challenges, and ability to promote strategies that are most likely to be successful in that unit. This position is an adjunct to, not a replacement for, fully trained ICPs. Furthermore, the infection control liaison nurses s hould not be counted when considering ICP staffing. II.A.1.b. Bedside nurse staffing There is increasing evi dence that the level of bedside nurse-staffing influences the quality of patient care 583, 584. If there are adequate nursing staff, it is more likely t hat infection control practices, including hand hygiene and Standard and Transmission- Based Precautions, will be given appropriate attention and applied correctly and consistently 552. A national multicenter study reported strong and cons istent inverse relationships between nurse staffing and five adverse outcomes in medical patients, two of which were HAIs: urinary tract infections and pneumonia 583. The association of nursing staff shortages with increased rates of HA Is has been demonstrated in several outbreaks in hospitals and long term care settings, and with increased transmission of hepatitis C virus in dialysis units 22, 418, 551, 585-597. In most cases, when staffing improved as part of a comprehensive control intervention, the outbreak ended or the HAI rate declined. In two studies 590, 596, the composition of the nursing staff (\"pool\" or \"f loat\" vs. regular staff nurse s) influenced the rate of primary bloodstream infections, with an increased infection rate occurring when the proportion of regular nurses de creased and pool nurses increased. II.A.1.c. Clinical micr obiology laboratory support The critical role of the clinical microbiology laboratory in infection control and healthcare epidemiology is described well 553, 554, 598-600 and is supported by the Infectious Disease Society 43 of America policy statement on consolidation of clinical microbiology laboratories published in 2001 553. The clinical microbiology laboratory contributes to preventing transmission of infectious diseas es in healthcare settings by promptly detecting and reporting epidemio logically important or ganisms, identifying emerging patterns of antimicrobial resistance, and assisting in assessment of the effectiveness of recommended precautions to limit transmission during outbreaks 598. Outbreaks of infections may be recognized first by laboratorians 162. Healthcare organizations need to ensur e the availability of the recommended scope and quality of laboratory services, a sufficient number of appropriately trained laboratory staff members, and systems to promptly communicate epidemiologically important results to t hose who will take action (e.g., providers of clinical care, infection control staff, healthcare epidemiologists, and infectious disease consultants) 601. As concerns about emerging pathogens and bioterrorism grow, the role of the clinical microbiology laboratory takes on even greater importance. For healthcare organi zations that outsource microbiology laboratory services (e.g., ambulatory care, home care, LTCFs, smaller acute care hospitals), it is important to specify by contract the types of services (e.g., periodic institution-specific aggregate susceptibility reports) required to support infection control. Several key functions of the clinical microbiology laboratory are relevant to this guideline: Antimicrobial susceptibility by testi ng and interpretation in accordance with current guidelines developed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), known as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) since 2005 602, for the detection of emerging resistance patterns 603, 604, and for the preparation, analysis, and distribution of periodic cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility summary reports 605-607. While not required, clinical la boratories ideally should have access to rapid genotypic identification of bacteria and their antibiotic resistance genes 608. Performance of surveillance cultures when appropriate (including retention of isolates for analysis) to assess patterns of infection transmission and effectiveness of infection control interventions at the facility or organization. Microbiologists assist in decisions concerning the indications for initiating and discont inuing active surveillance programs and optimize the use of l aboratory resources. Molecular typing, on-site or outsourc ed, in order to investigate and control healthcare-associated outbreaks 609. Application of rapid diagnostic tests to support clinical decisions involving patient treatment, room se lection, and implementation of control measures including barrier precautions and use of vaccine or chemoprophylaxis agents (e.g., influenza 610-612, B. pertussis 613, RSV 614, 615, and enteroviruses 616). The microbiologist provides guidance to limit rapid testing to clinical situations in which rapid results influence patient 44 management decisions, as well as prov iding oversight of point-of-care testing performed by non-laboratory healthcare workers 617. Detection and rapid reporting of epi demiologically important organisms, including those that are reportabl e to public health agencies. Implementation of a quality control pr ogram that ensures testing services are appropriate for the population serv ed, and stringently evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, appl icability, and feasibility. Participation in a multidisciplin ary team to develop and maintain an effective institutional program for t he judicious use of antimicrobial agents 618, 619. II.A.2. Institutional safety cultur e and organizational characteristics Safety culture (or safety climate) refers to a work environment where a shared commitment to safety on the part of management and the workforce is understood and followed 557, 620, 621. The authors of the In stitute of Medicine Report, To Err is Human 543, acknowledge that causes of medical error are multifaceted but emphasize repeatedly the pivotal role of system failures and the benefits of a safety culture. A safety culture is created through 1) the actions management takes to improve patient and work er safety; 2) work er participation in safety planning; 3) the availability of appropriate protective equipment; 4) influence of group norms regarding accept able safety practices; and 5) the organization's socialization process for new personnel. Safety and patient outcomes can be enhanced by improving or creating organizational characteristics within patient care units as demonstrated by studies of surgical ICUs 622, 623. Each of these factors has a direct bearing on adherence to transmission prevention recommendations 257. Measurement of an institutional culture of safety is useful for designing improvements in healthcare 624, 625. Several hospital-based studies have linke d measures of safety culture with both employee adherence to safe practices and reduced exposures to blood and body fluids 626-632. One study of hand hygiene practices concluded that improved adherence requires integration of infection control into the organization's safety culture 561. Several hospitals that are part of the Veterans Administration Healthcare System have taken specific steps toward improving the safety culture, including error reporting mechanisms, performing root cause analysis on problems identified, providing safety incentives, and employee education. 633-635 . II.A.3. Adherence of healthcare personnel to recommended guidelines Adherence to recommended infection contro l practices decreases transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings 116, 562, 636-640. However, several observational studies have shown lim ited adherence to recommended practices by healthcare personnel 559, 640-657. Observed adherence to universal precautions ranged from 43% to 89% 641, 642, 649, 651, 652. However, the degree of adherence depended frequently on the practice that was assessed and, for glove use, the circumstance in which they were used. Appropriate glove use has ranged from a low of 15% 645 to a high of 82% 650 . However, 92% and 98% adherence with glove use have been reported during arterial blood gas collection and 45 resuscitation, respectively, procedures where there may be considerable blood contact 643, 656. Differences in observed adherence have been reported among occupational groups in the same healthcare facility 641 and between experienced and nonexperienced professionals 645. In surveys of health care personnel, self- reported adherence was generally higher than that reported in observational studies. Furthermore, where an observat ional component was included with a self-reported survey, self-perceived adher ence was often greater than observed adherence 657. Among nurses and physicians, increasing years of experience is a negative predictor of adherence 645, 651. Education to improve adherence is the primary intervention that has been studied. While positive changes in knowledge and attitude have been demonstrated, 640, 658, there often has been limited or no accompanying change in behavior 642, 644. Self-reported adherence is higher in groups that have received an educational intervention 630, 659. Educational interventions that incorporated vi deotaping and performance feedback were successful in improving adherence during the period of study; the long-term effect of these interventions is not known 654.The use of videotape also served to identify system problems (e.g., communica tion and access to personal protective equipment) that otherwise may not have been recognized. Use of engineering controls and facility design concepts for improving adherence is gaining interest. While introduction of automated sinks had a negative impact on consistent adherence to hand washing 660, use of electronic monitoring and voice prompts to remind healthcare workers to perform hand hygiene, and improving accessibility to hand hygiene products, increased adherence and contributed to a decrease in HAIs in one study 661. More information is needed regarding how technology might improve adherence. Improving adherence to infection contro l practices requires a multifaceted approach that incorporates continuous asse ssment of both the i ndividual and the work environment 559, 561. Using several behavioral theories, Kretzer and Larson concluded that a single intervention (e.g ., a handwashing campaign or putting up new posters about transmission precautio ns) would likely be ineffective in improving healthcare personnel adherence 662. Improvement requires that the organizational leadership make prevention an institutional priority and integrate infection control practices into the organization's safety culture 561. A recent review of the literature conc luded that variations in organizational factors (e.g., safety climate, policies and procedures, education and training) and individual factors (e.g., knowledge, perceptions of risk, past experience) were determinants of adherence to infection control guidelin es for protection against SARS and other respiratory pathogens 257. II.B. Surveillance for healthcare-asso ciated infections (HAIs) Surveillance an essential tool for case-finding of single pati ents or clusters of patients who are infected or coloniz ed with epidemiologically important organisms (e.g., susceptible bacteria such as S. aureus, S. pyogenes [Group A streptococcus] or Enterobacter-Klebsie lla MDROs; difficile ; RSV; influenza virus) for whic h transmission-based precautions may 46 be required. Surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and disseminati on of data regarding a health-related event for use in public health action to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve health 663. The work of Ignaz Semmelweis that described the role of person-to-person transmission in puerperal sepsis is t he earliest example of the use of surveillance data to reduce transmission of infectious agents 664. Surveillance of both process measures and the infection rates to which they are linked are important for eval uating the effectiveness of infection prevention efforts and identifying indications for change 555, 665-668. The Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) found that different combinations of in fection control practices resulted in reduced rates of nosocomial surgical site infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia in acute care hospitals 566; however, surveillance was the only component essential for reducing all four types of HAIs. Although a similar study has not been conducted in other healthcare settings, a role for surveillance and the need for novel strategies have been described in LTCFs 398, 434, 669, 670 and in home care 470-473. The essential elements of a surveillance system are: 1) standardized definitions; 2) identification of patient populations at risk for infection; 3) statistical analysis (e.g. risk-adjustment, calculation of rates using appropriate denominators, trend analysis us ing methods such as statistical process control charts); and 4) feedback of results to the primary caregivers 671\u00ad 676. Data gathered through surveillance of high-risk populations, device use, procedures, and/or facility locations (e.g., ICUs) are useful for detecting transmission trends 671-673. Identification of clusters of infections should be followed by a systematic epidemiologic in vestigation to determine commonalities in persons, places, and time; and guide implementation of interventions and evaluation of the effectiveness of those interventions. Targeted surveillance based on the highes t risk areas or patients has been preferred over facility-wide surveillance fo r the most effective use of resources 673, 676. However, surveillance for certain epidemiologically im portant organisms may need to be facility-wide. Surveillance methods will continue to evolve as healthcare delivery systems change 392, 677 and user-friendly electronic tools become more widely available for electronic tracking and trend analysis 674, 678, 679. Individuals with experience in healthca re epidemiology and infection control should be involved in selecting software packages for data aggregation and analysis to assure that the need for effici ent and accurate HAI surveillance will be met. Effective surveillance is increasin gly important as legislation requiring public reporting of HAI rates is passed and states work to develop effective systems to support such legislation 680. II.C. Education of HCWs, patients, and families Education and training of healthcare per sonnel are a prerequisite for ensuring that policies and procedur es for Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions are understood and practiced. Understanding the scientific rationale for the 47 precautions will allow HCWs to apply procedures correctly, as well as safely modify precautions based on changing requ irements, resources, or healthcare settings 14, 655, 681-688. In one study, the likelihood of HCWs developing SARS was strongly associated with less than 2 hours of infection control training and lack of understanding of infecti on control procedures 689. Education about the important role of vaccines (e.g., influenza, measles, varicella, pertussis, pneumococcal) in protecting healthcare personnel, their pat ients, and family members can help improve vaccination rates 690-693. Education on the principles and prac tices for preventing transmission of infectious agents should begin during traini ng in the health professions and be provided to anyone who has an opportunity for contact with patients or medical equipment (e.g., nursing and medical sta ff; therapists and technicians, including respiratory, physical, occupational, radiology, and cardiology personnel; phlebotomists; housekeeping and main tenance staff; and students). In healthcare facilities, education and training on Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions are typically provided at t he time of orientation and should be repeated as necessary to maintain co mpetency; updated education and training are necessary when policies and procedures are revised or when there is a special circumstance, such as an outbreak that requires modification of current practice or adoption of new recommendat ions. Education and training materials and methods appropriate to the HCW's level of responsibility, individual learning habits, and language needs, can impr ove the learning experience 658, 694-702. Education programs for healthcare per sonnel have been associated with sustained improvement in adherence to bes t practices and a related decrease in device-associated HAIs in t eaching and non-teaching settings 639, 703 and in medical and surgical ICUs {Cooper smith, 2002 #2149; Babcock, 2004 #2126; Berenholtz, 2004 #2289; www.ihi.org/IHI/Programs/Campaign, #2563}. Several studies have shown that, in addition to targeted education to improve specific practices, periodic assessment and feedback of the HCW s knowledge,and adherence to recommended practices are necessary to achieve the desired changes and to identify continuing education needs 562, 704-708. Effectiveness of this approach for isolation practices has been demonstrated for control of RSV 116, 684. Patients, family members, and visitors can be partners in preventing transmission of infections in healthcare settings 9, 42, 709-711. Information about Standard Precautions, especially hand hygiene, Re spiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette, vaccination (especially against influenza) and other routine infection prevention strategies may be incorporated into pat ient information materials that are provided upon admission to the healthcare facility. Additional information about Transmission-Based Precautions is best prov ided at the time they are initiated. Fact sheets, pamphlets, and other print ed material may include information on the rationale for the additional precautions, risks to household members, room assignment for Transmission-Based Precautions purposes, explanation about the use of personal protective equipment by HCWs, and directions for use of 48 such equipment by family members and visitors. Such information may be particularly helpful in the home envir onment where household members often have primary responsibility for adher ence to recommended infection control practices. Healthcare personnel must be available and prepared to explain this material and answer questions as needed. II.D. Hand hygiene Hand hygiene has been cited frequently as the single most important practice to reduce the transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings 559, 712, 713 and is an essential element of Standard Precautions. The term \"hand hygiene\" includes both handwashing with either plain or antiseptic-containing soap and water, and use of alcohol-based products (gel s, rinses, foams) that do not require the use of water. In the absence of visible soiling of hands, approved alcohol- based products for hand disinfection are pr eferred over antimic robial or plain soap and water because of their superior micr obiocidal activity, reduced drying of the skin, and convenience 559. Improved hand hygiene practices have been associated with a sustained decrease in the incidence of MRSA and VRE infections primarily in the ICU 561, 562, 714-717. The scientific rationale, indications, methods, and products for hand hygiene ar e summarized in other publications 559, 717. The effectiveness of hand hygiene can be reduced by the type and length of fingernails 559, 718, 719. Individuals wearing artifi cal nails have been shown to harbor more pathogenic organisms, especially gram negative bacilli and yeasts, on the nails and in the subungual ar ea than those with native nails 720, 721. In 2002, CDC/HICPAC recommended (Category IA) that artificial fingernails and extenders not be worn by healthcare personnel who have contact with high-risk patients (e.g., those in ICUs, ORs) due to the association wit h outbreaks of gram- negative bacillus and candidal infections as confirmed by molecular typing of isolates 30, 31, 559, 722-725.The need to restrict the wearing of artificial fingernails by all healthcare personnel who provide dire ct patient care or by healthcare personnel who have contact with other hi gh risk groups (e.g., oncology, cystic fibrosis patients), has not been studi ed, but has been recommended by some experts 20. At this time such decisions are at the discretion of an individual facility's infection control program. There is less evidence that jewelry affects the quality of hand hygiene. Although hand co ntamination with potential pathogens is increased with ring-wearing 559, 726, no studies have related this practice to HCW-to-patient transmission of pathogens. II.E. Personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel PPE refers to a variety of barriers and resp irators used alone or in combination to protect mucous membranes, airways, skin, and clothing from contact with infectious agents. The selection of PPE is based on the nature of the patient 49 interaction and/or the likely mode(s) of transmission. Guidance on the use of PPE is discussed in Part III. A suggested procedure for donning and removing PPE that will prevent skin or clothing cont amination is presented in the Figure. Designated containers for used disposable or reusable PPE should be placed in a location that is convenient to the site of removal to facilitate disposal and containment of contaminated materials. Hand hygiene is always the final step after removing and disposing of PPE. The following sections highlight the primary uses and methods for selecting this equipment. II.E.1. Gloves Gloves are used to prevent contamination of healthcare personnel hands when 1) anticipating dire ct contact with blood or body fluids, mucous membranes, nonintact skin and other potentially infectious material; 2) having direct contact with patients who are colonized or infected with pathogens transmitted by the contact r oute e.g., VRE, MRSA, RSV 559, 727, 728; or 3) handling or touching visibly or potentially contaminated patient care equipment and environmental surfaces 72, 73, 559. Gloves can protect both patients and healthcare personnel from exposure to infectious material that may be carried on hands 73. The extent to which gloves will protect healthcare pers onnel from transmission of bloodborne pathogens (e.g., HIV, following a needlestick or other pucture that penetrates the glove barri er has not been determined. Although gloves may reduce the volume of blood on the external surfac e of a sharp by 46\u00ad 86% 729, the residual blood in the lumen of a hollowbore needle would not be affected; therefore, the effect on transmission risk is unknown. Gloves manufactured for healthcare purpos es are subject to FDA evaluation and clearance 730 . Nonsterile disposable medical gloves made of a variety of materials (e.g., latex, vinyl, nitrile) are available for routine patient care 731. The selection of glove type for non-surgical use is based on a number of factors, including the task that is to be perform ed, anticipated contact with chemicals and chemotherapeutic agents, latex sensitivity, sizing, and fac ility policies for creating a latex-free environment 17, 732-734. For contact with blood and body fluids during non-surgical patient care, a single pair of gloves generally provides adequate barrier protection 734. However, there is considerable variability among gloves; both the quality of the manuf acturing process and type of material influence their barrier effectiveness 735. While there is little difference in the barrier properties of unused intact gloves 736, studies have shown repeatedly that vinyl gloves have higher failure rates than latex or nitrile gloves when tested under simulated and actual clinical conditions 731, 735-738. For this reason either latex or nitrile gloves are preferable for clinical procedures that require manual dexterity and/or will involve more than brief patient contact. It may be necessary to stock gloves in several sizes. Heavier, reusable utility gloves are indicated for non-patient care activities, such as handling or cleaning contaminated equipment or surfaces 11, 14, . During patient care, transmission of infectious organisms can be reduced by adhering to the principles of working from \"clean\" to \"dirty\", and confining or limiting contamination to surfaces that are directly needed for patient care. It may be necessary to change gloves during the care of a single patient to prevent 50 739 cross-contamination of body sites 559, 740. It also may be necessary to change gloves if the patient interaction also involves touching portable computer keyboards or other mobile equipment that is transported from room to room. Discarding gloves between patients is necessary to prevent transmission of infectious material. Gloves must not be washed for subsequent reuse because microorganisms cannot be removed reliably from glove surfaces and continued glove integrity cannot be ens ured. Furthermore, glove reuse has been associated with transmission of MRSA and gram-negative bacilli 741-743 . When gloves are worn in combination with other PPE, they are put on last. Gloves that fit snugly around the wrist ar e preferred for use with an isolation gown because they will cover the gown cuff and provide a more reliable continuous barrier for the arms, wrists , and hands. Gloves that are removed properly will prevent hand contamination (Figure). H and hygiene following glove removal further ensures that the hands will not carry potentially infectious material that might have penetrated th rough unrecognized tear s or that could contaminate the hands during glove removal 559, 728, 741. II.E.2. Isolation gowns Isolation gowns are used as specified by Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions, to protect the HCW's arms and exposed body areas and prevent contaminat ion of clothing with bloo d, body fluids, and other potentially infectious material 24, 88, 262, 744-746. The need for and type of isolation gown selected is based on the nature of t he patient interaction, including the anticipated degree of contac t with infectious material and potential for blood and body fluid penetration of the barrier. T he wearing of isolation gowns and other protective apparel is mandated by the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard 739. Clinical and laboratory coats or jackets worn over personal clothing for comfort and/or purposes of i dentity are not considered PPE. When applying Standard Precauti ons, an isolation gown is worn only if contact with blood or body fluid is anticipated. However, w hen Contact Precautions are used (i.e., to prevent transmission of an infe ctious agent that is not interrupted by Standard Precautions alone and that is associated with environmental contamination), donning of both gown and gloves upon room entry is indicated to address unintentional cont act with contaminated environmental surfaces 54, 72, 73, 88. The routine donning of is olation gowns upon entry into an intensive care unit or other high-risk area does not prevent or influence potential colonization or infection of patients in those areas365, 747-750. Isolation gowns are always worn in combination with gloves, and with other PPE when indicated. Gowns are usually t he first piece of PPE to be donned. Full coverage of the arms and body front, from neck to the mid-thigh or below will ensure that clothing and exposed upper body areas are protected. Several gown sizes should be available in a healthcare facility to ensure appropriate coverage for staff members. Isolat ion gowns should be removed before leaving the patient care area to prevent possible contami nation of the environment outside the patient's room. Isolation gowns should be removed in a manner that prevents contamination of clothing or skin (Figure). The outer, \"c ontaminated\", side of the 51 gown is turned inward and rolled into a bundle, and then discarded into a designated container for waste or linen to contain contamination. II.E.3. Face protection: masks, goggles, face shields II.E.3.a. Masks Masks are used for three primary purposes in healthcare settings: 1) placed on healthcare personnel to protect them from contact with infectious material from patients e.g., respiratory secretions and sprays of blood or body fluids, consistent with Standard Pr ecautions and Droplet Precautions; 2) placed on healthcare personnel when enga ged in procedures requiring sterile technique to protect patients from exposure to infectious agents carried in a healthcare worker's mouth or nose, and 3) placed on coughing patients to limit potential dissemination of infectious respir atory secretions from the patient to others (i.e., Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette). Masks may be used in combination with goggles to protect the mouth, nose and eyes, or a face shield may be used instead of a mask and goggle s, to provide more complete protection for the face, as discussed below. Masks should not be confused with particulate respirators that are used to prevent inhalation of small particles that may contain infectious agents transmitted via the airborne route as described below. The mucous membranes of the mouth, nos e, and eyes are susceptible portals of entry for infectious agents, as can be other skin surf aces if skin integrity is compromised (e.g., by acne, dermatitis) 66, 751-754. Therefore, use of PPE to protect these body sites is an important component of Standard Precautions. The protective effect of masks for exposed healthcare personnel has been demonstrated 93, 113, 755, 756. Procedures that generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excr etions (e.g., endotracheal suctioning, bronchoscopy, invasive vascular procedures) require either a face shield (disposable or reusabl e) or mask and goggles 93-95, 96 , 113, 115, 262, 739, 757 .The wearing of masks, eye protection, and face shields in specified circumstances when blood or body fluid exposures are lik ely to occur is mandated by the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard 739. Appropriate PPE should be selected based on the anticipated level of exposure. Two mask types are available for use in healthcare settings: surgical masks that are cleared by the FDA and required to have fluid-resistant properties, and procedure or isolation masks 758 #2688. No studies have been published that compare mask types to determine whether one mask type provides better protection than another. Si nce procedure/isolation masks are not regulated by the FDA, there may be more variab ility in quality and performance than with surgical masks. Masks come in various shapes (e.g., molded and non-molded), sizes, filtration efficiency, and method of attachment (e.g., ties, elastic, ear loops). Healthcare facilities may find that different types of masks are needed to meet individual healt hcare personnel needs. II.E.3.b. Goggles, face shields Guidance on eye protection for infection control has been published 759. The eye protection chosen fo r specific work situations (e.g., goggles or face shield) depends upon the circumstances of exposure, other 52 PPE used, and personal vision needs. Personal eyeglasses and contact lenses are NOT considered adequate eye protection (www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eye-infectious.html). NIOSH states that, eye protection must be comfortabl e, allow for sufficient peri pheral vision, and must be adjustable to ensure a secure fit. It may be necessary to provide several different types, styles, and sizes of protective equipment. Indirectly-vented goggles with a manufacturer's anti-fog c oating may provide the most reliable practical eye protection from splashes, sprays, and respiratory droplets from multiple angles. Newer styles of goggles may provide better indirect airflow properties to reduce fogging, as well as better peripheral vision and more size options for fitting goggles to different workers. Many styles of goggles fit adequately over prescription glasses with minimal gaps. While effective as eye protection, goggles do not provide splash or spray protection to other parts of the face. The role of goggles, in addition to a mask, in preventing exposure to infectious agents transmitted via resp iratory droplets has been studied only for RSV. Reports published in the mid-1980s dem onstrated that eye protection reduced occupational transmission of RSV 760, 761. Whether this was due to preventing hand-eye contact or respiratory droplet -eye contact has not been determined. However, subsequent studies demonstrated that RSV tr ansmission is effectively prevented by adherence to Standard plus Co ntact Precations and that for this virus routine use of goggles is not necessary 24, 116, 117, 684, 762. It is important to remind healthcare personnel that even if Droplet Precautions are not recommended for a specific respiratory tract pathogen, protection for the eyes, nose and mouth by using a mask and goggle s, or face shield alone, is necessary when it is likely that ther e will be a splash or spray of any respiratory secretions or other body fluids as def ined in Standard Precautions Disposable or non-disposable face shields may be used as an alternative to goggles 759. As compared with goggles, a face shield can provide protection to other facial areas in addition to the eyes . Face shields extending from chin to crown provide better face and eye protec tion from splashes and sprays; face shields that wrap around the sides may r educe splashes around the edge of the shield. Removal of a face shield, goggles and mask can be performed safely after gloves have been removed, and hand hygiene performed. The ties, ear pieces and/or headband used to secure the equi pment to the head are considered \"clean\" and therefore safe to touch with bare hands. T he front of a mask, goggles and face shield are consider ed contaminated (Figure). II.E.4. Respiratory protection The subject of respirator y protection as it applies to preventing transmission of airborne infectious agents, including the need for and frequency of fit-testing is under scientif ic review and was the subject of a CDC workshop in 2004 763. Respiratory protection curr ently requires the use of a respirator with N95 or higher filtration to prevent inhalation of infectious particles. Information about respirators and respiratory protection programs is summarized 53 in the Guideline for Preventing Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health-care Settings, 2005 (CDC.MMWR 2005; 54: RR-17 12). Respiratory protection is broadly regulated by OSHA under the general industry standard for respiratory protection (29CFR1910.134)764 which requires that U.S. employers in all employment settings im plement a program to protect employees from inhalation of toxic materials. OS HA program components include medical clearance to wear a respirator; provisio n and use of appropriate respirators, including fit-tested NIOSH-certified N95 and higher particulate filtering respirators; education on respirator use and periodic re-evaluation of the respiratory protection program . When selecting particula te respirators, models with inherently good fit characteristics (i.e ., those expected to provide protection factors of 10 or more to 95% of wear ers) are preferred and could theoretically relieve the need for fit testing 765, 766. Issues pertaining to respiratory protection remain the subject of ongoing debate. In formation on various types of respirators may be found at www.cdc.gov/niosh/nppt l/respirators/respsars.html and in published studies 765, 767, 768. A user-seal check (formerly called a \"fit check\") should be performed by the wearer of a respirator each time a respirator is donned to minimize air leakage around the facepiece 769. The optimal frequency of fit-testng has not been determined; re-t esting may be indicated if there is a change in facial features of the wearer, onset of a medical condition that would affect respiratory function in the wearer, or a change in the model or size of the initially assigned respirator 12. Respiratory protection was first recommended for protection of preventing U.S. healthcare personnel from exposure to M. tuberculosis in 1989. That recommendation has been maintained in two successive revisions of the Guidelines for Prevention of Transmission of Tuberculosis in Hospitals and other Healthcare Settings 12, 126. The incremental benefit fr om respirator use, in addition to administrative and engineering controls (i.e., AIIRs, early recognition of patients likely to have tuberculosi s and prompt placement in an AIIR, and maintenance of a patient with suspected tuberculosis in an AIIR until no longer infectious), for preventing transmission of airborne infectious agents (e.g., M. tuberculosis) is undetermined. Although some studies have demonstrated effective prevention of M. tuberculosis transmission in hospitals where surgical masks, instead of respirators, were used in conjunction with other administrative and engineering controls 637, 770, 771, CDC currently recommends N95 or higher level respirators for personnel exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. Currently this is also true for other diseases that could be transmitted through the airbor ne route, including SARS 262 and smallpox 108, 129, 772, until inhalational transmission is better defined or healthcare-specific protective equipment more suitable for fo r preventing infection are developed. Respirators are also currently recomm ended to be worn during the performance of aerosol-generating procedur es (e.g., intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning) on patients withSARS Co-V infection, avi an influenza and pandemic influenza (See Appendix A). Although Airborne Precautions are recommended for preventing airborne transmission of measles and varicella-zos ter viruses, there are no data upon 54 which to base a recommendation for respir atory protection to protect susceptible personnel against these two infections; tran smission of varicella-zoster virus has been prevented among pediatric patients usi ng negative pressure isolation alone 773. Whether respiratory protection (i.e., wearing a particulate respirator) would enhance protection from these viruses has not been studied. Since the majority of healthcare personnel have natural or ac quired immunity to these viruses, only immune personnel generally care fo r patients with these infections 774-777. Although there is no evidence to suggest that masks are not adequate to protect healthcare personnel in these settings , for purposes of consistency and simplicity, or because of difficulties in ascertaining immunity, some facilities may require the use of respirators for entry into all AIIRs, regardless of the specific infectious agent. Procedures for safe remova l of respirators are prov ided (Figure). In some healthcare settings, particulate respirat ors used to provide care for patients with M. tuberculosis are reused by the same HCW. Th is is an acceptable practice providing the respirator is not damaged or soiled, the fit is not compromised by change in shape, and the respirator has not been contaminat ed with blood or body fluids. There are no data on which to base a recommendation for the length of time a respirat or may be reused. II.F. Safe work practices to prevent HCW exposure to bloodborne pathogens II.F.1. Prevention of needlesticks and other sharps-related injuries Injuries due to needles and other sharps have been associated with transmission of HBV, HCV and HIV to healthcare personnel 778, 779. The prevention of sharps injuries has always been an essential element of Universal and now Standard Precautions 1, 780. These include measures to handle needles and other sharp devices in a manner that will prevent inju ry to the user and to others who may encounter the device during or after a procedure. These measures apply to routine patient care and do not address t he prevention of sharps injuries and other blood exposures during surgical an d other invasive procedures that are addressed elsewhere 781-785. Since 1991, when OSHA first iss ued its Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to protect healthcare personnel from blood exposure, the focus of regulatory and legislative activity has been on impl ementing a hierarchy of control measures. This has included focusing a ttention on removing sharps hazards through the development and use of engineering controls. The federal Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act signed into law in November, 2000 authorized OSHA's revision of its Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to more explicitly require the use of safety-engineered sharp devices 786. CDC has provided guidance on sharps injury prevention 787, 788, including for the design, implementation and evaluation of a comp rehensive sharps injury prevention 789program . 55 II.F.2. Prevention of mucous membrane contact Exposure of mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mout h to blood and body fluids has been associated with the transm ission of bloodborne viruses and other infectious agents to healthcare personnel 66, 752, 754, 779. The prevention of mucous membrane exposures has always been an element of Universal and now Standard Precautions for routine patient care 1, 753 and is subject to OSHA bloodborne pathogen regulations. Safe work practices, in addition to wearing PPE, are used to protect mucous memb ranes and non-intact skin from contact with potentially infectious material. T hese include keeping gloved and ungloved hands that are contaminated from touchi ng the mouth, nose, eyes, or face; and positioning patients to direct sprays and splatter away from the face of the caregiver. Careful plac ement of PPE before patient contact will help avoid the need to make PPE adjustments and possi ble face or mucous membrane contamination during use. In areas where the need for resuscitation is unpredictable, mouthpieces, pocket resuscitation masks with one-way valves, and other ventilation devices provide an alternative to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, preventing exposure of the caregiver's nose and mouth to oral and re spiratory fluids during the procedure. II.F.2.a. Precautions during aerosol-generating procedures The performance of procedures that can generate small particle aeros ols (aerosol-generating procedures), such as bronchoscopy , endotracheal intubation, and open suctioning of the respiratory tract, have been associated with transmission of infectious agents to healthcare personnel, including M. tuberculosis 790, SARS- CoV 93, 94, 98 and N. meningitidis 95. Protection of the eyes, nose and mouth, in addition to gown and gloves, is reco mmended during perfo rmance of these procedures in accordance with Standard Pr ecautions. Use of a particulate respirator is recommended during aerosol-generating procedures when the aerosol is likely to contain M. tuberculosis , SARS-CoV, or avian or pandemic influenza viruses. II.G. Patient placement II.G.1. Hospitals and long-term care settings Options for patient placement include single patient room s, two patient rooms, and mu lti-bed wards. Of these, single patient rooms are pr efered when there is a conc ern about transmission of an infectious agent. Although some studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of single patient rooms to prevent HAIs 791, other published studies, including one commissioned by the Americ an Institute of Ar chitects and the Facility Guidelines Institute, have doc umented a beneficial relationship between private rooms and reduction in infecti ous and noninfectious adverse patient outcomes 792, 793. The AIA notes that private r ooms are the trend in hospital planning and design. However, most hospitals and long-term care facilities have multi-bed rooms and must consider many co mpeting priorities when determining the appropriate room placement for patient s (e.g., reason for admission; patient characteristics, such as age, gender, mental status; staffing needs; family 56 requests; psychosocial factors; reimburse ment concerns). In the absence of obvious infectious diseases that require specified airborne infection isolation rooms (e.g., tuberculosis, SARS, chi ckenpox), the risk of transmission of infectious agents is not always cons idered when making placement decisions . When there are only a limited nu mber of single-patient rooms, it is prudent to prioritize them for those patients who have conditions that facilitate transmission of infectious material to other patients (e.g., draining wounds , stool incontinence, uncontained secretions) and for those who are at increased risk of acquisition and adverse outcomes resulting from HAI (e.g., immunosuppression, open wounds, indwelling catheter s, anticipated prolonged length of stay, total dependence on HCWs for activities of daily living) 15, 24, 43, 430, 794, 795. Single-patient rooms ar e always indicated for patients placed on Airborne Precautions and in a Protective Environment and are preferred for patients who require Contact or Droplet Precautions 23, 24, 410, 435, 796, 797. During a suspected or proven outbreak caused by a pathogen whose reservoir is the gastrointestinal tract, use of single pati ent rooms with priv ate bathrooms limits opportunities for transmission, especially when the colonized or infected patient has poor personal hygiene habits, fecal incontinence, or cannot be expected to assist in maintaining procedures that prevent transmission of microorganisms (e.g., infants, children, and patients with altered mental status or developmental delay). In the absence of continued transmission, it is not necessary to provide a private bathroom for patients colonized or infected with enter ic pathogens as long as personal hygiene practices and Standard Precautions, es pecially hand hygiene and appropriate environmental cleaning, are maintained. Assignment of a dedicated commode to a patient,and cleaning and disinfecting fixtures and equipment that may have fecal contamination (e.g., bathrooms, commodes 798, scales used for weighing diapers) and the adjacent su rfaces with appropriate age nts may be especially important when a single- patient room can not be used since environmental contamination with intesti nal tract pathogens is likely from both continent and incontinent patients 54, 799. Results of several studies to determine the benefit of a single-patient room to prevent transmission of Clostridium difficile are inconclusive 167, 800-802. Some studies have shown that being in the same room with a colonized or infected patient is not necessarily a risk factor for transmission 791, 803-805. However, for children, t he risk of healthcare-associated diarrhea is increased with the increas ed number of patients per room 806. Thus, patient factors are important determinants of infection transmission risks, and the need for a single-patient room and/or private bathroom for any patient is best determined on a case-by-case basis. Cohorting is the practice of grouping togethe r patients who are colonized or infected with the same organism to confine their care to one area and prevent contact with other patients. Cohorts ar e created based on c linical diagnosis, microbiologic confirmation when ava ilable, epidemiology, and mode of transmission of the infectious agent. It is gen erally preferred not to place severely immunosuppressed patients in rooms with other patients. Cohorting has been used extensively for managing outb reaks of MDROs including Modeling studies provide additional support for cohorting patients to control outbreaks Talon 817-819. However, cohorting often is implemented only after routine infection control measures have failed to control an outbreak. Assigning or cohorting healthca re personnel to care only for patients infected or colonized with a single target pathogen limi ts further transmission of the target pathogen to uninfected patients 740, 819 but is difficult to achieve in the face of current staffing shortages in hospitals 583 and residential healthcare sites 820-822. However, when continued transmission is occurring after implementing routine infection control measures and creating patient cohorts, cohorting of healthcare personnel may be beneficial. During the seasons when RSV, human metapneumovirus 823, parainfluenza, influenza, other respiratory viruses 824, and rotavirus are circulating in the community, cohorting based on the present ing clinical syndr ome is often a priority in facilities that care for infants and young children 825. For example, during the respiratory virus season, infants may be cohorted based soley on the clinical diagnosis of bronc hiolitis due to the logistical difficulties and costs associated with requiring micr obiologic confirmation prio r to room placement, and the predominance of RSV duri ng most of the season. However, when available, single patient rooms are always preferred since a common clinical presentation (e.g., bronchiolitis), can be caused by more than one infectious agent 823, 824, 826. Furthermore, the inability of infants and children to contain body fluids, and the close physical contact that occurs dur ing their care, increases infection transmission risks for patients and personnel in this setting 24, 795. II.G.2. Ambulatory settings Patients actively infected with or incubating transmissible infectious diseases are s een frequently in ambulat ory settings (e.g., outpatient clinics, physicians' offices, emergency departments) and potentially expose healthcare personnel and other pat ients, family members and visitors 21, 34, 127, 135, 142, 827. In response to the global outbreak of SARS in 2003 and in preparation for pandemic influenza, healthcare providers working in outpatient settings are urged to implement source containment measures (e.g., asking couging patients to wear a surgical ma sk or cover their coughs with tissues) to prevent transmission of resp iratory infections, beginning at the point of initial patient encounter 9, 262, 828 as described below in section III.A.1.a. Signs can be posted at the entrance to facilities or at the reception or registration desk requesting that the patient or individua ls accompanying the patient promptly inform the receptionist if there are symptoms of a resp iratory infection (e.g., cough, flu-like illness, increased production of respiratory secretions). The presence of diarrhea, skin rash, or known or suspected exposure to a transmissible disease (e.g., measles, per tussis, chickenpox, tuberculosis) also could be added. Placement of potentially infectious patients without delay in an examination room lim its the number of exposed indi viduals, e.g., in the common waiting area. 58 In waiting areas, maintaining a distance between symptomatic and non- symptomatic patients (e.g., >3 feet), in addition to source control measures, may limit exposures. However, infections transmitted via the airborne route (e.g., M tuberculosis , measles, chickenpox) require additional precautions 12, 125, 829. Patients suspected of having such an in fection can wear a surgical mask for source containment, if tolerated, and s hould be placed in an examination room, preferably an AIIR, as soon as possible. If this is not possible, having the patient wear a mask and segregate him/herself from other patients in the waiting area will reduce opportunities to expose others. Since the person(s) accompanying the patient also may be infectious, applic ation of the same infection control precautions may need to be extended to thes e persons if they are symptomatic 21, 252, 830. For example, family members accompanying children admitted with suspected M. tuberculosis have been found to have unsuspected pulmonary tuberculosis with cavitary lesions, even when asymptomatic 42, 831. Patients with underlying condition s that increase their susceptibility to infection (e.g., those who are immunocompromised 43, 44 or have cystic fibrosis 20) require special efforts to protect them from exposures to infected patients in common waiting areas. By informing the receptioni st of their infection risk upon arrival, appropriate steps may be taken to further pr otect them from infection. In some cystic fibrosis clinics, in order to avoi d exposure to other patients who could be colonized with B. cepacia , patients have been given beepers upon registration so that they may leave the area and rece ive notification to return when an examination room becomes available 832. II.G.3. Home care In home care, the patient placement concerns focus on protecting others in the home from expos ure to an infectious household member. For individuals who are especially vulner able to adverse outcomes associated with certain infections, it may be beneficial to either remove them from the home or segregate them within the home. Persons who are not part of the household may need to be prohibited from visiting dur ing the period of infectivity. For example, if a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis is contagious and being cared for at home, very young children (<4 years of age) 833 and immunocompromised persons who have not yet been infected should be removed or excluded from the household. During the SARS outbreak of 2003, segregation of infected persons during the communicable phase of the ill ness was beneficial in preventing household transmission 249, 834. II.H. Transport of patients Several principles are used to guide transport of patients requiring Transmission- Based Precautions. In the inpatient and residential settings these include 1) limiting transport of such patients to e ssential purposes, such as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that cannot be performed in the patient's room; 2) when transport is necessary, using appropriate barriers on the patient (e.g., mask, gown, wrapping in sheets or use of im pervious dressings to cover the affected area(s) when infectious skin lesions or drainage are present, consistent with the route and risk of transmission; 3) notifying healthcare personnel in the receiving 59 area of the impending arrival of the patient and of the precautions necessary to prevent transmission; and 4) for patient s being transported outside the facility, informing the receiving facility and the m edi-van or emergency vehicle personnel in advance about the type of Transmission-Based Precautions being used. For tuberculosis, additional pr ecautions may be needed in a small shared air space such as in an ambulance 12. II.I. Environmental measures Cleaning and disinfecting non-critical surfaces in patient-care areas are part of Standard Precautions. In general, thes e procedures do not need to be changed for patients on Transmission-Based Precauti ons. The cleaning and disinfection of all patient-care areas is important fo r frequently touched surfaces, especially those closest to the patient, that ar e most likely to be contaminated (e.g., bedrails, bedside tables, commodes, doorknobs, sinks, surfaces and equipment in close proximity to the patient) 11, 72, 73, 835. The frequency or intensity of cleaning may need to change based on the patient's level of hygiene and the degree of environmental contamination and for certain for infectious agents whose reservoir is the intestinal tract 54. This may be especially true in LTCFs and pediatric facilities where patients wit h stool and urine incontinence are encountered more frequently. Also, increased frequency of cleaning may be needed in a Protective Environment to minimize dust accumulation 11. Special recommendations for cleaning and disinfecti ng environmental surfaces in dialysis centers have been published 18. In all healthcare settings, administrative, staffing and scheduling activities should prioritize the proper cleaning and disinfection of surfaces that could be implicated in trans mission. During a suspected or proven outbreak where an environmental reservoir is suspected, routine cleaning procedures should be reviewed, and the need for additional trained cleaning staff should be assessed. Adherence should be monitored and reinforced to promote consistent and correct cleaning is performed. EPA-registered disinfectant s or detergents/disinfect ants that best meet the overall needs of the healthcare facility for routine cleaning and disinfection should be selected 11, 836. In general, use of the existing facility detergent/disinfectant according to the manufacturer's re commendations for amount, dilution, and contact time is sufficient to remove pathogens from surfaces of rooms where colonized or infected individuals were housed. This includes those pathogens that are resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents (e.g., C. difficile , VRE, MRSA, MDR-GNB 11, 24, 88, 435, 746, 796, 837). Most often, environmental reservoirs of pathogens during outbreaks are related to a failure to follow recommended procedures for cleaning and disinfection rather than the specific cleaning and disinfectant agents used 838-841 . Certain pathogens (e.g., rotavirus, noroviruses, C. difficile ) may be resistant to some routinely used hospital disinfectants 275, 292, 842-847.The role of specific disinfectants in limiting transmissi on of rotavirus has been demonstrated experimentally 842. Also, since C. difficile may display increased levels of spore production when exposed to non-chlorine- based cleaning agents, and the spores are more resistant than veget ative cells to commonly used surface disinfectants, 60 some investigators have recommended t he use of a 1:10 dilution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (household bleac h) and water for routine environmental disinfection of rooms of patients with C. difficile when there is continued transmission 844, 848. In one study, the use of a hypochlorite solution was associated with a decrease in rate s of C. difficile infections 847. The need to change disinfectants based on the pr esence of these organisms can be determined in consultation with the infection control committee 11, 847, 848. Detailed recommendations for disinfecti on and sterilization of surfaces and medical equipment that have been in contact with prion-c ontaining tissue or high risk body fluids, and for cleaning of blood and body substance spills, are available in the Guidelines for Environm ental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities 11 and in the Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization 848. II.J. Patient care equipment and instruments/devices Medical equipment and in struments/devices must be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturers' instructions to prevent patient-to-patient transmission of infectious agents 86, 87, 325, 849. Cleaning to remove organic material must always precede high level disinfection and steriliz ation of critical and semi-critical instruments and devices be cause residual proteinacous material reduces the effectiveness of the di sinfection and sterilization processes 836, 848. Noncritical equipment, such as commodes, intravenous pumps, and ventilators, must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before use on another patient. All such equipment and devices should be han dled in a manner t hat will prevent HCW and environmental contact with potentia lly infectious material. It is important to include com puters and personal digital assistants (PDAs) used in patient care in policies for cleaning and di sinfection of non-crit ical items. The literature on contamination of com puters with pathogens has been summarized 850 and two reports have linked computer contamination to colonization and infections in patients 851, 852. Although keyboard covers and washable keyboards that can be easily disinfected are in use, the infection control benefit of those items and optimal management have not been determined. In all healthcare settings, providing patients who are on Transmission-Based Precautions with dedicated noncritical m edical equipment (e.g., stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, electronic thermometer) has been beneficial for preventing transmission 74, 89, 740, 853, 854. When this is not possible, disinfection after use is recommended. Consult other guidelines for detailed guidance in developing specific protocols for cleaning and r eprocessing medical equipment and patient care items in both routine and special circumstances 11, 14, 18, 20, 740, 836, 848. In home care, it is preferable to remove visible blood or body fluids from durable medical equipment before it leaves t he home. Equipment can be cleaned on-site using a detergent/disinfectant and, when possi ble, should be placed in a single plastic bag for transport to the reprocessing location 20, 739. II.K. Textiles and laundry Soiled textiles, including bedding, towels, and patient or resident clothing may be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. However, the risk of disease 61 transmission is negligible if they are handled, transported, and laundered in a safe manner 11, 855, 856. Key principles for handling soiled laundry are 1) not shaking the items or handling them in any way that may aerosolize infectious agents; 2) avoiding contact of one's body and personal clothing with the soiled items being handled; and 3) containing soiled items in a laundry bag or designated bin. When laundry chutes are used, they must be maintained to minimize dispersion of aeros ols from contaminated items 11. The methods for handling, transporting, and laundering soiled textiles are determined by organizational policy and any applicable regulations 739; guidance is provided in the Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control 11. Rather than rigid rules and regulations, hygienic and common sense st orage and processing of clean textiles is recommended 11, 857. When laundering occurs outside of a healthcare facility, the clean items must be packaged or co mpletely covered and placed in an enclosed space during transpor t to prevent contaminat ion with outside air or construction dust that could contain infect ious fungal spores that are a risk for immunocompromised patients 11. Institutions are required to launder garments used as personal protective equipment and uniforms visibly soiled with blood or infective material 739. There are few data to determine the safety of home laundering of HCW uniforms, but no increase in infection rates was observed in the one published study 858 and no pathogens were recovered from home- or hospital-laundered scrubs in another study 859. In the home, textiles and laundry from patients wit h potentially transmissible infectious pathogens do not require special handling or separate laundering, and may be washed with warm water and detergent 11, 858, 859. II.L. Solid waste The management of solid wa ste emanating from the heal thcare environment is subject to federal and st ate regulations for medi cal and non-medical waste 860, 861. No additional precautions are needed fo r non-medical solid waste that is being removed from rooms of patients on Transmission-Based Precautions. Solid waste may be contained in a single bag (as compared to using two bags) of sufficient strength. 862. II.M. Dishware and eating utensils The combination of hot water and detergent s used in dishwashers is sufficient to decontaminate dishware and eating utensils. Therefore, no special precautions are needed for dishware (e.g., gla may be used for patients requiring Transmission-Based Precautions. In the home and other co mmunal settings, eating utensils and drinking vessels that are being used s hould not be shared, consistent with principles of good personal hygiene and for the purpose of preventing transmission of respiratory viruses, Herpes simplex virus, and infectious agents that infect the gastrointestinal tract and are transmitted by the fecal/oral route (e.g., hepatitis A virus, noroviruses). If adequate resources for cleaning utensils and dishes are not available, disp osable products may be used. 62 II.N. Adjunctive measures Important adjunctive measures that ar e not considered prim ary components of programs to prevent transmission of infectious agents, but improve the effectiveness of such programs, include 1) antimicrobial management programs; 2) postexposure chemoprophylaxis with anti viral or antibacterial agents; 3) vaccines used both for pre and postexposur e prevention; and 4) screening and restricting visitors with signs of transm issible infections. Detailed discussion of judicious use of antimicrobial agents is beyond the scope of this document; however the topic is addressed in the MDRO section (Managem ent of Multidrug- Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings 2006. www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf ). II.N.1. Chemoprophylaxis Antimicrobial agents and topical antiseptics may be used to prevent infection and potential out breaks of selected agents. Infections for which postexposure chemoprophylaxis is recommended under defined conditions include B. pertussis 17, 863, N. meningitidis 864, B. anthracis after environmental exposure to aeosolizable material865, influenza virus611 , HIV 866, and group A streptococcus 160. Orally administered ant imicrobials may also be used under defined circumstances for MR SA decolonization of patients or healthcare personnel 867 . Another form of chemoprophylaxis is the use of topical antiseptic agents. For example, triple dye is used routinely on t he umbilical cords of term newborns to reduce the risk of colonization, skin in fections, and omphalitis caused by S. aureus , including MRSA, and group A streptococcus 868, 869. Extension of the use of triple dye to low birth weight in fants in the NICU was one component of a program that controlled one longstanding MRSA outbreak 22. Topical antiseptics are also used for decolonization of health care personnel or selected patients colonized with MRSA, using mupirocin II.N.2. Immunoprophylaxis Certain immunizations recommended for susceptible healthcare personnel have decreased the risk of infection and the potential for transmission in healthcare facilities 17, 874. The OSHA mandate that requires employers to offer hepatitis B vaccination to HCWs played a substantial role in the sharp decline in incide nce of occupational HBV infection 778, 875. The use of varicella vaccine in healthcare personnel has decreased the need to place susceptible HCWs on administrative leave following exposure to patients with varicella 775. Also, reports of healthcare-asso ciated transmission of rubella in obstetrical clinics 33, 876 and measles in acute care settings 34 demonstrate the importance of immunization of suscept ible healthcare personnel against childhood diseases. Many states have requirements for HCW vaccination for measles and rubella in the absence of ev idence of immunity. Annual influenza vaccine campaigns targeted to patients and healthcare personnel in LTCFs and acute-care settings have been instrumental in preventing or lim iting institutional 63 outbreaks and increasing attention is being directed toward improving influenza vaccination rates in healthcare personnel 35 , 611, 690, 877, 878 , 879. Transmission of B. pertussis in healthcare facilities has been associated with large and costly outbreaks that incl ude both healthcare personnel and patients 17, 36, 41, 100, 683, 827, 880, 881. HCWs who have close contact with infants with pertussis are at particularly high risk because of waning immunity and, until 2005, the absence of a vaccine that could be used in adults. However, two acellular pertussis vaccines were licensed in the Un ited States in 2005, one for use in individuals aged 11-18 and one for use in ages 10-64 years 882. Provisional ACIP recommendations at the time of publication of this document include adolescents and adults, especially those with contact with infants < 12 months of age and healthcare personnel with direct patient contact 883 884 . Immunization of children and adults will he lp prevent the introduction of vaccine- preventable diseases into healthcare settings. The recommended immunization schedule for children is published annually in the January issues of the Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report with interim updates as needed 885, 886. An adult immunization schedule also is available for healthy adults and those with special immunization needs due to high risk medical conditions 887. Some vaccines are also used for poste xposure prophylaxis of susceptible individuals, including varicella 888, influenza 611, hepatitis B 778, and smallpox 225 vaccines 17, 874. In the future, administration of a newly developed S. aureus conjugate vaccine (still under investigation) to selected patients may provide a novel method of preventing healthcare-associated S. aureus, including MRSA , infections in high-risk groups (e.g., hemodialysis patients and candidates for selected surgical procedures) 889, 890. Immune globulin preparations also are used for postexposure prophylaxis of certain infectious agents under specified circumstances (e.g., varicella-zoster virus [VZIG], hepatitis B viru s [HBIG], rabies [RIG], measles and A virus 17, 833, 874). The RSV monoclonal antibody preparation, Palivizumab, may have contributed to controlling a nosocomia l outbreak of RSV in one NICU , but there is insufficient evidence to support a routine recommendation for its use in this setting 891. II.N. 3. Management of visitors II.N.3.a. Visitors as sources of infection Visitors have been identified as the source of several types of HAIs (e.g., pertussis 40, 41, M. tuberculosis 42, 892, influenza, and other respiratory viruses 24, 43, 44, 373 and SARS 21, 252-254). However, effective methods for visitor screening in healthcare settings have not been studied. Visitor screening is especially important during community outbreaks of infectious diseases and for high risk patient units. Sibling visits are often encouraged in birthing centers, post partum rooms and in pediatric inpatient units, ICUs, and in residential settings for children; in hospital settings, a child visitor should visit only his or her own siblin g. Screening of visiting siblings and other children before they are allowed into clinical areas is necessary to prevent the introduction of childhood illnesses and common respiratory infections. 64 Screening may be passive through the use of signs to alert family members and visitors with signs and sympt oms of communicable diseases not to enter clinical areas. More active screening may include th e completion of a screening tool or questionnaire which elicits information rela ted to recent exposures or current symptoms. That informati on is reviewed by the facilit y staff and the visitor is either permitted to visit or is excluded 833. Family and household members visiting pediatric patients with pertussis and tuberculosis may need to be screened for a hist ory of exposure as well as signs and symptoms of current infection. Potent ially infectious visitors are excluded until they receive appropriate medical scr eening, diagnosis, or treatment. If exclusion is not considered to be in the best interest of the patient or family (i.e., primary family members of critically or terminal ly ill patients), then the symptomatic visitor must wear a mask wh ile in the healthcare facility and remain in the patient's room, avoiding exposure to others, especially in public waiting areas and the cafeteria. Visitor screening is used consistently on HSCT units 15, 43. However, considering the experience during t he 2003 SARS outbreaks and the potential for pandemic influenza, developing effective visitor screening systems will be beneficial 9. Education concerning Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette is a useful adjunct to visitor screening. II.N.3.b. Use of barrier pr ecautions by visitors The use of gowns, gloves, or masks by visitors in healthcare settings has not been addressed specifically in the scientific literature. Some studies included the use of gowns and gloves by visitors in the control of MDRO's, but did not perform a separate analysis to determine whether their use by visitors had a measurable impact 893-895. Family members or visitors who are providing ca re or having very close patient contact (e.g., feeding, holding) may have contact with other patients and could contribute to transmission if barrier precautions are not used correctly. Specific recommendations may vary by facility or by unit and should be determined by the level of interaction. 65 Part III: Precautions to Prevent Transmission of Infectious Agents There are two tiers of HI CPAC/CDC precautions to prevent transmission of infectious agents, Standard Precauti ons and Transmission-Based Precautions. Standard Precautions are intended to be appli ed to the care of all patients in all healthcare settings, regardle ss of the suspected or confirmed presence of an infectious agent. Implementation of Standard Precautions constitutes the primary strategy for the prevention of healthcare-associated transmission of infectious agents among pa tients and healthcare personnel . Transmission-Based Precautions are for patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with infe ctious agents, including certain epidemiologically important pathogens, which require additional control measures to effectively prevent transmissi on. Since the infecting agent often is not known at the time of admission to a healthcare facility, Transmission-Based Precautions are used empirically, accord ing to the clinical syndrome and the likely etiologic agents at the time , and then modified when the pathogen is identified or a transmissible in fectious etiology is ruled out. Examples of this syndromic approach are presented in T able 2. The HICPAC/CDC Guidelines also include recommendations for creat ing a Protective Environment for allogeneic HSCT patients. The specific elements of Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions are discussed in Part II of this guideline. In Part III, the circ umstances in which Standard Precautions, Transmission-Based Precautions, and a Protective Environment are applied are discussed. See Tables 4 and 5 for summaries of the key elements of these sets of precautions III.A. Standard Precautions Standard Precautions combine the major features of Universal Precautions (UP) 780, 896 and Body Substance Isolation (BSI) 640 and are based on the principle t hat all blood, body fluids , secretions, excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include a group of in fection prevention practices that apply to all pat ients, regardless of suspec ted or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered (Table 4). These include: hand hygiene; use of gloves , gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the anticipated exposure; and sa fe injection practices. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likel y to have been contaminated with infectious body fluids must be handl ed in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents (e.g. wear gloves fo r direct contact, contain heavily soiled equipment, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment before use on another patient). The application of Standard Pr ecautions during patient care is determined by the nature of the HCW-patient interaction and the extent of antic ipated blood, body fluid, or pathogen exposu re. For some intera ctions (e.g., performing venipuncture), only gloves may be needed; during other interactions (e.g., intubation), use of gloves, gown, and face shield or mask and goggles is necessary. Education and training on the principles and rationale for 66 recommended practices are critical el ements of Standard Precautions because they facilitate appropriate decision -making and promote adherence when HCWs are faced with new circumstances 655, 681-686. An example of the importance of the use of Standard Precautions is intubation, especially under emergency circumstances when infectious agents ma y not be suspected, but later are identified (e.g., SARS-CoV, N. meningitides). The application of Standard Precautions is described below and summarized in Table 4. Guidance on donning and removing gloves, gowns and ot her PPE is presented in the Figure. Standard Precautions are also intended to protect patients by ensuring that healthcare personnel do not carry infecti ous agents to patients on their hands or via equipment used during patient care. III.A.1. New Elements of Standard Precautions Infection control problems that are identified in the course of outbreak investigations often indicate the need for new recommendations or reinforcem ent of existing infection control recommendations to protect patients. Because such recommendations are considered a standard of care and may not be included in ot her guidelines, they are added here to Standard Precautions. Three such areas of practice that have been added are: Respiratory Hy giene/Cough Etiquette, safe injection practices, and use of masks for insertion of catheters or injection of material into spinal or epidural spaces via lumbar puncture pr ocedures (e.g., myelogram, spinal or epidural anesthesia). While most element s of Standard Precautio ns evolved from Universal Precautions that were deve loped for protection of healthcare personnel, these new elements of Standard Precautions fo cus on protection of patients. III.A.1.a. Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette The transmission of SARS- CoV in emergency department s by patients and their fa mily members during the widespread SARS outbreaks in 2003 high lighted the need for vigilance and prompt implementation of infection control measures at the first point of encounter within a healthcare setting (e .g., reception and triage areas in emergency departments, outpatient clinics, and physician offices) 21, 254, 897. The strategy proposed has been termed Re spiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette 9, 828 and is intended to be incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of Standard Precautions. The st rategy is targeted at patients and accompanying family members and fr iends with undiagnosed transmissible respiratory infections, and applies to any person with signs of illness including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increas ed production of respir atory secretions when entering a healthcare facility 40, 41, 43. The term cough etiquette is derived from recommended source control measures for M. tuberculosis 12, 126. The elements of Respiratory Hygiene/C ough Etiquette include 1) education of healthcare facility staff, pat ients, and visitors; 2) pos ted signs, in language(s) appropriate to the population served, with instructions to patients and accompanying family members or friends; 3) source control measures (e.g., covering the mouth/nose with a tissue w hen coughing and prompt disposal of used tissues, using surgical masks on the coughing person when tolerated and 67 appropriate); 4) hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions; and 5) spatial separation, ideally >3 feet, of persons with respiratory infections in common waiting areas when possible. Covering sneezes and coughs and placing masks on coughing patients are pr oven means of source containment that prevent infected persons from dispersi ng respiratory secretions into the air 107, 145, 898, 899. Masking may be difficult in some se ttings, (e.g., pediatrics, in which case, the emphasis by necessity may be on cough etiquette 900. Physical proximity of <3 feet has been associat ed with an increased risk for transmission of infections via the droplet route (e.g., N. meningitidis 103 and group A streptococcus 114 and therefore supports the prac tice of distancing infected persons from others who are not infect ed. The effectiveness of good hygiene practices, especially hand hygiene, in preventing transmission of viruses and reducing the incidence of respirator y infections both within and outside 901-903 healthcare settings is summa rized in several reviews 559, 717, 904. These measures should be effective in decreasing the risk of transmission of pathogens contained in large re spiratory droplets (e.g., influenza virus 23, adenovirus 111, B. pertussis 827 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae 112. Although fever will be present in many respiratory infections, patients with pertussis and mild upper respiratory tract infections are often afebrile. Theref ore, the absence of fever does not always exclude a respirator y infection. Patients who have asthma, allergic rhinitis, or chronic obstructi ve lung disease also may be coughing and sneezing. While these patients often are not infectious, cough etiquette measures are prudent. Healthcare personnel are advised to obser ve Droplet Precautions (i.e., wear a mask) and hand hygiene when examining an d caring for patients with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection. Healthcare personnel who have a respiratory infection are advised to avoid direct patient contact, especially with high risk patients. If this is not possible, t hen a mask should be worn while providing patient care. III.A.1.b. Safe Injection Practices The investigation of fo ur large outbreaks of HBV and HCV among patients in ambulatory ca re facilities in the United States identified a need to define and reinforce safe injection practices 453. The four outbreaks occurred in a private medical practice, a pain clinic, an endoscopy clinic, and a hematology/oncology clinic . The primary breaches in infection control practice that contributed to these outbreaks were 1) reinsertion of used needles into a multiple-dose vial or so lution container (e.g., saline bag) and 2) use of a single needle/syringe to administe r intravenous medication to multiple patients. In one of these outbreaks, pr eparation of medications in the same workspace where used needle/syringes were dismantled also may have been a contributing factor. Thes e and other outbreaks of vira l hepatitis could have been prevented by adherence to basic princi ples of aseptic technique for the preparation and administration of parenteral medications 453, 454. These include the use of a sterile, single- use, disposable needle and syringe for each injection given and prevention of cont amination of injection equipment and medication. 68 Whenever possible, use of single-dose vials is preferred over multiple-dose vials, especially when medications will be administered to multiple patients. Outbreaks related to unsafe injection prac tices indicate that some healthcare personnel are unaware of, do not under stand, or do not adhere to basic principles of infection control and aseptic technique. A survey of US healthcare workers who provide medication through in jection found that 1% to 3% reused the same needle and/or syr inge on multiple patients 905. Among the deficiencies identified in recent outbreaks were a lack of oversight of per sonnel and failure to follow-up on reported breaches in infection control practices in ambulatory settings. Therefore, to ensure that all healthcare workers understand and adhere to recommended practices, principles of infection control and aseptic technique need to be reinforced in training programs and incorporated into institutional polices that are monitored for adherence 454. III.A.1.c. Infection Control Practices for Special Lumbar Puncture Procedues In 2004, CDC investigated eight cases of post-myelography meningitis that either were reported to CDC or identifie d through a survey of the Emerging Infections Network of the Infe ctious Disease Society of America. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid of all eight cases yielded streptococcal species consistent with oropharyngeal flora and there were changes in the CSF indices and clinical status indicative of bacteri al meningitis. Equipment and products used during these procedures (e.g., contrast media) were excluded as probable sources of contaminati on. Procedural details av ailable for seven cases determined that antiseptic skin preparations and sterile gloves had been used. However, none of the clinicians wore a fa ce mask, giving rise to the speculation that droplet transmission of oralpharyngeal flora was the most likely explanation for these infections. Bacterial meningit is following myelogram and other spinal procedures (e.g., lumbar puncture, spinal and epidural anesthesia, intrathecal chemotherapy) has been reported previously 906-915. As a result, the question of whether face masks should be worn to prev ent droplet spread of oral flora during spinal procedures (e.g., myelogram, lu mbar puncture, spinal anesthesia) has been debated 916, 917. Face masks are effective in limiting the dispersal of oropharyngeal droplets 918 and are recommended for the placement of central venous catheters 919. In October 2005, the Heal thcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) reviewed the evidence and concluded that there is sufficient experience to wa rrant the additional pr otection of a face mask for the individual placing a catheter or injecting material into the spinal or epidural space. III.B. Transmission-Based Precautions There are three categories of Transmission-Based Precautions: Contact Precautions, Droplet Precautions, and Airborne Precautions. Transmission-Bas ed Precautions are used when the route(s) of transmission is (are) no t completely interrupted using Standard Precautions alone. For some diseases t hat have multiple routes of transmission (e.g., SARS), more than one Transmission-Based Precautions category may be used. When used either singly or in co mbination, they are always used in 69 addition to Standard Precautions. See Appendix A for recommended precautions for specific infections. When Transmi ssion-Based Precautions are indicated, efforts must be made to counteract possible adverse effects on patients (i.e., anxiety, depression and ot her mood disturbances 920-922, perceptions of stigma 923, reduced contact with clinical staff 924-926, and increases in preventable adverse events 565 in order to improve acceptance by the patients and adherence by HCWs. III.B.1. Contact Precautions Contact Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents, incl uding epidemiologi cally important microorganisms, which are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment as descri bed in I.B.3.a. The specific agents and circumstance for which Contact Precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A. The application of Contact Precautions for patients infect ed or colonized with MDROs is described in the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline 927 . Contact Precautions also apply where the pres ence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased potential for extensive environmental contamination and risk of transmission. A single- patient room is preferred for patients who require Contact Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation wit h infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). In multi-patient rooms, > 3 feet spatial sepa ration between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadv ertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients. Healthca re personnel caring for patients on Contact Precautions wear a gow n and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient's environment. Donning PPE upon room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to cont ain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through envir onmental contamination (e.g., VRE, C. difficile, noroviruses and other intestinal tract pathogens; RSV) 54, 72, 73, 78, 274, 275, 740. III.B.2. Droplet Precautions Droplet Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread thr ough close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respir atory secretions as described in I.B.3.b. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a healthcare facility, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission. Infectious agents for which Droplet Precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A and include B. pertussis , influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, N. meningitides, and group A streptococcus (for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy). A single patient r oom is preferred for patients who require Droplet Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate ). Spatial separation of > 3 feet and drawing 70 the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in multi-bed rooms with infections transmi tted by the droplet route. Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) fo r close contact with infectious patient; the mask is generally donned up on room entry. Patients on Droplet Precautions who must be transported outside of the r oom should wear a mask if tolerated and follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette. III.B.3. Airborne Precautions Airborne Precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infecti ous over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measle s], varicella virus [chickenpox], M. tuberculosis, and possibly SARS-CoV) as described in I.B.3 .c and Appendix A. The preferred placement for patients who require Ai rborne Precautions is in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). An AIIR is a single-patient r oom that is equipped with special air handling and v entilation capacity that m eet the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Instit ute (AIA/FGI) standar ds for AIIRs (i.e., monitored negative pressure relative to the surrounding area, 12 air exchanges per hour for new construction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilities, air exhausted direct ly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return) 12, 13. Some states require the availability of such rooms in hospitals, emergency department s, and nursing homes that care for patients with M. tuberculosis . A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, fit-test ing, and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (e.g., physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (e.g., office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or highe r level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for healthcare personnel will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmi ssion until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to t he home environment, as deemed medically appropriate. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on Airborne Precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on th e disease-specific recommendations (Respiratory Protection II.E .4, Table 2, and Appendix A), that is donned prior to room entry. Whenever possible, non-imm une HCWs should not care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseas es (e.g., measles, chickenpox, and smallpox). III.C. Syndromic and em piric applications of Transmission-Based Precautions Diagnosis of many infections r equires laboratory confirmation. Since laboratory tests, especially thos e that depend on culture techniques, often require two or more days for completion, Transmission-Based Precautions must be implemented while test results are pendi ng based on the clinical presentation and likely pathogens. Use of appropriate Tr ansmission-Based Precautions at the time a patient develops symptoms or signs of transmissible infection, or arrives at a healthcare facility for care, reduces tr ansmission opportunities. While it is not possible to identify prospectively all patients needing Transmission-Based Precautions, certain clinical syndromes and conditions carry a sufficiently high 71 risk to warrant their use empirically wh ile confirmatory te sts are pending (Table 2). Infection control professionals ar e encouraged to modify or adapt this table according to local conditions. III.D. Discontinuation of Transmi ssion-Based Precautions Transmission- Based Precautions remain in effect for limited periods of time (i.e., while the risk for transmission of the infectious agent per sists or for the duration of the illness (Appendix A). For most infectious diseases, this dur ation reflects known patterns of persistence and shedding of infecti ous agents associated with the natural history of the infectious process and its treatment. For some diseases (e.g., pharyngeal or cutaneous diphtheria, R SV), Transmission-Based Precautions remain in effect until culture or antigen-detection test results document eradication of the pathogen and, for RSV, symptomatic disease is resolved. For other diseases, (e.g., M. tuberculosis ) state laws and regulations, and healthcare facility policies, may dictat e the duration of precautions12). In immunocompromised patients, viral shedding can persist for prolonged periods of time (many weeks to months) and transmission to others may occur during that time; therefore, the duration of contact and/or droplet precautions may be prolonged for many weeks 500, 928-933. The duration of Contact Precautions for patients who are colonized or infected with MDROs remains undefined. MRSA is the only MDRO for which effective decolonization regimens are available 867. However, carriers of MRSA who have negative nasal cultures after a course of systemic or topical therapy may resume shedding MRSA in the weeks that follow therapy 934, 935. Although early guidelines for VRE suggested discontinuation of Contac t Precautions after three stool cultures obtained at w eekly intervals proved negative 740, subsequent experiences have indicated that such screening may fail to detect colonization that can persist for >1 year 27, 936-938. Likewise, available data indicate that colonization with VRE, MRSA 939, and possibly MDR-GNB, can persist for many months, especially in the presence of severe underlying disease, invasive devices, and recurrent course s of antimicrobial agents. It may be prudent to assume that MDRO ca rriers are colonized permanently and manage them accordingly. Alternatively, an interval free of hospitalizations, antimicrobial therapy, and invasive dev ices (e.g., 6 or 12 months) before reculturing patients to document clearance of carriage may be used. Determination of the best strategy awaits the results of additional studies. See the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline 927 for discussion of possible criteria to discontinue Contact Precautions for pati ents colonized or infected with MDROs. III.E. Application of Transmission-B ased Precautions in ambulatory and home care settings Although Transmission-Based Precautions generally apply in all healthcare settings, excepti ons exist. For example, in home care, AIIRs are not available. Furthermore, family members already exposed to diseases such as varicella and tubercu losis would not use masks or respiratory protection, but visiting HCWs would need to use such protection. Similarly, management of patients colonized or in fected with MDROs may necessitate 72 Contact Precautions in acute care hospi tals and in some LTCFs when there is continued transmission, but the risk of tr ansmission in ambulatory care and home care, has not been defined. Consistent us e of Standard Precaut ions may suffice in these settings, but more information is needed. III.F. Protective Environment A Protective Environment is designed for allogeneic HSCT patients to minimize f ungal spore counts in the air and reduce the risk of invasive environmental fungal infections (see Table 5 for specifications) 11, 13-15. The need for such controls has been demonstrated in studies of aspergillus outbreaks associated with construction 11, 14, 15, 157, 158. As defined by the American Insi tute of Architecture 13 and presented in detail in the Guideline for Environmental Infection Control 2003 11, 861, air quality for HSCT patients is improved through a combination of environmental controls that include 1) HEPA filtration of incoming air; 2) dire cted room air flow; 3) positive room air pressure relative to the corridor; 4) we ll-sealed rooms (including sealed walls, floors, ceilings, windows, electrical outlets) to prevent flow of air from the outside; 5) ventilation to provide > 12 air changes per hour; 6) stra tegies to minimize dust (e.g., scrubbable surfaces rather than upholstery 940 and carpet 941, and routinely cleaning crevices and sprinkler heads); and 7) prohibiting dried and fresh flowers and potted plants in the rooms of HSCT patients. The latter is based on molecular typing studies that have found indistinguishable strains of Aspergillus terreus in patients with hematologic malign ancies and in potted plants in the vicinity of the patients 942-944. The desired quality of ai r may be achieved without incurring the inconvenience or expense of laminar airflow 15, 157. To prevent inhalation of fungal spores during periods when construction, r enovation, or other dust-generating activities that may be ongoing in and around the health-care facility, it has been advised that severely immunocompromised patients wear a high-efficiency respiratory-protection dev ice (e.g., an N95 respirator) when they leave the Protective Environment 11, 14, 945). The use of masks or respirators by HSCT patients when they are outside of the Protective Environment for prevention of environmental f ungal infections in the absence of construction has not been evaluated. A Protective Environm ent does not include the use of barrier precautions beyond those indicated for Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions. No published reports suppor t the benefit of placing solid organ transplants or other immunoc ompromised patients in a Protective Environment. 73 Part IV: Recommendations These recommendations are designed to prevent transmission of infectious agents among patients and healthcare personnel in all settings where healthcare is delivered . As in other CDC/HICPAC guidelines, each recommendation is categorized on the basis of existing sci entific data, theoretical rationale, applicability, and when possible, economic impact. The CDC/HICPAC system for categorizing recommendations is as follows: Category IA Strongly recommended for impl ementation and st rongly supported by well-designed experimental, clinic al, or epidemiologic studies. Category IB Strongly recommended for implementation and supported by some experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies and a strong theoretical rationale. Category IC Required for implementation, as mandated by federal and/or state regulation or standard. Category II Suggested for implementation and supported by suggestive clinical or epidemiologic studies or a theoretical rationale. No recommendation ; unresolved issue. Practi ces for which insufficient evidence or no consensus regarding efficacy exists. I. Administrative Responsibilities Healthcare organization administrator s should ensure the implementation of recommendations in this section. I.A. Incorporate preventing transmissi on of infectious agents into the objectives of the organization's pati ent and occupational safety programs 543-546, 561, 620, 626, 946. Category IB/IC I.B.

Category II IV. Standard Precautions Assume that every person is potentia lly infected or colonized with an organism that could be transmitted in the healthcare setting and apply the following infection control practices during the delivery of health care. IV.A. Hand Hygiene 77 IV.A.1. During the delivery of healthca re, avoid unnecessary touching of surfaces in close proximity to the patient to prevent both contamination of clean hands fr om environmental surfaces and transmission of pathogens from contaminated hands to surfaces72, 73 739, 800, 975{CDC, 2001 #970. Category IB/IC IV.A.2. When hands are visibly dirty, contaminated with proteinaceous material, or visibly soiled with bl ood or body fluids, wash hands with either a nonantimicrobial soap and water or an antimicrobial soap and water 559. Category IA IV.A.3. If hands are not visibly soiled, or after removing visible material with nonantimicrobial soap and water, decontaminate hands in the clinical situations described in IV .A.2.a-f. The preferred method of hand decontamination is with an alcohol-based hand rub 562, 978. Alternatively, hands may be wash ed with an antimicrobial soap and water. Frequent use of alcohol-based hand rub immediately following handwashing with nonant imicrobial soap may increase the frequency of dermatitis 559. Category IB Perform hand hygiene: IV.A.3.a. Before having direct contact with patients 664, 979. Category IB IV.A.3.b. After contact with blood, body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, nonintact skin, or wound dressings 664.

Category IB IV.A.4. Wash hands with non-antimicr obial soap and water or with antimicrobial soap and water if contact with spores (e.g., C. difficile or Bacillus anthracis ) is likely to have occurred. The physical action of washing and rinsing hands under such circumstances is recommended because alcohols, chlorhexidine, iodophors, and other antiseptic agents have poor activity against spores 559, 956, 983. Category II IV.A.5. Do not wear artificial fingernails or extenders if duties include direct contact with patients at high risk for infection and associated adverse outcomes (e.g., those in ICUs or operating rooms) 30, 31, 559, 722-724 .

Category IB VI.F.4.c. If an anteroom is not availabl e, place the patient in an AIIR and use portable, industrial-grade H EPA filters in the room to enhance filtration of spores 1042. Category II 92 Appendix A: Preamble The mode(s) and risk of transmission fo r each specific disease agent included in Appendix A were reviewed. Principle sources consulted for the development of disease-specific recommendations for Appendix A included infectious disease manuals and textbooks 833, 1043, 1044. The published literature was searched fo r evidence of person-to-person transmission in healthcare and non-healthcare settings with a focu s on reported outbreaks that would assist in developing recommendations for all settings where healthcare is delivered. Criteria used to assign Transmission-Based Precautions categories follow: A Transmission-Based Precautions cat egory was assigned if ther e was strong evidence for person-to-person transmission via droplet, contact, or ai rborne routes in healthcare or non-healthcare settings and/or if patient factors (e.g., diapered infants, diarrhea, draining wounds) increased the risk of transmission Transmission-Based Precautions cat egory assignments reflect the predom inant mode(s) of transmission If there was no evidence for person-to -person transmission by droplet, cont act or airborne routes, Standard Precautions were assigned If there was a low risk for person-to-person transmission and no evidence of he althcare-associated transmission, Standard Precautions were assigned Standard Precautions were assigned for bloodborne pat hogens (e.g., hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus) as per CDC recommendations for Universal Precautions issued in 1988 780. Subsequent experience has confirmed the efficacy of Standard Precautions to prevent ex posure to infected blood and body fluid 778, 779, 866. Additional information relevant to use of precautions was added in the comme nts column to assist the caregiver in decision-making. Citations were added as needed to support a change in or provide additional evidence for recommendations for a specific disease and for new infectious agents (e.g., SARS-CoV, avian influenza) that have been added to Appendix A.

INFECTION CONTROL CONSIDERATIONS FOR HIGH-P RIORITY (CDC CATEGORY A) DISEASES THAT MAY RESULT FROM BIOTERRORIST A TTACKS OR ARE CONSIDERED TO BE BIOTERRORIST THREATS (www.bt.cdc.gov) a a Abbreviations used in this table: = respiratory tract; gastrointes = cerebr ospinal fluid; and LD 50 - lethal dose for 50% of experimental animals; HCWs = healthcare worker; IHC Site(s) of Infection; Transmission Mode Cutaneous and inhalation disease have occurred in past bioterrorist incidents Cutaneous (contact with spores); RT (inhalation of spores); GIT (ingestion of spores - rare) Comment: Spores can be inhaled into the lower re spiratory tract. The infectious dose of B. anthracis in humans by any route is not precisely known. In primat es, the LD50 (i.e., the dose required to kill 50% of animals) for an aerosol challenge with B. anthracis is estimated to be 8,000-5 0,000 spores; the infectious dose may be as low as 1-3 spores Incubation Period Cutaneous : 1 to12 days; RT: Usually 1 to 7 days but up to 43 days reported; GIT: 15-72 hours Clinical Features Cutaneous: Painless, reddish papule, develops a central vesicle or bulla in 1-2 days; over next 3-7 days becomes pustular, and necrotic, wit h black eschar; extensive surrounding edema. RT: initial flu-like illness for 1-3 days with headache, fever, malaise, cough; by day 4 severe dyspnea and shock, and is usually fatal (85%-90% if unt reated; meningitis in 50% of RT cases. GIT: ; if intestinal form, necrotic, ulcerated edematous le sions develop in intestines with fever, nausea and vomiting, progression to hematemesis and bloody diarrhea; 25-60% fatal Diagnosis Cutaneous: fluid aspirate for Gram stain and culture; blood cult ure if systemic symptoms; acute and 123convalescent sera for ELISA serology culture, PCR and IHC; for IHC, blood and ascites fluid, stool samples, rectal swabs, and swabs of oropharyngeal lesions if present for culture, PCR and IHC Infectivity Cutaneous: Person-to-person transmission from contact with lesion of untreated patient possible, but extremely rare. RT and GIT: Person-to-person transmission does not occur. Aerosolized powder, environmental exposures: Highly infectious if aerosolized Recommended Precautions Cutaneous : Standard Precautions; Contact Precautions if uncontained copious drainage. RT and GIT: Standard Precautions. Aerosolized powder, environmental exposures: Respirator (N95 mask or P APRs), protective clothing; decontamination with powder on them (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pr eview/mmwrhtml/mm5135a3.htm) Hand hygiene: Handwashing for 30-60 seconds r chlorhexid ene gluconate after 289:1274]). antimicrobials (either doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxac in) and post-exposure vaccine IND Disease Botulism Site(s) of Infection; Transmission Mode GIT: Ingestion Inhalation toxin contai ning aerosol cause disease. Comment: Toxin ingested or potentially delivered by aerosol in bioterrorist incidents. LD 50 for type A is 0.001 g/ml/kg. Incubation Period 1-5 days. Clinical Features Ptosis, generalized weakness, dizzine ss, dry mouth and throat, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphonia, and dysphagia followed by symmetrical descending paralysis and respiratory failure. 124Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis; identification of toxin in stool, se rology unless toxin-containi ng material available for toxin neutralization bioassays. Infectivity Not transmitted from person to person. Exposure to toxin necessary for disease. Recommended Precautions Standard Precautions. Disease Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Site(s) of Infection; Transmission Mode As a rule infection develops afte r exposure of mucous membranes or RT, or through broken skin or percutaneous injury. Incubation Period 2-19 days, usually 5-10 days Clinical Features Febrile illnesses with malaise, myalgias, headache, vo miting and diarrhea that are rapidly complicated by hypotension, shock, and hemorrhagic feat ures. Massive hemorrhage in < 50% pts. Diagnosis Etiologic diagnosis can be made using RT-PCR, serologic detection of an tibody and antigen, pathologic assessment with immunohistochemist ry and viral culture with EM confirmation of morphology, Infectivity Person-to-person transmission primarily occurs th rough unprotected contact wit h blood and body fluids; percutaneous injuries (e.g., needlestick) associated with a high rate of transmission; transmission in healthcare settings has been reported but is pr evented by use of barrier precautions. Recommended Precautions Hemorrhagic fever specific barrier precautions : If disease is believed to be related to intentional release of a bioweapon, epidemiology of transmission is unpredictable pending observation of disease transmission. Until the nature of the pathogen is understood and its transmission pattern confirmed, Standard, Contact and Airborne Precautions should be used. Once the pathogen is characterized, if the epidemiology of transmission is consistent with natura l disease, Droplet Precautions can be substituted for Airborne Precautions. Emphasize: 1) use of sharps safety devices and safe work practices, 2) hand hygiene; 3) barrier protection agains t blood and body fluids upon entry into room (single gloves and fluid- resistant or impermeable gown, face/eye protecti on with masks, goggles or face shields); and 4) appropriate waste handling. Use N95 or higher respirators when performing aerosol-generating procedures. In settings where AIIRs are unavailabl e or the large numbers of patients cannot be accommodated by existing AIIRs, observe Droplet Pr ecautions (plus Standard Precautions and Contact Precautions) and segregate patients fr om those not suspected of VHF infection. Limit blooddraws to those essential to care. See text for discussion and Appendix A for recommendations for naturally 125occurring VHFs. Disease resp iratory droplets. Comment : Pneumonic plague most likely to occur if used as a biological weapon, but some cases of bubonic and primary septicemia may also o ccur. Infective dose 100 to 500 bacteria Incubation Period 1 to 6, usually 2 to 3 days. Clinical Features Pneumonic: fever, chills, headache, cough, dyspnea, rapi d progression of weakness, and in a later stage hemoptysis, circulatory collaps e, and bleeding diathesis Diagnosis Presumptive diagnosis from Gram stain or Wayson st ain of sputum, blood, or lymph node aspirate; definitive diagnosis from cultures of same material, or paired acute/convalescent serology. Infectivity Person-to-person transmission occurs via respiratory droplets risk of tr ansmission is low during first 20- 24 hours of illness and requires close contact. Respiratory secretions probably are not infectious within a few hours after initiation of appropriate therapy. Recommended Precautions Standard Precautions, Droplet Precauti ons until patients have received 48 hours of appropriate therapy. Chemoprophylaxis: Consider antibiotic prophylaxis fo r HCWs with close contact exposure. 2 Pneumonic plague is not as contagious as is often thought. Historical accounts and contemporary evidence indicate that persons with plague usually only transmit the infection when the disease is in the end stage. These persons cough copious amounts of bloody sputum that contains many plague bacteria. Patients in the early stage of primary pneumonic plague (approximately th e first 20-24 h) apparently pose little risk [1, 2]. Antibiotic medication rapidly clears the sputum of plague bacilli, so that a patient generally is not infective within hours after initiation of effective antibiotic tr eatment [3]. This means that in modern times many patients will never reach a stage where they pose a significant risk to others. Even in the end stage of disease, tr ansmission only occurs after close contact. Simple protective measures, such as wearing masks, good hygiene, and avoiding close contact, have been effective to in terrupt transmission during many pneumonic plague outbreaks [2]. In the United States, the last known cases of person to person transmission of pneumonic plague occurred in 1925 [2]. 1. Wu L-T. A treatise on pneumonic plague. Geneva: League of Nations, 1926. III.

New York: Plenu m Medical Book Company, 1983. 126 Disease Smallpox Site(s) of Infection; Transmission Mode RT Inhalation of droplet or, rarely, aerosol s; and skin lesions (contact with virus). Comment: If used as a biological weapon, natural di sease, which has not occurred since 1977, will likely result. Incubation Period 7 to 19 days (mean 12 days) Clinical Features Fever, malaise, backache, headache, and often vomi ting for 2-3 days; then generalized papular or maculopapular rash (more on face and extremities), which becomes vesicular (on day 4 or 5) and then pustular; lesions all in same stage. Diagnosis Electron microscopy of vesicular fluid or cultur e of vesicular fluid by WHO approved laboratory (CDC); detection by PCR available only in select LRN labs, CDC and USAMRID Infectivity Secondary attack rates up to 50% in unvaccinated per sons; infected persons may transmit disease from time rash appears until all le sions have crusted over (about 3 weeks); greatest infectivity during first 10 days of rash. Recommended Precautions Combined use of Standard, Contact, and Airborne Precautions b until all scabs have separated (3-4 weeks). Only immune HCWs to care for pts; post-exposure vaccine within 4 days. Vaccinia: HCWs cover vaccination site with gauze and semi-permeable dressing until scab separates ( > 21 days). Observe hand hygiene. Adverse events with vi rus-containing lesions: Standard plus Contact Precautions until all lesions crusted b Transmission by the airborne route is a rare event; Airbor ne Precautions is recommended when possible, but in the event of mass exposures, barrier precautions and cont ainment within a designated ar ea are most important 204, 212. c Vaccinia adverse events with lesions containing infectious virus include inadvertent autoinoculation, ocular lesions (blepharitis, conjunctivitis), also requires addition of contact precau tions if exudates cannot be contained 216, 217. 127 Disease Tularemia Site(s) of Infection; Transmission Mode RT: Inhalation of aerosolized bacteria. GIT: Ingestion of food or drink contaminated with aerosolized bacteria. Comment: Pneumonic or typhoidal disease likely to occu after event using aerosol delivery. Infective dose 10-50 bacteria Incubation Period 2 to 10 days, usually 3 to 5 days Clinical Features Pneumonic: malaise, cough, s putum production, dyspnea; Typhoidal: fever, prostration, weight loss and frequently an associated pneumonia. Diagnosis Diagnosis usually made with serol ogy on acute and convalescent serum specimens; bacterium can be detected by PCR (LRN) or is olated from blood and other body fluids on cysteine-enriched media or mouse inoculation. Infectivity Person-to-person spread is rare. Laboratory workers who encounter/handle cultures of this organism ar e at high risk for disease if exposed.

Formerly, negative pressure isolation room, an AIIR is a single-occupancy pati ent-care room used to isolate persons with a suspected or confirmed airborne infe ctious disease. Environmental factors are controlled in AIIRs to minimize the transmission of infect ious agents that are usually transmitted from person to pers on by droplet nuclei associated with coughing or aerosolization of contaminated fluids. AIIRs should provide negative pressure in the room (so that air fl ows under the door gap into the room); and an air flow rate of 6-12 ACH ( 6 ACH fo r existing structures, 12 ACH for new construction or renovation); and direct exhaust of air from the room to the outside of the building or recirculation of air through a HEPA filter before retruning to circulation (MMWR 2005; 54 [RR-17]). American Institute of Architects (AIA) . A professional organization that develops standards for building ventilation, The \"2001Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Health Care Facilities\", the development of which was supported by the AIA, Academy of Architecture for Health, Facilities Guideline Institute, with assistance fr om the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health, is the primary source of guidance for creating airbor ne infection isolation room s (AIIRs) and protective environments (www.aia.org/aah). Ambulatory care settings. Facilities that provide health care to patients who do not remain overnight (e.g., hospital-based outpatient clinics, nonhospital-based clinics and physician offices, urgent ca re centers, surgic enters, free-standing dialysis centers, public health clinics, imaging centers, ambulatory behavioral health and substance abuse clinics, physical therapy and rehabilitation centers, and dental practices. Bioaerosols . An airborne dispersion of particles containing whole or parts of biological entities, such as bacteria, viru ses, dust mites, fungal hyphae, or fungal spores. Such aerosols usually consist of a mixture of mono-dispersed and aggregate cells, spores or viruses, carried by other materials, such as respiratory secretions and/or inert particles. Infecti ous bioaerosols (i.e., those that contain biological agents capable of causi ng an infectious disease) can be generated from human sources (e.g., ex pulsion from the respiratory tract during coughing, sneezing, talking or singing; during suctioning or wound irrigation), wet environmental sources (e.g. HVAC and cooling tower water with Legionella) or dr y sources (e.g.,constuction dust with spores produced by Aspergillus spp.). Bioaerosols in clude large respiratory droplets and small et nuclei (Cole EC. AJIC 1998;26: 453-64). Caregivers. . All persons who are not employees of an organization, are not paid, and provide or assist in providing healthca re to a patient (e.g., family member, friend) and acquire technical training as needed based on the tasks that must be performed. Cohorting. In the context of this guideline, th is term applies to the practice of grouping patients infected or colonized with the same infectious agent together to confine their care to one area and prev ent contact with susceptible patients (cohorting patients). During outbreaks, heal thcare personnel may be assigned to a cohort of patients to furt her limit opportunities for transmission (cohorting staff). Colonization. Proliferation of microorganisms on or within body sites without detectable host immune response, cellular da mage, or clinical expression. The presence of a microorganism within a host may occur with varying duration, but may become a source of potential transmissi on. In many instances, colonization and carriage are synonymous. Droplet nuclei. Microscopic particles < 5 \u00b5m in size that are the residue of evaporated droplets and ar e produced when a person coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings. These particles can remain su spended in the air for prolonged periods of time and can be carried on normal ai r currents in a room or beyond, to adjacent spaces or areas receiving exhaust air. Engineering controls. Removal or isolation of a workplace hazard through technology. AIIRs, a Protective Environment, engineered sharps injury prevention devices and shar ps containers are examples of engineering controls. Epidemiologically important pathogens . Infectious agents that have one or more of the following characteristics: 1) are readily transmissible; 2) have a proclivity toward causing outbreaks; 3) may be associated with a severe outcome; or 4) are difficult to treat. Examples include , vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus [VRSA] influenza virus [RSV], rotavirus, SARS- CoV, noroviruses and the hemorrhagic fever viruses). Hand hygiene. A general term that applies to any one of the following: 1) handwashing with plain (nonant imicrobial) (waterless antiseptic product, most often al cohol-based, rubbed on all surfaces of hands); or 4) surgical antisepsis ( perso nnel to eliminate transient hand flora and reduce resident hand flora) 559. Healthcare-associated infection (HAI). An infection that develops in a patient who is cared for in any setting where heal thcare is delivered (e.g., acute care hospital, chronic care facility, ambulato ry clinic, dialysis center, surgicenter, home) and is related to receiving health ca re (i.e., was not incubating or present at the time healthcare was provided) . In ambulatory and home settings, HAI would apply to any infection that is associated with a medical or surgical intervention. Since the geographic locati on of infection acquisition is often uncertain, the preferred term is considered to be healthcare-associated rather than healthcare- acquired . Healthcare epidemiologist. A person whose primary training is medical (M.D., D.O.) and/or masters or doctorate-lev el epidemiology who has received advanced training in healthcare epidemio logy. Typically these professionals direct or provide consultation to an infect ion control program in a hospital, long term care facility (LTCF), or healthcare delivery system (also see infection control professional). Healthcare personnel, healthcare worker (HCW). All paid and unpaid persons who work in a healthcare setting (e.g. any person who has professional or technical training in a healthcare-related field and provides patient care in a healthcare setting or any person who provid es services that support the delivery of healthcare such as dietary, housekeeping, engineering, maintenance personnel). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Any transplantation of blood- or bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, regardless of donor type (e.g., allogeneic or autologous) or cell source (e.g., bone ma rrow, peripheral blood, or placental/umbilical cord blood); associated with periods of severe immunosuppression that vary with the s ource of the cells, the intensity of chemotherapy required, and the presence of graft ve rsus host disease (MMWR 2000; 49: RR-10). High-efficiency particulat (HEPA) filter. air filter that removes >99.97% of particles > 0.3\u00b5m (the most penetrating particle size) at a specified flow rate of air. HEPA filters may be integrated into the central air handling systems, installed at the point of use above the ceiling of a room, or used as portable units (MMW R 2003; 52: RR-10). Home care. A wide-range of medical, nursing, rehabilitation, hospice and social services delivered to patients in their plac e of residence (e.g., private residence, senior living center, assisted living facilit y). Home health-care services include care provided by home health aides and ski lled nurses, respiratory therapists, dieticians, physicians, chaplains, and vol unteers; provision of durable medical equipment; home infusion therapy; and physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Immunocompromised patients. Those patients whose immune mechanisms are deficient because of congenital or acquired immunologic disorders (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infect ion, congenital immune deficiency syndromes), chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, emphysema, or cardiac failure, ICU care, malnutri tion, and immunosuppressive therapy of another disease process radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti-graft\u00ad rejection medication, corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific component of the immune system]) . The type of infections for which an immunocompromised patient has increased susceptibility is determined by the severity of immunosuppression and the specific component(s) of the immune system that is affected. Patients under going allogeneic HSCT and those with chronic graft versus host disease are c onsidered the most vulnerable to HAIs. Immunocompromised states also make it more difficult to diagnose certain infections (e.g., tuberculosis) and are associated with more severe clinical disease states than persons with the same infection and a normal immune system. Infection. The transmission of microorganisms into a host after evading or overcoming defense mechanisms, resulti ng in the organism's proliferation and invasion within host tissue(s). Host re sponses to infection may include clinical symptoms or may be subclini cal, with manifestations of disease mediated by direct organisms pathogenesis and/or a fu nction of cell-mediated or antibody responses that result in the destruction of host tissues. Infection control and prevention professional (ICP). A person whose primary training is in either nursing, medical te chnology, microbiology, or epidemiology and who has acquired special training in in fection control. Responsibilities may include collection, analysis, and feedback of infection data and trends to healthcare providers; consultation on infection risk assessment, prevention and control strategies; performance of education and training activities; implementation of evidence-based infectio n control practices or those mandated by regulatory and licensing agencies; applicat ion of epidemiologic principles to improve patient outcomes; participation in planning renovation and construction projects (e.g., to ensure appropriate cont ainment of construction dust); evaluation of new products or procedures on patient outcomes; oversi ght of employee health services related to infection pr evention; implementation of preparedness plans; communication within the healthcare setting, with local and state health departments, and with the community at large concerning infection control issues; and participation in research. Cert ification in infection control (CIC) is available through the Certific ation Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology. Infection control and prevention program . A multidisciplinar y program that includes a group of activities to ens ure that recommended practices for the prevention of healthcare-associated infe ctions are implemented and followed by HCWs, making the healthcare setting safe from infection for patients and healthcare personnel. The Joint Commissi on on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requires the following five components of an infection control program for accreditation: 1) surveillance : monitoring patients and healthcare personnel for acquisition of infection and/or colonization; 2) investigation: identification and analysis of infection problems or undesirable trends; 3) prevention: implementation of measures to prevent transmission of infectious agents and to reduce ri sks for device- and procedure-related infections; 4) control : evaluation and management of outbreaks; and 5) reporting: provision of information to external agencie s as required by st ate and federal law and regulation (www.jcaho.org). The infect ion control program staff has the ultimate authority to determine infecti on control policies for a healthcare organization with the approval of the organization's governing body. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs). An array of residential and outpatient facilities designed to meet the bio-psychosocial needs of per sons with sustained self-care deficits. These include skilled nursing facilities, chronic disease hospitals, nursing homes, foster a nd group homes, institutions for the developmentally disabled, residential care facilities, assisted living facilities, retirement homes, adult day health care fa cilities, rehabilitat ion centers, and long- term psychiatric hospitals. Mask. A term that applies collectively to items used to cover the nose and mouth and includes both procedure masks and surgical masks (www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/ guidance/094.html#4). Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). In general, bacteria that are resistant to one or more classes of antim icrobial agents and usually are resistant to all but one or two commercially ava ilable antimicrobial agents (e.g., MRSA, VRE, extended spectrum or intrinsically resistant gram-negative bacilli) 176. Nosocomial infection. A term that is derived fr om two Greek words \"nosos\" (disease) and \"komeion\" (to take care of ) and refers to any infection that develops during or as a resu lt of an admission to an acut e care facility (hospital) and was not incubating at the time of admission. Personal protective equipment (PPE). A variety of barriers used alone or in combination to protect mucous membr anes, skin, and clothing from contact with infectious agents. PPE includes gloves, masks, respirators, goggles, face shields, and gowns. Procedure Mask . A covering for the nose and mouth that is intended for use in general patient care situations. These ma sks generally attach to the face with ear loops rather than ties or elastic. Unli ke surgical masks, procedure masks are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Protective Environment. A specialized patient-care area, usually in a hospital, that has a positive air flow relative to the corridor (i.e., air fl ows from the room to the outside adjacent space). The combinat ion of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration, high numbers (> 12) of air changes per hour (ACH), and minimal leakage of air into t he room creates an environment that can safely accommodate patients with a severely co mpromised immune sys tem (e.g., those who have received allogeneic hemopoietic stem-cell transplant [HSCT]) and decrease the risk of exposure to spores produced by environmental fungi. Other components include use of scrubbable surfac es instead of materials such as upholstery or carpeting, cleani ng to prevent dust accumula tion, and prohibition of fresh flowers or potted plants. Quasi-experimental studies. Studies to evaluate interventions but do not use randomization as part of the study design. These studies are also referred to as nonrandomized, pre-post-intervention study designs. These studies aim to demonstrate causality between an in tervention and an outcome but cannot achieve the level of confidence concer ning attributable benef it obtained through a randomized, controlled trial. In hospit als and public health settings, randomized control trials often cannot be implemented due to ethical, practical and urgency reasons; therefore, quasi-experimental design studies are used commonly. However, even if an intervention appears to be effective statistically, the question can be raised as to the possibility of altern ative explanations for the result.. Such study design is used when it is not logistic ally feasible or et hically possible to conduct a randomized, controlled trial, (e .g., during outbreaks). Within the classification of quasi-experimental study designs, there is a hierarchy of design features that may contribute to validit y of results (Harris et al. CID 2004:38: 1586). Residential care setting. A facility in which people live, minimal medical care is delivered, and the psychosocial needs of the residents are provided for. Respirator. A personal protective device worn by healthcare personnel to protect them from inhalation exposure to airborne infectious agents that are < 5 m in size. These include infectious droplet nuclei fr om patients with M. tuberculosis, variola virus [smallpox], SARS-CoV) , and dust particles that contain infectious particles, such as spores of environmental fungi (e.g., Aspergillus sp.). The CDC's National Instit ute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certifies respirators used in healthcare settings (www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/resp irators/). The N95 disposable particulate, air purifying, respirator is the type used most commonly by healthcare personnel. Other respirators used include N-99 and N- 100 particulate respirators, powered re respirators. A can be found at www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirat ors/disp_part/particlist.html . Respirators must be used in conjunction with a complete Respiratory Protection Program, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), that includes fit testing, trai ning, proper selection of re spirators, medical clearance and respirator maintenance. Respiratory Hygiene/ Cough Etiquette. A combination of measures designed to minimize the transmission of respir atory pathogens via droplet or airborne routes in healthcare settings. The co mponents of Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette are 1) covering the mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing, 2) using tissues to contain respiratory secr etions with prompt disposal into a no- touch receptacle, 3) offering a surgic al mask to persons who are coughing to decrease contamination of the surrounding environment, and 4) turning the head away from others and maintaining spatia l separation, ideally >3 feet, when coughing. These measures are target ed to all patients with symptoms of respiratory infection and their acco mpanying family members or friends beginning at the point of initial encounter with a healthcare setting (e.g., reception/triage in emergency department s, ambulatory clinics, healthcare provider offices) 126 (Srinivasin A ICHE 2004; 25: 1020; www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/inf ectioncontrol/resphygiene.htm). Safety culture/climate. The shared perceptions of workers and management regarding the expectations of safety in the work environment. A hospital safety climate includes the follo wing six organizational co mponents: 1) senior management support for safety programs; 2) absence of workplace barriers to safe work practices; 3) cleanliness and orderliness of the worksite; 4) minimal conflict and good communication among staf f members; 5) frequent safety- related feedback/training by superviso rs; and 6) availability of PPE and engineering controls 620. Source Control . The process of containing an in fectious agent either at the portal of exit from the body or within a confined space. The term is applied most frequently to containment of infectious agents transmitted by the respiratory route but could apply to other routes of transmissi on, (e.g., a draining wound, vesicular or bullous skin lesions). Respirator y Hygiene/Cough Etiquette that encourages individuals to \"cover your cough\" and/or wear a mask is a source control measure. The use of enclosing devices fo r local exhaust ventilation (e.g., booths for sputum induction or administrati on of aerosolized medication) is another example of source control. Standard Precautions . A group of infection prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed diagnosis or presumed infection status. Standard Precautions is a combination and expansion of Universal Precautions 780 and Body Substance Isolation 1102. Standard Precautions is based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except swea t, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions includes hand hygiene, and depending on the anticipated exposure, use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield. Also, equipment or items in t he patient environment likely to have been contaminated with infe ctious fluids must be handled in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents, (e.g. wear gloves for handling, contain heavily soiled equipm ent, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment bef ore use on another patient). Surgical mask. A device worn over the mouth and nose by operating room personnel during surgical pr ocedures to protect both surgical patients and operating room personnel from transfe r of microorganisms and body fluids. Surgical masks also are used to protec t healthcare personnel from contact with large infectious droplets (>5 m in size). According to draft guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration on May 15, 2003, surgical masks are evaluated using standardized testing procedures for fl uid resistance, bacterial filtration efficiency, differential pressure (air exchange), and flammability in order to mitigate the risks to heal th associated with the use of surgical masks. These specifications apply to any masks that are labeled surgical, laser, isolation, or dental or medical procedure (www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/094.html#4). Surgical masks do not protect against inhalation of small particles or droplet nuclei and should not be confused with par ticulate respirators that are recommended for protection against selected airborne infectious agents, (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis) .

Executive Summary This guideline updates and expands the original Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline for Prevention of Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI) published in 1981. Several developments necessitated revision of the 1981 guideline, including new research and technological advancements for preventing CAUTI, increasing need to address patients in non-acute care settings and patients requiring long-term urinary catheterization, and greater emphasis on preventi on initiatives as well as better defined goals and metrics for outcomes and process measures. In addition to updating the previous guideline, this revised guideline reviews the available evidence on CAUTI prevention for patients requiring chronic indwelling catheters and individuals who can be managed with alternative methods of urinary drainage (e.g., intermittent catheterization). The revised guideline also includes specific recommendations for implementation, performance measurement, and surveillance. Although the general principles of CAUTI prevention have not changed from the previous version, the revised guideline provides clarification and more specific guidance based on a defined, systematic review of the literature through July 2007. For areas where knowledge gaps exist, recommendations for further research are listed. Finally, the revised guideline outlines high-priority recommendations for CAUTI prevention in order to offer guidance for implementation. This document is intended for use by infection prevention staff, healthcare epidemiologists, healthcare administrators, nurses, other healthcare providers, and persons responsible for developing, implementing, and evaluating infe ction prevention and control programs for healthcare settings across the continuum of care. The guideline can also be used as a resource for societies or organizations that wish to develop more detailed implementation guidance for prevention of CAUTI. Our goal was to develop a guideline based on a targeted systematic review of the best available evidence, with explicit links between the evidence and recommendations. To accomplish this, we used an adapted GRADE system approach for evaluating quality of evidence and determining strength of recommendations. The methodology, structure, and components of this guideline are approved by HICPAC and will be used for subsequent guidelines issued by HICPAC. A more detailed description of our approach is available in the Methods section. To evaluate the evidence on preventing CAUTI, we examined data addressing three key questions and related subquestions: 1. Who should receive urinary catheters? A. When is urinary catheterization necessary? B. What are the risk factors for CAUTI? C. What populations are at highest risk of mortality related to urinary catheters? 2. For those who may require urinary catheters, what are the best practices? Specifically, what are the risks and benefits associated with: A. Different approaches to catheterization? B. Different catheters or collecting systems? C. Different catheter management techniques? D. Different systems interventions (i .e., quality improvement programs)? 3. What are the best practices for preventing CAUTI associated with obstructed urinary catheters? 8 Evidence addressing the key questions was used to formulate recommendations, and explicit links between the evidence and recommendations are available in the Evidence Review in the body of the guideline and Evidence Tables and GRADE Tables in the Appendices . It is important to note that Category I recommendations are all considered strong recommendations and should be equally implemented; it is only the quality of the evidence underlying the recommendation that distinguishes between levels A and B. Category IC recommendations are required by state or federal regulation and may have any level of supporting evidence. The categorization scheme used in this guideline is presented in Table 1 in the Summary of Recommendations and described further in the Methods section . The Summary of Recommendations is organized as follows: 1) recommendations for who should receive indwelling urinary catheters (or, for certain populations, alternatives to indwelling catheters); 2) recommendations for catheter insertion; 3) recommendations for catheter maintenance; 4) quality improvement programs to achieve appropriate placement, care, and removal of catheters; 5) administrative infrastructure required; and 6) surveillance strategies. The Implementation and Audit section includes a prioritization of recommendations (i.e., high- priority recommendations that are essential for every healthcare facility), organized by modules, in order to provide facilities more guidance on implementation of these guidelines. A list of recommended performance measures that can potentially be used for internal reporting purposes is also included. Areas in need of further research identified during the evidence review are outlined in the Recommendations for Further Research . This section includes guidance for specific methodological approaches that should be used in future studies. Readers who wish to examine the primary evidence underlying the recommendations are referred to the Evidence Review in the body of the guideline, and the Evidence Tables and GRADE Tables in the Appendices . The Evidence Review includes narrative summaries of the data presented in the Evidence Tables and GRADE Tables . The Evidence Tables include all study-level data used in the guideline, and the GRADE Tables assess the overall quality of evidence for each question. The Appendices also contain a clearly delineated search strategy that will be used for periodic updates to ensure that the guideline remains a timely resource as new information becomes available. 9 II.

Consider using a portable ultrasound device to assess urine volume in patients undergoing intermittent catheterization to assess urine volume and reduce unnecessary catheter insertions. (Category II) (Key Question 2C) 1. If ultrasound bladder scanners are used, ensure that indications for use are clearly stated, nursing staff are trained in their use, and equipment is adequately cleaned and disinfected in between patients. (Category IB) 12 III. Proper Techniques for Urinary Catheter Maintenance A. Following aseptic insertion of the urinary catheter, maintain a closed drainage system (Category IB) (Key Question 1B and 2B) 1.

Complex urinary drainage systems (utilizing mechanisms for reducing bacterial entry such as antiseptic-release cartridges in the drain port) are not necessary for routine use. (Category II) (Key Question 2B) E. Changing indwelling catheters or drainage bags at routine, fixed intervals is not recommended. Rather, it is suggested to change catheters and drainage bags based on clinical indications such as infection, obstruction, or when the closed system is compromised. (Category II) (Key Question 2C) F. Unless clinical indications exist (e.g., in patients with bacteriuria upon catheter removal post urologic surgery), do not use systemic ant imicrobials routinely to prevent CAUTI in patients requiring either short or long-term catheterization.

(No recommendation/unresolved issue) (Key Question 2C) Catheter Materials M. If the CAUTI rate is not decreasing after implementing a comprehensive strategy to reduce rates of CAUTI, consider using antimicrobial/antiseptic-impregnated catheters. The comprehensive strategy should include, at a minimum, the high priority recommendations for urinary catheter use, aseptic insertion, and maintenance (see Section III. Implementation and Audit). (Category IB) (Key Question 2B) 1. Further research is needed on the effect of antimicrobial/antiseptic-impregnated catheters in reducing the risk of symptomatic UTI, their inclusion among the primary interventions, and the patient populations most likely to benefit from these catheters.

Implement quality improvement (QI) progr ams or strategies to enhance appropriate use of indwelling catheters and to reduce the risk of CAUTI based on a facility risk assessment. (Category IB) (Key Question 2D) The purposes of QI programs should be: 1) to assure appropriate utilization of catheters 2) to identify and remove catheters that are no longer needed (e.g., daily review of their continued need) and 3) to ensure adherence to hand hygiene and proper care of catheters. Examples of programs that have been demonstrated to be effective include: 1. A system of alerts or reminders to identify all patients with urinary catheters and assess the need for continued catheterization 2. Guidelines and protocols for nurse-directed removal of unnecessary urinary catheters 3. Education and performance feedback regarding appropriate use, hand hygiene, and catheter care 4.

Provide education about CAUTI, other complications of urinary catheterization, and alternatives to indwelling catheters. (Category IB) 2. When feasible, consider providing performance feedback to these personnel on what proportion of catheters they have placed meet facility-based criteria and other aspects related to catheter care and maintenance. (Category II) C. Supplies 1. Ensure that supplies necessary for aseptic technique for catheter insertion are readily available. (Category IB) D. System of documentation 1. Consider implementing a system for docum enting the following in the patient record: indications for catheter insertion, date and time of catheter insertion, individual who inserted catheter, and date and time of catheter removal. (Category II) a. Ensuring that documentation is accessible in the patient record and recorded in a standard format for data collection and quality improvement purposes is suggested. Electronic documentation that is searchable is preferable. (Category II) E. Surveillance resources 1. If surveillance for CAUTI is performed, ensure that there are sufficient trained personnel and technology resources to support surveillance for urinary catheter use and outcomes. (Category IB) 16 VI. Surveillance A. Consider surveillance for CAUTI when indicated by facility-based risk assessment. (Category II) 1. Identify the patient groups or units on which to conduct surveillance based on frequency of catheter use and potential risk of CAUTI. B. Use standardized methodology for performing CAUTI surveillance. (Category IB) 1. Examples of metrics that should be used for CAUTI surveillance include: a. Number of CAUTI per 1000 catheter-days b. Number of bloodstream infections secondary to CAUTI per 1000 catheter-days c. Catheter utilization ratio: (urinary catheter days/patient days) x 100 2. Use CDC/NHSN criteria for identif ying patients who have symptomatic UTI (SUTI) (numerator data) (see NHSN Patient Safety Manual: http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/library.html ). 3. For more information on metrics, please see the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections: http://www.hhs.gov/ophs/initi atives/hai/infection.html . C. Routine screening of catheterized patients for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is not recommended. (Category II) (Key Question 2D) D. When performing surveillance for CAUTI, consider providing regular (e.g., quarterly) feedback of unit-specific CAUTI rates to nursing staff and other appropriate clinical care staff. (Category II) (Key Question 2D) 17 III. Implementation and Audit Prioritization of Recommendations In this section, the recommendations considered essential for all healthcare facilities caring for patients requiring urinary catheterization are organized into modules in order to provide more guidance to facilities on implementation of these guidelines. The high-priority recommendations were chosen by a consensus of experts based on strength of recommendation as well as on the likely impact of the strategy in preventing CAUTI. The administrative functions and infrastructure listed above in the summary of recommendations ar e necessary to accomplish the high priority recommendations and are therefore critical to the success of a prevention program. In addition, quality improvement programs should be implemented as an active approach to accomplishing these recommendations and when process and outcome measure goals are not being met based on internal reporting. Priority Recommendations for Appropriate Urinary Catheter Use (Module 1) Insert catheters only for appropriate indications (see Table 2), and leave in place only as long as needed. (Category IB) o Avoid use of urinary catheters in patients and nursing home residents for management of incontinence. (Category IB) o For operative patients who have an indication for an indwelling catheter, remove the catheter as soon as possible postoperatively, preferably within 24 hours, unless there are appropriate indications for continued use. (Category IB) Priority Recommendations for Aseptic Insertion of Urinary Catheters (Module 2) Ensure that only properly trained persons (e.g., hospital personnel, family members, or patients themselves) who know the correct technique of aseptic catheter insertion and maintenance are given this responsibility. (Category IB) In the acute care hospital setting, insert catheters using aseptic technique and sterile equipment. (Category IB) Priority Recommendations for Proper Urinary Catheter Maintenance (Module 3) Following aseptic insertion of the urinary catheter, maintain a closed drainage system (Category IB) Maintain unobstructed urine flow. (Category IB) Performance Measures A. Internal Reporting . Consider reporting both process and outcome measures to senior administrative, medical, and nursing leadership and clinicians who care for patients at risk for CAUTI. (Category II) 1. Examples of process measures: a) Compliance with educational program: Calculate percent of personnel who have proper training: Numerator: number of personnel who insert urinary catheters and who have proper training Denominator: number of personnel who insert urinary catheters Standardization factor: 100 (i.e., multiply by 100 so that measure is expressed as a percentage) 18 b) Compliance with documentation of catheter insertion and removal dates: Conduct random audits of selected units and calculate compliance rate: Numerator: number of patients on unit with catheters with proper documentation of insertion and removal dates Denominator: number of patients on the unit with a catheter in place at some point during admission Standardization factor: 100 (i.e., multiply by 100 so that measure is expressed as a percentage) c) Compliance with documentation of indication for catheter placement: Conduct random audits of selected units and calculate compliance rate Numerator: number of patients on unit with catheters with proper documentation of indication Denominator: number of patients on the unit with catheter in place Standardization factor: 100 (i.e., multiply by 100 so that measure is expressed as a percentage) 2. Recommended outcome measures: a) Rates of CAUTI: Use NHSN definitions (see http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/library.html ). Measurement of rates allows an individual facility to gauge the longitudinal impact of implementation of prevention strategies: Numerator: number of CAUTIs in each location monitored Denominator: total number of urinary catheter-days for all patients that have an indwelling urinary catheter in each location monitored Standardization factor: Multiply by 1000 so that the measure is expressed as cases per 1000 catheter-days b) Rate of bloodstream infections secondary to CAUTI: Use NHSN definitions for laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection, available at http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/library.html . Numerator: number of episodes of bloodstream CAUTI Denominator: total number of urinary catheter-days for all patients that have an indwelling urinary catheter in each location monitored Standardization factor: Multiply by 1000 so that the measure is expressed as cases per 1000 catheter-days B. External Reporting . Current NHSN definitions for CAUTI were developed for monitoring of rates within a facility; however, reporting of CAUTI rates for facility-to- facility comparison might be requested by state requirements and external quality initiatives. 19 IV. Recommendations for Further Research Our literature review revealed that many of the studies addressing strategies to prevent CAUTI were not of sufficient quality to allow firm conclusions regarding the benefit of certain interventions. Future studies of CAUTI prevention should: 1) Be primary analytic research (i.e . systematic reviews, meta-analyses, interventional studies, and observational studies [cohort, case-control, analytic cross-sectional studies]) 2) Evaluate clinically relevant outcomes (e.g., SUTI, bloodstream infections secondary to CAUTI) 3) Adjust for confounders as needed using multivariable analyses 4) Stratify outcomes by patient populations at risk for CAUTI 5) Ensure adequate statistical power to detect differences The following is a compilation of recommendations for further research: 1. Catheter materials a. Antimicrobial and antiseptic-impregnated catheters i. Effect of catheters on reducing the risk of SUTI and other clinically significant outcomes ii. Patient populations most likely to benefit iii. Incidence of antimicrobial resistance in urinary pathogens iv. Role of bacterial biofilms in the pathogenesis of CAUTI b. Standard catheters i.

Optimal cleaning and storage procedures (e.g., wet vs. dry storage) for catheters used for clean intermittent catheterization 7. Prevention of transmission a. Spatial separation of patients with urinary catheters (in the absence of epidemic spread or frequent cross-infection) to prevent transmission of pathogens colonizing urinary drainage systems 21 V. Background Urinary tract infections are the most common type of healthcare-associated infection, accounting for more than 30% of infections reported by acute care hospitals.19 Virtually all healthcare-associated UTIs are caused by instrumentation of the urinary tract. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital cost, and length of stay. 6-9 In addition, bacteriuria commonly leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, and urinary drainage systems are often reservoirs for multidrug- resistant bacteria and a source of transmission to other patients.10,11 Definitions An indwelling urinary catheter is a drainage tube that is inserted into the urinary bladder through the urethra, is left in place, and is connected to a closed collection system. Alternative methods of urinary drainage may be employed in some patients. Intermittent (\"in-and-out\") catheterization involves brief insertion of a catheter into the bladder through the urethra to drain urine at intervals. An external catheter is a ur ine containment device that fits over or adheres to the genitalia and is attached to a urinary drainage bag. The most commonly used external catheter is a soft flexible sheath that fits over the penis (\"condom\" catheter). A suprapubic catheter is surgically inserted into the bladder through an incision above the pubis. Although UTIs associated with alternative urinary drainage systems are considered device-associated, CAUTI rates reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) only refer to those associated with indwelling urinary catheters. NHSN has recently revised the UTI surveillance definition criteria. Among the changes are removal of the asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) criterion and refinement of the criteria for defining symptomatic UTI (SUTI). The time period for follow-up surveillance after catheter removal also has been shortened from 7 days to 48 hours to align with other device-associated infections. The new UTI criteria, which took effect in January 2009, can be found in the NHSN Patient Safety Manual (http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/library.html ). The limitations and heterogeneity of definitions of CAUTI used in various studies present major challenges in appraising the quality of evidence in the CAUTI literature. Study investigators have used numerous different definitions for CAUTI outcomes, ranging from simple bacteriuria at a range of concentrations to, less commonly, symptomatic infection defined by combinations of bacteriuria and various signs and symptoms. Futhermore, most studies that used CDC/NHSN definitions for CAUTI did not distinguish between SUTI and ASB in their analyses. 30 The heterogeneity of definitions used for CAUTI may reduce the quality of evidence for a given intervention and often precludes meta-analyses. The clinical significance of ASB in catheterized patients is undefined. Approximately 75% to 90% of patients with ASB do not develop a systemic inflammatory response or other signs or symptoms to suggest infection. 6,31 Monitoring and treatment of ASB is also not an effective prevention measure for SUTI, as most cases of SUTI are not preceded by bacteriuria for more than a day. 25 Treatment of ASB has not been shown to be clinically beneficial and is associated with the selection of antimicrobial-resistant organisms. 22 Epidemiology Between 15% and 25% of hospitalized patients may receive short-term indwelling urinary catheters.12,13 In many cases, catheters are placed for inappropriate indications, and healthcare providers are often unaware that their patients have catheters, leading to prolonged, unnecessary use.14-16 In acute care hospitals reporting to NHSN in 2006, pooled mean urinary catheter utilization ratios in ICU and non-ICU areas ranged from 0.23-0.91 urinary catheter-days/patient-days. 17 While the numbers of units reporting were small, the highest ratios were in trauma ICUs and the lowest in inpatient medical/ surgical wards. The overall prevalence of long- term indwelling urethral catheterization use is unknown. The prevalence of urinary catheter use in residents in long-term care facilities in the United States is on the order of 5%, representing approximately 50,000 residents with catheters at any given time.18 This number appears to be declining over time, likely because of feder ally mandated nursing home quality measures. However, the high prevalence of urinary catheters in patients transferred to skilled nursing facilities suggests that acute care hospitals should focus more efforts on removing unnecessary catheters prior to transfer.18 Reported rates of UTI among patients with urinary catheters vary substantially. National data from NHSN acute care hospitals in 2006 showed a range of pooled mean CAUTI rates of 3.1- 7.5 infections per 1000 catheter-days.17 The highest rates were in burn ICUs, followed by inpatient medical wards and neurosurgical ICUs, although these sites also had the fewest numbers of locations reporting. The lowest rates were in medical/surgical ICUs. Although morbidity and mortality from CAUTI is considered to be relatively low compared to other HAIs, the high prevalence of urinary catheter use leads to a large cumulative burden of infections with resulting infectious complications and deaths. An estimate of annual incidence of HAIs and mortality in 2002, based on a broad survey of US hospitals, found that urinary tract infections made up the highest number of infections (> 560,000) compared to other HAIs, and attributable deaths from UTI were estimated to be over 13,000 (mortality rate 2.3%). 19 And while fewer than 5% of bacteriuric cases develop bacteremia,6 CAUTI is the leading cause of secondary nosocomial bloodstream infections; about 17% of hospital-acquired bacteremias are from a urinary source, with an associated mortality of approximately 10%.20 In the nursing home setting, bacteremias are most commonly caused by UTIs, the majority of which are catheter- related.21 An estimated 17% to 69% of CAUTI may be preventable with recommended infection control measures, which means that up to 380,000 infections and 9000 deaths related to CAUTI per year could be prevented.22 Pathogenesis and Microbiology The source of microorganisms causing CAUTI c an be endogenous, typically via meatal, rectal, or vaginal colonization, or exogenous, such as via contaminated hands of healthcare personnel or equipment. Microbial pathogens can enter the urinar y tract either by the extraluminal route, via migration along the outside of the catheter in the periurethral mucous sheath, or by the intraluminal route, via movement along the internal lumen of the catheter from a contaminated collection bag or catheter-drainage tube junction. The relative contribution of each route in the pathogenesis of CAUTI is not well known. The marked reduction in risk of bacteriuria with the introduction of the sterile, closed urinary drainage system in the1960's23 suggests the importance of the intraluminal route. However, even with the closed drainage system, 23 bacteriuria inevitably occurs over time either via breaks in the sterile system or via the extraluminal route.24 The daily risk of bacteriuria with catheterization is 3% to 10%,25,26 approaching 100% after 30 days, which is considered the delineation between short and long- term catheterization.27 Formation of biofilms by urinary pathogens on the surface of the catheter and drainage system occurs universally with prolonged duration of catheterization.28 Over time, the urinary catheter becomes colonized with microorganisms living in a sessile state within the biofilm, rendering them resistant to antimicrobials and host defenses and virtually impossible to eradicate without removing the catheter. The role of bacteria within biofilms in the pathogenesis of CAUTI is unknown and is an area requiring further research. The most frequent pathogens associated with CAUTI (combining both ASB and SUTI) in hospitals reporting to NHSN between 2006-2007 were was caused by other gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus spp 5. Antimicrobial resistance among urinary pathogens is an ever increasing problem. About a quarter of E. coli isolates and one third of P. aeruginosa isolates from CAUTI cases were fluoroquinolone-resistant. Resistance of gram-negative pathogens to other agents, including third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, was also substantial 5. The proportion of organisms that were multidrug-resistant, defined by non-susceptibility to all agents in 4 classes, was 4% of P. aeruginosa , baumannii . 29 24 VI. Scope and Purpose This guideline updates and expands the original CDC Guideline for Prevention of CAUTI published in 1981. The revised guideline addresses the prevention of CAUTI for patients in need of either short- or long-term (i.e., > 30 days) urinary catheterization in any type of healthcare facility and evaluates evidence for alternative methods of urinary drainage, including intermittent catheterization, external cathet ers, and suprapubic catheters. The guideline also includes specific recommendations for implementation, performance measurement, and surveillance. Recommendations for further research are also provided to address the knowledge gaps in CAUTI prevention identified during the literature review. To evaluate the evidence on preventing CAUTI, we examined data addressing three key questions and related subquestions: 1. Who should receive urinary catheters? A. When is urinary catheterization necessary? B. What are the risk factors for CAUTI? C. What populations are at highest risk of mortality from catheters? 2. For those who may require urinary catheters, what are the best practices? Specifically, what are the risks and benefits associated with: A. Different approaches to catheterization? B.

The guideline can also be used as a resource for societies or organizations that wish to develop more detailed implementation guidance for prevention of CAUTI. 25 VII. Methods This guideline was based on a targeted systematic review of the best available evidence on CAUTI prevention. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach 32-34 to provide explicit links between the available evidence and the resulting recommendations. Our guideline development process is outlined in Figure 1. Figure 1. The Guideline Development Process GUIDELINE SEARCH DEVELOPMENT OF KEY QUESTIONS Review of relevant guidelines to inform key questions LITERATURE SEARCH Databases identified; search strategy developed; references stored; duplicates resolved ABSTRACT AND FULL-TEXT SCREENING To identify studies which were a) relevant to one or more key questions b) primary analytic research, systematic review or meta-analysis and c) written in English DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data abstracted into evidence tables; study quality assessed DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS Strength of evidence graded; summaries and recommendations drafted FINALIZE RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations finalized; guideline published 26 Development of Key Questions We first conducted an electronic search of the National Guideline Clearinghouse\u00ae (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), Medline\u00ae (National Library of Medicine) using the Ovid\u00ae Platform (Ovid Technologies, Wolters Kluwer, New York, NY), the Cochrane\u00ae Health Technology Assessment Database (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK), the NIH Consensus Development Program, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force database for existing national and international guidelines relevant to CAUTI. The strategy used for the guideline search and the search results can be found in Appendix 1A . A preliminary list of key questions was developed from a review of the relevant guidelines identified in the search.1,35,36 Key questions were finalized after vetting them with a panel of content experts and HICPAC members. Literature Search Following the development of the key questions, search terms were developed for identifying literature relevant to the key questions. For the purposes of quality assurance, we compared these terms to those used in relevant seminal studies and guidelines. These search terms were then incorporated into search strategies for the relevant electronic databases. Searches were performed in Medline\u00ae (National Library of Medicine) using the Ovid\u00ae Platform (Ovid Technologies, Wolters Kluwer, New York, NY), EMBASE\u00ae (Elsevier BV, (Ebsco Publishing, Ipswich, MA) and Cochrane\u00ae (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) (all databases were searched in July 2007), and the resulting references were imported into a reference manager, where duplicates were resolved. For Cochrane reviews ultimately included in our guideline, we checked for updates in July 2008. The detailed search strategy used for identifying primary literature and the results of the search can be found in Appendix 1B . Study Selection Titles and abstracts from references were screened by a single author (C.V.G, R.K.A., or D.A.P.) and the full text articles were retrieved if they were 1) relevant to one or more key questions, 2) primary analytic research, systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and 3) written in English. Likewise, the full-text articles were screened by a single author (C.V.G. or D.A.P.) using the same criteria, and included studies underwent a second review for inclusion by another author (R.K.A.). Disagreements were resolved by the remaining authors. The results of this process are depicted in Figure 2. 27 Figure 2: Results of the Study Selection Process 8065 potentially relevant studies identified 1060 studies retrieved for preliminary evaluation7005 studies excluded based on title and abstract 249 studies included for data extraction 811 studies excluded because: Not in English (n=5); not primary analytic research, systematic review or meta- analysis (n=386); not re levant to any key question (n=364); present in included systematic reviews (n=50); other (n=6) 28 Data Extraction and Synthesis Data on the study author, year, design, objective, population, setting, sample size, power, follow-up, and definitions and results of clinically relevant outcomes were extracted into evidence tables (Appendix 2 ). Three evidence tables were developed, each of which represented one of our key questions. Studies were extracted into the most relevant evidence table. Then, studies were organized by the common themes that emerged within each evidence table. Data were extracted by one author (R .K.A.) and cross-checked by another (C.V.G.). Disagreements were resolved by the remaining authors. Data and analyses were extracted as originally presented in the included studies. Meta-analyses were performed only where their use was deemed critical to a recommendation, and only in circumstances where multiple studies with sufficiently homogenous populations, interventions, and outcomes could be analyzed. Systematic reviews were included in our review. To avoid duplication of data, we excluded primary studies if they were also included in a systematic review captured by our search. The only exception to this was if the primary study also addressed a relevant question that was outside the scope of the included systematic review. Before exclusion, data from the primary studies that we originally captured were abstracted into the evidence tables and reviewed. We also excluded systematic reviews that analyzed pr imary studies that were fully captured in a more recent systematic review. The only exception to this was if the older systematic review also addressed a relevant question that was outside the scope of the newer systematic review. To ensure that all relevant studies were captured in the search, the bibliography was vetted by a panel of clinical experts. Grading of Evidence First, the quality of each study was assessed using scales adapted from existing methodology checklists, and scores were recorded in the evidence tables. Appendix 3 includes the sets of questions we used to assess the quality of each of the major study designs. Next, the quality of the evidence base was assessed using methods adapted from the GRADE Working Group.32 Briefly, GRADE tables were developed for each of the interventions or questions addressed within the evidence tables. Included in the GRADE tables were the intervention of interest, any outcomes listed in the evidence tables that were judged to be clinically important, the quantity and type of evidence for each outcome, the relevant findings, and the GRADE of evidence for each outcome, as well as an overall GRADE of the evidence base for the given intervention or question. The initial GRADE of evidence for each outcome was deemed high if the evidence base included a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or a systematic review of RCTs, low if the evidence base included only observational studies, or very low if the evidence base consisted only of uncontrolled studies. The initial GRADE could then be modified by eight criteria .34 Criteria which could decrease the GRADE of an evidence base included quality, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias. Criteria that could increase the GRADE included a large magnitude of effect, a dose-response gradient, or inclusion of unmeasured confounders that would increase the magnitude of effect (Table 3 ). GRADE definitions are as follows: 1. High - further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect 2. Moderate - further research is likely to affect confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate 3. Low - further research is very likely to affect confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate 4. Very low - any estimate of effect is very uncertain 29 After determining the GRADE of the evidence base for each outcome of a given intervention or question, we calculated the overall GRADE of the evidence base for that intervention or question. The overall GRADE was based on the lowest GRADE for the outcomes deemed critical to making a recommendation. Table 3. Rating the Quality of Evidence Using the GRADE Approach Type of Evidence Initial Grade Criteria to Decrease Grade Criteria to Increase Grade Overall Quality Grade RCT High Quality Serious (-1 grade) or very serious (-2 grades) limitation to study quality Consistency Important inconsistency (-1 grade) Directness Some (-1 grade) or major (-2 grades) uncertainty about directness Precision Imprecise or sparse data (-1 grade) Publication bias High risk of bias (-1 grade) Strong association Strong (+1 grade) or very strong evidence of association (+2 grades) Dose-response Evidence of a dose-response gradient (+1 grade) Unmeasured Confounders Inclusion of unmeasured confounders increases the magnitude of effect (+1 grade) High Moderate Observational study Low Low Any other evidence (e.g., expert opinion) Very low Very low Formulating Recommendations Narrative evidence summaries were then drafted by the working group using the evidence and GRADE tables. One summary was written for each theme that emerged under each key question. The working group then used the narrative evidence summaries to develop guideline recommendations. Factors determining the strength of a recommendation included 1) the values and preferences used to determine which outcomes were \"critical,\" 2) the harms and benefits that result from weighing the \"critical\" outcomes, and 3) the overall GRADE of the evidence base for the given intervention or question (Table 4). 33 If weighing the \"critical outcomes\" for a given intervention or question resulted in a \"net benefit\" or a \"net harm,\" then a \"Category I Recommendation\" was formulated to strongly recommend for or against the given intervention respectively. If weighing the \"critical outcomes\" for a given intervention or question resulted in a \"trade off\" between benefits and harms, then a \"Category II Recommendation\" was formulated to recommend that providers or institutions consider the intervention when deemed appropriate. If weighing the \"critical outcomes\" for a given intervention or question resulted in 30 an \"uncertain trade off\" between benefits and harms, then a \"No Recommendation\" was formulated to reflect this uncertainty. Table 4. Formulating Recommendations HICPAC Recommendation Weighing Benefits and Harms for Critical OutcomesQuality of Evidence STRONG (I) Interventions with net benefits or net harms IA - High to Moderate IB - Low or Very Low (Accepted Practice) IC - High to Very Low (Regulatory) WEAK (II) Inteventions with trade offs between benefits and harms High to Very Low No recommendation/ unresolved issue Uncertain trade offs between benefits and harms Low to Very Low For Category I recommendations, levels A and B represent the quality of the evidence underlying the recommendation, with A representing high to moderate quality evidence and B representing low quality evidence or, in the case of an established standard (e.g., aseptic technique, education and training), very low quality to no evidence based on our literature review. For IB recommendations, although there may be low to very low quality or even no available evidence directly supporting the benefits of the intervention, the theoretical benefits are clear, and the theoretical risks are marginal. Level C represents practices required by state or federal regulation, regardless of the quality of evidence. It is important to note that the strength of a Category IA recommendation is equivalent to that of a Category IB or IC recommendation; it is only the quality of the evidence underlying the IA recommendation that makes it different from a IB. In some instances, multiple recommendations emerged from a single narrative evidence summary. The new HICPAC categorization scheme for recommendations is provided in Table 1, which is reproduced below. Table 1. Modified HICPAC Categorization Scheme for Recommendations Category IA A strong recommendation supported by high to moderate quality evidence suggesting net clinical benefits or harms Category IB A strong recommendation supported by low quality evidence suggesting net clinical benefits or harms or an accepted practice (e.g., aseptic technique) supported by low to very low quality evidence Category IC A strong recommendation required by state or federal regulation. Category II A weak recommendation supported by any quality evidence suggesting a trade off between clinical benefits and harms No recommendation/ unresolved issue Unresolved issue for which there is low to very low quality evidence with uncertain trade offs between benefits and harms 31 Category I recommendations are defined as strong recommendations with the following implications: 1. For patients: Most people in the patient's situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; request discussion if the intervention is not offered. 2. For clinicians: Most patients should receive the recommended course of action. 3. For policymakers: The recommendation may be adopted as a policy. Category II recommendations are defined as weak recommendations with the following implications: 1. For patients: Most people in the patient's situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not. 2. For clinicians: Different choices will be appropriate for different patients, and clinicians must help each patient to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences. 3. For policymakers: Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders. It should be noted that Category II recommendations are discretionary for the individual institution and are not intended to be enforced. The wording of each recommendation was carefully selected to reflect the recommendation's strength. In most cases, we used the active voice when writing Category I recommendations - the strong recommendations. Phrases like \"do\" or \"do not\" and verbs without auxiliaries or conditionals were used to convey certainty. We used a more passive voice when writing Category II recommendations - the weak recommendations. Words like \"consider\" and phrases like \"is or \"is not recommended\" were chosen to reflect the lesser certainty of the Category II recommendations. Rather than a simple statement of fact, each recommendation is actionable, describing precisely a proposed action to take. The category \"No recommendation/unresolved issue\" was most commonly applied to situations where either 1) the overall quality of the evidenc e base for a given intervention was low to very low and there was no consensus on the benefit of the intervention or 2) there was no published evidence on outcomes deemed critical to weighing the risks and benefits of a given intervention. If the latter was the case, those critical outcomes will be noted at the end of the relevant evidence summary. Our evidence-based recommendations were cross-checked with those from guidelines identified in our original systematic search. Recommenda tions from previous guidelines for topics not directly addressed by our systematic review of the evidence were included in our \"Summary of Recommendations\" if they were deemed critical to the target users of this guideline. Unlike recommendations informed by our literature search, these recommendations are not linked to a key question. These recommendations were agreed upon by expert consensus and are designated either IB if they represent a strong recommendation based on accepted practices (e.g., aseptic technique) or II if they are a suggestion based on a probable net benefit despite limited evidence. All recommendations were approved by HICPAC . Recommendations focused only on efficacy, effectiveness, and safety. The optimal use of these guidelines should include a consideration of the costs relevant to the local setting of guideline users. Reviewing and Finalizing the Guideline 32 After a draft of the tables, narrative summaries, and recommendations was completed, the working group shared the draft with the expert panel for in-depth review. While the expert panel was reviewing this draft, the working group completed the remaining sections of the guideline, including the executive summary, background, scope and purpose, methods, summary of recommendations, and recommendations for guideline implementation, audit, and further research. The working group then made revisions to the draft based on feedback from members of the expert panel and presented the entire draft guideline to HICPAC for review. The guideline was then posted on the Federal Register for public comment. After a period of public comment, the guideline was revised accordingly, and the changes were reviewed and voted on by HICPAC. The final guideline was cleared internally by CDC and published and posted on the HICPAC website. Updating the Guideline Future revisions to this guideline will be dictated by new research and technological advancements for preventing CAUTI and will occur at the request of HICPAC. 33 VIII. Evidence Review Q1. Who should receive urinary catheters? To answer this question, we focused on three subquestions: A) When is urinary catheterization necessary? B) What are the risk factors for CAUT I? and C) What populations are at highest risk of mortality from urinary catheters? Q1A. When is urinary catheterization necessary? The available data examined five main populations. In all populations, we considered CAUTI outcomes as well as other outcomes we deemed critical to weighing the risks and benefits of catheterization. The evidence for this question consists of 1 systematic review, 37 9 RCTs,38-46 and 12 observational studies.47-58 The findings of the evidence review and the grades for all important outcomes are shown in Evidence Review Table 1A. For operative patients , low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of avoiding urinary catheterization. 37-44,47-49 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria/unspecified UTI, no effect on bladder injury, and increased risk of urinary retention in patients without catheters. Urinary retention in patients without catheters was specifically seen following urogenital surgeries. The most common surgeries studied were urogenital, gynecological, laparoscopic, and orthopedic surgeries. Our search did not reveal data on the impact of catheterization on peri-operative hemodynamic management. For incontinent patients , low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of avoiding urinary catheterization. 45,50-52 This was based on a decreased risk of both SUTI and bacteriuria/unspecified UTI in male nursing home residents without urinary catheters compared to those with continuous condom catheters. We found no difference in the risk of UTI between having a condom catheter only at night and having no catheter. Our search did not reveal data on the impact of catheterization on skin breakdown. For patients with bladder outlet obstruction , very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of a urethral stent over an indwelling catheter. 53 This was based on a reduced risk of bacteriuria in those receiving a urethral stent. Our search did not reveal data on the impact of catheterization versus stent placement on urinary complications. For patients with spinal cord injury , very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of avoiding indwelling urinary catheters. 54,56 This was based on a decreased risk of SUTI and bacteriuria in those without indwelling catheters (including patients managed with spontaneous voiding, clean intermittent catheterization [CIC], and external striated sphincterotomy with condom catheter drainage), as well as a lower risk of urinary complications, including hematuria, stones, and urethral injury (fistula, erosion, stricture). For children with myelomeningocele and neurogenic bladder , very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of CIC compared to urinary diversion or self voiding. 46,57,58 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria/unspecified UTI in patients receiving CIC compared to urinary diversion, and a lower risk of urinary tract deterioration (defined by febrile urinary tract infection, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, or increases in BUN or serum creatinine) compared to self-voiding and in those receiving CIC early (< 1 year of age) versus late (> 3 years of age). 34 Evidence Review Table 1A. When is urinary catheterization necessary? 1A.1. Use urinary catheters in operative patients only as necessary, rather than routinely. (Category IB) 1A.2. Avoid use of urinary catheters in patients and nursing home residents for management of incontinence. (Category IB) 1A.2.a. Further research is needed on periodic (e.g., nighttime) use of external catheters in incontinent patients or residents and the use of catheters to prevent skin breakdown. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 1A.3. Further research is needed on the benefit of using a urethral stent as an alternative to an indwelling catheter in selected patients with bladder outlet obstruction. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 1A.4. Consider alternatives to chronic indwelling catheters, such as intermittent catheterization, in spinal cord injury patients. (Category II) 1A.5. Consider intermittent catheterization in children with myelomeningocele and neurogenic bladder to reduce the risk of urinary tract deterioration. (Category II) Q1B. What are the risk factors for CAUTI? To answer this question, we reviewed the quality of evidence for those risk factors examined in more than one study. We considered the critical outcomes for decision-making to be SUTI and bacteriuria. The evidence for this question consists of 11 RCTs 59-69 and 37 observational studies.9,50,54,70-103 The findings of the evidence review and the grades for all important outcomes are shown in Evidence Review Table 1B. For SUTI , 50,54,61,62,74,75 ,79,83,102,103 low-quality evidence suggested that female sex, older age, prolonged catheterization, impaired immunity, and lack of antimicrobial exposure are risk factors. Very low quality evidence suggested that catheter blockage and low albumin level are also risk factors. For bacteriuria , 9,59-61,63-68,72,73,76-78, 82,84-86,89-94,96-100 multiple risk factors were identified; there was high quality evidence for prolonged catheterization and moderate quality evidence for female sex, positive meatal cult ures, and lack of antimicrobial exposure. Low- quality evidence also implicated the following risk factors for bacteriuria: older age, disconnection of the drainage system, diabetes, renal dysfunction, higher severity of illness, impaired immunity, placement of the catheter out side of the operating room, lower professional training of the person inserting the catheter, incontinence, and being on an orthopaedic or neurology service. Our search did not re veal data on adverse events and antimicrobial resistance associated with antimicrobial use, although one observational study found that the protective effect of antimicrobials lasted only for the first four days of catheterization, and that antimicrobial exposure led to changes in the epidemiology of bacterial flora in the urine. 35 Evidence Review Table 1B. What are the risk factors for CAUTI? 1B.1. Following aseptic insertion of the urinary catheter, maintain a closed drainage system. (Category IB)a 1B.2. Insert catheters only for appropriate indications, and leave in place only as long as needed. (Category IB) b 1B.3. Minimize urinary catheter use and duration of use in all patients, particularly those at higher risk for CAUTI such as women, the elderly, and patients with impaired immunity. (Category IB) 1B.4. Ensure that only properly trained persons (e.g., hospital personnel, family members, or patients themselves) who know the correct technique of aseptic catheter insertion and maintenance are given this responsibility. (Category IB) 1B.5. Maintain unobstructed urine flow. (Category IB) c a More data are available under Question 2B. b More data are available under Question 2C. c More data are available under Question 2D. Q1C. What populations are at highest risk of mortality from urinary catheters? To answer this question, we reviewed the quality of evidence for those risk factors examined in more than one study. The evidence for this question consists of 2 observational studies.7,74 The findings of the evidence review and the grades for all important outcomes are shown in Evidence Review Table 1C . Low-quality evidence suggested that older age, higher severity of illness, and being on an internal medicine service compared to a surgical service were independent risk factors for mortality in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. Both studies evaluating these risk factors found the highest risk of mortality in patients over 70 years of age. Low-quality evidence also suggested that CAUTI was a risk factor for mortality in patients with catheters. Evidence Review Table 1C. What populations are at highest risk of mortality from catheters? 1C.1. Minimize urinary catheter use and duration in all patients, particularly those who may be at higher risk for mortality due to catheterization, such as the elderly and patients with severe illness. (Category IB) Q2. For those who may require ur inary catheters, what are the best practices? 36 To answer this question, we focused on four subquestions: A) What are the risks and benefits associated with different approaches to catheterization?, B) What are the risks and benefits associated with different types of catheters or collecting systems?, C) What are the risks and benefits associated with different catheter management techniques, and D) What are the risks and benefits associated with different systems interventions? Q2A. What are the risks and benefits asso ciated with different approaches to catheterization? The available data examined the following comparis ons of different catheterization approaches: 1) External versus indwelling urethral 2) Intermittent versus indwelling 3) Intermittent versus suprapubic 4) Suprapubic versus indwelling urethral 5) Clean intermittent versus sterile intermittent For all comparisons, we considered SUTI, bacteriuria/unspecified UTI, or combinations of these outcomes depending on availability, as well as other outcomes critical to weighing the risks and benefits of different catheterization approaches. The evidence for this question consists of 6 systematic reviews, 37,104-108 16 RCTs,62,63,109-122 and 18 observational studies.54,73,81,84,123-136 The findings of the evidence review and the grades for all important outcomes are shown in Evidence Review Table 2A Q2A.1. External versus indwelling urethral Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using external catheters over indwelling urethral catheters in male patients who require a urinary collection device but do not have an indication for an indwelling catheter such as urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction. 81,109,123 This was based on a decreased risk of a composite outcome of SUTI, bacteriuria, or death as well as increased patient satisfaction with condom catheters. Differences were most pronounced in men without dementia. Statistically significant differences were not found or reported for the individual CAUTI outcomes or death. Our search did not reveal data on differences in local complications such as skin maceration or phimosis. Q2A.2. Intermittent versus indwelling urethral Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using intermittent catheterization over indwelling urethral catheters in selected populations. 84,104-106,110-114,124-126,135,136 This was based on a decreased risk of SUTI and bacteriuria/unspecified UTI but an increased risk of urinary retention in postoperative patients with intermittent catheterization. In one study, urinary retention and bladder distension were avoided by performing cat heterization at regular intervals (every 6-8 hrs) until return of voiding. Studies of patients with neurogenic bladder most consistently found a decreased risk of CAUTI with intermittent catheterization. Studies in operative patients whose catheters were removed within 24 hrs of surgery found no differences in bacteriuria with intermittent vs. indwelling catheterization, while studies where catheters were left in for longer durations had mixed results. Our search did not reveal data on differences in patient satisfaction. Q2A.3. Intermittent versus suprapubic 37 Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of intermittent over suprapubic catheterization in selected populations115,116,134-136 based on increased patient acceptability and decreased risk of urinary complications (bladder calculi, vesicoureteral reflux, and upper tract abnormalities). Although we found a decreased risk of bacteriuria/unspecified UTI with suprapubic catheterization, there were no differences in SUTI. The populations studied included women undergoing urogynecologic surgery and spinal cord injury patients. Q2A.4. Suprapubic versus indwelling urethral Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of suprapubic catheters over indwelling urethral catheters in selected populations. 37,62,104,107, 108,128-133,135,136 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria/unspecified UTI, recatheterization, and urethral stricture, and increased patient comfort and satisfaction. However, there were no differences in SUTI and an increased risk of longer duration of catheterization with supr apubic catheters. Studies involved primarily postoperative and spinal cord injury patients. Our search did not reveal data on differences in complications related to catheter insertion or the catheter site. Q2A.5. Clean intermittent versus sterile intermittent Moderate-quality evidence suggested no benefit of using sterile over clean technique for intermittent catheterization. 63,73,105,117-122 No differences were found in the risk of SUTI or bacteriuria/unspecified UTI. Study populations included nursing home residents and adults and children with neurogenic bladder/spinal cord injury. Evidence Review Table 2A. What are the risks and benefits associated with different approaches to catheterization? 2A.1. Consider using external catheters as an alternative to indwelling urethral catheters in cooperative male patients without urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction. (Category II) 2A.2. Intermittent catheterization is preferable to indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters in patients with bladder emptying dysfunction. (Category II) 2A.3. If intermittent catheterization is used, perform it at regular intervals to prevent bladder overdistension. (Category IB) 2A.4. For operative patients who have an indication for an indwelling catheter, remove the catheter as soon as possible postoperatively, preferably within 24 hours, unless there are appropriate indications for continued use. (Category IB)* 2A.5. Further research is needed on the risks and benefits of suprapubic catheters as an alternative to indwelling urethral catheters in selected patients requiring short- or long-term catheterization, particularly with respect to complications related to catheter insertion or the catheter site. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 2A.6. In the non-acute care setting, clean (i.e., non-sterile) technique for intermittent catheterization is an acceptable and more practical alternative to sterile technique for patients requiring chronic intermittent catheterization. (Category IA) * More data are available under Question 2C 38 Q2B. What are the risks and benefits asso ciated with different catheters or collecting systems? The available data examined the following compar isons between different types of catheters and drainage systems: 1. Antimicrobial/antiseptic catheters vs. standard catheters a. Silver-coated catheters vs. standard catheters b. Nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters vs. standard catheters 2. Hydrophilic catheters vs. standard catheters 3. Closed vs. open drainage systems 4. Complex vs. simple drainage systems 5. Preconnected/sealed junction catheters vs. standard catheters 6. Catheter valves vs. catheter bags For all comparisons, we considered CAUTI outcomes as well as other outcomes critical to weighing the risks and benefits of different types of catheters or collecting systems. The evidence for this question consists of 5 systematic reviews, 37,137-140 17 RCTs,64,143-158 23 observational studies,82,86,89,97,159-163, 165-178 and 3 economic analyses.179180,181 The findings of the evidence review and the grades for all important outcomes are shown in Evidence Review Table 2B. Q2B.1.a. Silver-coated catheters vs. standard catheters Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of silver-coated catheters over standard latex catheters. 37,82,86,137-139,143,159-163, 165,166 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria/unspecified UTI with silver-coated catheters and no evidence of increased urethral irritation or antimicrobial resistance in studies that reported data on microbiological outcomes. Differences were significant for silver alloy-coated catheters but not silver oxide-coated catheters. In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (see Appendix ), silver alloy-coated catheters reduced the risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria compared to standard latex catheters (control latex catheters were either uncoated or coated with hydrogel, Teflon\u00ae, or silicone), whereas there were no differences when compared to standard, all silicone catheters. The effect of silver alloy catheters compared to latex catheters was more pronounced when used in patients catheterized <1 week. The results were robust to inclusion or exclusion of non peer-reviewed studies. Only one observational study found a decrease in SUTI with silver alloy- coated catheters. 166 The setting was a burn referral center, where the control catheters were latex, and patients in the intervention group had new catheters placed on admission, whereas the control group did not. Recent observational studies in hospitalized patients found mixed results for bacteriuria/unspecified UTI. Q2B.1.b. Nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters vs. standard catheters Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters in patients catheterized for short periods of time. 137,138 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria and no evidence of increased antimicrobial resistance in studies that reported microbiological outcomes. Differences were significant in a meta-analysis of three studies examining nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters (only one individual study significant) when duration of catheterization was <1 week. No differences were seen when duration of catheterization was >1 week, although the meta-analysis was borderline significant. 39 Q2B.2. Hydrophilic catheters vs. standard catheters Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of hydrophilic catheters over standard non- hydrophilic catheters in specific populations undergoing clean intermittent catheterization. 137,144- 148,169 This was based on a decreased risk of SUTI, bacteriuria, hematuria, and pain during insertion, and increased patient satisfaction. Differences in CAUTI outcomes were limited to one study of spinal cord injury patients and one study of patients receiving intravesical immunochemoprophylaxis for bladder cancer, while multiple other studies found no significant differences. Q2B.3. Closed vs. open drainage systems Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using a closed rather than open urinary drainage system. 89,171 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria with a closed drainage system. One study also found a suggestion of a decreased risk of SUTI, bacteremia, and UTI- related mortality associated with closed drainage sy stems, but differences were not statistically significant. Sterile, continuously closed drai nage systems became the standard of care based on an uncontrolled study published in 1966 demonstrating a dramatic reduction in the risk of infection in short-term catheterized patients with the use of a closed system.23 Recent data also include the finding that disconnection of the drainage system is a risk factor for bacteriuria (Q1B). Q2B.4. Complex vs. simple drainage systems Low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of complex closed urinary drainage systems over simple closed urinary drainage systems. 150-152,154,172,176,177 Although there was a decreased risk of bacteriuria with the complex systems, differences were found only in studies published before 1990, and not in more recent studies. The complex drainage systems studied included various mechanisms for reducing bacterial entry, such as antiseptic-releasing cartridges at the drain port of the urine collection bag; see evidence table for systems evaluated. Q2B.5. Preconnected/sealed junction catheters vs. standard catheters Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using preconnected catheters with junction seals over catheters with unsealed junctions to reduce the risk of disconnections. 64,153,156,175 This was based on a decreased risk of SUTI and bacteriuria with preconnected sealed catheters. Studies that found differences had higher rates of CAUTI in the control group than studies that did not find an effect. Q2B.6. Catheter valves vs. drainage bags Moderate-quality evidence suggested a benefit of catheter valves over drainage bags in selected patients with indwelling urinary catheters. 140 Catheter valves led to greater patient satisfaction but no differences in bacteriuria/unspecified UTI or pain/bladder spasms. Details regarding the setting for recruitment and follow-up of the patients in the studies were unclear, and the majority of subjects were men. Our search did not reveal data on the effect of catheter valves on bladder function, bladder/urethral trauma, or catheter blockage. 40 Evidence Review Table 2B. What are the risks and benefits associated with different catheters or collecting systems? 2B.1. If the CAUTI rate is not decreasing after implementing a comprehensive strategy to reduce rates of CAUTI, consider using antimicrobial/antiseptic-impregnated catheters. The comprehensive strategy should include, at a minimum, the high priority recommendations for urinary catheter use, aseptic insertion, and maintenance (see Section III. Implementation and Audit). (Category IB) 2B.1.a. Further research is needed on the effect of antimicrobial/antiseptic-impregnated catheters in reducing the risk of symptomatic UTI, their inclusion among the primary interventions, and the patient populations most likely to benefit from these catheters. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 2B.2. Hydrophilic catheters might be preferable to standard catheters for patients requiring intermittent catheterization. (Category II) 2B.3. Following aseptic insertion of the urinary catheter, maintain a closed drainage system. (Category IB) 2B.4. Complex urinary drainage systems (utilizing mechanisms for reducing bacterial entry such as antiseptic-release cartridges in the drain port) are not necessary for routine use. (Category II) 2B.5. Urinary catheter systems with preconnected, sealed catheter-tubing junctions are suggested for use. (Category II) 2B.6. Further research is needed to clarify the benefit of catheter valves in reducing the risk of CAUTI and other urinary complications. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) Q2C. What are the risks and benefits associated with different catheter management techniques? The available data examined the follow ing catheter management techniques: 1. Antimicrobial prophylaxis 2. Urinary antiseptics (i.e., methanamine) 3. Bladder irrigation 4. Antiseptic instillation in the drainage bag 5. Periurethral care 6. Routine catheter or bag change 7. Catheter lubricants 8. Securing devices 9. Bacterial interference 10. Catheter cleansing 11. Catheter removal strategies (clamping vs. free drainage prior to removal, postoperative duration of catheterization) 12. Assessment of urine volumes 41 For all comparisons, we considered CAUTI outcomes as well as other outcomes critical to weighing the risks and benefits of different catheter management techniques. The evidence for this question consists of 6 systematic reviews, 37,105,106,182-184 56 RCTs,60,61,65-69,143,158,158,185-231 34 observational studies,83,85,88,90,96,102, 133,167,178,232-258 and 1 economic analysis.180 The findings of the evidence review and the grades for all important outcomes are shown in Evidence Review Table 2C . Q2C.1. Antimicrobial prophylaxis Low-quality evidence suggested no in patients undergoing short-term catheterization. 37,60,61,83,85,133,158,178, 182,185,186,189-191,232-234 This was based on heterogeneous results for SUTI and bacteriuria/unspecified UTI and no adverse events related to antimicrobials. Lack of consistency in specific factors, such as patient population, antimicrobial agents, timing of administration, and duration of follow-up, did not allow for a summary of evidence of the effect of antimicrobial prophylaxis on CAUTI in patients undergoing short term catheterization. Only two studies ev aluated adverse events related to antimicrobials. Our search did not reveal data on antimicrobial resistance or Clostridium difficile infection. Low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients undergoing long-term catheterization (indwelling and clean intermittent catheterization). 106,183,192,194,235,238 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria, heterogeneous results for SUTI, and no differences reported for catheter encrustation or adverse events, although data were sparse. One systematic review suggested an increase in antimicrobial resistance with antimicrobial use. Q2C.2. Urinary antiseptics methenamine for short-term catheterized patients. 196,197 This was based on a reduced risk of SUTI and bacteriuria and no differences in adverse events. Evidence was limited to two studies of patients following gynecological surgery in Norway and Sweden. Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of methanamine for long-term catheterized patients. 106,236-239 This was based on a reduced risk of encrustation but no differences in risk of SUTI or bacteriuria. Data on encrustation was limited to one study. Studies involved primarily elderly and spinal cord injury patients with chronic indwelling catheters Q2C.3. Bladder irrigation Low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of bladder irrigation in patients with indwelling or intermittent catheters. 66,69,199-206,240-242 This was based on no differences in SUTI and heterogeneous findings for bacteriuria. Q2C.4. Antiseptic instillation in the drainage bag Low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of antiseptic instillation in urinary drainage bags. 90,207-211,243-245 This was based on no differences in SUTI and heterogeneous results for bacteriuria. Q2C.5. Periurethral care 42 Low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of antiseptic meatal cleaning regimens before or during catheterization to prevent CAUTI.65,67,68,88,158,212-216,246,247 This was based on no difference in the risk of bacteriuria in patients receiving periurethral care regimens compared to those not receiving them. One study found a higher risk of bacteriuria with cleaning of the urethral meatus-catheter junction (either twice daily application of povidine-iodine or once daily cleaning with a non-antiseptic solution of green soap and water) in a subgroup of women with positive meatal cultures and in patients not receiving antimicrobials. Periurethral cleaning with chlorhexidine before catheter insertion did not have an effect in two studies. Q2C.6. Routine catheter or bag change Low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of routine catheter or drainage bag changes to prevent CAUTI. 102,217-219,248,249 This was based on no difference or an increased risk of SUTI and no difference in bacteriuria with routine compared to as-needed changes or with more frequent changing intervals. One study in nursing home residents found no differences in SUTI with routine monthly catheter changes compared to changing only for obstruction or infection, but the study was underpowered to detect a difference. Another study in home care patients found an increased risk of SUTI when catheters were changed more frequently than monthly. Q2C.7. Catheter lubricants Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using lubricants for catheter insertion. 167,220- 223,250-254 This was based on a decreased risk of SUTI and bacteriuria with the use of a pre- lubricated catheter compared to a catheter lubricated by the patient and a decreased risk of bacteriuria with use of a lubricant versus no lubricant. Studies were heterogeneous both in the interventions and outcomes studied. Several studies comparing antiseptic lubricants to non- antiseptic lubricants found no significant differences. Q2C.8. Securing devices Low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of using catheter securing devices to prevent CAUTI. 224 This was based on no significant difference in the risk of SUTI or meatal erosion. The only study in this category looked at one particular product. Q2C.9. Bacterial interference Moderate-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using bacterial interference in catheterized patients. 225 In the one study evaluating this intervention, urinary colonization with a non- pathogenic Escherichia coli was associated with a decreased risk of SUTI in adults with spinal cord injury and a history of frequent CAUTI. Q2C.10. Catheter cleansing Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of wet versus dry storage procedures for catheters used in clean intermittent catheterization. 255 This was based on a decreased risk of SUTI with a wet storage procedure in one study of spinal cord injury patients undergoing clean intermittent catheterization compared to a dry storage procedure where the catheter was left to air dry after washing. In the wet procedure, the catheter was stored in a dilute povidone-iodine solution after washing with soap and water. Q2C.11. Catheter removal strategies 43 a. Clamping vs. free drainage prior to removal Low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of clamping versus free drainage before catheter removal.37,184 This was based on no difference in risk of bacteriuria, urinary retention, or recatheterization between the two strategies. One study comparing a clamp and release strategy to free drainage over 72 hours found a greater risk of bacteriuria in the clamping group. b. Postoperative duration of catheterization Moderate-quality evidence suggested a benefit of shorter versus longer postoperative durations of catheterization. 37,184,227,228 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria/unspecified UTI, decreased time to ambulation and length of stay, no differences in urinary retention and SUTI, and increased risk of recatheterization. Significant decreases in bacteriuria/unspecified UTI were found specifically for comparisons of 1 day versus 3 or 5 days of postoperative catheterization. Recatheterization risk was greater in only one study comparing immediate removal to removal 6 or 12 hours after hysterectomy. Q2C.12. Assessment of urine volumes Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using portable ultrasound to assess urine volume in patients undergoing intermittent catheterization. 229,230 This was based on fewer catheterizations but no reported differences in risk of unspecified UTI. Patients studied were adults with neurogenic bladder in inpatient rehabilitation centers. Our search did not reveal data on the use of ultrasound in catheterized patients in other settings. Evidence Review Table 2C. What are the risks and benefits associated with different catheter management techniques? 2C.1. Unless clinical indications exist (e.g., in patients with bacteriuria upon catheter removal post urologic surgery), do not use systemic antim icrobials routinely as prophylaxis for UTI in patients requiring either short or long-term catheterization. (Category IB) 2C.2.a. Further research is needed on the use of urinary antiseptics (e.g., methanamine) to prevent UTI in patients requiring short-term catheterization. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 2C.2.b. Further research is needed on the use of methanamine to prevent encrustation in patients requiring chronic indwelling catheters who are at high risk for obstruction. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 2C.3.a. Unless obstruction is anticipated (e.g., as might occur with bleeding after prostatic or bladder surgery), bladder irrigation is not recommended. (Category II) 2C.3.b. Routine irrigation of the bladder with antimicrobials is not recommended. (Category II) 2C.4. Routine instillation of antiseptic or antimicrobial solutions into urinary drainage bags is not recommended. (Category II) 2C.5.a. Do not clean the periurethral area with antiseptics to prevent CAUTI while the catheter is in place. Routine hygiene (e.g., cleansing of the meatal surface during daily bathing) is 44 appropriate. (Category IB) 2C.5.b. Further research is needed on the use of antiseptic solutions vs. sterile water or saline for periurethral cleaning prior to catheter insertion. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 2C.6. Changing indwelling catheters or drainage bags at routine, fixed intervals is not recommended. Rather, catheters and drainage bags should be changed based on clinical indications such as infection, obstruction, or when the closed system is compromised. (Category II) 2C.7.a. Use a sterile, single-use packet of lubricant jelly for catheter insertion. (Category IB) 2C.7.b. Routine use of antiseptic lubricants is not necessary. (Category II) 2C.8. Further research is needed on the use of bacterial interference to prevent UTI in patients requiring chronic urinary catheterization. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 2C.9. Further research is needed on optimal cleaning and storage methods for catheters used for clean intermittent catheterization. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 2C.10.a. Clamping indwelling catheters prior to removal is not necessary. (Category II) 2C.10.b. Insert catheters only for appropriate indications, and leave in place only as long as needed. (Category IB) 2C.10.c. For operative patients who have an indication for an indwelling catheter, remove the catheter as soon as possible postoperatively, preferably within 24 hours, unless there are appropriate indications for continued use. (Category IB) 2C.11.a. Consider using a portable ultrasound device to assess urine volume in patients undergoing intermittent catheterization to assess urine volume and reduce unnecessary catheter insertions. (Category II) 2C.11.b. Further research is needed on the use of a portable ultrasound device to evaluate for obstruction in patients with indwelling catheters and low urine output. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) Q2D. What are the risks and benefits associated with different systems interventions? The available data examined the fo llowing systems interventions: 1. Infection control/quality improvement programs (multifaceted) 2. Catheter reminders 3. Bacteriologic monitoring 4. Hand hygiene 5. Patient placement 6. Catheter team versus self-catheterization 7. Feedback 8. Nurse-directed catheter removal We considered CAUTI outcomes, duration of catheterization, recatheterization, and transmission of pathogens when weighing the risks and benefits of different systems interventions. The evidence for this question consists of 1 RCT 259 and 19 observational 45 studies.3,25,260-276 The findings of the evidence review and the grades for all important outcomes are shown in Evidence Review Table 2D . Q2D.1. Multifaceted infection control/quality improvement programs Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of multifaceted infection control/quality improvement programs to reduce the risk of CAUTI. 3,260-267 This was based on a decreased risk of SUTI, bacteriuria/unspecified UTI, and duration of catheter use with implementation of such programs. Studies evaluated various multifaceted interventions. The studies with significant findings included: 1) education and performance feedback regarding compliance with catheter care, emphasizing hand hygiene, and maintaining unobstructed urine flow; 2) computerized alerts to physicians, nurse-driven protocols to remove catheters, and use of handheld bladder scanners to assess for urinary retention; 3) guidelines and education focusing on perioperative catheter management; and 4) a multifaceted infection control program including guidelines for catheter insertion and maintenance. A program using a checklist and algorithm for appropriate catheter use also suggested a decrease in unspecified UTI and catheter duration, but statistical differences were not reported. Q2D.2. Reminders Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using urinary catheter reminders to prevent CAUTI. 268-270 This was based on a decreased risk of bacteriuria and duration of catheterization and no differences in recatheterization or SUTI when reminders were used. Reminders to physicians included both computerized and non-computerized alerts about the presence of urinary catheters and the need to remove unnecessary catheters. Q2D.3. Bacteriologic monitoring Very low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of bacteriologic monitoring to prevent CAUTI. 25,271 Although one study found a decreased risk of bacteriuria during a period of bacteriologic monitoring and feedback, only 2% of SUTI episodes were considered potentially preventable with the use of bacteriologic monitoring. Q2D.4. Hand hygiene Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using alcohol hand sanitizer in reducing CAUTI. This was based on one study in a rehabilitation facility that found a decrease in unspecified UTI, although no statistical differences were reported. 272 A separate multifaceted study that included education and performance feedback on compliance with catheter care and hand hygiene showed a decrease in risk of SUTI. 265 Q2D.5. Patient placement Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of spatially separating patients to prevent transmission of urinary pathogens. 273 This was based on a decreased risk of transmission of urinary bacterial pathogens in nursing home residents in separate rooms compared to residents in the same rooms. Q2D.6. Catheter team versus self-catheterization 46 Very low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of a catheter team to prevent CAUTI among patients requiring intermittent catheterization.274 This was based on one study showing no difference in unspecified UTI between use of a catheter care team and self-catheterization for intermittent catheterization in paraplegic patients. Q2D.7. Feedback Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of using nursing feedback to prevent CAUTI.275 This was based on a decreased risk of unspecified UTI during an intervention where nursing staff were provided with regular reports of unit-specific rates of CAUTI. Q2D.8. Nurse-directed catheter removal Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of a nurse-directed catheter removal program to prevent CAUTI.276 This was based on a decreased risk of unspecified UTI during an intervention where criteria were developed that allowed a registered nurse to remove a catheter without a physician's order when no longer medically necessary . Of the three intensive care units where the intervention was implemented, differences we re significant only in the coronary intensive care unit. Evidence Review Table 2D. What are the risks and benefits associated with different systems interventions? 2D.1.a. Ensure that healthcare personnel and others who take care of catheters are given periodic in-service training stressing the correct techniques and procedures for urinary catheter insertion, maintenance, and removal. (Category IB) 2D.1.b. Implement quality improvement (QI) progr ams or strategies to enhance appropriate use of indwelling catheters and to reduce the risk of CAUTI based on a facility risk assessment. (Category IB) Examples of programs that have been demonstrated to be effective include: 1. A system of alerts or reminders to identify all patients with urinary catheters and assess the need for continued catheterization 2. Guidelines and protocols for nurse-directed removal of unnecessary urinary catheters 3. Education and performance feedback regarding appropriate use, hand hygiene, and catheter care 4. Guidelines and algorithms for appropriate peri-operative catheter management, such as: a. Procedure-specific guidelines for catheter placement and postoperative catheter removal b. Protocols for management of postoperative urinary retention, such as nurse- directed use of intermittent catheterization and use of ultrasound bladder scanners 2D.2. Routine screening of catheterized patients for asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended. (Category II) 2D.3. Perform hand hygiene immediately before and after insertion or any manipulation of the catheter site or device. (Category IB) 47 48 2D.5. Maintain unobstructed urine flow. (Category IB) 2D.6. Further research is needed on the benefit of spatial separation of patients with urinary catheters to prevent transmission of pathogens colonizing urinary drainage systems. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 2D.7. When performing surveillance for CAUTI, consider providing regular (e.g., quarterly) feedback of unit-specific CAUTI rates to nursing staff and other appropriate clinical care staff. (Category II) Q3: What are the best practices fo r preventing UTI associated with obstructed urinary catheters? The available data examined the following practices: 1. Methods to prevent/reduce encrustations or blockage 2. Catheter materials preventing blockage For this question, available relevant outcomes included blockage/encrustation. We did not find data on the outcomes of CAUTI. The evidence for this question consists of 1 systematic review,277 2 RCTs,278,279 and 2 observational studies.280,281 The findings of the evidence review and the grades for all important outcomes are shown in Evidence Review Table 3 . Q3.1. Methods to prevent/reduce encrustations or blockage Low-quality evidence a benefit of acidifyi ng solutions or oral acetohydroxamic acid in preventing or reducing catheter encrustations and blockage in long-term catheterized patients. 277,278,280,281 No differences were seen with daily catheter irrigation with normal saline. Q3.2. Catheter materials preventing blockage Low-quality evidence suggested a benefit of silicone over latex or Teflon-coated catheters in prevention or reducing catheter encrustations in long-term catheterized patients who were prone to blockage. No differences were seen with different materials in patients considered \"non-blockers.\" 279 Evidence Review Table 3. What are the best practices for preventing UTI associated with obstructed urinary catheters? 3.1.a. Further research is needed on the benefit of irrigating the catheter with acidifying solutions or use of oral urease inhibitors in long-term catheterized patients who have frequent catheter obstruction. (No recommendation/unresolved issue) 3.2.a. Silicone might be preferable to other materials to reduce the risk of encrustation in long- term catheterized patients who have frequent obstruction.

Introduction Multidrug-resistant organisms(MDRO s), including methicillin-resistant (GNB) have important infection control implic ations that either have not been addressed or received only limited considerat ion in previous isolation gui delines. Increasing experience with these organisms is improving understanding of the routes of transmission and effective preventive measures. Although transmission of MDROs is mo st frequently documented in acute care facilities, all healthcare settings are affected by the emergence and transmission of antimicrobial-resistant microbes. The severi ty and extent of disease caused by these pathogens varies by the population( s) affected and by the instit ution(s) in which they are found. Institutions, in turn, vary widely in physical and functional characteristics, ranging from long-term care facilities (LTC F) to specialty units (e.g., intensive care units [ICU], burn units, neonatal ICUs [NICUs]) in tertiary care facilities. Because of this, the approaches to prevention and control of thes e pathogens need to be tailored to the specific needs of each population and individual institut ion. The prevention and contro l of MDROs is a national priority - one that requires t hat all healthcare facilities and agencies assume responsibility(1) (2). The following discussion and reco mmendations are provided to guide the implementation of strategies an d practices to prevent the transmission of MRSA, VRE, and other MDROs. The administration of healthcare organizations and institutions should ensure that appropriate strategies are fully implemented, regularly evaluated for effectiveness, and adjusted such that there is a consistent decrease in the incidence of targeted MDROs. Successful prevention and cont rol of MDROs requires adm inistrative and scientific leadership and a financial and human resource commitment(3-5). Resources must be made available for infection pr evention and control, including ex pert consultation, laboratory support, adherence monitoring, and data analysis. Infection prevention and control professionals have found that healthcare pers onnel (HCP) are more receptive and adherent to the recommended control measures when organi zational leaders participate in efforts to reduce MDRO transmission(3). 5II. Background MDRO definition . For epidemiologic purposes, MDROs are defined as microorganisms, predominantly bacteria, that are re sistant to one or more classes of antimicrobial agents (1). Although the names of certain MDROs descri be resistance to only one agent (e.g., MRSA, VRE), these pathogens are frequently resistant to most ava ilable antimicrobial agents . These highly resistant organisms deserve special attention in healthcare facilities (2). In addition to MRSA and VRE, certain GNB, in cluding those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and others that are resistant to multip le classes of antimicrobial agents, are of particular concern.1 In addition to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae , these include strains of Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to all antim icrobial agents, or all and organisms intrinsically resistant to the broadest-spectrum antimicrobial agents. In some residential setti ngs (e.g., LTCFs), it is important to control multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae (MDRSP) that are resistant to penicillin and other broad-spectrum agents such as macrolides and fluroquinolones (18, 19). Strains of S. aureus that have intermediate susceptibility or are resistant to vancomycin (i.e., vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA], vancomycin-resistant S. aureus [VRSA]) (20-30) have affected specific populations, su ch as hemodialysis patients. Clinical importance of MDROs . In most instances, MDRO infections have clinical manifestations that are sim ilar to infections caused by susceptible pathogens. However, options for treating patients with these infections are often ex tremely limited. For example, until recently, only vancomycin provided effectiv e therapy for potentially life-threatening MRSA infections and during the 1990's there were virtually no antimicrobial agents to treat infections caused by VRE. Although antimic robials are now available for treatment of MRSA and VRE infections, resistance to each new agent has already emerged in clinical 1 Multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis are not addressed in this document because of the markedly different patterns of transmission and spread of the pathogen and the very different control interventions that are needed for prevention of M. tuberculosis infection. Current recommendations for prevention and control of tuberculosis can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/ rr5417.pdf . 6isolates(31-37). Similarly, t herapeutic fo r ESBL-producing isolates of gram-negative bacilli, strains of A. baumannii resistant to all antimicrobial agents except imipenem(8-11, 38) and intrinsically resistant Stenotrophomonas sp.(12-14, 39). These limitations may influence antib iotic usage patterns in ways that suppress normal flora and create a favorable environment for development of colonization when exposed to potential MDR pathogens (i.e., selective advantage)(40). Increased lengths of stay, co sts, and mortality also have been associated with MDROs (41- 46). Two studies documented increased mortalit y, hospital lengths of stay, and hospital charges associated with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNBs), including an NICU outbreak of ESBL-producing pneumoniae (47) and the emergence of third- generation cephalospori n resistance in Enterobacter spp. in hospitalized adults (48). Vancomycin resistance has been reported to be an independent predictor of death from enterococcal bacteremia(44, 49-53). Furthe rmore, VRE was associated with increased mortality, length of hospital stay, admission to the ICU, surgical procedures, and costs when VRE patients were compared with a matched hospital population (54). However, MRSA may behave differently from other MDROs. W hen patients with MRSA have been compared to patients wit h methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), MRSA- colonized patients more frequently develop symp tomatic infections( 55, 56). Furthermore, higher case fatality rates have been observed for certain MRSA infections, including bacteremia(57-62), poststernotomy mediastinitis(63), and surgical site infections(64). These outcomes may be a result of delays in the adm inistration of vancom ycin, the relative decrease in the bactericidal activity of vanc omycin(65), or persistent bacteremia associated with intrinsic characteristics of certain MRSA st rains (66). Mortality may be increased further by S. aureus with reduced vancomycin susceptibility (V ISA) (26, 67). Also some studies have reported an association between MRSA infe ctions and increased length of stay, and healthcare costs(46, 61, 62), while others hav e not(64). Finally, some hospitals have observed an increase in the overall occurrenc e of staphylococcal infections following the introduction of MRSA into a hospital or special-care unit(68, 69). 7III. Epidemiology of MDROs Trends : Prevalence of MDROs varies tempora lly, geographically, and by healthcare setting(70, 71). For example, VRE emerged in the eastern Unit ed States in the early 1990s, but did not appear in the wester n United States until several y ears later, and MDRSP varies in prevalence by state(72). The type and level of care also influence the prevalence of MDROs. ICUs, especially those at tertiary care facilities, may have a higher prevalence of MDRO infections than do non-ICU settings (73, 74). Antimicrobial resistance rates are also strongly correlated with hospital size, tertiary-l evel care, and facility type (e.g., LTCF)(75, 76). The frequency of clinical infection caused by these pathogens is low in LTCFs(77, 78). Nonetheless, MDRO infections in LTCFs can cause serious disease and mortality, and colonized or infected LTCF residents may se rve as reservoirs and vehicles for MDRO introduction into acute care facilities (78-88). Another example of population differences in prevalence of target MDROs is in the pediatric population. Point prevalence surveys conducted by the Pediatric Pr evention Network (PPN) in ei ght U.S. PICUs and 7 U.S. NICUs in 2000 found < 4% of patients were coloniz ed with MRSA or VRE compared with negativ e bacilli. Despite some evidence that MDRO burden is greatest in adult hospital patients, MDRO r equire similar control efforts in pediatric populations as well(89). During the last several decades, the prevalence of MDROs in U.S. hospitals and medical centers has increased steadily(90, 91). MRSA wa s first isolated in the United States in 1968. By the early 1990s, MRSA accounted for 20%-25% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospitalized patients(92) . In 1999, MRSA accounted for >50% of S. aureus isolates from patients in ICUs in the Nati onal Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) system; in 2003, 59.5% of S. aureus isolates in NNIS ICUs were MRSA (93). A similar rise in prevalence has occurred with VRE (94). Fr om 1990 to 1997, the prevalence of VRE in enterococcal isolates from hospitalized patie nts increased from <1% to approximately 15% (95). VRE accounted for almost 25% of enteroc occus isolates in NNIS ICUs in 1999 (94), and 28.5% in 2003 (93). 8GNB resistant to ESBLs, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides also have increased in prevalence. For example, in 1997, the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program found that among K. pneumoniae strains isolated in the United States, resistance rates to ceftazidime and other third-generation cephalosporins were 6.6%, 9.7%, 5.4%, and 3.6% for bloodstream, pneumonia, wound, and urinary tract infections, respectively (95) In 2003, 20.6% of all K. pneumoniae isolates from NNIS ICUs were resistant to these drugs ((93)). Similarly, between 1999 and 2003, Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics increased from 23% to 29.5% in NNIS ICUs(74). Also, a 3-month survey of 15 Brooklyn hospita ls in 1999 found that 53% of A. baumannii strains exhibited resistance to carbapenems and 24% of P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem (10). During 1994-2000, a national re view of ICU patients in 43 st ates found that the overall susceptibility to ciprofloxacin decreased from 86% to 76% and was temporally associated with increased use of fluoroquinolones in the United States (96). Lastly, an analysis of temporal trends of antim icrobial resistance in non-ICU patients in 23 U.S. hospitals during 1996-1997 and 1998-1999 (97) found signif icant increases in the prevalence of resistant isolates in MRSA, ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa , and ciprofloxacin- or ofloxacin-resistant E. coli. Several factors may have contributed to these increases including: selective pressure exer ted by exposure to antimicrobial agents, particularly fluoroquinolones, outside of the I CU and/or in the community(7, 96, 98); increasing rates of community-associated MR SA colonization and infection(99, 100); inadequate adherence to infection control practice s; or a combination of these factors. Important concepts in transmission. Once MDROs are introduced into a healthcare setting, transmission and persistence of the resistant strain is determined by the availability of vulnerable patients, selective pressure exer ted by antimicrobial use, increased potential for transmission from larger numbers of col onized or infected patients (\"colonization pressure\")(101, 102); and the impac t of implementation and adherenc e to prevention efforts. Patients vulnerable to colonization and infe ction include those with severe disease, especially those with compromised host def enses from underlying medical conditions; recent surgery; or devic es (e.g., urinary catheters or endotracheal 9tubes(103, 104)). Hospitalized pa tients, especially ICU patients, tend to have more risk factors than non-hospitalized pati ents do, and have the highest infe ction rates. For example, the risk that an ICU patient will acquire VRE in creases significantly once the proportion of ICU patients colonized with VR E exceeds 50%(101) or the number days of exposure to a VRE-patient exceeds 15 days(105). A similar effect of colonization pressure has been demonstrated for MRSA in a medical ICU(10 2). Increasing numbers of infections with MDROs also have been reported in non-ICU areas of hospitals(97). There is ample epidemiologic evidence to s uggest that MDROs are carried from one person to another via the hands of HCP(106-109). Hands are eas ily contaminated during the process of care-giving or from contact with environmental surfac es in close proximity to the patient(110-113). The latter is especially important when patients have diarrhea and the reservoir of the MDRO is the gastroint estinal tract(114-117) . Without adherence to published recommendations for hand hygiene and glove use(111) HCP are more likely to transmit MDROs to patients. Thus, strategies to increase and monitor adherence are important components of MDRO control programs(106, 118). Opportunities for transmission of MDROs beyond the acute care hospital results from patients receiving care at multiple healthcare facilities and moving between acute-care, ambulatory and/or chronic care, and LTC envir onments. System-wide surveillance at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, monitored patients identified as being infected or colonized with MRSA or VRE, and found t hat those patients subsequently received inpatient or outpatient care at as many as 62 different healthcare facilities in that system during a 5-year span(119). Role of colonized HCP in MDRO transmission. Rarely, HCP may introduce an MDRO into a patient care unit(120- 123). Occasionally, HCP can becom e persistently colonized with an MDRO, but these HCP have a limited role in transmission, unless other factors are present. Additional factors that can facilitat e transmission, include chronic sinusitis(120), upper respiratory infection(123), and dermatitis(124). 10Implications of community- associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). The emergence of new epidemic strains of MRSA in the community , among patients without established MRSA risk factors, may present new challenges to MR SA control in healthcare settings(125-128). Historically, genetic analyses of MRSA isolat ed from patients in hospitals worldwide revealed that a relatively small number of MR SA strains have unique qual ities that facilitate their transmission from patient to patient with in healthcare facilities over wide geographic areas, explaining the dramatic increases in HAIs caused by MRSA in the 1980s and early 1990s(129). To date, most MRSA strains isol ated from patients with CA-MRSA infections have been microbiologically distin ct from those endemic in heal thcare settings, suggesting that some of these strains may have arisin de novo in the community via acquisition of methicillin resistance genes by es tablished methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains(130-132). Two pulsed-field types, termed USA300 and USA400 according to a typing scheme established at CDC, have accounted for the majority of CA-MRSA infections characterized in the United States, whereas pulsed-field types USA100 and USA200 are the predominant genotypes USA300 and USA400 genotypes of the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) mec, the mobile genetic el ement that carries the mecA methicillin-resistance gene (133, 134). This genet ic cassette is smaller than types I through III, the types typically found in healthcare associated MRSA st rains, and is hypothesized to be more easily transferable between S. aureus strains. CA-MRSA infection presents most commonly as relatively minor skin and soft tissue infections, but severe invasive disease, including necrotizing pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, severe osteomyelitis, and a sepsis syndrome with increased mortality have also been described in childr en and adults(134-136). Transmission within hospitals of MRSA strain s first described in the community (e.g. USA300 and USA400) are being reported with increasing frequency(137-140). Changing resistance patterns of MRSA in ICUs in the NNIS system from 1992 to 2003 provide additional evidence that the new epidem ic MRSA strains are becoming established 11healthcare-associated as well as community pat hogens(90). Infections with these strains have most commonly presented as skin disease in community settings. However, intrinsic virulence characteristics of the organisms can resu lt in clinical manifestations similar to or potentially more severe than traditional hea lthcare-associated MRSA infections among hospitalized patients. T he prevalence of MRSA colonization and infection in the surrounding community may therefor e affect the selection of strategies for MRSA control in healthcare settings. IV. MDRO Prevention and Control Prevention of Infections. Preventing infections will r educe the burden of MDROs in healthcare settings. Prevention of antimicrobial resistance depends on appropriate clinical practices that should be incorporated into all routine patient care. These include optimal management of vascular and urinary catheters, prevention of lower respiratory tract infection in intubated patients, accurate diagn osis of infectious etiologies, and judicious antimicrobial selection and utiliz ation. Guidance for these pr eventive practices include the Campaign to Reduce Antimicrobial Re sistance in Healthcare Settings (www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/healthcare/default.htm ), a multifacet evidence-based approach with four paralle l strategies: infection prevention; accurate and prompt diagnosis and treatment; prudent use of antimicrobials; and prevention of transmission. Campaign materials are available for acute care hospitals , surgical settings, dialysis units, LTCFs and pediatric acute care units. To reduce rates of central-venous-line asso ciated bloodstream infe ctions(CVL-BSIs) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a gr oup of bundled evidence-based clinical practices have been implemented in many U. S. healthcare facilities(118, 141-144). One report demonstrated a sustained effect on the reduction in CVL-BSI rates with this approach(145). Although the specif ic effect on MDRO infection and colonization rates have not been reported, it is logi cal that decreasing these and other healthcare-associated infections will in turn reduce antimicrobial use and decrease opportunities for emergence and transmission of MDROs. 12Prevention and Control of MDRO transmission Overview of the MDRO control literature. Successful control of MDROs has been documented in the United Stat es and abroad using a variety of combined interventions. These include improvements in hand hygiene, use of Contact Precautions until patients are culture-negative for a target MDRO, active surveillance cultures (ASC), education, enhanced environmental cleaning, and improvem ents in communication about patients with MDROs within and between hea lthcare facilities. Representative studies include: \u0083 Reduced rates of MRSA transmission in The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and other Scandinavian countries after the implementat ion of aggressive and sustained infection control interventions (i.e., ASC; preemptiv e use of Contact Precautions upon admission until proven culture negative; and, in some instances, closure of units to new admissions). MRSA generally accounts for a very small proportion of S. aureus clinical isolates in these countries(146-150). \u0083 Reduced rates of VRE transmission in healthc are facilities in the three-state Siouxland region (Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota ) following formation of a coalition and development of an effective region-wide infe ction control intervention that included ASC and isolation of infected pat ients. The overall prevalence rate of VRE in the 30 participating facilities decreased from 2.2% in 1997 to 0.5% in 1999(151). \u0083 Eradication of endemic MRSA infections fr om two NICUs. The first NICU included implementation of ASC, Contact Precautions, use of triple dye on the umbilical cord, and systems changes to improve surveillance a nd adherence to recommended practices and to reduce overcrowding(152). The second NICU used ASC and Contact Precautions; surgical masks were included in the barriers used for Contact Precautions(153). \u0083 Control of an outbreak and eventual eradica tion of VRE from a burn unit over a 13- month period with implem entation of aggressive culturing, environme ntal cleaning, and barrier isolation(154). \u0083 Control of an outbreak of VRE in a NICU ov er a 3-year period wit h implementation of ASC, other infection control measures such as use of a waterless hand disinfectant, and mandatory in-service education(155). 13\u0083 Eradication of MDR-strains of A. baumannii from a burn unit over a 16-month period with implementation of strategies to impr ove adherence to hand hygiene, isolation, environmental cleaning, and te mporary unit closure(38). \u0083 In addition, more than 100 reports publish ed during 1982-2005 support the efficacy of combinations of various control interventio ns to reduce the burden of MRSA, VRE, and MDR-GNBs (Tables 1 and 2). Case-rate redu ction or pathogen eradic ation was reported in a majority of studies. \u0083 VRE was eradicated in sev en special-care units(154, 156- 160), two hospitals(161, 162), and eradicated 164-169), two hospitals(170), one LTCF(167), and one Finnish district(171). Furthermore, four MRSA reports described continuing success in sust aining low endemic MDRO rates for over 5 years(68, 166, 172, 173). \u0083 An MDR-GNB was eradicated from 13 specia l-care units(8, 9, 38, 174-180) and two hospitals (11, 181). These success stories testify to the impor tance of having dedicated and knowledgeable teams of healthcare professi onals who are willing to persist for years, if necessary, to control MDROs. Eradication and control of MDROs, such as those reported, frequently required periodic reassessment and the addition of new and more stringent interventions over time (tiered strategy). For example, interventions were added in a stepwise fashion during a 3-year effort that eventually eradicated MRSA from an NICU(152). A series of interventions was adopted throughout the course of a year to eradicate VRE from a burn unit(154). Similarly, eradication of carbapenem-resistant strains of A. baumannii from a hospital required multiple and progressively more intense interventions over several years(11). Nearly all studies reporting su ccessful MDRO control employed a median of 7 to 8 different interventions concurrently or sequentially (T able 1). These figures may underestimate the actual number of control measures used, because authors of thes e reports may have considered their earliest efforts routine (e .g., added emphasis on handwashing), and did not include them as interventions, and some \"s ingle measures\" are, in fact, a complex 14combination of several interventions. The use of multiple concurrent control measures in these reports underscores the need for a compr ehensive approach for controlling MDROs. Several factors affect the abili ty to generalize the results of the various studies reviewed, including differences in definition, study design, endpoints and variables measured, and period of follow-up. Two-thirds of the reports cited in Ta bles 1 and 2 involved perceived outbreaks, and one-third descri bed efforts to reduce endemic transmission. Few reports described preemptive efforts or prospective studies to control MDROs before they had reached high levels within a unit or facility. With these and other factors, it has not been possible to determine the effectiveness of individual interventions, or a specific combinat ion of interventions, that would be appropriate for all healthcare facilities to implement in or der to control their target MDROs. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to acquire this level of evidence. An NIH-sponsored, randomized controlled trial on th e prevention of MRSA and VRE transmission in adult ICUs is ongoing and may provide further insight into optimal control measures (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00100386?order=1 ). This trial compares the use of education (to improve adherence to hand hygiene) and Standard Precautions to the use of ASC and Contact Precautions. Control Interventions. The various types of interventio ns used to control or eradicate MDROs may be grouped into seven categories. These include administrative support, judicious use of antimicrobials, surve illance (routine and enhanced), Standard and Contact Precautions, environmental measures, education and decolonization. These interventions provide the basis for the recommendations for c ontrol of MDROs in healthcare settings that follow this review and as summarized in Table 3. In the studies reviewed, these interventions were applied in various combinat ions and degrees of intensity, with differences in outcome. 1. Administrative support. In several reports, administr ative support and involvement were important for the succe ssful control of the target MDRO(3, 152, 182-185), and authorities in infection control have str ongly recommended such support(2, 106, 107, 15186). There are several examples of MDRO control interventions that require administrative commitment of fiscal and human resources. One is the use of ASC(8, 38, 68, 107, 114, 151, 152, 167, 168, 183, 184, 187-192). Ot her interventions that require administrative support include: 1) implementing system changes to ensure prompt and effective communications e.g., computer alerts to identify patients previously known to be colonized/infe cted with MDROs(184, 189, 193, 194); 2), providing the necessary num ber and appropriate placement of hand washing sinks and alcohol-containing hand rub dispensers in the facility(106, 195); 3) maintaining staffing levels appropriate to the intens ity of care requir ed(152, 196-202); and 4) enforcing adherence to recommended infection control practices (e.g., hand hygiene, Standard and Contact Precautions) for MDRO control. Other measures that have been associated with a positive impact on prevention efforts, that require administrative support, are direct obser vation with feedback to HCP on adherence to recommended precautions and keeping HCP informed about changes in transmission rates(3, 152, 182, 203-205). A \"How-to guide\" for implementing change in ICUs, including analysis of structure, process, and outcomes when designing interventions, can assist in identification of needed administrative interventions(195). Lastly, participation in existi ng, or the creation of new, ci ty-wide, state-wide, regional or national coalitions, to co mbat emerging or gr owing MDRO problems is an effective strategy that requires administrativ e support(146, 151, 167, 188, 206, 207). 2. Education. Facility-wide, unit-targeted, and informa l, educational interventions were included in several successful studies (3, 189, 193, 208-211). The focus of the interventions was to encourage a behavio r change through improved understanding of the problem MDRO that the facility was trying to control. Whether the desired change involved hand hygiene, antimicrobial pr escribing patterns, or other outcomes, enhancing understanding and creating a cultur e that supported and promoted the desired behavior, were viewed as essentia l to the success of the intervention. Educational campaigns to enhance adherence to hand hygiene practices in conjunction with other cont rol measures have been associated temporally with decreases in MDRO transmission in various healthcare settings(3, 106, 163). 16 3. Judicious use of antimicrobial agents. While a comprehensive review of antimicrobial stewardship is beyond the scope of this guideline, recommendations for control of MDROs must include attention to judicious antimi crobial use. A temporal association between formulary changes and dec reased occurrence of a target MDRO was found in several studies, especially in those that focused on MDR-GNBs(98, 177, 209, 212-218). Occurrence of C. diffic ile-associated disease has also been associated with changes in antimicrobial use(219). Although some MRSA and VRE control efforts have attempted to limit antimicr obial use, the relative importance of this measure for controlling these MDROs remains unclear(193, 220). Limiting antimicrobial use alone may fail to control re sistance due to a comb ination of factors; including 1) the relative effect of antimicr obials on providing initia l selective pressure, compared to perpetuating resistance onc e it has emerged; 2) inadequate limits on usage; or 3) insufficient time to observe the impact of this intervention. With the intent of addressing #2 and #3 above in the study design, one study demonstrated a decrease in the prevalence of VRE associated with a formulary switch from ticarcillin- clavulanate to piperacillin-tazobactam(221). The CDC Campaign to Prevent Antimicrobial Resistance that was launched in 2002 provides evidence-based principles for judi cious use of antimicrobials and tools for implementation(222) www.cdc.go v/drugresistance/healthcare . This effort targets all healthcare settings and focuses on effective ant imicrobial treatment of infections, use of narrow spectrum agents, treatment of infections and not c ontaminants, avoiding excessive duration of therapy , and restricting use of broad- spectrum or more potent antimicrobials to treatment of serious infe ctions when the pathogen is not known or when other effective agents are unavailable. Achieving these objectives would likely diminish the selective pressure that favors proliferation of M DROs. Strategies for influencing antimicrobial pr escribing patterns within healthcare facilities include education; formulary restriction; prior-appr oval programs, including pre-approved indications; automatic st op orders; academic interventions to counteract pharmaceutical influences on prescribing patterns; antimicrobial cycling(223-226); 17computer-assisted management redundant antimicrobial combinat ions(230). A systematic revi ew of controlled studies identified several successful practices. Thes e include social marketing (i.e. consumer education), practice guidelines, authoriz ation systems, formula ry restriction, mandatory consultation, and peer review and feedback. It furt her suggested that online systems that provide clinical informa tion, structured order entry, and decision support are promising strategies(231) . These changes are best accomplished through an organizational, multidisciplinary, antimicrobial management program(232). 4. MDRO surveillance. Surveillance is a critically im portant component of any MDRO control program, allowing detection of newly emerging pathogens, monitoring epidemiologic trends, and measur ing the effectiveness of interventions. Multiple MDRO surveillance strategies have been em ployed, ranging from surveillance of clinical microbiology laboratory results obtained as part of r outine clinical care, to use of ASC to detect asymptomatic colonization. Surveillance for MDROs isolated from routine clinical cultures. Antibiograms . The simplest form of MDRO surve illance is monitoring of clinical microbiology isolates resulting from tests orde red as part of routine clinical care. This method is particularly useful to detect emergence of new MDROs not previously detected, either within an individual healthcare facility or community -wide. In addition, this information can be used to prepare facilit y- or unit-specific summary antimicrobial susceptibility reports that describe pathogen -specific prevalence of resistance among clinical isolates. Such reports may be us eful to monitor for changes in known resistance patterns that might signal emerge nce or transmission of MDROs, and also to provide clinicians with information to gui de antimicrobial prescribing practices(233- 235). MDRO Incidence Based on Clinical Culture Results. Some investigators have used clinical microbiology results to calc ulate measures of incidence of MDRO isolates in specific popul ations or patient care locations (e.g. new MDRO 18isolates/1,000 patient days, new MDRO is olates per month)( 205, 236, 237). Such measures may be useful for monitoring MDRO trends and assessing the impact of prevention programs, although th ey have limitations. Because they are based solely on positive culture results without accompanying clinical information, they do not distinguish colonization fr om infection, and may not fully demonstrate the burden of MDRO-associated disease. Furthermore, t hese measures do not precisely measure acquisition of MDRO colonization in a gi ven populaton or location. Isolating an MDRO from a clinical cult ure obtained from a patient se veral days after admission to a given unit or facility does not establish t hat the patient acquired colonization in that unit. On the other hand, pati ents who acquire MDRO colonization may remain undetected by clinical cultures(107). Desp ite these limitations, incidence measures based on clinical culture results may be highly correlated with actual MDRO transmission rates derived from information us ing ASC, as demonstrated in a recent multicenter study(237). These results sugge st that incidence measures based on clinical cultures alone might be useful su rrogates for monitoring changes in MDRO transmission rates. MDRO Infection Rates. Clinical cultures can also be used to identify targeted MDRO infections in certain patient populations or units(238, 239). This strategy requires investigation of clinical circumstances su rrounding a positive culture to distinguish colonization from infection, but it can be par ticularly helpful in defining the clinical impact of MDROs wit hin a facility. Molecular typing of MDRO isolates. Many investigators have used molecular typing of selected isolates to confirm cl onal transmission to enhance understanding of MDRO transmission and the ef fect of interventions within their facility(38, 68, 89, 92, 138, 152, 190, 193, 236, 240). Surveillance for MDROs by Detect ing Asymptomatic Colonization Another form of MDRO surveilla nce is the use of active surveillance cultures (ASC) to identify patients who are colonized with a targeted MDRO(38, 107, 241). This 19approach is based upon the observation tha t, for some MDROs, detection of colonization may be delayed or missed comple tely if culture results obtained in the course of routine clinical care are t he primary means of i dentifying colonized patients(8, 38, 107, 114, 151, 153, 167, 168, 183, 184, 187, 189, 191-193, 242-244). Several authors report having used ASC when new pathogens emerge in order to define the epidemiology of t he particular agent( 22, 23, 107, 190). In addition, the authors of several reports have concluded that ASC, in combination with use of Contact Precautions for colonized patients, contributed directly to the decline or eradication of the target MDRO(38, 68, 107, 151, 153, 184, 217, 242). However, not all studies have reached the sa me conclusion. Poor control of MRSA despite use of ASC has been described(245). A recent study failed to identify cross-transmission of MRSA or MSSA in a MICU during a 10 week period when ASC were obtained, despite the fact that culture results we re not reported to the staff(246). The investigators suggest that the degr ee of cohorting and adherence to Standard Precautions might have been the important determinants of transmission prevention, rather than the use of ASC and Contact Precautions fo r MRSA-colonized patients. The authors of a systematic review of the lit erature on the use of isolation measures to control healthcare-associated MRSA co ncluded that there is evidence that concerted efforts that incl ude ASC and isolation can r educe MRSA even in endemic settings. However, the authors also not ed that methodological weaknesses and inadequate reporting in published research make it di fficult to rule out plausible alternative explanations for reductions in MRSA acquisition associated with these interventions, and therefore concluded that the precise contribution of active surveillance and isolation alone is difficult to assess(247). Mathematical modeling studies have been used to estimate the impact of ASC use in control of MDROs. One such study ev aluating interventions to decrease VRE transmission indicated that use of ASC (versus no cultures) could potentially decrease transmission 39% and that wit h pre-emptive isolation plus ASC, transmission could be decreased 65%(248). A nother mathematical model examining the use of ASC and isolation fo r control of MRSA predicted t hat isolating colonized or 20infected patients on the basis of clinical cult ure results is unlikely to be successful at controlling MRSA, whereas use of active surveillance and isolation can lead to successful control, even in settings wher e MRSA is highly endemic.(249) There is less literature on the use of ASC in cont rolling MDR-GNBs. Active surveillance cultures have been used as part of efforts to successful control of MDR-GNBs in outbreak settings. The experience with ASC as part of successful control efforts in endemic settings is mixed. One study r eported successful reduction of extended- spectrum beta-lactamase -producing Ente robacteriaceae over a six year period using a multifaceted control program that included use of ASC(245). Other reports suggest that use of ASC is not necessary to control endemic MDR-GNBs.(250, 251). More research is needed to determine the circumstances under which ASC are most beneficial(252), but their use should be considered in some settings, especially if other control measures have been ineffective. When use of ASC is incorporated into MDRO prevention programs, the following should be considered: The decision to use ASC as part of an infection prevention and control program requires additional support for successful implementation, incl uding: 1) personnel to obtain the appropriate cultures, 2) micr obiology laboratory personnel to process the cultures, 3) mechanism for communicati ng results to caregivers, 4) concurrent decisions about use of additional isolat ion measures triggered by a positive culture (e.g. Contact Precautions) and 5) mechanism for assuring adherence to the additional isolation measures. The populations targeted for ASC are not well defined and vary among published reports. Some investigators have chosen to target specific patient populations considered at high risk for MDRO coloniza tion based on factors such as location (e.g. ICU with high MDRO rates), antib iotic exposure history, presence of underlying diseases, prolonged duration of stay, exposure to other MDRO- colonized patients, patients transferred from other facilities known to have a high prevalence of MDRO carriage, or having a history of recent hospital or nursing home stays(107, 151, 253). A more co mmonly employed strategy involves obtaining surveillance cultur es from all patients admitted to units experiencing 21high rates of colonization/infection with the MDROs of interest, unless they are already known to be MDRO carriers(153, 184, 242, 254). In an effort to better define target populations for active surve illance, investigators have attempted to create prediction rules to identify subpopu lations of patients at high risk for colonization on hospital admission(255, 256). Decisions about which populations should be targeted for active surveillance should be made in the context of local determinations of the incidence and prevalen ce of MDRO colonization within the intervention facility as well as other fa cilities with whom pat ients are frequently exchanged(257). Optimal timing and interval of ASC are not well defined. In many reports, cultures were obtained at the time of admission to t he hospital or intervention unit or at the time of transfer to or from designated units (e.g ., ICU)(107). In addition, some hospitals have chosen to obtain cultures on a periodic basis [e.g., weekly(8, 153, 159) to detect silent transmission. Other s have based follow-up cultures on the presence of certain risk factors for M DRO colonization, such as antibiotic exposure, exposure to other MDRO colonized patients, or prolonged duration of stay in a high risk unit(253). Methods for obtaining ASC must be ca refully considered, and may vary depending upon the MDRO of interest. o MRSA: Studies suggest that cultures of the nares identify most patients with MRSA and perirectal and wound ltures can identify 258-261). o VRE: Stool, rectal, or per irectal swabs are generally considered a sensitive method for detection of VRE. While one study suggested that rectal swabs may identify only 60% of individuals harboring VRE, and may be affected by VRE stool density(262), this observation has not been reported elsewhere in the literature. o MDR-GNBs: Several methods for detection of MDR-GNBs have been employed, including use of peri-rect al or rectal swabs alone or in combination with oro- pharyngeal, endotracheal, inguinal, or wound cultures. The absence of standardiz ed screening media fo r many gram- 22negative bacilli can make the process of isolating a specific MDR-GNB a relatively labor-intensive process(38, 190, 241, 250). o Rapid detection methods: Using conven tional culture methods for active surveillance can result in a delay of 2-3 days before result s are available. If the infection control precautions (e .g., Contact Precautions) are withheld until the results are availa ble, the desired infection control measures could be delayed. If empiric precautions ar e used pending negative surveillance culture results, precautions may be unnec essarily implemented for many, if not most, patients. For this reason, investigators have sought methods for decreasing the time necessary to obtain a result from ASC. Commercially available media containing chromogeni c enzyme substrates (CHROMagar MRSA(263, 264) has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for identification of MRSA and facilit ate detection of MRSA colonies in screening cultures as early as 16 hours a fter inoculation. In addition, real- time PCR-based tests for rapid detecti on of MRSA directly from culture swabs (< 1-2 hours) are now commercia lly available(265-267), as well as PCR-based tests for detection of vanA and van B genes from rectal swabs(268). The impact of rapid te sting on the effectiveness of active surveillance as a prevention strategy, however, has not been fully determined. Rapid identification of MR SA in one study was associated with a significant reduction in MRSA infecti ons acquired in the medical ICU, but not the surgical ICU(265). A mat hematical model characterizing MRSA transmission dynamics predicted that, in comparison to conventional culture methods, the use of rapid det ection tests may decrease isolation needs in settings of low-endemicity and re sult in more rapid reduction in prevalence in highly-endemic settings(249). Some MDRO control reports described surveillance cultures of healthcare personnel during outbreaks, but colonized or infected healthcare personnel are rarely the source of ongoing transmission, and this strategy should be reserved for settings in which specific healthc are personnel have been epidemiologically implicated in the transmission of MDROs(38, 92, 152-154, 188). 23 5. Infection Control Precautions. Since 1996 CDC has recommended the use of Standard and Contact Precautions for M DROs \"judged by an infection control program...to be of special clinical and epidemiologic significance.\" This recommendation was based on general co nsensus and was not necessarily evidence-based. No studies have direct ly compared the efficacy of Standard Precautions alone versus Standard Precaut ions and Contact Precautions, with or without ASC, for control of MDROs. Some reports mention the use of one or both sets of precautions as part of successf ul MDRO control efforts; however, the precautions were not the prim ary focus of the study inte rvention(164, 190, 205, 269- 271). The NIH-sponsored study mentioned earlier (Section: Overview of the MDRO control literature ) may provide some answers, http://clinicaltrials. gov/ct/show/NCT00100386?order=1 ). Standard Precautions have an essential role in preventing MDRO transmission, even in facilities that use Contact Precaut ions for patients with an identified MDRO. Colonization with MDROs is frequently undetected; even su rveillance cultures may fail to identify colonized persons due to lack of sensitivity, laboratory deficiencies, or intermittent colonization due to antimicr obial therapy(262). Therefore, Standard Precautions must be used in order to preven t transmission from potentially colonized patients. Hand hygiene is an important component of Standard Precautions. The authors of the Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings(106) cited nine studies that demonstrated a temporal re lationship between improved adherence to recommended hand hygiene practices and control of MDROs. It is not eworthy that in one report the frequency of hand hygiene di d not improve with use of Contact Precautions but did improve when gloves were used (per Standard Precautions) for contact with MDRO patients(272). MDRO control efforts frequently involved ch anges in isolation practices, especially during outbreaks. In the majo rity of reports, Contact Pr ecautions were implemented for all patients found to be colonized or in fected with the target MDRO (See Table 2). 24Some facilities also preemptively used C ontact Precautions, in conjunction with ASC, for all new admissions or for all patients adm itted to a specific unit, until a negative screening culture for the target MDRO was r eported(30, 184, 273). Contact Precautions are intended to prevent trans mission of infectious agents, including epidemiologically important microor ganisms, which are transmitted by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the pati ent's environment. A si ngle-patient room is preferred for patients who require C ontact Precautions. W hen a single-patient room is not available, consultation with in fection control is necessary to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roomma te). HCP caring for patients on Contact Precautions should wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient's environment. Donning gown and gloves upo n room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to cont ain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through envir onmental contamination (e.g., VRE, C. difficile, noroviruses and other tract agents; RSV)(109, 111, 274-277). Cohorting and other MDRO control strategies. In several reports, cohorting of patients(152, 153, 167, 183, 184, 188, 189, 217, 242), c ohorting of staff(184, 217, 242, 278), use of designated bed s or units(183, 184), and ev en unit closure(38, 146, 159, 161, 279, 280) were necessary to cont rol transmission. Some authors indicated that implementation of the latte r two strategies were the tu rning points in their control efforts; however, these measures usually followed many other actions to prevent transmission. In one, two-center study, mo ving MRSA-positive patients into single rooms or cohorting these patients in designa ted bays failed to reduce transmission in ICUs. However, in this study adherenc e to recommendations for hand hygiene between patient contacts was only 21%(281). Other published studies, including one commissioned by the American Institute of Architects and the Facility Guidelines Institute (www.ai a.org/aah_gd_hospcons ), have documented a beneficial relationship between private rooms and reduction in ri sk of acquiring MDROs(282). Additional 25studies are needed to define the specific cont ribution of using single-patient rooms and/or cohorting on preventing tr ansmission of MDROs. Duration of Contact Precautions. The necessary duration of Contact Precautions for patients treated for in fection with an MDRO, but who may continue to be colonized with the organism at one or more body sites, remains an unresolved issue. Patients may remain colonized with MDRO s for prolonged periods; shedding of these organisms may be intermittent, and surveillan ce cultures may fail to detect their presence(84, 250, 283). The 1995 HICPAC gui deline for preventing the transmission of VRE suggested three negativ e stool/perianal cultures obt ained at weekly intervals as a criterion for discontinuation of Contac t Precautions(274). On e study found these criteria generally reliable(284). Howeve r, this and other studies have noted a recurrence of VRE positive cultures in persons who subsequently receive antimicrobial therapy and persi stent or intermittent carri age of VRE for more than 1 year has been reported(284-286). Simila rly, colonization with MRSA can be prolonged(287, 288). Studies demonstrating initial cl earance of MRSA following decolonization therapy have reported a high frequency of subsequent carriage(289, 290). There is a paucity of information in the literature on wh en to discontinue Contact Precautions for patients coloni zed with a MDR-GNB, possibly because infection and colonization with these MDRO s are often associated with outbreaks. Despite the uncertainty about when to discontinue Contact Precautions, the studies offer some guidance. In t he context of an outbreak, prudence would dictate that Contact Precautions be used indefinitely for all previously infected and known colonized patients. Likewise, if ASC are used to detect and isolate patients colonized with MRSA or VRE, and there is no decolonization of these pat ients, it is logical to assume that Contact Precautions would be us ed for the duration of stay in the setting where they were first implemented. In gener al, it seems reasonable to discontinue Contact Precautions when three or more su rveillance cultures for the target MDRO are repeatedly negative over the course of a week or two in a patient who has not received antimicrobial therapy for several weeks, especially in the absence of a 26draining wound, profuse respir atory secretions, or evidenc e implicating the specific patient in ongoing transmission of the MDRO within the facility. Barriers used for contact with patients infected or colonized with MDROs. Three studies evaluated the use of glov es with or without gowns for all patient contacts to prevent VRE acquisition in ICU settings(30, 105, 273). Two of the studies showed that use of both gloves and gowns reduced VRE transmission(30, 105) while the third showed no difference in transmissi on based on the barriers used(273). One study in a LTCF compared the use of gloves only, with gloves plus contact isolation, for patients with four MDROs, including VR E and MRSA, and found no difference(86). However, patients on contact isolation were more likely to acquire MDR- K. pneumoniae strains that were prevalent in t he facility; reasons for this were not specifically known. In addition to diffe rences in outcome, differing methodologies make comparisons difficult. Specific ally, HCP adherence to the recommended protocol, the influence of added precauti ons on the number of HCP-patient interactions, and colonization pressure were not consistently assessed. Impact of Contact Precautions on patient care and well-being. There are limited data regarding the impact of Contact Precaut ions on patients. Two studies found that HCP, including attending physicians, were half as likely to enter the rooms of(291), or examine(292), patients on Cont act Precautions. Other investigators have reported similar observations on surgical wards(293) . Two studies reported that patients in private rooms and on barrier precautions for an MDRO had increased anxiety and depression scores(294, 295). Another study found that patients placed on Contact Precautions for MRSA had significantly more preventable adverse events, expressed greater dissatisfaction with their treat ment, and had less documented care than control patients who were not in isolation( 296). Therefore, when patients are placed on Contact Precautions, efforts must be made by the healthcare team to counteract these potential adverse effects. 276. Environmental measures. The potential role of environmental reservoirs, such as surfaces and medical equipment, in the tr ansmission of VRE and other MDROs has been the subject of several reports(109-111, 297, 298). While environmental cultures are not routinely recommended( 299), environmental cultures were used in several studies to document contamination, and led to interventions that included the use of dedicated noncritical medical equipment(217 , 300), assignment of dedicated cleaning personnel to the affected patient care unit(154), and increased cleaning and disinfection of frequently-touched surfaces (e.g., bedrails, charts, bedside commodes, doorknobs). A common reas on given for finding environmental contamination with an MDRO was the lack of adherence to facility procedures for cleaning and disinfection. In an educational and observational intervention, which targeted a defined group of housekeeping personnel, there was a persistent decrease in the acquisition of VRE in a medi cal ICU(301). Therefore, monitoring for adherence to recommended environmental cl eaning practices is an important determinant for success in controlling tr ansmission of MDROs and other pathogens in the environment(274, 302). In the MDRO reports reviewed, enhanced en vironmental cleanin g was frequently undertaken when there was evidence of env ironmental contamination and ongoing transmission. Rarely, control of the target MDRO required va cating a patient care unit for complete environmental cl eaning and assessment(175, 279). 7. Decolonization. Decolonization entails treatme of persons with a specific MDRO, usually MRSA, to eradi cate carriage of that organism. Although some investigators have attempted to dec olonize patients harbor ing VRE(220), few have achieved success. However, decolonization of persons carrying MRSA in their nares has proved possible with several regi mens that include topical mupirocin alone or in combination with orally administered antibiotics (e.g., rifa mpin in combination with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxaz ole or ciprofloxacin) plus the use of an antimicrobial soap for bathing(303). In one report, a 3-day regimen of baths with povidone-iodine and nasal therapy resu lted in been thoroughly reviewed.(303, 305-307). Decolonization regimens are not sufficiently effective to warrant routine use. Therefore, most healthcare facilities have limited the use of decolonization to MRSA outbreaks, or other hi gh prevalence situations, especiall y those affecting special-care units. Several factors limit the utility of th is control measure on a widespread basis: 1) identification of candidates for decoloniza tion requires surveillance cultures; 2) candidates receiving decolonization treatment must receive follow-up cultures to ensure eradication; and 3) recolonization with the same strain, initial colonization with a mupirocin-resistant stra in, and emergence of resistan ce to mupirocin during treatment can occur(289, 303, 308-310). HC P implicated in transmission of MRSA are candidates for decolonization and s hould be treated and cu lture negative before returning to direct patient care. In contrast, HCP who are colonized with MRSA, but are asymptomatic, and have not been linked epidemiologically to transmission, do not require decolonization. IV. Discussion This review demonstrates the depth of publis hed science on the prevention and control of MDROs. Using a combination of interv entions, MDROs in endemic, outbreak, and non- endemic settings have been brought under contro l. However, despite the volume of literature, an appropriate set of evidence-based control measur es that can be universally applied in all healthcare settings has not been definitively establish ed. This is due in part to differences in study methodology and outcome measures, including an absence of randomized, controlled trials comparing one MDRO control measure or strategy with another. Additionally, the dat a are largely descriptive and quasi-experimental in design(311). Few reports describ ed preemptive efforts or pros pective studies to control MDROs before they had reached high levels wit hin a unit or facility. Furthermore, small hospitals and LTCFs are infrequently represented in the literature. A number of questions remain and are discussed below. 29Impact on other MDROS from inter ventions targeted to one MDRO Only one report described control efforts directed at more than one MDRO, i.e., MDR-GNB and MRSA(312). Several reports have shown either decreases or increases in other pathogens with efforts to control one MDRO. For example, two repor ts on VRE control efforts demonstrated an increase in MRSA following the prioritization of VRE patients to priv ate rooms and cohort beds(161). Similarly an outbreak of Serratia marcescens was temporally associated with a concurrent, but unrelated, out break of MRSA in an NICU(313) . In contrast, Wright and colleagues reported a decrease in MRSA and VRE acquisition in an ICU during and after their successful effort to eradicate an MDR-strain of A. baumannii from the unit(210). Colonization with multiple MDROs appears to be common(314, 315). One study found that nearly 50% of residents in a skilled-care unit in a LTCF were colonized with a target MDRO and that 26% were co-colonized with >1 MDRO; a detailed analysis showed that risk factors for colonization varied by pathogen( 316). One review of the liter ature(317) reported that patient risk factors associated with co lonization with MRSA, VRE, MDR-GNB, C. difficile and Candida sp were the same. This review concluded that control programs that focus on only one organism or one antimic robial drug are unlikely to su cceed because vulnerable patients will continue to serve as a magnet for other MDROs. Costs. Several authors have provided evidence fo r the cost-effectiveness of approaches that use ASC(153, 191, 253, 318, 319). However, the supporti ve evidence often relied on assumptions, projections, and estimated attri butable costs of MDRO infections. Similar limitations apply to a study s uggesting that gown use yields a cost benefit in controlling transmission of VRE in ICUs(320). To date, no studies have di rectly compared the benefits and costs associated with different MDRO control strategies. Feasibility. The subject of feasibility, as it applies to the extrapo lation of results to other healthcare settings, has not been addressed. Fo r example, smaller hospitals and LTCFs may lack the on-site laboratory services need ed to obtain ASC in a timely manner. This factor could limit the applic ability of an aggressive program based on obtaining ASC and preemptive placement of patient s on Contact Precautions in these settings. However, with 30the growing problem of antimic robial resistance, and the rec ognized role of all healthcare settings for control of this problem, it is imperative that appropriate human and fiscal resources be invested to increas e the feasibility of recommended control strategies in every setting. Factors that influence selecti on of MDRO control measures. Although some common principles apply, the preceding literature revi ew indicates that no single approach to the control of MDROs is appropriate for all health care facilities. Many factors influence the choice of interventions to be appli ed within an institution, including: Type and significance of problem MDROs within the institution . Many facilities have an MRSA problem while others have ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae . Some facilities have no VRE colonization or disease; others have high rates of VRE colonization without disease; and still others have ongoing VRE outbreaks. The magnitude of the problem also varies . Healthcare facilities may have very low numbers of cases, e.g., with a newly introduced strain, or may have prolonged, extensive outbreaks or coloni zation in the population. Between these extremes, facilities may have low or hi gh levels of endemic colonization and variable levels of infection. Population and healthcare-settings. The presence of high-risk patients (e.g., transplant, hematopoietic stem-cell transplan t) and special-care neonatal ICUs; burn; hemodi alysis) will influence surveillance needs and could limit the areas of a facility targeted for MDRO control interventions. Although it appears that MDRO transmi ssion seldom occurs in ambulatory and outpatient settings, some pa tient populations (e.g., hemodialysis, cystic fibrosis) and patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents are at risk for colonization and infection with MDROs. Furthermore, the emergence of VRSA within the outpatient setting(22, 23, 25) demonstrates that even these settings need to make MDRO prevention a priority. 31Differences of opinion on the opti mal strategy to control MDROs . Published guidance on the control of MDROs reflec ts areas of ongoing debate on opt imal control strategies. A key issue is the use of ASC in control effo rts and preemptive use of Contact Precautions pending negative surveillance culture result s(107, 321, 322). The various guidelines currently available exhibit a spectrum of approaches, which their authors deem to be evidence-based. One guideline fo r control of MRSA and VRE, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (S HEA) guideline from 2003(107), em phasizes routine use of ASC and Contact Precautions. That position paper does not address control of MDR-GNBs. The salient features of SHEA recommendat ions for MRSA and VRE control and the recommendations in this guideline for cont rol of MDROs, including MRSA and VRE, have been compared(323); recommended interventions ar e similar. Other guidelines for VRE and MRSA, e.g., those proffered by the Michi gan Society for Infection Control (www.msic- online.org/resource_sections/aro_guidelines ), emphasize consistent practice of Standard Precautions and tailoring the use of ASC and C ontact Precautions to local conditions, the specific MDROs that are prevalent and being transmitted, and the presence of risk factors for transmission. A variety of approaches have reduced MDRO rates( 3, 164, 165, 209, 214, 240, 269, 324). Therefore, selection of inte rventions for controllin g MDRO transmission should be based on assessments of the local problem, the pr evalence of various MDRO and feasibility. Individual fa cilities should seek appropriate guidance and adopt effective measures that fit their circumstances and needs. Most studies have been in acute care settings; for non-acute care setting s (e.g., LCTF, small rural hospitals), the optimal approach is not well defined. Two-Tiered Approach for Control of MDROs. Reports describing successful control of MDRO transmission in healthcare fa cilities have included seven categories of interventions (Table 3). As a rule, these reports indicate that facilities confronted with an MDRO problem selected a combination of control measures, implemented them, and reassessed their impact. In so me cases, new measures we re added serially to further enhance control efforts. This evidence indicate s that the control of MDROs is a dynamic process that requires a systematic approach ta ilored to the problem and healthcare setting. The nature of this evidence gave rise to the two-tiered approac h to MDRO control 32recommended in this guideline. This approach provides the flexibility needed to prevent and control MDRO transmission in every kind of facility addressed by this guideline. Detailed recommendations for MDRO control in all healthcare se ttings follow and are summarized in Table 3. Table 3, which applies to all healthcare settings, contains two tiers of activities. In the first tier are the baseline leve l of MDRO control activities designed to ensure recognition of MDROs as a problem, involvement of healthcare administrators, and provision of safeguards for managing unidentified carriers of MDROs. With the emergence of an MDRO problem that cannot be cont rolled with the basic set of infection control measures, addi tional control measures should be selected from the second tier of interventions presented in Table 3. Deci sions to intensify MDRO control activity arise from surveillance observations and assessments of the risk to patients in various settings. Circumstances that may trigger these decisions include: Identification of an MDRO from even one patient in a facility or special unit with a highly vulnerable patient populati on (e.g., an ICU, NICU, burn unit) that had previously not enc ountered that MDRO. Failure to decrease the prevalence or incidence of a specific MDRO (e.g., incidence of resistant clinical isolates) despite infection control efforts to stop its transmission.(Statistical process c ontrol charts or other validated methods that account for normal variation c an be used to track rates of targeted MDROs)(205, 325, 326). The combination of new or increased frequen cy of MDRO isolates and patients at risk necessitates escalation of efforts to achieve or re-establish control, i.e., to reduce rates of transmission to the lowest possible level. Intens ification of MDRO control activities should begin with an assessment of the problem and evaluation of the ef fectiveness of measures in current use. Once the problem is defined, appropriate additi onal control measures should be selected from the second tier of Table 3. A knowledgeable in fection prevention and control professional or healthca re epidemiologist should make this determination. This approach requires support from t he governing body and medical st aff of the facility. Once interventions are implemented, ongoing surv eillance should be used to determine whether selected control measures are effective and if additional meas ures or consultation are 33indicated. The result of this process shoul d be to decrease MDRO rates to minimum levels. Healthcare facilities must not accept ongoing MDRO outbreaks or high endemic rates as the status quo. With selection of infection contro l measures appropriate to their situation, all facilities can achieve the desired goal and reduce t he MDRO burden substantially. 34V.

Masks are not otherwise recommended for prevention of MDRO transmission from patients to healthcare personnel dur ing routine care (e.g., upon room entry).(8, 22, 151, 152, 154, 189, 190, 193, 208, 240, 366) Category IB V.A.5.c. Use of Contact Precautions V.A.5.c.i.

Intensified interventions to prevent MDRO transmission The interventions presented below have bee n utilized in various combinations to reduce transmission of MDROs in healthcare facilities. Neither the effectiveness of individual components nor that of specific combinations of control measures has been assessed in controlled trials. Neverthel ess, various combin ations of control elements selected under the guidance of knowledgeable content experts have repeatedly reduced MDRO transmission rates in a variety of healthcare settings. V.B.1. Indications and approach V.B.1.a. Indications for intens ified MDRO control efforts (V II.B.1.a.i and VII.B.1.a.ii) should result in selection and impl ementation of one or more of the interventions described in VII.B.2 to VII.B.8 below. Individualize the selection of control measures accordin g to local considerations(8, 11, 38, 68, 114, 152-154, 183-185, 189, 190, 193, 194, 209, 217, 242, 312, 364, 365). Category IB V.B.1.a.i. When incidenc e or prevalence of MDROs are not decreasing despite implementation of and co rrect adherence to the routine control measures described above, intensify MDRO control efforts by adopting one or more of the inte rventions described below.(92, 152, 183, 184, 193, 365) Category IB V.B.1.a.ii. When the first case or outbreak of an epidemiologically important MDRO (e.g., VRE, MRSA, VISA, VRSA, MDR-GNB) is identified 42within a healthcare facility or uni t.(22, 23, 25, 68, 170, 172, 184, 240, 242, 378) Category IB V.B.1.b. Continue to monitor the in cidence of target MDRO infection and colonization after additional interventi ons are implemented. If rates do not decrease, implement more interventions as needed to reduce MDRO transmission.(11, 38, 68 , 92, 152, 175, 184, 365) Category IB V.B.2. Administrative measures V.B.2.a. Identify persons wit h experience in infection control and the epidemiology of MDRO, either in hous e or through outside consultation, for assessment of the local MDRO problem and fo r the design, implementation, and evaluation of appropriate control m easures (3, 68, 146, 151-154, 167, 184, 190, 193, 242, 328, 377). Category IB V.B.2.b. Provide necessary leadership , funding, and day-to-day oversight to implement interventions selected. Involve the governing body and leadership of the healthcare facility or system that have organizational responsibility for this and other infe ction control effort s.(8, 38, 152, 154, 184, 189, 190, 208) Category IB V.B.2.c. Evaluate healthcare system factors for their role in creating or perpetuating transmission of MDROs, including: sta ffing levels, education and training, availability of consumable and dur able resources, communication processes, policies and procedures, and adherence to recommended infection control measures (e.g., hand hygiene and St andard or Contact Precautions). Develop, implement, and monitor action plans to correct system failures.(3, 8, 38, 152, 154, 172, 173, 175, 188, 196, 198, 199, 208, 217, 280, 324, 379, 380) Category IB V.B.2.d. During the proce ss, update healthcare providers and administrators on the progress and effectiveness of the in tensified interventions. Include information on changes in prevalence, ra tes of infection and colonization; results of assessments and corrective actions for system failures; degrees of adherence to recommended practices; and action plans to improve 43adherence to recommended infection cont rol practices to prevent MDRO transmission.(152, 154, 159, 184, 204, 205, 312, 332, 381) Category IB V.B.3. Educationa l interventions Intensify the frequency of MDRO educ ational programs for healthcare personnel, especially those who work in areas in which MDRO rates are not decreasing. Provide individual or unit- specific feedback when available.(3, 38, 152, 154, 159, 170, 182, 183, 189, 190, 193, 194, 204, 205, 209, 215, 218, 312) Category IB V.B.4. Judicious use of antimicrobial agents Review the role of antimicrobial us e in perpetuating the MDRO problem targeted for intensified in tervention. Control and impr ove antimicrobial use as indicated. Antimicrobial agents that may be targeted include vancomycin, third-generation cephalosporins, and anti-anaerobic agents quinolones and carbapenems(80, 156, 166, 174, 175, 209, 218, 242, 254, 329, 334, 335, 337, 341).

Facilities that provide health care to patients who do not remain overnight (e.g., hospital-based outpatient clin ics, nonhospital-based clinics and physician offices, urgent care centers, surgicenters, free-standing di alysis centers, public health clinics, imaging centers, ambulatory behaviora l health and substance abuse clinics, physical therapy and rehabilitation cent ers, and dental practices. Cohorting. In the context of this guideline, this term applies to the practice of grouping patients infected or colonized with the same in fectious agent together to confine their care to one area and prevent contac t with susceptible patients (cohorting patients). During outbreaks, healthcare personnel may be assigned to a cohort of patients to further limit opportunities for transmi ssion (cohorting staff). Contact Precautions. Contact Precautions are a set of practices used to prevent transmission of infectious agents that are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment. Contact Precautions also apply where the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal in continence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased transmission risk. A single patient room is preferred fo r patients who require Contact Precautions. When a single patient room is not available, consultation with infection control is helpful to assess the various risks associated with other pati ent placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an exis ting roommate). In mu lti-patient rooms, > 3 feet spatial separation of between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/coloniz ed patient and other patients. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on C ontact Precautions wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or poten tially contaminated areas in the patient's environment. Donning of gown and gloves upon room entry, removal before exiting the patient r oom and performance of hand hygiene immediately upon exiting are done to contain pathogens . 50 Epidemiologically important pathogens. Infectious agents that have one or more of the following characteristics: 1)A propensity for transmission within healthcare facilities based on published reports and the occurrence of temporal or geographic clusters of > 2 patients, (e.g., VRE, MRSA However, for group A streptococcus, most experts consider a si ngle case of healthcare-associated disease a trigger for investigation and enhanced cont rol measures because of the devastating outcomes associated with HAI gr oup A streptococcus infections. For susceptible bacteria that are known to be associat ed with asymptomatic colonizati on, isolation from normally sterile body fluids in patients with significant c linical disease would be the trigger to consider the organism as epidemiologically important. 2) Antimicrobial resistance implications: o Resistance to first-line therapies (e.g., MRSA, VRE, VISA, VRSA, ESBL- producing organisms). o Unusual or usual agents with unusual pa tterns of resistance within a facility, (e.g., the first isolate of Burkholderia cepacia complex or Ralstonia spp. in non-CF patients or a quinolone-resistant strain of Pseudomonas in a facility. o Difficult to treat because of innate or ac quired resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents (e.g., Stenotrophomonas maltophili a, Acinetobacter spp. ). 3) Associated with serious clinical disease, increased morbidity and mortality (e.g., MRSA and MSSA, group A streptococcus); or 4) A newly discovered or reemerging pathogen. The strategies described for MDROs may be applied fo r control of epidemio logically important organisms other than MDROs. Hand hygiene. A general term that applies to any one of the following: 1) handwashing with plain (nonantimicrobial) soap and water); 2) antiseptic hand wash (soap containing antiseptic agents and water); 3) antiseptic hand rub (waterless antis eptic product, most often alcohol-based, rubbed on all surfaces of hands); or 4) surgical hand antisepsis 51(antiseptic hand wash or antis eptic hand rub performed preoperatively by surgical personnel to eliminate transient hand flora and reduce resident hand flora). Healthcare-associated infection (HAI). An infection that develops in a patient who is cared for in any setting where healthcare is delivered (e.g., acute care hospital, chronic care facility, ambulatory clinic, dialysis center, surgicenter, home) and is related to receiving health care (i.e., was not incubating or pres ent at the time healthcare was provided). In ambulatory and home settings, HAI would apply to any infection that is associated with a medical or surgical intervention performed in those settings. Healthcare epidemiologist A person whose primary training is medical (M.D., D.O.) and/or masters or doctorate-level epidemiology wh o has received advanced training in healthcare epidemiology. Typically these pr ofessionals direct or provide consultation to an infection prevention and control program in a hospital, long term care fa cility (LTCF), or healthcare delivery system (also see infection pr evention and control professional). Healthcare personnel (HCP). All paid and unpaid persons who work in a healthcare setting, also known as healthcare workers (e.g. any person who has professional or technical training in a healthcare-related field and provides patient care in a healthcare setting or any person who provides services t hat support the delivery of healthcare such as dietary, housekeeping, engineer ing, maintenance personnel). Home care. A wide-range of medical, nursing, rehabilit ation, hospice, and social services delivered to patients in their place of residence (e.g., private residence, senior living center, assisted living facility). Home health-care serv ices include care provided by home health aides and skilled nurses, respir atory therapists, dieticians , physicians, chaplains, equipment; home infu sion therapy; and physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Infection prevention and control professional (ICP). A person whose primary training is in either nursing, medical technology, micr obiology, or epidemiology and who has acquired 52specialized training in infection control. Res ponsibilities may include collection, analysis, and feedback of infection data and trends to healthca re providers; consultation on infection risk assessment, prevention and control strategies ; performance of education and training activities; implementation of evidence-based in fection control practices or those mandated by regulatory and licensing agencies; application of epidemiologic principles to improve patient outcomes; participation in planning renovation and constr uction projects (e.g., to ensure appropriate containment of construction dust); eval uation of new products or procedures on patient outcomes; ov ersight of employee health services related to infection prevention; implementation of preparedness plans; communica tion within the healthcare setting, with local and state heal th departments, and with the comm unity at large concerning infection control issues; and participation in research. Infection prevention and control program . A multidisciplinary progr am that includes a group of activities to ensure that recommended practices for the prevention of healthcare- associated infections are implemented and fo llowed by healthcare personnel, making the healthcare setting safe from infection for patients and healthcare personnel. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCA HO) requires the following five components of an infection prevention a nd control program for accreditation: 1) surveillance : monitoring patients and healthcare personnel for acquisition of infection and/or colonization; 2) investigation: identification and analysis of infection problems or undesirable trends; 3) prevention : implementation of measures to prevent transmission of infectious agents and to reduce risks for device- and procedure-related infections; 4) control : evaluation and management of outbreaks; and 5) reporting: provision of information to external agencies as required by state and federal law and regulation (www.jcaho.org). The infection prevention and contro l program staff has the ultima te authority to determine infection control policies for a healthcare organi zation with the approval of the organization's governing body. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs). An array of residential and outpatient facilities designed to meet the bio-psychosocial needs of persons with sustai ned self-care deficits. These include skilled nursing facilities, chronic diseas e hospitals, nursing homes, foster and group homes, institutions for the devel opmentally disabled, residentia l care facilities, assisted 53living facilities, retirement homes, adult day health care facilities, rehabi litation centers, and long-term psychiatric hospitals. Mask. A term that applies collectively to item s used to cover the nose and mouth and includes both procedure masks and surgical masks (www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/ guidance/094.html#4). Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). In general, bacteria (excluding M. tuberculosis) that are resistant to one or mo re classes of antimicrobial agent s and usually are resistant to all but one or two commercially available ant imicrobial agents (e.g., MRSA, VRE, extended spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producing or in trinsically resistant gram-negative bacilli). Nosocomial infection. from two Greek words \"nos os\" (disease) and \"komeion\" (to take care of). Refers to any infection that develops during or as a re sult of an admission to an acute care facility (hospital) and was not incubating at the time of admission. Standard Precautions . A group of infection prevention practi ces that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed diagn osis or presumed infection status. Standard Precautions are a combinat ion and expansion of Universa l Precautions and Body Substance Isolation. Standard Precautions are based on the prin ciple that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except t, nonintact skin, and mucous contain transmissible infectious agents. St andard Precautions inclu des hand hygiene, and depending on the anticipated exposure , use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likely to have been contaminated with infectious fluids must be handled in a manner to pr event transmission of infectious agents, (e.g. wear gloves for hand ling, contain heavily soiled equipment, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equip ment before use on anot her patient). 54 1.

Tier 1. General Recommendations for Routine Prevention and Control of MDROs in Healthcare Settings Administrative Measures/Adherence Monitoring MDRO Education Judicious Antimicrobial Use Surveillance Infection Control Precautions to Prevent Transmission Environmental Measures Decolonization Make MDRO prevention/control an organizational priority. Provide administrative support and both fiscal and human resources to prevent and control MDRO transmission. (IB) Identify experts who can provide consultation and expertise for analyzing epidemiologic data, recognizing MDRO problems, or devising effective control strategies, as needed . (II) Implement systems to communicate information about reportable MDROs to administrative personnel and state/local health departments. (II) Implement a multi-disciplinary process to monitor and improve HCP adherence to recommended practices for Standard and Contact Precautions. (IB) Implement systems to designate patients known to be colonized or infected with a targeted MDRO and to notify receiving healthcare facilities or personnel prior to transfer of such patients within or between facilities. (IB) Support participation in local, regional and/or national coalitions to combat emerging or growing MDRO problems. (IB) Provide updated feedback at least annually to healthcare providers and administrators on facility and patient-care unit MDRO infections. Include information on changes in prevalence and incidence, problem assessment and performance improvement plans. (IB) Provide education and training on risks and prevention of MDRO transmission during orientation and periodic educational updates for HCP; include information on organizational experience with MDROs and prevention strategies. (IB) In hospitals and LTCFs, ensure that a multi-disciplinary process is in place to review local susceptibility patterns (antibiograms), and antimicrobial agents included in the formulary, to foster appropriate antimicrobial use. (IB) Implement systems (e.g., CPOE, susceptibility report comment, pharmacy or unit director notification) to prompt clinicians to use the appropriate agent and regimen for the given clinical situation. (IB) Provide clinicians with antimicrobial susceptibility reports and analysis of current trends, updated at least annually, to guide antimicrobial prescribing practices. (IB) In settings with limited electronic communication system infrastructures to implement physician prompts, etc., at a minimum implement a process to review antibiotic use. Prepare and distribute reports to providers. (II) Use standardized laboratory methods and follow published guidelines for determining antimicrobial susceptibilities of targeted and emerging MDROs. Establish systems to ensure that clinical micro labs (in-house and outsourced) promptly notify infection control or a medical director/designee when a novel resistance pattern for that facility is detected. (IB) In hospitals and LTCFs: ...develop and implement laboratory protocols for storing isolates of selected MDROs for molecular typing when needed to confirm transmission or delineate epidemiology of MDRO in facility. (IB) ...establish laboratory-based systems to detect and communicate evidence of MDROs in clinical isolates (IB) ...prepare facility-specific antimicrobial susceptibility reports as recommended by CLSI; monitor reports for evidence of changing resistance that may indicate emergence or transmission of MDROs (IA/IC) ...develop and monitor special-care unit-specific antimicrobial ventilator-dependent units, ICUs, oncology units). ( IB) ...monitor trends in incidence of target MDROs in the facility over time to determine if MDRO rates are decreasing or if additional interventions are needed. ( IA) Follow Standard Precautions in all healthcare settings. (IB) Use of Contact Precautions (CP): --- In acute care settings : Implement CP for all patients known to be colonized/infected with target MDROs. (IB) --- In LTCFs: Consider the individual patient's clinical situation and facility resources in deciding whether to implement CP (II) --- In ambulatory and home care settings, follow Standard Precautions (II) ---In hemodialysis units : Follow dialysis specific guidelines (IC) No recommendation can be made regarding when to discontinue CP. ( Unresolved issue) Masks are not recommended for routine use to prevent transmission of MDROs from patients to HCWs. Use masks according to Standard Precautions when performing splash-generating procedures, caring for patients with open tracheostomies with potential for projectile secretions, and when there is evidence for transmission from heavily colonized sources (e.g., burn wounds). Patient placement in hospitals and LTCFs: When single-patient rooms are available, assign priority for these rooms to patients with known or suspected MDRO colonization or infection. Give highest priority to those patients who have conditions that may facilitate transmission, e.g., uncontained secretions or excretions . When single-patient rooms are not available, cohort patients with the same MDRO in the same room or patient-care area. (IB) When cohorting patients with the same MDRO is not possible, place MDRO patients in rooms with patients who are at low risk for acquisition of MDROs and associated adverse outcomes from infection and are likely to have short lengths of stay. ( II) Follow recommended cleaning, disinfection and sterilization guidelines for maintaining patient care areas and equipment. Dedicate non-critical medical items to use on individual patients known to be infected or colonized with an MDRO. Prioritize room cleaning of patients on Contact Precautions. Focus on cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces (e.g., bed rails, bedside commodes, bathroom fixtures in patient room, doorknobs) and equipment in immediate vicinity of patient. Not recommended routinely 74 74Tier 2. Recommendations for In tensified MDRO control efforts Institute one or more of the interventions described below when 1) incidence or prevalence of MDROs are not decreas ing despite the use of routine control measures; or 2) the first case or outbreak of an epidemiologically important MDRO (e.g., VRE, MRSA, VISA, VRSA, MD R-GNB) is identified within a healthcare facility or unit ( IB) Continue to monitor the incidence of target MDRO infection and colonization; if rates do not decrease, implement additional interventions as needed to reduce MDRO transmission. Administrative Measures/Adherence Monitoring MDRO Education Judicious Antimicrobial Use Surveillance Infection Control Precautions to Prevent Transmission Environmental Measures Decolonization Obtain expert consultation from persons with experience in infection control and the epidemiology of MDROS, either in-house or through outside consultation, for assessment of the local MDRO problem and guidance in the design, implementation and evaluation of appropriat4e control measures. (IB) Provide necessary leadership, funding and day-to-day oversight to implement interventions selected. (IB) Evaluate healthcare system factors for role in creating or perpetuating MDRO transmission, including staffing levels, education and training, availability of consumable and durable resources; communication processes, and adherence to infection control measures. (IB) Update healthcare providers and administrators on the progress and effectiveness of the intensified interventions. (IB) Intensify the frequency of educational programs for healthcare personnel, especially for those who work in areas where MDRO rates are not decreasing. Provide individual or unit-specific feedback when available. (IB) Review the role of antimicrobial use in perpetuating the MDRO problem targeted for intensified intervention. Control and improve antimicrobial use as indicated. Antimicrobial agents that may be targeted include vancomycin, third- d generation cephalosporins, anti- anaerobic agents for VRE; and quinolones and carbapenems. (IB) Calculate and of target MDROs (single isolates/patient; location-, service-specific) (IB) Increase frequency of compiling, monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility summary reports (II) Implement laboratory protocols for storing isolates of selected MDROs for molecular typing; perform typing if needed (IB) Develop and implement protocols to obtain active surveillance cultures from patients in populations at risk. (IB) (See recommendations for appropriate body sites and culturing methods.) Conduct culture surveys to assess efficacy of intensified MDRO control interventions. Conduct serial (e.g., weekly) unit- specific point prevalence culture surveys of the target MDRO to determine if transmission has decreased or ceased. (IB) Repeat point-prevalence culture- surveys at routine intervals and at time of patient discharge or transfer until transmission has ceased. (IB) If indicated by assessment of the MDRO problem, collect cultures to assess the colonization status of roommates and other patients with substantial exposure to patients with known MDRO infection or colonization. (IB) Obtain cultures from HCP for target MDROs when there is epidemiologic evidence implicating the staff member as a source of ongoing transmission. (IB) Use of Contact Precautions: Implement Contact Precautions (CP) routinely for all patients colonized or infected with a target MDRO. (IA) Don gowns and gloves before or upon entry to the patient's room or cubicle. (IB) In LTCFs, modify CP to allow MDRO-colonized/infected patients whose site of colonization or infection can be appropriately contained and who can observe good hand hygiene practices to enter common areas and participate in group activities When active surveillance cultures are obtained as part of an intensified MDRO control program, implement CP until the surveillance culture is reported negative for the target MDRO (IB) No recommendation is made for universal use of gloves and/or gowns. ( Unresolved issue) Implement policies for patient admission and placement as needed to prevent transmission of the problem MDRO. (IB) When single-patient rooms are available, assign priority for these rooms to patients with known or suspected MDRO colonization or infection. Give highest priority to those patients who have conditions that may facilitate transmission, e.g., uncontained secretions or excretions . When single-patient rooms are not available, cohort patients with the same MDRO in the same room or patient-care area. (IB) When cohorting patients with the same MDRO is not possible, place MDRO patients in rooms with patients who are at low risk for acquisition of MDROs and associated adverse outcomes from infection and are likely to have short lengths of stay. ( II) Stop new admissions to the unit or facility if transmission continues despite the implementation of the intensified control measures. (IB) Implement patient.-dedicated use of non-critical equipment (IB) Intensify and reinforce training of environmental staff who work in areas targeted for intensified MDRO control. Some facilities may choose to assign dedicated staff to targeted patient care areas to enhance consistency of proper environmental cleaning and disinfection services (IB) Monitor cleaning performance to ensure consistent cleaning and disinfection of surfaces in close proximity to the patient and those likely to be touched by the patient and HCWs (e.g., bedrails, carts, bedside commodes, doorknobs, faucet handles) (IB). Obtain environmental cultures (e.g., surfaces, shared equipment) only when epidemiologically implicated in transmission (IB) Vacate units for environmental assessment and intensive cleaning when previous efforts to control environmental transmission have failed (II) Consult with experts on a case-by-case basis regarding the appropriate use of decolonization therapy for patients or staff during limited period of time as a component of an intensified MRSA control program (II) When decolonization for MRSA is used, perform susceptibility testing for the decolonizing agent against the target organism or the MDRO strain epidemiologically implicated in transmission. Monitor susceptibility to detect emergence of resistance to the decolonizing agent. Consult with microbiologists for appropriate testing for mupirocin resistance, since standards have not been established. Do not use topical mupirocin routinely for MRSA decolonization of patients as a component of MRSA control programs in any healthcare setting. (IB) Limit decolonization to HCP found to be colonized with MRSA who have been epidemiologically implicated in ongoing transmission of MRSA to patients. (IB) No recommendation can be made for decolonization of patients who carry "}
