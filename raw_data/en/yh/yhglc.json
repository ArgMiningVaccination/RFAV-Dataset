Price, ScM2, and Eric S. Weintraub, MPH1 Objective To evaluate the association between autism and the level of immunologic stimulation received from vaccines administered during the rst 2 years of life. Study design We analyzed data from a case-control study conducted in 3 managed care organizations (MCOs) of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 752 control children matched on birth year, sex, and MCO. In addition to the broader category of ASD, we also evaluated autistic disorder and ASD with regression. ASD diag- noses were validated through standardized in-person evaluations. Exposure to total antibody-stimulating proteins and polysaccharides from vaccines was determined by summing the antigen content of each vaccine received, asobtained from immunization registries and medical records. Potential confounding factors were ascertained fromparent interviews and medical charts. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess associations betweenASD outcomes and exposure to antigens in selected time periods. Results The aOR (95% CI) of ASD associated with each 25-unit increase in total antigen exposure was 0.999 (0.994-1.003) for cumulative exposure to age 3 months, 0.999 (0.997-1.001) for cumulative exposure to age 7months, and 0.999 (0.998-1.001) for cumulative exposure to age 2 years. Similarly, no increased risk was found for autistic disorder or ASD with regression. Conclusion In this study of MCO members, increasing exposure to antibody-stimulating proteins and polysac- charides in vaccines during the rst 2 years of life was not related to the risk of developing an ASD. (J Pediatr 2013;163:561-7) . The initial concerns that vaccines may cause autism were related to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine1and thimerosal-containing vaccines.2In 2004, a comprehensive review by the Institute of Medicine concluded that the evidence favors rejection of possible causal associations between each of these vaccine types and autism.3Nonetheless, concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persist,4with the latest concern centering on the number of vac- cines administered to infants and young children.5A recent survey found that parents' top vaccine-related concerns included administration of too many vaccines during the rst 2 years of life, administration of too many vaccines in a single doctor visit, and a possible link between vaccines and learning disabilities, such as autism.6All of the foregoing concerns were reported by 30%-36% of all survey respondents, and were reported by 55%-90% of parents who indicated that their children would receive some, but not all, of the vaccines on the recommended schedule. Another recent survey found that more than 10% of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations, with most believing that delaying vaccine doses is safer than providing them inaccordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended vaccination schedule. 7 Using the number of antibody-stimulating proteins and polysaccharides contained in vaccines as a measure, we evaluated the association between the level of immunologic stimulation received from vaccines during the rst 2 years of life and the risk ofdeveloping an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including specic ASD subtypes. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of publicly available data from a case-control study designed to examine potential associ-ations between exposure to thimerosal-containing injections and ASD. 8The study was conducted in 3 managed care or- ganizations (MCOs). Data sources for the original study included MCO computerized data les, abstraction of biological mothers' and children's medi- cal charts, and standardized telephone interviews with biological mothers. Casechildren underwent standardized in-person assessment to verify case status.From the1Immunization Safety Ofce, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA and 2Abt Associates Inc, Bethesda, MD Funded by a contract from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to America's Health InsurancePlans (AHIP), and by subcontracts from AHIP to AbtAssociates, Inc.

For each of 3 age ranges (birth to 3 months, birth to 7 months, and birth to 2 years), we evaluated the associations between the total cumulative exposure to antibody- stimulating proteins and polysaccharides from childhoodvaccinations and 3 outcomes: ASD, autistic disorder (AD),and ASD with regression. We also evaluated associationswith the maximum number of antigens to which a childwas exposed in a single day. Study-eligible children were: (1) born between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1999; (2) had been continuously enrolled in the MCO from birth until their second birthday; and (3) were currently enrolled at the time of sample selec-tion. The children were aged 6-13 years at the time of datacollection. Parents provided written consent for study par-ticipation. Children were excluded who had any the follow-ing medical conditions with known links to ASD traits:fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Rett syndrome, con-genital rubella syndrome, or Angelman syndrome. Control children were selected at random from the MCO popula- tions to match cases within matching strata dened by birthyear, sex, and MCO. Potential cases were identied by searching the MCO com- puterized records for relevant International Classication of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for ASD (299.0-ASD or 299.8-PDD NOS), supplemented by text string searches at1 MCO and by text strings and autism registries at another. Mothers of case children were administered the Autism Diag- nostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), 11and case children were assessed directly by trained assessors using the Autism Diag-nostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). 12 ASD consists of qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal so- cial interactions and communication, along with restrictive,repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Childrenmeeting study criteria for ASD had ADOS scores indicating abnormalities in all 3 areas and had ADI-R scores indicating abnormalities in reciprocal social interactions and eithercommunication or patterns of behavior. The children meet-ing study criteria for AD were a subset of children with ASDwho had higher scores on all 3 areas of the ADOS, ADI-Rscores indicating abnormalities in all 3 areas, and onset be-fore age 36 months. Using items from the ADI-R, ASDwith regression was dened as the subset of children with ASD who reported loss of previously acquired language skills after acquisition. Assessors were blinded to the vaccinationhistories of study children. To reduce the likelihood that the control group included children with undiagnosed ASD, the Lifetime form of theSocial Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) 13was admin- istered as part of the maternal interview in children withsigns of neurodevelopmental difculties. Seven control group children with an SCQ score >15 were excluded from the analysis.We obtained the children's vaccination histories from computerized immunization tracking systems and abstractedmedical charts. We adapted published data on the antibody-stimulating proteins and polysaccharides content of selectedvaccines 14,15to determine the antigen loads in the various vaccines ( Table I). We evaluated antigen exposure for 3 age ranges according to 2 measures: cumulative exposure to antigens within the specied age range and the maximum number of antigens re- ceived in a single day within the specied age range. Datawere collected on a large number of covariates, includingchild and family characteristics, maternal exposures duringpregnancy, childbirth conditions, early childhood healthconditions, and maternal healthcare-seeking behavior (ie,Kotelchuck prenatal care index, cholesterol, and Pap smearscreenings). 9 For the primary statistical analysis, we t conditional logis- tic regression models to estimate the ORs for ASD outcomesassociated with a 1-unit increase in antigen exposure. To fa-cilitate interpretation of the results, we present the estimatedORs for an increase of 25 antigen units (approximately thetotal number of antigens hepatitis B vaccines). We also per- formed analyses in which we categorized antigen exposureTable I.

All tests were 2-tailed, andstatistical signicance was set at P< .05. Results Of 771 potential cases and 2760 controls selected for recruit- ment, 103 cases (13.4%) and 316 controls (11.4%) were deemed ineligible.9Among the remaining 668 cases and 2444 controls, 321 cases (48.1%) and 774 controls (31.7%)participated in all phases of the study. Twelve of the 774 con-trol participants (1.6%) were excluded because analysis ofmedical chart and parent interview data revealed exclusion-ary conditions. In addition, 10 controls were not includedin the analysis because there were no cases in their matching strata. Of the remaining 752 controls included in the analysis, 186 had an SCQ score <16 but had indications of speechdelay or language delay, learning disability, attention decithyperactivity disorder or attention decit disorder, or tics,or had an individual education plan. Of the 321 potential case children who participated in standardized assessments, 256 (79.8%) met study criteriafor ASD. Among these 256 children, 187 (73%) met the stricter criteria for AD and 49 (19%) met the criteria for ASD with regression. The children were aged 6-13 years at the time of data col- lection, and the group was 85% male. Birth weight distribu-tions; maternal age, education, and marital status; andpaternal age were similar for cases and controls. 8 The distributions of cumulative antigen exposures for each of the 3 age ranges are shown in Figure 1. For both cases and controls in all 3 age groups, the cumulative exposuresexhibited a bimodal distribution depending on receipt ofwhole-cell vaccines. For example, approximately one-halfof the study children never received a whole-cell pertussis-containing vaccine or a typhoid vaccine during their rst 7months of life, and thus had cumulative exposures of 0-125antigens during that period. In the birth to 7 monthsgroup, children who received a single whole-cell pertussis- containing vaccine (and possibly other vaccines) had cumulative exposures of 3000-3250 antigens, those whoreceived 2 of 9000-9250 antigens. In thebirth to 2 years group, cumulative antigen exposures were0-311 in children who received no whole-cell pertussis or typhoid vaccines and 3000-15 250 in those who received 1 or more whole-cell vaccines. Maximum antigen exposures on a single day also exhibited a bimodal distribution depending on receipt of whole-cellpertussis or typhoid vaccines ( Figure 2 ). In the birth to 7 months group, no child received more than 1 whole-cellpertussis-containing vaccine (or typhoid vaccine) ina single day; thus, no child was exposed to more than 3320 antigens in a single day. In the birth to 2 years group, 1 control child received a whole-cell pertussis-containingvaccine, a typhoid vaccine, and other vaccines in a singleday, resulting in a maximum single-day exposure of 6112antigens. In the regression models, the risk of acquiring an ASD was not associated with total antigen exposure at birth to 3months, birth to 7 months, or birth to 2 years ( Table II ). In the analyses with exposure categorized at 3 levels, the ORs all had 95% CIs that overlapped 1.0 (ie, were not statistically signicant). The ORs for a 25-unit increase invaccine antigen exposure, analyzed as a continuous variableand adjusted for several potential confounding variables,also revealed no signicant increase in the risk of variousASD outcomes with increasing vaccine antigen exposure.Moreover, the risk of ASD was not associated withmaximum antigen exposure on a single day ( Table III ). In a previous analysis, 8we found that thimerosal exposure during certain time periods was associated with a decreasedrisk for some ASD outcomes; thus, we performed additionalanalyses in which thimerosal exposure was included asa covariate, and found little change from the resultspresented in Tables II and III(data not shown). Because the antigen content of whole-cell pertussis- containing vaccines is much greater than other vaccines, we performed further analyses according to the number of whole-cell pertussis vaccine doses received. These analy-ses adjusted for the same covariates included in the 25-antigen increase models presented in Tables II and III. We found no statistically signicant associations betweennumber of whole-cell pertussis vaccine doses receivedbetween birth and age 2 years and any of the ASDoutcomes; ORs (95% CI) for each increase of 1 whole-cell pertussis vaccine dose were 0.956 (0.793-1.152) for ASD, 0.989 (0.700-1.397) for AD, and 0.761 (0.380-1.525) forASD with regression. Discussion We found no evidence indicating an association between ex-posure to antibody-stimulating proteins and polysaccharides contained in vaccines during the rst 2 years of life and the risk of acquiring ASD, AD, or ASD with regression. Wealso detected no associations when exposures were evaluatedas cumulative exposure from birth to 3 months, from birth to7 months, or from birth to 2 years, or as maximum exposureon a single day during those 3 time periods. These results in-dicate that parental concerns that their children are receivingtoo many vaccines in the rst 2 years of life or too many vac- cines at a single doctor visit are not supported in terms of an increased risk of autism. The present study evaluated the level of immunologic ex- posure from vaccines and the risk of autism. Smith andWoods 16reported nding no association between the total number of infant vaccinations and several neurodevelop-mental outcomes, but that study did not include autism.Their analysis implicitly assumed that all vaccines have equivalent antigenic loads. Oft et al 15proposed that a more complete assessment of the antigenic content ofAugust 2013 ORIGINAL ARTICLES Increasing Exposure to Antibody-Stimulating Proteins and Polysaccharides in Vaccines Is Not Associated with Risk of Autism563vaccines should take into account all of the antibody- stimulating proteins and polysaccharides in each vaccine, which is the approach that we took in the present study. Admittedly, this approach assumes that all proteins andpolysaccharides in a vaccine evoke equivalent immuneresponses, whereas some proteins actually may be more likelythan others to stimulate an immune response. 14Moreover, the calculations do not take into account the number ofepitopes per antigen or the immunologic strength of eachepitope. Nonetheless, we believe that our estimates provide a valid relative ranking of the antigen content of vaccines.The immunization schedule in effect during the years in which our study children were vaccinated included some,such as diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis, that were cruder and more antigenic than current vaccines, andalso caused more side effects. Removal of whole-cell pertussisvaccine from the childhood vaccination schedule has sub-stantially decreased the antigenic load from vaccines. Thus,even though the routine childhood schedule in 2012 containsseveral more vaccines than the schedule in the late 1990s, 17 the maximum number of antigens to which a child could be exposed by age 2 years was 315 in 2012, compared with0 1 02 03 04 05 0Birth to 6258 9000 to 9258 15 000 to 15 258 12 000 to 12 258 18 000 to 18 258 Total Cumulative Immunogens01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0Birth to 7 MonthsPercent 0120182523 9000 to 9258 12 000 to 12 258 15 000 to 15 258 18 000 to 18 258 Total Cumulative Immunogens01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0Birth to 2 YearsPercent 00 0 1 01 11 002525 18 13 9000 to 9258 12 000 to 12 25815 000 to 15 258 18 000 to 18 258 Total Cumulative Immunogens Figure 1.

Our results cover a broader range of vaccine antigen exposures than the typical child would be exposed to today, and thus our results provide rel-evant data for the current immunization schedule. In addition to our measures of antigen content, the origi- nal study from which our analysis is derived had several otherstrengths. State-of-the-art assessment tools, including in-person observational assessments of case children, wereused to validate diagnoses of ASD and subtypes of ASD. Data on childhood immunizations were derived from com-puterized immunization tracking systems and medical chartdata sources and thus were not susceptible to recall bias. Extensive information on potential confounding factorswas collected, and these factors were controlled for in theanalysis. However, measures of prenatal and infant exposureto a number of risk factors were obtained from maternalinterviews, and differential recall might have affected adjust-ments for potential confounding variables. This is a minorconcern, given that covariate adjustment had little impact on the results.0 1 02 03 04 05 0Birth to 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0Birth to 7 MonthsPercent4038 One Day01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0Birth to 2 YearsPercent 11 22 in One Day Figure 2. Distribution of maximum antigen exposure in a single day among ASD cases and controls, by age range.August 2013 ORIGINAL ARTICLES Increasing Exposure to Antibody-Stimulating Proteins and Polysaccharides in Vaccines Is Not Associated with Risk of Autism565Knowledge that a child had ASD would not likely have influenced the choice of vaccines, considering that none of the case children had an ASD diagnosis by age 7 months and few had a diagnosis before age 2 years. Some of thecase children, however, might have exhibited indications ofneurodevelopmental problems well before receiving anASD diagnosis. How evidence of early neurodevelopmentaldelays would have affected our results is not clear; it mighthave resulted in lower vaccination levels if parents were con-cerned about vaccinating their children, or possibly higher vaccination levels through more frequent contact with the healthcare system. A potential limitation of this study is the possibility that socioeconomic factors could be related to both receipt of vac-cines and evaluations for an ASD diagnosis. Differences in so-cioeconomic factors likely did not confound our results,however, given that all children were members of MCOs inwhich routine infant and childhood immunizations were a covered benet. Moreover, we adjusted for numerous socioeconomic factors. Another potential concern is thatchildren who had an older sibling with autism might havebeen less likely to receive vaccinations because their parentswere aware of the speculative link between vaccines andautism. 18Only 5% of ASD cases and 2% of controls had an older sibling with autism,10and the results were not changed when these children were excluded from the analysis (data not shown). Considerations of biological mechanisms should be taken into account when evaluating a possible association between autism and immunologic stimulation fromvaccines early in life.

Beginning at birth, an infant is exposed to hun- dreds of viruses and other antigens, and it has been esti-mated that an infant theoretically could respond tothousands of vaccines at once. 15The possibility that im- munologic stimulation from vaccines during the rst 1-2years of life could be related to the development of ASDis not well supported by the known neurobiology of ASD, which tends to be genetically determined with ori- gins in prenatal development, 19-22although possible effects in early infancy cannot be ruled out completely. It can beargued that ASD with regression, in which children usu-ally lose developmental skills during the second year oflife, could be related to exposures in infancy, includingvaccines; however, we found no association between expo-sure to antigens from vaccines during infancy and the de- velopment of ASD with regression. n We thank Dr Paul Oft for his assistance in determining the antibody- stimulating protein and polysaccharide content of specic vaccines.
