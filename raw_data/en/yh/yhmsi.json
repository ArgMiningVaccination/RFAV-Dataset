It is also aims to enable readers to make informed decisions about the treatment options they wish to pursue. This guide is written and edited by people with personal experience of complementary and alternative medicine who retain a critical attitude to the field. It was produced with the advice of a panel of experts in the field of complementary and alternative medicine. NAM does not advocate the superiority of any form of treatment, whether orthodox or unorthodox. We do advocate the need for people with HIV to be as fully informed as possible when making decisions about treatments, and we recognise that doctors have a key role to play in this process. One of the difficulties faced by many people with HIV and their doctors has been obtaining reliable information about complementary and alternative therapies. We hope that this guide will inform doctors and health care professionals just as much as it does people with HIV. After many years of training and clinical practice it can be difficult to understand therapies which remain completely outside a medical frame of reference. We hope that this guide will give some understanding of the rationale behind the complementary and alternative therapies being used by people with HIV. We also hope that it will promote greater understanding of the role which complementary and alternative therapies can play in the treatment strategies of people with HIV. The need for information Doctors at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital recently reported that 44% of outpatients attending the Kobler Centre were using at least one alternative or complementary therapy, the most popular of which were massage, dietary therapies, reflexology and acupuncture. \"Out of 375 separate treatments, only one episode of one therapy in one patient was reported to have had any harmful effect. Thirty nine episodes of therapy were reported to have had no effect, but the overall majority of therapies (335 episodes) were described as being beneficial.\" They also reported that the clinic plans to work with complementary practitioners to assess the effects of complementary therapies in combination with anti-retroviral treatments. An appreciable proportion of people who answered the AIDS Treatment Update readers survey in Autumn 1993 told us that they were using alternative medicine to complement conventional medical treatment. Many of these people may have come into contact with complementary and alternative medicine for the first time through HIV clinics and support groups, a large number of which now offer alternative therapies. Appropriate terminology In recent years there has been some debate about the terms that should be used to describe the therapies covered in this guide. We have used the phrases corr.nementary and alternative simply to describe how the therapy is used in relation to Western/orthodox medicine: either to assist or to replace it. We have used the term holistic to describe an approach to the patient which takes into account the mind, body and spirit in explaining the source of illness, making a diagnosis and offering treatment. Any form of medicine can be practiced in a holistic way. Complementary and alternative medicine is often described as holistic medicine, but orthodox medicine can be practiced in a holistic way too. The holistic approach to health and disease is one which pays attention to the role which the mind, body, spirit and emotions have in the development of illness and in healing. We have used the terms patient, client and participant as appropriate to the context. Different perspectives on health and disease One of the misgivings which many people have about complementary and alternative medicine concerns the differing views of the human body and the sources of disease on which such therapies are based. Such views often strike people as mystical and lacking in any solid scientific basis. The chief difference between conventional and alternative forms of medicine is the notion of 'energy' or 'life-force', a concept that is alien to Western medicine because it is unmeasurable. Scientific methods cannot detect the meridians of qi in Chinese medicine, the auras detectable by healers or the active agent in a highly diluted homoeopathic remedy, but large numbers of practitioners and patients are untroubled by this problem and continue to use these therapies successfully. All these forms of energy are taken for granted in alternative forms of medicine, and it has been argued that Western scientific methods are only just beginning to get to grips with these concepts as the fields of quantum physics, chaos and complexity theory begin to develop new ways of thinking about energy and matter. It can also be puzzling to encounter so many different explanations of the way in which the human body works and its ailments relieved. Acupuncturists look for signs in the pulses and the tongue and then place needles in points which from a doctor's point of view have nothing to do with the place where the pain is present. Reflexologists seek to relieve problems by using the feet 2 INTRODUCTION [Page 3](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/7?q1=directories) as a key to identifying the body's ailments. Homoeopaths use minute doses of medicines which should not, by all the laws of orthodox science, have any detectable effect on the human body. In recent years there has been a great deal of debate over the ways in which the validity of alternative forms of medicine can be proved, as demand increases amongst patients for the availability of complementary therapies through the NHS. Doctors may still say that until the safety and effectiveness of therapies are proved they are not happy to refer patients to complementary therapists and remain uncertain of the potential benefits to their patients. The lack of research Orthodox scientific methods and orthodox medicine have developed alongside each other over hundreds of years. Painstaking observation, experimentation and deduction have been the mainstays of the scientific and medical tradition and they have given us an elaborate knowledge of the human body and its processes. Orthodox scientific methods have developed very rigorous standards for proving that treatments work, that organisms cause disease and that if patients recover or become sicker it is as a consequence of the treatment rather than some other factor. Research is now beginning to develop into the complementary and alternative therapies with a view to proving their effectiveness. Although complementary and alternative medicine has been labelled anti-scientific by some critics, it is not by its nature opposed to scientific methods such as trials and rigorous observation. Some of these studies attempt to compare complementary treatments with orthodox treatments; others compare complementary treatments with a placebo. Wherever research of relevance to HIV-positive people has already been conducted, we have described it in the A-Z of therapies. The few trials which have been conducted into the efficacy of complementary treatments in HIV and AIDS have been conducted by individual hospitals, which means that they tend to be small studies. As a consequence, reports of these studies invariably conclude: \"More research is needed in this area to verify these results\". Unfortunately the chances of such research taking place on a large scale remains fairly small owing to the way in which treatment research is organised. It remains largely funded by drug companies, which have no financial incentive to invest in trials of non-pharmaceutical treatments which they cannot patent and make money from. Acupuncture, for instance, is a treatment which depends on the skill of the practitioner rather than the ingenuity of a chemist or a researcher for its success. Up to now, such research has been funded by public bodies or private trusts with very limited funds available for such work. Doctors are reluctant to undertake trials of complementary and alternative therapies because they do not use these therapies in their everyday practice and are unfamiliar with their methods. They would prefer to see complementary and alternative practitioners experienced in the use of a particular therapy conducting such studies. There is also considerable difference of opinion on the best way to conduct research into complementary and alternative therapies, and the best methods have still to be agreed upon. In such circumstances it is worth remembering that practitioners of complementary and alternative therapies can take steps to ensure that the benefits of their treatments are properly recorded. The Research Council for Complementary Medicine recommends that if practitioners wish to present evidence of the benefits of their treatment, they need to present basic evidence in the following way: Details of all patients treated. A case report which describes three successes in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma may omit to mention the five cases which weren't helped by the treatment. A report which says that twenty people are healthy after two years of treatment is not enough either. In order to judge the success of a treatment, it's necessary to know what point people started from. Did they have high CD4 counts at the start of the study, or did they have low CD4 counts indicating a high risk of opportunistic infections? A case report needs to give details of everybody treated in order to allow others to judge the success rate using this therapy. If patients don't come back, they need to be contacted and properly followed up too. Just because they fail to return, this should not be taken as a sign that the treatment has been successful. What treatment was given? It's not enough to say that patients were given acupuncture treatment, for instance. A case report needs to give details of the exact treatment, how often it was given and how long for. What were the results? Although it may be difficult to measure the outcomes without expensive equipment, it is possible to track the progress of patients through their medical records and through self-assessment. For instance, patients can be asked to define on a 1 to 10 scale their sense of well-being, level of energy, level of pain or severity of other symptoms at each visit. The Research Council for Complementary Medicine is able to advise on research in this field. The Immune Development Trust is planning research into holistic treatments in HIV, AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis. It is planning to develop a research protocol which can be used in research into complementary therapies. INTRODUCTION 3 [Page 4](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/8?q1=directories) Mind and Body Many people with HIV say that they have gained great benefit, either in terms of symptom relief or improved quality of life and enhanced sense of well-being, from therapies which use the mind to influence the body, or which relax the mind. These include meditation, autogenic training and visualisation. The mechanisms through which the nervous system, conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions influence immune responses are being unravelled by researchers who describe their field of study as psychoneuroimmunology - the study of the relationship between the mind, the nervous system and the immune system. Stress signals are transmitted through the body by several pathways, using neurotransmitters and hormones. Alterations in levels of these hormones and neurotransmitters govern the way in which the body responds to the stressful event. The short-term stress response - the 'fight or flight' response - is our basic response to danger, and prepares us to act quickly. Increased energy is supplied to the brain, the heart and the muscles, the heart beat speeds up, and sweating increases in order to cool the body. This alarm response is short-term and eventually wears off, so other mechanisms come into play to deal with more prolonged episodes of stress. Cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal gland, increases blood sugar levels so that more energy is available. Cortisol also reduces the activity of white blood cells essential in fighting infection. If this stress response becomes repetitive and chronic, it can reduce the ability of the adrenal glands to manufacture the hormones needed and eventually place a strain on the heart, the arteries and general immunity. There is also some evidence that attitudes to illness play a role in determining the course of an illness. In 1993 The Lancet published the findings of American research into Chinese-Americans' beliefs about their prognosis following diagnosis with cancer. The study was designed to investigate whether beliefs about illness might affect survival. In Chinese folklore, the year of birth is linked with one of five elements: earth, fire, water, metal or wood. Each element is linked to an organ system and its diseases, so that fire is linked with heart diseases and earth with tumours, including cancer. In China it is thought that people born in earth years are especially susceptible to cancer. The study compared Chinese-Americans diagnosed with the same types of cancers at the same time, and found that those who knew that they had been born in unfavourable earth years tended to die months or even years before those born in other years. Those Chinese-Americans born in earth years also died more quickly than non-Chinese Americans born in earth years. The same was true of heart disease patients born in fire years and those with chest diseases born in metal years. This study suggests that widely held beliefs about the course of an illness can become self-fulfilling prophecies. The effect of positive thinking and personality on the course of illness is disputed amongst researchers, but all researchers are agreed upon the power of the human mind to cause physical responses to what it believes to be an effective treatment. Scientists call this effect the placebo effect, and a placebo is used in many clinical trials in order to determine whether there is a greater response to a treatment which contains an active drug than there is to an inactive imitation drug. Sometimes placebo effects can be quite startling. In one controlled study by the British Stomach Cancer Group, 30% of the placebo group lost their hair and 56% of the group suffered nausea or vomiting, all side-effects expected to result from chemotherapy. This suggests that belief in the effectiveness of the treatment can produce the positive and negative effects associated with that treatment and that belief - or disbelief - in treatments can produce powerful effects. This may be one reason why some people are so angered by those who question their choice of treatment or produce information which questions the effectiveness of that treatment. The effects of some complementary and alternative therapies are dismissed by critics as 'just a placebo effect'. However, if complementary and alternative therapies do on occasion produce benefits purely through the power of suggestion, this is an effect worthy of further investigation rather than dismissal. The link between the mind and body is seen as crucial to self healing by many holistic practitioners, since each influences the other. Holistic practitioners say that healing emotional problems makes a crucial contribution to healing physical problems, and that emotional disorders can lead to illness. Stress and relaxation Complementary and alternative therapies are sometimes dismissed as 'merely' providing stress relief, as if this wasn't a significant benefit to people with compromised immune systems. Yet as the previous sections show, stress plays an important role in illness, and even if the benefits of a therapy only amount to stress reduction, the therapy is still providing something which is not available on prescription from your doctor. Therapies such as massage, acupuncture, aromatherapy and t'ai chi all have the effect of relaxing the body and the mind. Massage, for instance, reduces levels of cortisol, a hormone connected to stress responses, and some forms of massage may increase levels of naturally occurring opiates. 4 INTRODUCTION [Page 5](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/9?q1=directories) Stress reduction techniques such as autogenic training, meditation and hypnotherapy work by using the mind to relax the body. All these techniques have been shown to improve health problems and lead to an enhanced sense of well-being. Exercise also relaxes the body and reduces stress. In particular, regular aerobic exercise increases the supply of endorphins in the brain and the body, improving mood. The process of consulting a complementary or alternative practitioner may in itself help to reduce the stress of a diagnosis. Many people say that they find the amount of time given by a therapist in itself makes them feel calmer and more able to cope with their symptoms and the implications of their diagnosis. The beneficial effects of feeling that someone is taking care of you should never be underestimated. Further reading Healing AIDS Naturally Laurence Badgeley (Human Energy Press, 1988) AIDS and the Healer Within Nick Bamforth (Amethyst, 1993) Written by an HIV-positive man who has worked as a healer with HIV-positive people for nearly ten years, this book provides meditations for those who want to cultivate their inner healing potential. Magic or Medicine: An Investigation into Healing Robert Buckman & Karl Sabbagh (Channel Four/Macmillan, 1993) An excellent critical examination of the claims of complementary and alternative medicine. Particularly good at explaining the problems which orthodox physicians and alternative and complementary practitioners have in understanding each other's terms of reference, and why so much that passes for 'proof' of the effectiveness of complementary therapies is nothing of the sort. Surviving AIDS Michael Callen (Harper Collins, 1990) A good and balanced investigation of the factors which people believe have allowed them to be long-term survivors of AIDS. Very readable and a source of inspiration to many. A World Without AIDS Leon Chaitow & Simon Martin (Thorsons, 1988) A review of alternative treatments and possible co-factors. Complementary Medicine and Disability Andrew Vickers (Chapman & Hall, 1993) Written by a member of the Research Council for Complementary Medicine, this book is an excellent introduction to choosing complementary therapies. Although written specifically for disabled people, this book contains lots of useful advice for anyone who wants to use alternative and complementary medicine and is by far the best user's guide currently available. Choosing and using a therapy This chapter offers a decision-making strategy that may be useful if you are considering using a complementary or alternative therapy. It looks at a series of issues you may wish to consider when thinking about your needs. When will a therapy be useful? You don't have to be seriously ill to use a therapy. Many people use therapies in order to maintain good health and a sense of well-being in the same way as they have incorporated exercise and diet into their everyday lives. For many people, using complementary and alternative therapies have enriched their quality of life and opened up new perspectives on the world. Many people say that using a complementary or alternative therapy has helped their physical, mental, emotional or spritual well-being at different stages in their lives. In order to know whether you want to use a therapy it may be helpful first of all to do a general health assessment. In this you should take stock of both your physical and emotional state of being. What physical problems do you want to relieve? What emotional problems do you want to deal with? Holistic therapy is as much concerned with the mind and the emotions as it is with the body. Think about yourself, your relationships with other people and your ability to manage stress. It may be useful to talk to a friend or a counsellor and identify sources of stress and dissatisfaction in your life. You may already have a feeling as to whether therapeutic interventions might be of use. It's important to consider your emotional symptoms alongside the physical symptoms. You may find that stressful situations simply can't be avoided. If you feel distressed or unable to cope with a physical problem, you may find that a complementary therapy has as much to offer in terms of enabling you to feel calmer and more able to cope as it does in terms of symptom relief. You may find that you simply have more energy to look after yourself. Taking care of yourself is often an important part of the healing process. Finding the appropriate therapy Your choice of therapy may be influenced by a number of factors. Is the therapy available in your area? Will you have to pay for it, or is a concessionary scheme available? Is this form of therapy something I am likely to feel comfortable with? Some people are scared of needles for instance; this may make acupuncture a daunting prospect. Other people may find the prospect of being touched by another person during a massage quite unsettling. For others, a treatment such as CHOOSING AND USING A THERAPY 5 [Page 6](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/10?q1=directories) homoeopathy, which superficially resembles conventional drug treatment, may seem less unfamiliar than other forms of complementary or alternative treatment. You may have particular needs which are not directly related to HIV infection. For instance, you may be an addict. If this is so, you may want to find out what particular therapies have to offer in terms of the treatment of addiction, helping the process of withdrawing from drugs or coping with anxiety and stress after withdrawal from drugs. In London the CORE Trust can provide information on the holistic treatment of addiction and the HIV-related problems of drug users, and a number of centres serving drug users offer complementary therapies in conjunction with the Immune Development Trust. There is also an NHS traditional Chinese medicine clinic in South London which specialises in the treatment of HIV infection, alcoholism and addiction, called the Gateway Clinic. For further details of all these services, see the Contacts section. If you already have one or two therapies in mind then begin looking into those therapies more deeply before you schedule any appointments. Have a look at the A-Z section in this guide if you don't know what a specific therapy might have to offer. Seek out any relevant information. Learn more about HIV/AIDS and orthodox treatments. This will give you more knowledge with which to judge the claims being made about certain therapies and hopefully allow you to make informed treatment choices. Imagine yourself to be a scientific researcher. Do not prejudge or censor information. Try to be objective and stay open to all the options. Become your own expert as you utilize those around you, your friends, other people with HIV, consultants and practitioners. Read the reports on trials, research and statistics. Listen and observe. Note down any information you collect, accompanied by your impressions and feelings on any implications this has for you. Evaluate information. All too often we hear reports of cures or healing achievements, or we hear complementary and alternative therapies dismissed as a confidence trick or even a dangerous fraud. In such circumstances, we need to know to how to establish an unbiased opinion, and where to go for information to help us make up our minds. See Evaluating new treatments for more tips on doing your own research and making up your own mind. Clarifying your treatment aims What are you hoping to gain from a complementary or alternative therapy? The following is a list of possible benefits. Remember that complementary and alternative therapies can meet some of these aims but not neccessarily all of them for any individual. Stress reduction and improvements in psychological health. Many forms of complementary therapy are excellent ways of reducing stress, and often have knock-on benefits such as an increased sense of well-being, greater confidence to make changes in lifestyle and an enhanced sense of control over one's life. Pain relief. Some forms of complementary therapy may provide very effective pain relief. Acupuncture is one example of a therapy with a good record of relieving certain sorts of pain. Treatment for secondary opportunistic problems such as fungal infections which are causing discomfort or pain. Many less serious infections can also be controlled with complementary forms of treatment, some of which have been tested and shown to be just as effective as standard drug treatments. Fungal infections, skin problems and night sweats are an example of the problems which herbalists, acupuncturists and homoeopaths say they have considerable success in relieving. Treatment to prevent the development of opportunistic infections such as PCP pneumonia. It is difficult to prove that any forms of complementary or alternative medicine prevent opportunistic infections because studies have not been done to compare people who receive orthodox medication with those who use alternative treatment regimes such as naturopathy. Complementary and alternative practitioners say that by improving the overall level of health of an individual, their treatment may enhance immunity and reduce the likelihood of opportunistic infections. Any doctor will routinely take the view that to abandon practices such as prophylaxis against PCP with drugs such as Septrin or aerosolised pentamidine is extremely ill-advised. Treatment to replace conventional medication which is not effective and/or too toxic. Practitioners, unless medically qualified and in charge of your treatment, should not be recommending you to come off any prescribed drugs. You are of course ultimately responsible for any decisions you take regarding your health care, but if you decide to stop taking a drug you should consult your doctor first. A significant minority of HIV-positive people nevertheless think that conventional medications may be doing more harm than good. For example, there is widespread resistance to the use of drugs such as AZT because of possible severe side-effects (which tend to occur more frequently in people who are already symptomatic). Many people turn to complementary and alternative forms of medicine because they distrust the side-effects of conventional medications and believe alternative medicine to be natural and non-toxic. Some forms of complementary and alternative medicine are certainly very safe, but others need to be used with caution. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine for instance employs some herbs which may cause liver problems, so it is 6 CHOOSING AND USING A THERAPY [Page 7](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/11?q1=directories) important that you continue to receive regular monitoring through your doctor whilst receiving such treatment. Treatment to boost your immune system and reduce levels of virus without toxicity. Although many claims are made for the capacity of complementary and alternative treatments to boost the immune system, much of the evidence is sketchy and confined to laboratory studies or very small trials, so embarking upon the use of some substances or therapies in the hope that they will lead to major health improvements is a significant act of faith. See Evaluating new treatments for more discussion of this issue. Nevertheless there are numerous anecdotal reports of people who show impressive improvements in health, CD4 counts, reduced levels of virus and quality of life after using combinations of alternative treatments in combination with some conventional medications. Problems to consider Your expectations should never be unrealistic. Can this therapy relieve your symptoms or help you cope with them? Can your quality of life improve? Beware of pressures and promises that push a picture of the truth or a dramatic cure. A good therapist will not tell you what to do. They will encourage you to take responsibility for your life. They can help to facilitate what you want to achieve by supporting you in making your own choices. Some therapies may have side-effects, such as making you feel drowsy for the next day or two. Others such as acupuncture or homoeopathy can cause temporary fluctuations in energy. Aromatherapists may recommend that you keep out of the sun after using some oils. Are there any side-effects to the therapy you are considering? Some therapies should not be used if you suffer from certain conditions. For example, if you have varicose veins, lymphatic drainage massage should be avoided. Some aromatherapy oils should be avoided during pregnancy. Autogenic training is not recommended for people with epilepsy. Check such contra-indications before choosing any therapy. People often have fears about a therapy. You may have heard things which make it seem like a difficult undertaking. Typical reservations about complementary and alternative therapies include: it will demand too much of a change in my life; nobody can really help me except doctors; I don't want to start relying on others; I might have to talk about my feelings with strangers; will I seem weak if I can't stick with it? These feelings are not unusual, but most people find that they recede once they begin to learn about the therapy. If you have any reservations before beginning a therapy, talk to a friend or discuss your reservations with the therapist. Begin the therapy with an agreement to have a few sessions to check out what the experience is like for you. Combining conventional treatments and complementary therapies Most HIV-positive people who use complementary or alternative forms of medicine do so whilst also receiving orthodox forms of treatment. For example, you may choose to take AZT whilst also taking vitamin supplements in the belief that these may reduce the side-effects, and employing a number of stress reduction therapies such as massage, aromatherapy and meditation alongside these options. Another example is someone who isn't receiving any anti-retroviral drug treatment, but who is receiving prophylaxis against PCP whilst also using Chinese herbal treatments for possible immune enhancing effects and treatment of symptoms such as thrush. A third example is someone who has been receiving chemotherapy for KS along with anti-retroviral drug treatment, and who is suffering from peripheral neuropathy. This person is also using massage and aromatherapy with the aim of relieving the pain in the hands and feet caused by the neuropathy. Virtually everyone using complementary and alternative therapies has constructed their own programme, which often requires doing some research but ultimately trying things out to see if they prove beneficial. Informing doctors and therapists If you have decided to include complementary therapies in your health care, a good working relationship with a doctor can maximise the benefits you get from therapies. Your doctor will be able to monitor your progress and advise you of current medical opinion on drug treatment. Being open about the therapies you are using and establishing a good understanding with your doctor about the part these therapies play in your health care cuts down the amount of stress you face. Of course some doctors may have a negative response to your use of complementary and alternative therapies. This may be because the doctor has not had time to research the therapy fully enough to support you in that choice, so presenting the fruits of any research you have done on the therapy you have chosen may help to improve understanding between you. However, you should also be prepared to listen to your doctor's doubts as part of the process of gathering information about the therapy. If you decide to use a therapy or treatment despite your doctor's scepticism, there are three possible outcomes. If you benefit from the therapy, your positive experience may make your doctor more open to such an approach in the future. You may simply agree to differ, but this can be stressful, especially if you need support whilst ill or wish a therapist to visit you in hospital. Or you may decide to change your doctor, if you have a choice of potential doctors in your area. When combining complementary treatments with orthodox treatment, it is important to keep both your doctors and your complementary practitioners informed CHOOSING AND USING A THERAPY 7 [Page 8](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/12?q1=directories) of the treatments which you are receiving, in order that any possible adverse effects of these treatments can be taken into account when diagnosing symptoms. For instance, there is a chance that interactions may occur between orthodox drug treatments and herbal treatments which you are using (even herbal treatments you buy for yourself). It can be sometimes be difficult to tell your doctor that you are using complementary therapies if you have heard your doctor expressing negative views about the therapy. It may also seem difficult to tell a therapist that you are continuing to using conventional medications when you have heard that therapist express disapproval of that drug treatment. A good therapist will respect your personal choice, although he or she may present additional information to explain why the drug might be harmful. It may be that you were not fully informed of possible side-effects, or that you did not take responsibility for finding out yourself what the effects of a drug might be. Remember that whilst some complementary and alternative therapists take the view that orthodox medications may at times contribute to illness, you do not have to adopt this view in order to gain benefits from complementary therapies. Decide each case on its merits, and be prepared to re-assess your ideas. Demand to see proof of the alleged adverse effects of any drugs - it is just as easy to make an uninformed choice about rejecting medication as it is to make an uninformed choice about using it. The achievement of your goals Monitor and assess your progress with any therapy or combination of therapies. It is a good idea to keep a separate diary noting drug dosages, holistic treatments, dietary changes, exercise routines, and most importantly, how you feel physically, emotionally and mentally. Such a diary may also reveal factors that affect your changes in mood and how you're feeling, such as not sleeping well after meals, or an increase in energy levels following certain exercises or dietary changes, or even that particular sorts of relationships leave you feeling confident and loved. Later on, this diary can form a basis for a more objective and accurate review of things which have worked for you when making health care decisions. Recall your original aims upon beginning the therapy and note what you have achieved physically and emotionally. Ask yourself what you feel better about. Notice too what you have not accomplished and how you feel about that. Perhaps your original goals were unrealistic or now seem irrelevant. Perhaps there are things you would still like to deal with. How might you approach that? Explore your reactions to leaving the therapy. Endings stir up complicated feelings in all of us. Your therapist/practitioner is a human being with whom you have develope a special relationship. You may be more emotionally dependent on your therapist than you had realised. 8 CHOOSING A PRACTITIONER Complete your therapy. Tie up any loose ends. Check to see if there's anything to do or say before or during your last session. You might want to review what has happened during your therapy with your practitioner. Finally, say goodbye! Choosing a practitioner Only afew practitioners of alternative or complementary forms of medicine see large numbers ofHIV-positive people. Some practitioners have specialised in treating HIV-positive people, but they are few and far between. Outside London, practitioners experienced in treating HIV and AIDS-related illnesses are rare. The answers a practitioner gives to the following questions may help you decide whether he or she is suitable for you. What is the treatment you offer, and how can it benefit me? You may already have some idea of what form the treatment takes and how it works, but it's always useful to hear from the practitioner about their philosophy and practice. There are considerable variations in philosophy and practice amongst homoeopaths for instance. In every field practitioners will develop their own style of treatment according to their experience with patients. Claims of benefit need to be scrutinised very carefully. Claims that any treatment can cure AIDS completely or reverse HIV antibody status from positive to negative should make you immediately wary. Claims that individual opportunistic infections have been cured should be treated very carefully. See also Evaluating new treatments or therapies What is your experience of treating people with HIV or AIDS? There are three points at which an HIV-positive individual may approach a practitioner: when HIV-positive but without symptoms; when suffering symptoms of immune deficiency, and when suffering from an acute, life-threatening condition. Some practitioners see patients at each of these stages. Others tend to see only those with serious symptoms; on the other hand, some tend to see patients only with minor symptoms. All these factors influence the amount of knowledge a practitioner will have, and what they can offer you. GPs face the same problem. For instance, just because a therapist has had success in treating candida, it doesn't make them an expert on all [Page 9](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/13?q1=directories) HIV-related problems. Candida is a common specialism amongst complementary and alternative practitioners. On the other hand, we are unaware of any cases in which practitioners claim to have been able to treat acute cases of PCP pneumonia. If the practitioner tells you that his or her experience lies largely with HIV-positive people who are well, it can be difficult to evaluate the success of the therapy they are offering. Is it the therapy which is keeping clients well and improving quality of life, or would they have remained healthy in any case? If the practitioner tells you that his or her experience lies largely in treating people with symptoms, ask which symptoms and what difference the treatment generally makes to those conditions. Ask if you can be put in touch with other people who have been treated by this practitioner. A cooperative practitioner will be able to do this without compromising the confidentiality of clients. You will also need to find out what proof the practitioner has that the treatment works. Practitioners may seek to assure you of the effectiveness of the treatment by citing cases of success with other patients. Written testimonials are no substitute for speaking to someone about their experience of a treatment. If the practitioner gives you scientific studies to read, look at them closely. In our experience, many studies used by practitioners to 'prove' the effectiveness of a treatment don't provide sufficient support for the claims or promises they are making. For example, it's commonly claimed that vitamin C has been shown to boost the immune system. A close examination of the data will show that this is based on laboratory studies and studies in non-HIV infected people. Its effects in HIV-positive people have not been studied. Are you prepared to visit me at home or in hospital if necessary? Consider your needs. If you are hospitalised, will this practitioner come to hospital to offer advice and continue this course of treatment? In some circumstances this is possible, although not all doctors and nursing staff are welcoming to complementary therapists. In London the Immune Development Trust runs a home visiting scheme which allows people to be treated at home by practitioners. Details are available on request. The Immune Development Trust also provides complementary therapies services to in-patients and out-patients at a number of hospitals in London. Some hospitals outside London also have complementary therapists as part of the care team. Practitioners may be resistant to visiting patients in hospital because of past experiences of poor co-operation from medical staff, and also because of the time and travelling costs involved. What experience and training do you have for diagnosing symptoms? It's important that your practitioner has a basic understanding of immune dysfunction and knows about the symptoms of AIDS-related illnesses. If they don't have this knowledge, complementary and alternative practitioners may miss symptoms which indicate a declining immune system. A trained and experienced practitioner will notice such symptoms and advise a visit to your doctor. How much do you charge, and do you have a concessionary scheme? Charges vary according to the therapy, but broadly speaking, if you are being charged more than ~50-~60 for an initial consultation, you may be being taken for a ride. Most therapists/practitioners charge much less. An initial consultation is likely to last longer than subsequent sessions. Do not be put off if the practitioner seems to be too expensive. Ask if a concessionary scheme exists. Most practitioners have a sliding scale of charges, but virtually all take the view that the client should pay something towards their treatment even if it is only a few pounds. Free treatment may be available through a local support group or through the Immune Development Trust which has a procedure for screening, training and supporting therapists. There may be a considerable waiting list for such services. The practitioner may also be able to tell you whether this treatment is one for which charities give financial support. If the therapy is being offered free, check the qualifications of the person offering it and whether they are affiliated to an organisation such as the Immune Development Trust. Sometimes volunteers with little training may be offering therapies through support groups in order to gain experience. Free treatment is best obtained from an experienced practitioner. How can this treatment be combined with conventional medication? It's important to tell the practitioner what treatment you are receiving from your doctor. Similarly, it's important to tell your doctor of any complementary treatment you are receiving, so that this can be taken into account when investigating possible drug interactions - or sudden improvement or deterioration in your health. Some complementary and alternative therapies are thought to be much less effective when used alongside conventional medications. For instance, some Chinese herbal remedies may not be as effective alongside certain orthodox medications. This is why it's important to talk to the therapist about the medications you are using. Other therapies may complement conventional medication far more easily. Dietary and nutritional adjustments are an example; supplementation of some vitamins may reduce the side-effects of commonly used treatment drugs. CHOOSING A PRACTITIONER 9 [Page 10](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/14?q1=directories) What are your qualifications? This is an important question to ask, because different professional associations have different standards of training and differing philosophies. The professional associations for the main complementary therapies are listed at the end of each entry in the A-Z section. Membership of a professional association does not always guarantee competence however. Unlike doctors and other medical professionals, complementary and alternative practtioners may not necessarily be subject to disciplinary procedures which can weed out clearly incompetent or unscrupulous practitioners. In fact, most complementary and alternative practitioners work relatively unsupervised and this is why word of mouth recommendation or warning from friends may be useful. Some organisations which provide complementary and alternative therapies ensure that those therapists have professional indemnity insurance. Although claims against practitioners for malpractice are very rare, it is worth remembering that such insurance is also intended to cover a practitioner against accidents on their premises. You should also check whether the practitioner is insured to treat HIV-positive people. A number of companies which provide professional indemnity insurance to complementary and alternative practitioners will not cover practitioners who treat HIV-positive people. Organisations providing complementary therapies such as the Immune Development Trust also provide training and professional support to practitioners, and ensure that practitioners abide by a code of conduct. If you have been referred to a therapist through such an organisation, ask to see details of the code of conduct so that you know where you stand if you have any doubts or complaints in the future. Evaluating new treatments or therapies It can be very difficult to judge the claims which are being made about a new treatment. Unlike conventional medical treatments which tend to be sponsored by drug companies and go through a well-defined process before the drug becomes widely available through the clinic which you attend, complementary and alternative treatments and forms of medicine may come to your attention by completely diferent routes. The commonest routes are through friends who have already tried the treatment or through the testimony of HIV-positive people who believe themselves to have benefited from a treatment. Another route is through alternative medical and health publications, often magazines or newsletters which are not AIDS-specific and which may have little experience of evaluating AIDS treatments. New treatments may be offered by a complementary or alternative medical practitioner already using other methods to treat you, or your doctor may refer you to a practitioner. Past experience may also teach you when a particular treatment is likely to be useful. In all these cases, there are a number of factors to bear in mind when making your decision about whether to begin using this treatment or substance. This chapter also looks at issues to bear in mind when considering the use of drug treatments outside an orthodox setting. Anecdotal reports from friends Although a treatment may have been beneficial to a friend, there's no guarantee that it will benefit you in the same way. The sort of anecdotes which are particularly worthy of attention are those which involve clear improvements in a symptom following the use of a single treatment. If someone is using several different therapies it is unwise to attribute any health imrpvements to a single treatment. Be wary of anecdotal reports supplied by promoters of a treatment. Personal testimonies of benefits are often the only 'evidence' promoters of treatment can produce to substantiate their claims. There is good reason to be sceptical of the value of such reports. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals Although large-scale studies of alternative treatments are few and far between, smaller studies and laboratory studies are relatively easy to perform. This guide summarises information available from those studies, and the limited conclusions which can be drawn from those studies. If you come across treatments which are not listed in this guide, ask for information about studies which have been published in peer reviewed medical journals. It is very easy for people to make claims about treatments and to report those claims in such a way that they seem scientifically credible. It's much more difficult to do that when the report is reviewed by other doctors or practitioners who understand the field. Alternative medical journals exist which have a peer review process and which publish scientific reports and studies of a high standard. These include the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine, many journals of Chinese medicine and acupuncture, and journals of herbal medicine and plant pharmacology. If a practitioner claims that a study 'shows' that a treatment works, ask to see a copy of the study. In our experience, practitioners often draw unwarranted conclusions from research. For instance, many fail to 10 EVALUATING NEW TREATMENTS OR THERAPIES [Page 11](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/15?q1=directories) make the crucial distinctions between a case report and a trial, and between controlled and uncontrolled trials. A case report is simply an observation. It is a report of what happened to a group of people who received a particular treatment. Such a report can often suggest trends, but it doesn't provide the standard of proof needed to say confidently that any improvement in health was due to the treatment in question. The case report may fail to explain what happened to the people who dropped out of the study and it may use average CD4 counts to claim benefits, despite the fact that averages can easily be skewed by one exceptional result. These are common faults of case reports in this field. In order to prove benefit, a doctor or practitioner needs to conduct a trial. This should attempt to assemble a large group of people whose characteristics reflect the diversity of people affected by the condition. A large number of participants protects against the possibility that the results of the trial could be due to chance, and the trial should have exclusion criteria to ensure that all the participants are comparable and that some aren't using treatments which could skew the results. The trial report will also use statistical methods to demonstrate whether the results are 'statistically significant' or whether they could simply be due to chance. A trial may test a treatment or therapy against a placebo, or against a standard treatment with a success or failure rate that is well known, or against an untreated control group. In all these cases it is possible to judge whether the therapy or treatment is better than the standard treatment, or whether it is harmful. Clarifying what the treatment is In cases where you are being advised to take something such as a drug or herbal compound, make sure you know what it is. This may sound obvious, but some of the worst charlatans still claim that they can't reveal all the ingredients of their treatment because they must protect their treatment from greedy drug companies. In truth, it's easy to patent a treatment and thus protect it from theft. If something is being kept from you, how can you make an informed decision about what to put into your body? The price of the treatments Many of the alternative treatments described in this guide are not available through the NHS. Although many practitioners who treat large numbers of HIV-positive people have concessionary schemes, some do not. You may be able to get help from voluntary organisations to help pay for the treatment. Many of the standard drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS-related illnesses are hugely expensive. Drug companies justify these prices by citing the high cost of drug development and research. How does an alternative practitioner justify exorbitant prices? If a treatment is very expensive, ask careful questions about it. Interview the promoter If the treatment is being promoted by one individual, check them out. Complementary and alternative therapies are almost always offered by individuals who are members of professional associations, but if you find that a new treatment is being offered by someone who is not either attached to a hospital or an association of professional therapists, it is advisable to ask further questions. What degrees do they have, and where from? If they claim to have a PhD in microbiology from Harvard University, check it out. A few pounds in phone calls and postage could save you thousands of pounds and lot of disappointment and suffering. Ask what papers they have published and where they have worked in the past. Ask other practitioners or doctors in the field for their opinion on the claims being made by the promoter. Claims based on natural and non-toxic qualities Just because a substance is an organic plant extract, it doesn't mean it's non-toxic. Plants produce very potent poisons, or they may be contaminated with toxins such as lead. The plant may also contain chemicals which interact with other treatment drugs you are taking. A qualified herbalist will be able to warn you of this possibility. Plants may indeed be non-toxic if used in the right way, but inexperienced prescribing or overdosing can lead to violent adverse reactions. In Chinese herbal medicine, prescriptions will sometimes contain toxic herbs with anti-viral and anti-carcinogenic properties which can only be taken in combination with other herbs to reduce those toxicities. Taking such a herb on its own is dangerous. Vitamins are often claimed to be a non-toxic supportive treatment, but taken in large enough quantities, virtually any vitamin or mineral can cause harm. See Dietary and Nutritional Therapies in the A-Z of Complementary and Alternative Therapies for further details. Claims of boosting the immune system The immune system is composed of many different elements. Not all of these are impaired in HIV-positive people. For instance, the ability to produce antibodies is not impaired, so if a substance is described as an immune booster due to its ability to stimulate antibody responses, this is unlikely to be of great benefit in HIV infection. There is considerable debate amongst scientists as to whether stimulating immune responses is a beneficial thing in HIV-infected people. Most immune stimulating treatments are called immune stimulators because they increase the proliferation of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which play a key role in identifying and eliminating infections. Lymphocytes are one of the main cell types to be infected by HIV. Some scientists believe that stimulating lymphocytes infected with HIV to proliferate by cloning themselves may lead to much larger numbers of HIV-infected lymphocytes in the body. However, there are many different types of lymphocytes, not all of which appear to become infected with HIV, and the effects of most immune stimulating treatments on different types of lymphocytes are unknown. EVALUATING NEW TREATMENTS OR THERAPIES 11 [Page 12](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/16?q1=directories) Immune stimulation is a gamble that depends on knowing enough about how the immune system is damaged by HIV and other possible co-factors. At the moment we don't know enough to understand what happens when one component of the immune system is boosted. What knock-on effects will this have? Ask exactly what evidence exists of the immune stimulating potential of this treatment and how it might stimulate the immune system. Ask what evidence exists about the health of people with HIV who have used this treatment for long periods. Talk to a doctor with a good knowledge of immunology, or do your own research. If you decide to use treatments which have an immune stimulating effect, make sure that you continue to undergo regular monitoring by your doctor. If these tests show increasing levels of virus, this suggests either that the treatment is having no effect on preventing viral replication, or that it is actively stimulating replication. Two personal perspectives My use of complementary therapies by John Stevens, Chair of Positively Healthy and editor of PHactPHile, the information resource of Positively Healthy 1992 marked the first time that complementary therapies were addressed in a special session at an International Conference on AIDS. At that conference a range of complementary therapies and treatments were discussed, from N-acetylcysteine, more commonly known as NAC, to Bitter Melon, Vitamin C, exercise, acupuncture and Chinese herbs, to name but a few. The 1993 Conference at Berlin saw this trend continue, a reflection perhaps of the growing recognition within the scientific and medical community that increasing numbers of people with HIV infection and AIDS are using complementary therapies in their personal systems of healthcare and that for those working with diagnosed people some understanding and cooperation is the best approach. No longer is it possible, nor does it make any sense, to ignore the vast numbers of us using alternative treatments. And now, rolling along with the tide of public opinion many medical professionals are recognising that no one system of medicine has all the answers for the ills that beset us, any more than any one doctor can look to 'cure' every problem in every patient every time. It may be that the growing popularity of complementary therapies reflects a loss of confidence in scientific medicine's ability to provide treatments for all the infections associated with HIV infection and AIDS, or that alternative options furnish a sense of empowerment for many patients isolated by Western medicine's mechanistic approach, or simply that we want to keep every door open in our pursuit of good health. Complementary therapies are playing an important and increasing role in our healthcare, for many reasons. Recently a friend confided that he was attracted to acupuncture because it was the one time of the week when he could socialise with other gay men in quiet, calm surroundings, and be flat on his back! Everyone has their reasons, each as valid as the next. Yet acupuncture has many uses, one being its exceptional value in pain management, another its use in stress management; clear reasons to attract people to it. Complementary therapies have been to many a beacon in a dark, turbulent sea providing comfort, hope and in many instances relief from many ailments. There are many alternative and complementary therapies that have been used with HIV infection and AIDS and which, for those lucky enough to live in London, are in plentiful supply. Often the choice can be baffling, particularly if you do not know what they are, and deciding which therapy is appropriate to you at any time can be extremely difficult. At present the Immune Development Trust and the London Lighthouse are the only organisations that provide a pre-session with a practitioner where your current health and diagnosis can be discussed and appropriate therapy options decided. In most other places it is up to the patient to decide which waiting list to apply to. Personally I have tried most of what is on offer and more. Very early on I decided to keep an open mind and approach as many therapies as possible. With no one available to guide me, I just had to learn as I went along. I've tried Reiki massage, Shiatsu, osteopathy, internal and external Chinese medicine, vitamin and mineral therapy, mushrooms, meditation, yoga, acupuncture, crystal therapy, autogenic training, homoeopathy, visualisation and hypnotherapy, cupping, aromatherapy and reflexology. I've been to Mexico for a cleansing herbal tonic, to California for DNCB, and looked to the Philippines for Bitter Melon. What all this travelling and exploring has given me is the knowledge to know what therapy is appropriate for me at any given time. I tend to switch from Chinese medicine to homoeopathy during periods of good health and revert to the former during periods of illness. It's not that I believe Chinese herbal medicine is more effective generally, only that I have a better response to it. In my view it saved my life in 1991 when all other medical approaches failed, so of course I have a great fondness for it. Despite this I do not rely on it as my only treatment but look to use those with which I have had success in the past. Some people tend to make the mistake of using as many therapies as often as they can. I think this misses the point and rather dilutes the total effectiveness of any one therapy. There are also some treatments such as homoeopathy and acupuncture that do not work well together. My use of these complementary therapies developed at a time when very few were available here, and when little was known about them, so most of the information I had either came from overseas publications or from friends 12 TWO PERSONAL PERSPECTIVES [Page 13](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/17?q1=directories) who had already tried and explored the treatment. To an extent this approach still governs my attitude to seeking out new therapies. There is great value in anecdotal information whether it comes from a newsletter or a friend and it's a resource that has always provided me with valuable information about the potential usefulness or otherwise of complementary and experimental therapies. In my experience this route or approach to complementary therapies holds good for many of us, particularly as there are very few guides to help us along. I think it's true to say that a whispering grapevine exists in the HIV and AIDS community down which information travels very fast. Of course we hear of therapies from other sources, such as practitioners or through publications, but nothing works quite as effectively as word of mouth and certainly nothing advertises better than a positive experience. That said, anecdotal information should be enough only to arouse interest. It should not be enough to immediately approach a therapy. The very best information a friend once gave me was firstly to listen, then check it out. People respond to therapies for a variety of reasons, not necessarily because of any intrinsic value of the treatment. One of my biggest mistakes was to swallow Hydrogen Peroxide three times daily without checking cut what it could potentially do to my body. But that was the first and last mistake. Anecdotes are good starting points, but always check the therapy out. There is no guarantee that any specific treatment will work for you. Many therapies such as Chinese medicine and homoeopathy are not easily evaluated according to Western scientific methods and often what we see with our own eyes and the way we respond is the only proof we have of their usefulness. This is fine for those therapies administered by trained practitioners. But many treatments are self administered and, without advice and warning, can be dangerous. Treatments such as DNCB and Bitter Melon which I use and which were reported at the Berlin Conference, along with others currently in vogue in the States, tend to have a clinical background, though not always with HIV (DNCB therapy is reviewed in NAM's HIV/AIDS Treatments Directory). Other, unknown treatments surface and rapidly circulate before rigorous trials are able to determine their benefits and risk, with consequent tragic results, such as Compound Q. This sometimes tends to make it difficult for our doctors to support us in what we do. Doctors like clinical evidence, and tend to view alternative therapies with suspicion because they have not been validated by clinical trials. This is understandable given that some remedies can be harmful or useless, or expensive and expoitative, and they have a responsibility to advise and investigate on behalf of their patients the potential value of alternative treatments. Your doctor may only wish to work within the confines of the British National Formulary and be sceptical of any other therapy or treatment. If you are happy with that, fine, if not then change your doctor. My first practitioner laughed at my pursuit of Chinese medicine and was quite happy to dismiss it as useless. In my opinion the best doctor is one who, provided you can give a rationale for the use of any therapy and you have some understanding of how that therapy is claimed to work, will support you one hundred percent. Of course these are hard to find, but it's worth the effort. Since my 1991 AIDS diagnosis I have worked hard to improve my health. At that time I lost almost one and a half stone and suffered all the problems chronic weight loss brings. Making informed health care choices based on my experiences I have slowly re-built my health and recovered the lean body mass I have lost. Clinically my blood profile has improved, with my natural killer cells, CD4s, CD8s steadily improving, rewards that keep me going. I don't feel good all the time, but then who does? I have outlived the expectations which everyone had for me in 1991, and I expect to continue maintaining my good health. If you are thinking of pursuing complementary therapies because you are curious, or because you wish to exercise more control over your life, or because you wish to minimise the use of drugs, it is important to find out as much as you can, because treatments may be beneficial, they may be harmful, or you may be exploited. All the long term survivors I have known have integrated allopathic and alternative treatments in their systems of healthcare. The regular use of complementary therapies has improved the quality of their life, whether it be a subjective improvement or an improved clinical profile; those who are informed and involved in their treatment programmes tend to do better and maintain our health than those of us who do not. Therapies are available that can mean the difference between life and death and each of us can make a difference to our health. Discovering how to heal by Thomas My story is essentially a simple one of discovering my healing potential and taking responsibility for my health. Apart from colds and hay fever I grew up taking my health for granted. In 1982, whilst studying for A-levals at the age of 17, I started to suffer from stomach pains. My GP said I had inflammatory bowel disorder, and I was prescribed a long-term treatment with Sulphasalazine to suppress the inflammation. I took this drug continuously for five years even though I suffered two relapses, each worse than the last and the second one requiring several weeks in hospital. On the second occasion in 1985 I tested HIV-positive. In 1987 my partner died after having suffered for six months with AIDS dementia, and in the Autumn of that year I became ill again and was diagnosed as having TWO PERSONAL PERSPECTIVES 13 [Page 14](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/18?q1=directories) AIDS myself. By February I was half my body weight, had a T-cell count of 20 and was p24 antigen positive. I looked like the pictures of people with AIDS I had seen on TV. Friends and carers from the THT came to say their goodbyes. I was admitted into intensive care where I finally became so weak I suffered an internal haemorrhage. I was swept into the operating theatre and my family were contacted to tell them that it was unlikely that I would survive the night. During this time I lost consciousness, and several things happened which were to be very important for my future health. The first thing sounds very cliched, but it happened nevertheless. I began to see flashbacks of my past life, not in chronological order but in order of the past situations I had left emotionally uncompleted. These included the fact that I'd not said 'I love you' to my parents since I was a child. The anger I had towards my partner who I loved so dearly but who had died leaving me alone. The bitterness I also harboured because I had contracted HIV from my partner who, behind the laughter and beauty of our love, had never told me that he knew himself to be HIV-positive before we met. The second thing that happened was that I recalled that whilst I had been in intensive care I had 'played' with my life support machine. I recalled slowing and speeding my breathing rate and seeing the numbers monitor the change. I tried counting my heart rate downwards and the machine's figures changed accordingly. I remember my consultant's surprise whilst he was trying unsuccessfully to insert feeder tubes into my neck arteries at the way in which I was able to calm him and myself by counting my heart rate down. By concentrating on the figures denoting the flow of intravenous medication I could increase or lower the flow at will. I also recalled the senior consultant sweeping into my quiet room with an entourage of ten junior doctors to tell me that the suppressive treatment I had been receiving for years had failed, and that it would be necessary to operate. This left me afraid, confused and angry at the doctors for my situation. Why had my doctors all those years ago not told me that the treatment was a suppressive treatment. Why had I never asked what the drug did? Why had I wasted several years in which I could have been treating the cause of the symptoms? Unconscious as I was, I had this feeling of being on a shelf halfway between my life, its memories and pains, and death with all its unknowns. I then started to question the life support machine incident. How had I managed to change its figures? If I had the ability to do that, what other untapped talents did I possess? Could I have the power to heal myself and get better? This questioning was the beginning of my healing experience. My anger and tears had sown a seed of curiousity and creativity. I began to question everything. Why had I never once looked up my illness or the medication given to me in 1982? Why had my GP told me it was a treatment when it was actually suppressing 1 4 TWO PERSONAL PERSPECTIVES the physical symptoms and not treating the cause? Why had I relinquished my power to a doctor who hardly knew me? I stopped accepting as true all information, even from authorities I respected, unless my life illustrated that it was true for me. This change of attitude empowered me to find the patience to start the long process of building my body back to health. I had decided I was going to get better and explore the mental potential I had demonstrated with the life support machine. Like an explorer with an open adventurous spirit, for the first time ever, I committed all my mental, emotional and physical energy to getting healthy again. This body was different though. I was actively building this one up with as much awareness as possible. I was not going to let it happen. I was participating in my own health care for the first time. I began to resolve unfinished business. I let go of the anger and bitterness towards myself and my partner. I told my parents I loved them and asked for hugs from both of them for the first time in many years. I got stronger but it wasn't until I began to live a life other than being a person with HIV that I really started healing. I began to be independent again; I made friends with people who were not my carers, my doctors or other people with HIV; I started work as a volunteer for a worthwhile cause with good job satisfaction; I found new hobbies - painting and gardening; I became interested in politics and complementary therapies; I questioned and re-assessed all I knew and created my own health care programme from an informed position. After a year and a half I became p24 antigen negative and my CD4 count rose to my present figure of 400. These have been constant now for over three years. I have had no primary opportunistic infections since I began to take responsibility for myself, creating my own programme of health care and taking care of myself. I realise that the healing process really began when I stepped out of the physical framework I'd fitted the world to. I don't have the time to confine myself only to that which can be rationally demonstrated and proven. I decided that I could use and benefit from therapies even though they had concepts of energy and matter that were unfamiliar to me. I stopped discounting everything that could not be proven scientifically and I accepted that mystery will be a part of my daily life for years to come. HIV has become part of my history. I haven't forgotten it. AIDS has been part of the most significant period in my life, but I've put it in a context with the rest of my life. I look on HIV now as the catalyst that provoked me to reassess who I am. It is perhaps ironic that once I had an AIDS diagnosis and was at my most vulnerable and ready to give up, it was I who became the opportunist, seizing every opportunity before any rogue disease had the chance to take advantage and kill me!

It is used frequently by people with HIV for its ability to improve well-being, relieve some symptoms and reduce stress levels. See Traditional Chinese Medicine for a full description of this therapy. * Aromatherapy Aromatherapy involves the use of essential oils, which are usually extracted from plants through distillation. Each oil is reputed to have a diferent healing effect on the mind or body and the oils are used in a variety of ways:for massage, inhalation and in baths and compresses. Many ancient civilizations have used aromatic plants therapeutically. The Egyptians are said to have burnt gums and resins to give clarity of mind and the Romans used essential oils for massage. They were burnt and used in the form of infusions in the 17th century against bubonic plague but their current application has only developed since the 1930s, when a French pharmacist, Gattefosse, burnt his hand and, after plunging it into a vat of lavender oil at the perfume factory where he worked, noticed subsequent swift and scar-free healing. His research into the healing properties of other oils was followed by research by Dr Valnet who used essential oils in surgery during the Second World War when antiseptic drugs were scarce. Despite this clinical background, aromatherapy has been marketed in the UK as a luxury therapy associated with the beauty industry and this has held back its reputation as a serious therapy. Recently however it has begun to be used more frequently in hospitals and other treatment ACUPUNCTURE 15 [Page 16](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/20?q1=directories) centres and more research is being carried out into its possible benefits. In France however aromatherapy does have a medical status; in contrast to the UK, where oral prescription is illegal, essential oils do have a clinical, internal use. They are for instance frequently prescribed in place of antibiotics. This difference in approach is partly because the first researchers in France were medically trained. The use of aromatherapy by people with HIV Aromatherapy can be an excellent way of treating stress, promoting relaxation and treating tension pains such as muscle fatigue and other symptoms where there may be an underlying emotional cause. Because the usual method of application is through massage, touch is also extremely important, and psychologically this can help the client to get back in touch with his or her body. An aromatherapist will normally take a full case history at the first session and then prescribe accordingly, but aromatherapy is not a diagnostic therapy. In this country treatment usually consists of massage. Most aromatherapists aim to relax rather than to stimulate and would use light massage and gentle holding techniques. Essential oils are said to have their own energetic properties and will be picked to suit the individual. Rose 'Otto', for instance, is recommended as an excellent oil for detoxification and cleansing. It is believed to dissipate anger, lift depression and energise and open the heart energy centre. It is connected to the heart, self-healing and self love and is also related to the thymus gland. Therefore aromatherapy can work on both an energetic level and a physical/psychological level. Clients tend to come primarily for relaxation, to relieve stress and promote change, rather than for specific conditions. However, some oils are said to be helpful in promoting immune function (tea-tree) and for combatting fungal infections. Essential oils can also sometimes counteract the side-effects of some orthodox drugs such as nausea. Adverse reactions to essential oils The importance of seeing a qualified aromatherapist cannot be too highly stressed as some essential oils are potentially toxic if wrongly administered. Some oils such as myrrh are emmenagogic (will bring on a period) and should therefore be avoided during pregnancy; some, such as bergamot, are photo-toxic so that skin damage may result following exposure to the sun. This is especially relevant since aromatherapy is often on offer from under-qualified individuals at beauty parlours who also provide sunbeds. Some oils may provoke physical symptoms; for instance when a body is detoxifying there may be a headache or flu-like symptoms. Therapists should warn clients that such symptoms could occur. If a client wants treatment for a serious condition, the aromatherapist should get his/her permission to check with the GP. Combination with other treatments Aromatherapy is not recommended for use when homoeopathic treatment is being given as the oils may affect the energy patterns of the remedies. It is suitable for use with most other therapies. Some of the oils are also useful for counteracting the unwanted side-effects of some orthodox medications, for instance the nausea associated with chemotherapy, but it is important that any possible interactions between essential oils and treatment drugs should be checked out with your primary medical practitioner first. It is important that therapists obtain their oils from a reputable supplier. Some suppliers will only supply to qualified aromatherapists. They can, on request, supply a chemical breakdown of the individual oils. Self-help Whilst aromatherapy can be used at home, it is best to seek advice about safe practice from a fully qualified practitioner, as some oils are too potent to be used without supervision. One example of an oil which is used safely for many functions is lavender, which can be used to deal with insomnia, anxiety, headaches, depression and to promote relaxation by dropping one to four drops of oil in a bath or one drop on your pillow at night. It is also said to have good wound-healing properties (five drops in 25ml of mineral water, applied with cotton wool). In massage oil it can help with aching muscles. Finding an experienced practitioner It is important to find a properly qualified therapist as many people offer aromatherapy who have merely done weekend courses. Regulation of aromatherapy is non-existent and there are many different registers of practititioners. Some, such as the Register of Qualified Aromatherapists, demand considerable periods of study; others allow practitioners to call themselves aromatherapists with very limited qualifications. The Institute of Complementary Medicine can advise on the qualifications of aromatherapists. Recommendations for sensitive practitioners from other users at HIV centres can be helpful. Once there, the first session will usually consist of an in-depth consultation about medical history, diet, general health and stresses. The therapist will then make up a blend of oils in a base massage oil which is administered through full body massage. Relaxing music may also be played or the therapist might use relaxing visualisation or breathing techniques. As the therapy aims to involve the client in the process, it is important for the client to be comfortable with the therapist and to feel easy about saying no to any treatment suggestion he/she is unhappy with. 16 AROMATHERAPY [Page 17](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/21?q1=directories) Contacts Aromatherapy Organisations 0455 234345 Umbrella organisation for aromatherapy which aims to establish common standards of training Plant Extracts Advisory and Training Services 7 Elm Court Park, Chelmsford Road, Essex CM4 OSE 0227 822563 Register of 2BD 0273 206640 The Institute provides training in the use of aromatherapy with people who are HIV-positive.

It aims to turn off the stressful 'fight-flight' mechanism in the body and direct the mind and body towards a state of deep relaxation which is an important pre-requisite for healing. The exercises aim to balance the sympathetic nervous system, which is broadly responsible for stress-related symptoms including emotional problems such as anger and anxiety, with the para-sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for relaxation and recuperation. A harmonious balance leads to good health, a feeling of well-being and empowerment. Autogenic training exercises aim to give users control over the mental, physical and emotional aspects of their lives through a series of 'internal commands'. The process also allows the users to get in touch with their own healing powers. In common with all other forms of deep relaxation including meditation, the individual may get in touch with deep, buried, unresolved memories and emotions which may be contributing to their problems and symptoms. But unlike other forms of deep relaxation techniques, autogenic training offers practical exercises to deal with emotions such as fear, anger, depression, anxiety and frustration which may arise as a consequence of autogenic exercises. How it works The training starts with a series of mental exercises concentrating on normal physiological sensations such as heaviness, warmth and cooling, starting in the periphery of the body i.e. the limbs, and gradually working to deeper areas such as the heart, the circulation, the solar plexus and the breathing over the next 7-8 weeks. The solar plexus is said by autogenic trainers to be the junction box and the point of interplay between the sympathetic and the para-sympathetic nervous system. Through other nerves the solar plexus is also connected with the brain and hence with the immune system through nervous, chemical and endocrine systems. The most important concept in AT is the process of 'passive concentration' (as opposed to the normal active concentration, which is aim-orientated). During this process the user repeats the appropriate phrases and watches and feels what is happening both to the specific body part under attention and to the rest of the body, mind, emotions and spirit. As individuals work inward to deep within themselves, they may become aware of emotional or psychological problems which may be contributory factors leading to their symptoms. This is the time when the emotional off-loading exercises come into their own. However, as AT is not a psychotherapeutic technique, the individual may need further counselling if their problems are too entrenched to be resolved by the combination of AT and off-loading exercises. Autogenic training and HIV/AIDS AT's approach to HIV is exactly the same as with any other condition. What is likely to vary is the degree of support required by the individual. Practitioners say that AT can change people's attitude toward their illness and enable them to live fully. You can learn the technique individually but AT is often more effective when carried out in groups as deeper states of relaxation are said to be achieved. Friendship and support can also develop in this context. However, one of its most important functions is to provide the user with an effective tool to empower themselves to take charge of their life. There are specific exercises for stress and fear. In terms of symptom control, AT has specific exercises which are AUTOGENIC TRAINING 17 [Page 18](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/22?q1=directories) directed at specific organs. It could, for instance, help relieve breathing problems associated with PCP. There have been good results in the control of night sweats, diarrhoea and weight loss, according to some practitioners of the technique. The technique may also help in reviving energy or assisting sleep. With the exception of conditions contraindicated below, nothing in the technique can make the disease or its symptoms worse. Contraindications AT is contraindicated in the following conditions: - Psychosis: there may be a motivation problem; deep relaxation can trigger psychotic symptoms; if the patient is on controlled drug therapy (e.g. in a hospital setting) AT could possibly be used. - Insulin-dependent diabetes: exercises may interfere with pancreas and send insulin supply haywire. - Epilepsy: electrical impulses in the brain may be affected. - Alcoholism: AT can bring on withdrawal Time commitment and motivation AT works best when an individual is strongly motivated, with a high degree of commitment towards using self-healing techniques. However practititioners accept clients with many different states of mind, even those who may wish to die. The important thing is to be sufficiently motivated to continue carrying out the exercises which become increasingly pleasurable and relaxing. The main exercise takes 10 to 20 minutes, starting with three 5 minute sessions each day and progressing to two 20 minute sessions each day. The technique is versatile however, allowing you to top-up with short exercises if time is short, but you still need a minimum of one 20 minute exercise per day to keep mind and body in touch.

Further reading Autogenic Training: the effective way to control stress Dr Kai Kermani (Thorsons, 1992) * Bach flower remedies Bach flower remedies are preparedfrom the flowers of wild plants and are primarily used to treat emotional conditions. They were discovered by Dr Edward Bach, who originally trained as a bacteriologist and pathologist before the First World War. On becoming disillusioned with orthodox medicine he became involved with homoeopathy and during his work in this area he became aware of the need for remedies based on the patient's emotional condition. This arose out of his increasing awareness of the patient as a whole being rather than as a set of symptoms and his conclusion that many physical conditions result from negative states of mind, apprehension, apathy or irritability. Abandoning the empirical approach of orthodox medicine, Dr Bach began to work in a more intuitive fashion, concentrating on communicating with flowering plants in order to understand their specific properties. He evolved a method of preparing remedies from 38 wild flower plants. Dr Bach's somewhat esoteric methods, justified in mystical terms, did not enhance his credibility with the medical profession. However, a large number of people, including medical practitioners do use and believe in the the effectiveness of Bach flower remedies. The best known of them is Rescue Remedy which is said to be invaluable in cases of shock and distress for inducing calm and decreasing anxiety. Detractors may feel that these kind of benefits derive from the alcoholic tincture in which the flower essences are held, but it is hard to deny the anecdotal evidence of so many enthusiasts who swear by the restorative powers of the flower remedies. Although Bach flower remedies are sometimes prescribed by herbalists and homoeopaths, they are well-suited to self-help, being harmless and inexpensive. They are available from homoeopathic pharmacies and from many wholefood shops.

Crystal therapy The idea that precious stones and crystals have healing properties dates back to ancient Egypt and elixirs containing precious stones 18 BACH FLOWER REMEDIES [Page 19](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/23?q1=directories) were part of medieval European and Arabic medicine. Like many other esoteric aspects of ancient medicine, the use of precious stones and crystals had astrological significance, but today crystal therapists tend to suggest that the healing power of crystals lies in their energy fields. Crystal therapists say that different crystals have different energy fields or wavelengths, and that these will act upon the human body in different ways. Crystals are said to be highly concentrated energy fields. Many healers who say that they are channelling energy will use crystals as part of this process. See Healing and therapeutic touch for an overview of this form of therapy. Dietary therapies Virtually allforms ofcomplementary and alternative medicine emphasise the role of diet in health. Some, such as naturopathy, make dietary adjustment a central part of the therapy. Broadly speaking, the dietary adjustments proposed by alternative therapists can be divided up into the following groups: - Macrobiotic diets - Anti-candida diets - Organic, wholefood & raw food diets - Dietary adjustments to improve specific symptoms - Micronutrient/multivitamin supplements. The last of these categories is described under the section on Vitamins and minerals. The benefits of dietary adjustments Dietary adjustment has hardly been studied amongst people with AIDS except in relation to the prevention of weight loss. Although this is clearly very important, there remain many unanswered questions about the role of dietary adjustments in alleviating or preventing AIDS-related illnesses. Nutritional status undoubtedly has an effect on immunity. This has been established through studies in different population groups in different parts of the world, and it has been suggested that an important reason for the decline in epidemic, infectious disease during the 20th century in the developed world is not just improved sanitation and improved medical care, but a better diet leading to improved immunity against infection. Many complementary and alternative therapists have views on diet and health which differ radically from those widely accepted by the medical profession. For instance, many naturopaths think that one of the causes of cancer, along with other lifestyle factors, may be an imbalance in the acidity of the body's tissues brought on over many years by eating foods which are too acidic. Cancer specialists dismiss this idea as fanciful. Dietary changes may be particularly attractive because they are one area which is under the control of the individual alone. Changing the way you eat is a far more significant life change than is often imagined; it often requires changes in habits which are deeply engrained, and one of the consequences of a wholesale change in diet may be a subtle re-evaluation of many other areas of life. The often repeated phrase 'you are what you eat' is true on a psychological as well as a physical level and for someone who wants to make a commitment to self-healing, the daily rituals of food preparation can be an important reminder that looking after yourself starts with your most basic bodily needs. Macrobiotic diets Macrobiotic diets are based in Chinese and Japanese beliefs about the need to eat a diet which balances yin and yang energies. Macrobiotic diets have been advocated from the earliest years of the AIDS epidemic and many individuals report that a macrobiotic diet has helped them. The diet consists of balancing the intake of yin and yang foods. Yin foods tend to be fruit, vegetables, pulses, stimulants, fermented drinks and sugary foods. Yang foods are meat, grains, fish and some oriental seasonings. The diet is high in complex carbohydrates and the protein sources in the diet are just as likely to be grains and tofu as meat or fish. Macrobiotic teachers emphasise that the diet can be changed according to an individual's health and needs. Some dietitians have warned that a macrobiotic diet may lack the calories necessary to maintain a stable weight, it may lack vitamin B12 if it excludes meat and that it may be difficult to digest for someone with digestive problems. Macrobiotic teachers say that the diet contains substances such as miso which aid digestion even in people who have digestive problems. The high levels of fibre in the diet may also make it difficult to sustain for anyone suffering from diarrhoea. Anti-candida diets Over the past twenty years an increasing number of complementary and alternative health practitioners have adopted the view that candida albicans, or thrush, is a major health problem and that it is responsible for more illness than is generally accepted by orthodox physicians. Theories about candida remain controversial and are dismissed by many doctors as lacking in strong supporting evidence. Nevertheless, an increasing number of complementary and alternative practitioners make dietary recommendations intended to reduce candida DIETARY THERAPIES 19 [Page 20](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/24?q1=directories) infestation and heal the problems they believe to be associated with candida. Candida is a fungus which proliferates in the gut and other mucous membranes when the resident bacteria become depleted or when immunity declines. These bacteria are said to become depleted in several ways: - Antibiotic treatment: antibiotics kill the resident gut bacteria which control candida growth - Weakened immunity: a weakened immune system is unable to control candida growth - Diet high in sugar and low in fibre is said to allow candida to proliferate Once candida levels increase, a number of problems are said to occur: - The release of toxins into the bloodstream which cause generalised symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety, depression, poor memory, craving for sugar. Candida toxins are also said to disrupt liver function - Hypoglycaemia leading to suppressed immune functions - Damage to the lining of the gut, permitting food and wastes to come into contact with the bloodstream and subsequent allergic reactions - Malabsorption of nutrients due to damage to the gut wall and inflammation - Spread of candida to other sites in the body: in women, vaginal thrush is a particular symptom These views are strongly disputed by most doctors, who say that the only evidence that candida causes severe problems is seen in people whose immune systems cannot keep candida in check. These people will suffer oral and oesophageal (throat) thrush as a consequence of immunosuppression. The effects of candida are one of the sharpest areas of controversy between the medical profession and complementary and alternative practitioners and you are likely to hear strongly conflicting views. In these circumstances you have to make up your own mind. Non-NHS nutritionists will usually recommend that you make every effort to avoid sugar and simple carbohydrates in processed foods such as white bread, white flour, pastry, white pasta and white rice. Alcohol should also be avoided. The anti-candida diet is a type of restricted or eliminative/cleansing diet based on fresh vegetables, lightly cooked whole grains (although wheat is usually excluded) and easily digested proteins such as white meat, fish, free range eggs and pulses combined with grains (brown rice, millet and buckwheat) and yoghurt, but no other dairy products or tofu. Oatmeal is also permitted but fruit is excluded for the first 2-4 weeks and then re-introduced in moderate amounts. Also included are olive oil for its oleic oil content (believed to inhibit candidal growth), garlic (2-3 cloves a day in food) for its anti-fungal action, and Pau d'Arco, a tea prepared by boiling one tablespoon in one cup of water for ten minutes and then drunk on an empty stomach 10-20 minutes before the first food of the day. This is also said to have anti-fungal action. Caprylic acid capsules, propolis and aloe vera liquid are also recommended on occasion to inhibit fungal growth, but their effectiveness is unknown. Foods excluded are mainly those which tend to be contaminated with mould or fungi such as nuts and mushrooms. Also excluded are those which are believed to cause intolerance due to sensitivity, or allergy due to the exposure of complete or partially degraded proteins to the human immune system as a result of a damaged gut lining. These include wheat products and products containing yeast or sugar. Also eliminated are cheese and dairy products, with the exception of yoghurt, tea, coffee, fruit juice, vinegar, alcohol and soy sauce. This diet is fairly demanding and may be difficult to get used to because of the lack of sweet foods, tea and coffee. It may also be difficult socially. Individuals often report feeling worse for 7-10 days, which therapists say is due to detoxification. The effectiveness of this diet in clearing candida problems or preventing their development in people with HIV has never been studied, so if complementary and alternative practitioners claim that this is a proven way to treat candida in HIV-positive people, bear in mind that we only have anecdotes from people who have tried the diet and from practitioners who advocate the diet. Conventional medications such as the -azole anti-fungal drugs are usually fairly successful at eliminating candida and preventing recurrences, but there is a danger that resistant strains of candida will develop or that side-effects such as nauseu, diarrhoea and abdominal pain will make the treatment unsustainable. Whilst many HIV-positive people with candida in the mouth or oesophagus but no other major symptoms report benefits from an anti-candida diet, such a diet may be problematic for someone who is beginning to lose weight. It may not contain high enough levels of carbohydrates either to maintain normal levels of energy and activity or to maintain lean muscle mass. Organic, raw food & whole food diets Naturopathic practitioners advise people to switch to a diet which is high in wholefoods and raw fruit and vegetables in order to avoid augmenting the toxins which reinforce disease states and symptoms and to supply a wider range of nutrients. 20 DIETARY THERAPIES [Page 21](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/25?q1=directories) For people without symptoms this may be a realistic option, but many people with symptoms report difficulty in sticking to such a diet, which may require more shopping and preparation time, more discomfort in eating, and the risk of weight loss due to lack of carbohydrate intake. If a practitioner recommends such a diet, ask for practical examples of foods and recipes that will help you. If the practitioner isn't a good source of tips on how to cook and eat well on this diet, you may find that an NHS dietitian will be able to offer you this form of advice, even though they wouldn't necessarily recommend the diet. Making sure that patients can implement dietary advice on a day to day basis is what NHS dietitians do best, so make use of this service. Ask at your local clinic for a referral to a dietitian if you haven't yet seen one. Dietary adjustments to relieve other symptoms Herpes Arginine is an amino-acid found in chocolate, nuts, beer and pulses. Some amino-acid supplements for body builders contain large amounts of arginine, because it may help stimulate the hormone involved in building muscle. If there is too much arginine in the diet, some researchers think this stimulates the herpes virus. Many people with herpes have long suspected that their attacks are triggered by these foods, but it is difficult to tell if a food triggers herpes attacks when stress and ill-health are also implicated. It has been suggested that lysine may prevent herpes attacks. Lysine is an amino-acid found in dairy products, brewer's yeast and potatoes. Some practitioners recommend lysine as prophylaxis against herpes. Only one study has demonstrated that people who received a supplement of 1248mg/day of lysine suffered fewer herpes attacks than those who received either none or 624 mg/day. Other studies have failed to show a link. None of the studies showed any effect on the severity of the attacks when lysine supplements were given, nor did they show any correlation between arginine intake and herpes attacks. Diarrhoea Any diarrhoea needs to be thoroughly investigated by a doctor who is an HIV specialist. In the meantime there are several measures which can be taken which may reduce the severity of diarrhoea or prevent it from developing in the first place. Much of this advice is common to the medical profession and complementary and alternative practitioners. The risk of diarrhoea may be reduced by boiling all drinking water (do not rely on bottled water, since this has not been tested for micro-organisms), refrigerating and discarding after twelve hours. Commercial water filters may remove some impurities but in themselves do not protect against some of the micro-organisms which can cause diarrhoea in immunocompromised people. Food hygiene is also important: - Don't take chances eating anything which you suspect to be going off; whilst a healthy immune response may be able to cope with the micro-organisms in slightly 'off' food, immune compromised people are less able to keep these bugs in check. - Wash food thoroughly, especially if it is to be eaten raw. - Do not eat re-heated food unless it has been heated to above boiling point and never eat re-heated chicken, pork or foods containing dairy products or eggs. - Avoid take-away food and don't eat in restaurants where you have suspicions about food hygiene. Possible ways of reducing diarrhoea: - Cut down on your fat intake including dairy products (although yoghurt, especially goat's milk, is still alright). - Cut down on insoluble fibre such as bran or brown bread. - Increase your intake of soluble fibre: apple sauce, bananas, oatmeal porridge, potatoes, pulses. - Ensure adequate fluid intake, but avoid drinks which promote urination such as tea and coffee. Water, chamomile, peppermint, blackberry leaf or raspberry leaf tea are preferable. Dilute fruit juice with water; acidic fruit juices are liable to increase diarrhoea. A low residue diet is best: white rice with home-made apple sauce, vegetable soup with pearl barley, cooked peeled potatoes, yoghut, white meat or fish (very fresh and well cooked), poached eggs and white toast (no butter), banana. This restricted form of diet needs to be monitored carefully and shouldn't be sustained for too long. Aim to introduce other foods gradually after two to three days, and note which ones exacerbate diarrhoea. It should be emphasised that this diet is not a cure for whatever is causing diarrhoea; it is a means of symptom control. Prompt and effective treatment for the cause of diarrhoea is always needed to prevent weight loss. If you are at all worried about weight loss, remember that NHS dietitians can prescribe easily absorbed supplemental drinks to maintain calorie, protein and vitamin intake.

Exercise can also improve mood and offer an important way of maintaining a healthy self-image for HIV-positive people. Activities which maintain or even build muscle mass are an important way of minimising the effects of weight loss in AIDS. People with less muscle mass are likely to be more severely weakened by weight loss/wasting, because it is usually muscle tissue that is broken down first in HIV wasting syndrome. Exercise also improves lung function; this may reduce the likelihood of chest infections. Besides popular forms of exercise like swimming, cycling, aerobics, weight training, and running, there are a number of movement-based exercise regimes which help maintain muscle tone and suppleness and which also have meditative or relaxing qualities: T'ai chi is a Chinese form of exercise which uses slow and flowing movement to both discipline and calm the mind, body and spirit. The exercises are intended to centre and direct the qi, the life-force, and many practitioners of Chinese medicine will prescribe gentle t'ai chi exercises to patients as part of a programme of treatment. T'ai chi is probably most familiar to Westerners from films of early morning exercises practiced by Chinese workers, but it is also widely practiced in the West, and T'ai chi classes are available in most parts of the country. Yoga is an Indian form of exercise which is often practiced alongside meditation. It is said to allow the mind to more fully let go of the mundane and the trivial through disciplining the body to accept discomforts. Most practitioners of yoga say that it increases suppleness, improves breathing control and posture, and relaxes the mind, body and spirit. Alexander technique is a form of movement therapy which seeks to correct problems of posture, the theory being that postural problems are related both to other health problems and to stress and mental attitudes. Alexander technique may be of benefit to people with HIV as a form of self-empowerment; many people who have a poor self-image report that their feelings about themselves have been altered as a result of a course of exercise. SHealing and therapeutic touch Healing, sometimes known as spiritual healing, therapeutic touch or the laying on of hands, is a process in which the healer acts as a channel to direct healing energy to the client (known as a healee) in order to stimulate and balance his or her own healing powers. The external energy with which the healer connects is often described as a higher spiritual force. One healer describes the process like this: \"I become the light which comes through me. I don't exist as a person. I have no thoughts but light and energy. True healing takes place when the healer, healee, and the light and love become one.\" Although this may sound rather esoteric and mystifying, we all clearly do have our own healing powers which we take more or less for granted: we assume, for instance, that a cut finger will automatically heal itself. Healing merely aims to develop and extend the healing energies we already possess. Healing is not seen as a substitute or replacement but as complementary to other forms of treatment. Evidence that healing works Healing is often dismissed as a form of trickery which is attractive to vulnerable people, and which provides no physical benefit, merely psychological comfort. Nevertheless many people report physical or psychological benefits as a result of receiving some form of healing and some measurable physical changes and benefits have been noted when healing has been studied. A great deal of research into the efficacy of one form of healing has been carried out by nurses studying therapeutic touch; studies into anxiety have been carried out with groups of patients of all ages with cardiac conditions; separate research into the healing of wounds used volunteers who agreed to receive incisions to their arms (Wirth). In each trial, one part of the group receiving healing from an experienced healer, while the other part received simulated motions of healing from inexperienced people or none at all. All these trials produced positive results (Quinn). Therapeutic touch has also shown to be of benefit in pain relief (Wright). 22 EXERCISE AND MOVEMENT [Page 23](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/27?q1=directories) Another study with young children showed that therapeutic touch greatly reduced the time needed to calm them after stressful experiences compared with those children who received conventional comforting touch (Kramer). Dr Larry Dossey has documented research on healing and psychological states such as meditation and prayer in Healing Words (Harper Collins, 1993). What a healer does The technique can be used for any condition affecting the client at any level of mind, body, emotions and spirit. It is not necessary for the healee to have any religious beliefs for healing to be effective but in order to get the maximum benefits, the healee should be willing to deal with any unconscious material which may emerge. Reported improvements vary; some may experience a major health improvement, some may feel more able to cope, feel calmer and have an improved quality of life, while others in the terminal stage of disease may use healing to cope with the process of dying with peace and dignity. Some healers apply direct touch, and some work with auras - the energy field surrounding the client; some use both methods. The healer will be sensing where there are imbalances and breaks in the body's flow of energy. Healing can be applied either in a sitting or lying down position and can be as short as ten minutes or as long as an hour depending on the healer and the circumstances. Some healers also combine healing with the use of crystals or coloured lights. Some form of counselling or psychotherapy may be involved in interpreting the images which may have arisen for the healee during the healing, though this may be dependant on the experience and qualifications of the healer. The healee may experience a variety of sensations during a healing session: heaviness of the limbs, pins and needles, sleepiness or relaxation. Most healees are very relaxed afterwards and care should be taken not to get up too quickly. During the time that healing sessions are taking place, detoxification will be taking place and it is important to drink a lot of fluids to assist the body with this process. Healing needs to happen in a relaxed and loving environment. There needs to be an affinity between healer and healee for healing to work and if this doesn't happen they may need to be referred to someone else. It is important to note that if an individual doesn't respond to a healer, it is not necessarily the technique or the healer him/herself which is to blame. Sometimes, for instance, healers say that an individual will need specifically male or female energy. Therepeutic touch Therapeutic touch, developed in the sixties in the US, is essentially the same as spiritual healing but uses far more secular terminology. Jean Sayre-Adams, its leading exponent in the US describes it thus: \"Human beings do not have energy fields, they are energy fields. Humans and the environment are continually, simultaneously, and mutually exchanging energy. The environment refers to everything exterior to humans, including other people.\" Therapeutic touch works on the principle that human beings are energy fields and that imbalances and breaks in the flow of this energy can be corrected by a trained practitioner who can sense where there is depletion. The therapist draws energy from the environment through his or her body or from other areas in the patient where there is congestion, and directs it into the area where it is lacking. When symmetry has been restored to the field, which allows the body to work towards wholeness again, the practitioner's work is done. Finding a healer The National Federation of Spiritual Healers is the principal professional body for healers in the UK. While it is not associated with any religion, it does see the source of healing as divine but leaves it up to individuals to interpret that as they wish. Members of the NFSH are bound by a strict code of co:duct. Besides providing details of local healers on request the NFSH functions as an information centre, aiming to publicise healing to a wider public. It organises lectures, provides interviews and articles for the media and participates with doctors in research programmes into the effects of healing on certain illnesses. The aim of the NFSH is for healing to be fully accepted by the public. They wish it to be available not only directly on request but through the NHS. Healing does enjoy a large degree of support from the medical establishment. Many doctors employ healers in their practices or refer their patients to healers. Dr Fleur Fisher who heads the Ethics and Information department of the British Medical Association has acknowledged the benefits of healing and supported its integration into the health service.

It may provide both symptom relief and an improved level of health and vitality. A huge body of knowledge about herbal treatment has existed for thousands of years in many cultures. Egyptian documentation dated around 1,500 BC survives detailing 700 medicines derived from plants. In 400 BC the Greek physician, Theophrastus, produced a textbook which was used for hundreds of years after his death. In Europe the knowledge of plants and herbs was passed down both orally by village women and in monasteries and convents. The advent of printing helped to spread this knowledge, with several herbal texts being published in the seventeenth century. As with Chinese herbs, remedies have been tried and tested over thousands of years, so although clinical research into herbalism remains in its infancy, the efficacy and possible toxicities of these remedies is well established. How herbal medicine works While orthodox medicine uses many extracts from plants used by herbalists in treating disease - digitalis extracted from foxglove and aspirin from the willow tree are well-known - herbal practitioners insist on the importance of using the whole herb, rather than extracts. Some herbal practitioners argue that the side-effects of orthodox treatment are increased when individual constituents are isolated and given as medication and that plants have a delicate chemical balance whereby their various constituents work together to promote maximum healing and avoid toxicity. As herbalism is a holistic therapy which takes account of the whole person, patients will be prescribed herbal treatment not only for their presenting symptoms, but in accordance with their overall health, taking diet, lifestyle, and exercise into account. Consequently the same presenting condition may be treated entirely differently in different people. The aim is to restore the body's vital energy, and to help it find its own self-healing mechanism. The emphasis is on strengthening the system rather than on attacking the disease. Nevertheless, although herbal treatment is not a 'magic bullet' cure, most herbalists reckon that if someone feels better in the first two to three weeks of treatment, s/he will probably respond well in the longer term. The philosophy of herbalism is to treat 'gently over a longer time'. Small doses of strong herbs can be given and tolerated, as the whole herb is used, with its own balance of constituents to counteract any possible toxicity. For instance, the National Institute of Medical Herbalists notes that the Chinese herb ma huang (ephedra sinica) yields ephedrine, an alkaloid which will raise blood pressure if given as an extracted drug. In the whole plant there are six other alkaloids, the main one of which actually prevents a rise in blood pressure and an increase in the heart rate. Dandelion leaves, which act as a diuretic, naturally contain the potassium which has to be given as a supplement with orthodox diuretic treatments. Herbal remedies in HIV There are three main functions of herbal treatment depending on the patient's symptoms: elimination and detoxification, health maintenance (where disease symptoms are counteracted) the body's defences are stimulated and stress is relieved, and finally the toning and nourishment of the body. The emphasis, as in the treatment of all diseases, is on strengthening the system, rather than attacking the disease. Fasting is sometimes advised for detoxification; this, however, needs to be tailored to suit the individual. Cleavers (goosegrass) is useful for promoting detoxification when fasting. Elderflower is used in sweating therapy. Milkthistle and dandelion root are used because they are thought to help the liver with detoxification, while milk thistle may strengthen the membrane of the liver's cells. When treating HIV/AIDS care needs to be taken when considering the stimulation of the body's defence system. Echinacea is often used by herbalists as an immune stimulator but if immune reserves are low, which is usually the case with HIV-positive people, this herb is too strong. Echinacea is not used by herbalists to treat people whose CD4 counts have fallen below 200. The role of polysaccharides - chains of sugars present in some plants - in stimulating without damaging the immune system is being researched in the US, Japan, and Switzerland. Many of the plant derived compounds listed in the A-Z of plant-derived medicines are polysaccharides. Herbal treatment has been successfully used to treat various common HIV-related conditions: tea tree oil is effective for some forms of fungal infection, as is garlic; sage has proved useful for night sweats, slippery elm for relieving diarrhoea, thuya for warts. As both herbs and knowledge about their use is fairly accessible, herbal treatment lends itself to self-help for less serious conditions. The 'materia medica', or list of 24 HERBALISM [Page 25](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/29?q1=directories) herbal remedies contained in herbal books, will give dosages, but people with HIV are better advised to see a professional herbalist to work out an overall programme. There is a danger that by using off-the-shelf remedies people will be more likely to experience adverse reactions, since these may contain unpredictable amounts of the herb, and adverse reactions are probably more likely to occur with self-medication. Combining with other therapies Herbalism combines well with most therapies apart from homoeopathy or traditional Chinese medicine where the remedies could interact badly. It also combines well with orthodox treatment. Quality control If harvesting in the wild, herbs should be picked just before they flower. Variation in strength is not usually a problem as the whole plant is used, giving a balanced formula. Herbs are best bought from people who are known to have growing skills, and supplied by manufacturers who will test them. They are subject to the Trades Descriptions Act. It is important to ensure that any self-gathered herbs have been correctly gathered; the National Institute of Medical Herbalists advises that many cases of poisoning and adverse reaction are a consequence of misidentification.

That is to say, the homoeopathic doctor prescribes for a sick person minute doses of a substance which in a crude, undiluted form would produce in a healthy person effects similar to those occurring in the disease. For example, the drug gelsemium produces symptoms in healthy people very much like those seen in influenza. Gelsemium, when used in appropriate doses, is said by homoeopaths to have an excellent record in the treatment of influenza. Homoeopathy approaches the symptoms of a disease in a very different way from orthodox medicine. The drugs prescribed by orthodox physicians are intended to control symptoms, which are seen as the problem in itself. For instance, pain caused by inflammation can be reduced by an anti-inflammatory drug which blocks the production of prostaglandin. Breathlessness and wheezing in asthmatics can be reduced by a drug which relaxes the tiny muscles within the walls of the airways. But these drugs are not directed at the cause of the illness; they turn off the symptoms without necessarily dealing with the cause. Homoeopathy views symptoms as a cure in process, an attempt by the individual's constitution to return to a state of health and well-being. The homoeopath seeks to prescribe a remedy which will assist this process, rather than suppressing the symptoms. In making a diagnosis, a homoeopath will take into account the smallest variation of symptoms, such as whether the symptoms worsen at specific times of day or with changes of temperature in the surrounding environment. The homoeopath will also note any emotional changes, and even dreaming may on occasion be significant. All these factors contribute to an overall symptom picture which expresses the individuality of the patient's complaint. The homoeopath then seeks to match this symptom picture with the symptom pictures which were observed when homoeopathic remedies were administered to healthy volunteers in experiments known as 'provings'. The homoeopath will also use past observations of the effects of remedy in other patients to make a prescription. The outcome is a highly individualised prescription. Two patients suffering from apparently similar symptoms may be prescribed very different remedies because of subtle differences in their symptoms. This reflects the highly individual responses to illness we all have. Sometimes the remedy prescribed will have no effect, because the homoeopath has failed to match the symptom picture with the right remedy, or because the HOMOEOPATHY 25 [Page 26](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/30?q1=directories) homoeopath did not have the information which would have enabled a correct diagnosis. Or it may be that the remedy was not prescribed in a high enough potency to have the necessary effect. Homoeopathic remedies Homoeopathic remedies come from plant, animal and mineral sources. Only very tiny doses are used, because one of the founding fathers of homoeopathy discovered that highly diluted medicines can still have potent effects. Homoeopathically prescribed remedies are often talked about as being tiny microdoses of an original base substance. Although this is true in part, it would be inaccurate to describe homoeopathy as a chemical therapy. Homoeopathic medicines are potentised. This means that they are diluted in water and then shaken vigourously in the presence of light. This process of dilution and shaking is repeated until, by the laws of chemistry, no traces of the original medicinal substance can remain. Paradoxically, each successive dilution and shaking appears to increase the potency of the remedy. It is thought by homoeopaths that during this process, information patterns continue to be held in the water molecules, and upon dissolving on the tongue, the molecular information contained in the tablet is passed into the body. It has been suggested that this process of dilution and shaking increases the intensity of the electromagnetic field of the substance. If the electromagnetic field of the remedy resonates at the same frequency as the electromagnetic field of the person who receives the remedy, it will provide an energetic impetus that enables the individual to overcome the symptoms for which they are being treated. Although the benefits of using homoeopathy are undeniable and well documented, the notion of energy resonance is far from being understood or accepted in the scientific world. Homoeopathy has tended to draw particular scepticism from scientists because the way it is thought to work is still difficult to explain within the limits of current scientific knowledge. It would probably be fair to say that scientific research is still attempting to come up with an explanation for how homoeopathy works. Nevertheless, the benefits of homoeopathic treatment have been proven in some diseases. Clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the benefit of homoeopathic remedies when compared with a placebo. Some scientists have argued that homoeopathy is just a very powerful placebo effect, but several trials have shown that the health of people who received a homoeopathic remedy for a condition improved when compared with those who received a placebo. Homoeopathic remedies have also been used on animals such as horses, dogs and cats with success, indicating that homoeopathy is not a placebo effect. Several studies have demonstrated that homoeopathic dilutions of particular substances do induce measurable effects in human cells in the laboratory. For instance, potentised doses of histamine and crushed bee had a significant effect on reducing the secretion of allergy-causing chemicals from basophils, white blood cells which play a role in allergic responses. Homoeopathic doses of silica have been shown to stimulate macrophages (immune cells which engulf bacteria) in mice. The homoeopathic view of AIDS and its treatment Few homoeopaths in the UK have experience of treating people with HIV or AIDS. These observations are based on the views of those who have treated a large number of patients. Broadly speaking, there are two approaches amongst homoeopaths to AIDS and the ways in which it should be treated. One adheres strictly to the methods of classical homoeopathy, and takes the view that AIDS-related illness can be treated with a series of remedies appropriate to the constitution of the individual and their pattern of symptoms. If the remedies are well-chosen, it should not be necessary to adjust diet or provide psychological counselling. The homoeopath will treat the central and most pressing symptoms first, whether these are physical problems such as night sweats or emotional reactions such as shock or fear. When these symptoms have been dealt with attention is paid to other, less intrusive symptoms. There is no firm evidence that this approach has been successful, but some homoeopaths claim a degree of success with some AIDS-related symptoms such as night sweats, fatigue and nausea, saying that they have been relieved. The other view held by homoeopathic practitioners is that AIDS is a consequence of an overloaded immune system in which HIV is merely one factor leading to immune deficiency. As a consequence, the homoeopath must prescribe remedies which address the range of factors which have led to immune deficiency and the specific opportunistic infections developed by individuals. A single remedy is unlikely to resolve the dis-ease. In some cases, this might involve the prescription of remedies designed to alleviate the effects of long-term use of recreational drugs, or a history of sexually transmitted disease. Some homoeopaths say that it is often when the damage caused by these factors is addressed that they see improvement in opportunistic infections or constitutional symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss. Once again, there is no firm evidence in the form of research studies that this approach has been successful in HIV-positive people, but several homoeopaths specialising in the treatment of HIV-positive people say that they have had success treating some AIDS-related illnesses using this method. Some homoeopaths claim that they can provide remedies which vaccinate or prophylax against specific infections, but those we spoke to strongly dispute this claim, pointing out that there is no evidence from properly controlled studies to support this view. 26 HOMOEOPATHY [Page 27](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/31?q1=directories) Homoeopathic treatment pays equal attention to physical and emotional symptom and homoeopaths say that remedies for fear, shock, anxiety, depression and compulsive thoughts have shown good effects in many people over the years, suggesting that homoeopathy may provide benefit on the emotional level to people confronting a diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS. Although this is an aspect of homoeopathy that draws particular suspicion from some doctors, it is one that deserves further study, given the frequently addictive nature of anti-depressant drugs. Homoeopathy and other treatments Most homoeopaths take the view that conventional medications will interfere with the ability of homoeopathic remedies to improve a condition. Their use will certainly make it more difficult to tell whether the homoeopathic remedy has been responsible for any improvement in the patient's condition. \"Superficial\" medicines such as antihistamines, sudafed, steroids, paracetamol and aspirin are thought to negate the effects of remedies, but so are some of the drugs used specifically to treat HIV infection, such as AZT. Attitudes differ amongst homoeopaths as to the likelihood of success of homoeopathic remedies used alongside the medications customarily used in HIV positive people. Some homoeopaths have attempted to negate the side-effects of AZT by prescribing potentised doses of the drug whilst patients continue to use it, but they say that there is no clear evidence that this reduces the side-effects. This is a controversial area amongst homoeopaths, and few use such methods. A homoeopath experienced in treating injecting drug users told NAM that homoeopathic remedies seem to be ineffective in drug users who are in the process of withdrawing from drug use, because body chemistry is disrupted during this period. Other complementary therapies which are said to work on the basis of altering the body's energy may interfere with homoeopathic treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine is one example. Other therapies which are concerned with dietary changes, stress reduction and physical manipulation will not interfere with the effects of homoeopathic remedies. Visiting a homoeopath A homoeopath will take a detailed medical history. This may not be quite the same as the form of history taken by a doctor. You will be asked about your symptoms, but you will also be asked about your past illnesses and about your habits and reactions to particular situations. This is to enable the homoeopath to build up a picture of your constitution and disposition which is holistic, taking into account your physical and emotional reactions. The homoeopath will then refer to the repertory, which contains lists of symptoms together with remedies suitable for those symptoms. These descriptions may be very specific. For instance, homoeopaths classify headaches not only according to where the pain is, but also at what times of day it is worst and what other forms of behaviour and sensation accompany the headache. Homoeopaths have arrived at these indications for use as result of provings, experiments done in healthy individuals to examine what symptoms are produced by the administration of the crude form of a herb or mineral. Individuals participating in the proving experiments were asked to note any physical and emotional symptoms, no matter how minor, to build a symptom picture of the remedy. Considerations in choosing a homoeopath Homoeopaths are trained in several different ways. Some receive a conventional medical training and subsequently become homoeopaths. The length of their homoeopathic training may vary considerably. Non-medical homoeopaths usually receive three or four years training at a college of homoeopathy. There are big differences from one homoeopath to another in their level of knowledge about the symptoms and the disease course associated with HIV and AIDS. There are also big differences in their knowledge of homoeopathic remedies. Ask the homoeopath how he or she keeps up to date on AIDS and the use of homoeopathy in AIDS. A number of organisations, including HEAL, the Letchworth Centre for Complementary Medicine and the Faculty of Homoeopaths provide some training on the use of homoeopathy in AIDS. Homoeopaths experienced in treating HIV-positive people can also be found through the Immune Development Trust and HEAL. Homoeopaths also differ in other ways, regardless of their training. Some will use classical methods alone, others will use a combination of remedies and will also offer advice on diet, stress reduction and lifestyle. They may also practice other complementary therapies, such as acupuncture.

Hypnotherapy Hypnotherapy induces a trance-like state during which the person is so deeply relaxed that the unconscious becomes accessible to suggestion. Hypnotherapy can therefore be used either to reduce or eliminate symptoms, or to assist psychological treatment, so that the therapist can explore the unconscious mind. It is unclear exactly how hypnosis works; the hypnotic state appears to exist somewhere in the hinterland between wakefulness and the unconscious. While the hypnotic technique is relatively modern, dating from the work of Franz Anton Mesmer in the eighteenth century, there is evidence of hypnotism, or the induction of trance-like states, being used in ancient Egypt, Greece and by the Druids in Britain. Hypnotism aroused great interest during the 19th century, but fell into increasing disrepute in the 20th century due to its reputation as a stage curiosity and its consequent association with quackery. A typical hypnotherapy session During a session the patient/client will sit or lie, either in a chair or on a couch, and will be taken through a series of relaxation exercises by the hypnotherapist who will rely on his/her voice to effect a relaxed state. While it is no longer usual for objects to be dangled before the patient, this is perfectly acceptable if this is what seems necessary and fits with the patient's expectations. It may be useful to check with the therapist what images he or she will conjure up; Nursing Times recently reported the story of a woman who was asked to imagine herself in a field of corn and had an attack of hay fever! Hypnotists claim that the power of suggestion is enough to produce allergic reactions to imaginary objects. Once a hypnotic state has begun the client will be gently probed to recall memories which may shed light on the problem in hand. The therapeutic relationship is all-important as trust is an essential prerequisite in order for this therapy to be effective. The ability to relax fully and so take best advantage of hypnosis may vary from person to person. The number of sessions will differ according to this and to the extent of the presenting problems. Individuals can also be taught self-hypnosis techniques akin to visualisation which many people report to be of great benefit. Hypnotherapy's potential for reducing both stress levels and pain make it a useful tool for achieving an enhanced quality of life when living with HIV. It also has a good record of helping to end addictions. Some people report that hypnotherapy has helped control complaints such as incontinence, and there is evidence from well-controlled clinical trials that hypnotherapy treatment for certain forms of pain is successful. It has also been credited with improving the breathing of asthmatics (Evans; Colosimo; James). Hypnotherapy has also proved to be useful in controlling nausea. A study which compared children between the ages of 10 and 18 receiving chemotherapy found that those taught self-hypnosis and relaxation vomited less (two-thirds did not vomit at all) and were able to maintain a higher fluid intake than the children who did not receive instruction in the technique (Cotanch). Finding a practitioner Whilst there are many reputable hypnotherapists, this is a field which tends to attract confidence tricksters and the unqualified hoping to make money. Anyone can claim to be a hypnotherapist and there are nearly 100 hypnotherapist organisations. The Institute of Complementary Medicine can advise on the qualifications of any hypnotherapist. An organisation for doctors and dentists qualified in hypnotherapy also exists: Medical and Dental Hypnosis Society c/o Colosimo CP The use management of chronic pain Hypnos 16(3): 122-126 (1989) Cotanch P et al Self-hypnosis as anti-emetic therapy in children receiving chemotherapy Oncology Nursing Forum 12(4): 41-46 (1985) Evans FJ Hypnosis and chronic pain: two contrasting case studies Clin J Pain 5(2): 169-76 (1989) 28 HYPNOTHERAPY [Page 29](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/33?q1=directories) James FR et al Self-hypnosis in chronic pain: a multiple baseline study of five highly hypnotisable subjects Clin J Pain 5(2):161-168 (1989) SMassage Massage is one of the oldest and simplest forms of treatment, and one of the therapies most widely offered to HIV-positive people, and its benefits are now widely recognised. It is an excellent way of reducing stress and increasing a generalised sense of well-being. There are many different sorts of massage, and practitioners are likely to specialise in one or two forms. These are some of the main types you are likely to encounter: - aromatherapy massage - biodynamic massage - holistic massage - massage with aromatherapy oils - shiatsu - sports massage - Swedish massage - therapeutic massage Swedish massage tends to be the basis of most approaches to massage. It involves a number of manual techniques aimed to relax, strengthen and stimulate the muscles. Holistic massage is a term used for massage that addresses the whole person - mind, body and emotions. The majority of masseurs will tend to take a holistic approach, apart from sports injury massage, which focuses only on the physical body. Therapeutic massage on the other hand looks at more than the physical body. For example, if the practitioner detects tension in certain parts of your body, this may lead to a discussion of why you have been feeling tense and how emotions could be seen to be stored in tense muscle. Biodynamic massage is massage without oils, applying a pressure-point style of touch using a stethoscope to listen to the body's responses. Massage with aromatherapy oils usually means that the therapist is a not a qualified aromatherapist, but has experience of using gentle oils such as lavendar, mandarin and geranium. The benefits of massage Quite a lot is now known about the way that massage affects the body, but most people who receive massage report that the benefits are very clear: it usually induces a sense of relaxation through enabling us to breathe deeply and slowly, and it slows the heart rate. It is also pleasurable to be touched. This can be particularly important for people who feel stigmatised, lonely or isolated as a result of their physical or emotional state of health. Touch provides a tangible sense of reassurance and support, and also helps reduce anxiety and calm the mind. In the process of relaxation many claim to be 'more in touch' with their emotional and physical state of health and begin to identify factors such as stress that are undermining their health. Massage is applied to the muscle and ligaments, relaxing the nervous system, imrpoving circulation, stimulating the flow of oxygen-bearing red blood cells around the body and assisting in the elimination of toxins. Massage has been helpful in restoring strength and mobility after injury or weight loss. A good practitioner will be able to adapt techniques for people confined to bed or to a wheelchair to help maintain muscular tone and blood circulation. When to avoid massage Contra-indications to massage include thrombosis, varicose veins, verrucaes and athlete's foot. With infectious or contagious skin conditions the immediate area should be avoided by the therapist. Stimulation of the lymphatic system is not recommended for people with KS. Although there is no clear proof, some doctors suspect that KS could spread through the lymph system. Combination with other therapies Massage can be combined with other therapies quite easily; indeed some forms of treatment such as traditional Chinese medicine and naturopathy may include massage as part of an attempt to clear toxins from the body. It is probably wise to let your masseur know of any other treatments you are receiving. What a good massage should involve Your first massage should involve a discussion with your masseur. The discussion or assessment will focus on what you hope to get from the massage, and you shouldn't be surprised if your masseur also asks for a brief medical history. Such a discussion could last thirty minutes or more before the massage actually takes place. It is standard practice that an all-over massage will take about an hour to complete. Getting the form of massage you want will often depend on voicing your needs, and also depends on your previous experience of massage. Some people rate a good massage as being very firm or even hard. Whilst such a massage might be appropriate for well-toned muscles, it might not be what you need or want, especially if you are suffering from exhaustion. Make sure MASSAGE 29 [Page 30](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/34?q1=directories) you discuss this with your masseur before the massage begins. Many people connect massage with sexual activity, but most professionally qualified masseurs see themselves as part of the health and therapy sector, not the sex industry. Masseurs are used to dealing tactfully with sexual arousal as a consequence of massage, so you shouldn't be embarrassed by the possibility. If, on the other hand, you feel that your masseur is making unwelcome sexual advances, you shouldn't be embarrassed about complaining, especially if the massage service is provided by a support group. Finding a masseur There are many different forms of qualifications and training available for massage, but the best known is the ITEC certificate. Massage services are often available through support groups and HIV centres. Naturopathy Naturopathy is a drug-free healing system based on the principle that the body has an inate ability to heal itself Naturopaths may use dietary adjustments, fasting, sweating, exercise, osteopathy and stress management to treat people. Naturopaths believe that there is a natural equilibrium and harmony towards which the body will strive and its inherent power to do this is expressed as the body's 'vital force'; this idea of a vital force crops up in various complementary and alternative therapies, notably in traditional Chinese medicine and it is the basis of naturopathic philosophy. The body's equilibrium can be disturbed by a build-up of toxins, resulting in disease. Disease is seen from the naturopathic point of view as the body's attempt to eliminate toxins and to restore equilibrium or balance. Naturopathy's concern is the holistic treatment of an individual; it does not only seek to address symptoms but to resolve the underlying causes of illness, bearing in mind the age, constitution, past medical history, mental, emotional and hereditary factors of the individual. Naturopaths will often be trained and will practise as osteopaths. The origins of naturopathy The history of the nature cure, as naturopathy has often been known, goes far back to the ancient Greek doctors Hippocrates and Aesculapius, whose success with natural therapy became legendary. Although naturopathy as a system is relatively new, its basic concepts date back to the laws of health laid down by Hippocrates in 400 BC. These are expressed as follows: - Only nature heals, providing it has the opportunity to do so; - Let food be your medicine and let medicine be your food; - Disease is an expression of purification; - All disease is one (i.e. resulting from the same cause, a build up of toxins in the body). Naturopathy as we know it today was formalised during the 19th century by practitioners working in the US, using hydrotherapy and 'hygienics'. Around the turn of the century naturopathic ideas were embodied in the health-farm movement in Britain, while in 1902 Benedict Lust set up the American School of Naturopathy in New York. Naturopathic techniques Naturopaths will take a full case history, taking the whole person into account; this will entail looking at the presenting condition, diet, lifestyle, substance abuse, medical history and medication. They are trained in clinical pathology and will diagnose similarly to orthodox medicine, often asking for blood or other medical tests. When treating serious illness, they may wish to work jointly with the patient's doctor as they perceive orthodox medicine as having a wider range of effective diagnostic tools. Naturopathy views acute illness as a natural healing or cleansing process manifested by colds, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, skin rashes etc. These are seen as positive processes by which the body detoxifies itself and brings about a restoration of health. It is the suppression of acute illness that may result in chronic ill-health. Naturopathy's cornerstone is elimination and the tools used to encourage this include: - Diet, based largely on wholefoods and fresh fruit and vegetables, preferably organically produced - Fasting - Hydrotherapy using hot and cold sprays or compresses - Physical therapy and osteopathic treatment - Exercise and breathing techniques - Stress management The naturopath sees the relationship with the patient as a partnership; responsibility needs to be taken by the patient to effect positive changes in his/her lifestyle. The naturopath's job is to encourage the body's vital healing force to eliminate the toxic build-up of cellular metabolic wastes which have accumulated due to inadequate elimination via the bowels, skin, kidneys, liver and lungs. This elimination may be evidenced by colds, flu-like symptoms, fever, diarrhoea or vomiting. These symptoms are described as a 'healing crisis' and viewed naturopathically as positive reactions when they occur in moderation. 30 NATUROPATHY [Page 31](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/35?q1=directories) Naturopaths say that treatment gives rise to the following phenomena: - A progressive improvement in general health, punctuated by healing crises; - A return of previous symptoms, particularly ones that were suppressed with orthodox medication, usually in reverse order of their first appearance; - The disease process moves from deeper tissues to more superficial ones, and from vital organs to the less vital. Naturopathy and HIV/AIDS There is some variation amongst naturopaths as to how HIV is defined but generally it is seen as an immune dysfunction; so one of the aims may be to help modulate the immune system so it can deal more effectively with HIV and opportunistic infections. The approach may thus be less concerned with cleansing and more on building up the constitution. Historically, HIV/AIDS is a new condition and naturopaths acknowledge the need to accept their limitations and to exercise great caution when treating an HIV-positive person. Treatment is individually tailored and no claims are made. The aim however is no different to any other condition: the restoration and/or maintenance of health and vitality with minimum drug intervention. The fundamental guide to all therapy is 'above all, do no harm'. This guiding principle allows the flexibility necessary when approaching the treatment of a condition as serious as AIDS, where patients may wish to carry on taking allopathic drugs such as prophylaxis against PCP. However, a better state of health may help offset opportunistic infections too. Changes may be necessary to traditional naturopathic advice: raw foods, for instance, may be kept to a minimum owing to the danger of parasites and of opportunistic infections from the soil. Fasting is also generally contra-indicated as the constitution is likely to be too weak. Dietary advice can be given, as can advice on vitamin supplementation. Initially two to three sessions will be needed over four to twelve weeks. It should then be possible to lengthen the intervals between sessions, with the patient returning only for further advice and monitoring of treatment. Naturopathy aims to give people the tools to achieve health, and the information about how to use these tools in accordance with well-established naturopathic principles. Good feedback is necessary for the practitioner in what is ideally a two-way process. The naturopath may look at ways of relieving stress and may recommend exercises, psycho-therapy, yoga or massage. Naturopathy combines well with most other therapies. Accreditation and training Anyone can call themselves a naturopath so it is important to check that a practitioner has completed an approved four year course at the British College of Naturopathy and Osteopathy (BCNO) where anatomy, physiology and pathology take up much of the curriculum. The college can be contacted at the address of the British Naturopathic Association. Contacts The British Naturopathic Association Frazer House, 6, Netherhall Gardens, London NW3 5RR This is the main professional body in this country. The General Council and Register of Naturopaths The Council keeps a register of practitioners, who use the initials MRN after their name. The register has a code of ethics, provides insurance and insists on proper four year training at an approved college. Free treatment can be obtained through the Immune Development Trust or at the BCNO where students will see members of the public as part of their training. As with most therapies, people with HIV are likely to find good practitioners with experience of HIV through organisations like the Immune Development Trust. Books Naturopathic medicine: treating the whole person Roger Newman Turner (Thorsons, 1990) SOsteopathy Osteopathy is a manipulative therapy which seeks to correct structural dysfunctions in the body, and resulting health problems, through working on the body's musculoskeletal system. Like naturopathy, osteopathy sees the body as possessing a natural tendency to strive towards a healthy equilibrium. If its balance is disturbed by mechanical dysfunctions in its structure, then its healing abilities will be impaired. Much attention is given to the spinal column and the healthy functioning of the central nervous system which it protects; if a lesion - the osteopathic term for a mechanical fault in a joint - occurs in the spine, its correction may well sort out other connected health problems. Osteopaths claim their treatment can improve the functioning of the nervous system, blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. Osteopathy does not claim that structural dysfunction is the only cause of ill-health, recognising the role played by other factors such as diet, psychological causes, environment and heredity. As a holistic therapy, it seeks to treat the whole person, not just the presenting symptoms. OSTEOPATHY 31 [Page 32](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/36?q1=directories) Visiting an osteopath A full history will be taken and a physical examination given. Diagnosis begins the moment the individual walks into the practice; movement, skin colour, breathing and posture will all be assessed. Investigation into the cause of the presenting symptoms will involve a thorough assessment of muscle tone and temperature and joint movement. The symptoms may well be some distance from the area being examined, such as when numbness or tingling, frequently emanating from the neck, is experienced in the hands. Sometimes x-rays may be requested. Having established that the problem is structural, treatment will be given. The patient sits or lies on a table in the best position for the practitioner to perform manipulation which may include high velocity thrusts, or clicks as they are popularly known. These are designed to free up joints which have become misaligned, sometimes over a long period of time. They can seem alarming but usually only involve a minimum of discomfort; occasionally the patient may feel a bruised sensation for a day or so following treatment. Some conditions may respond to soft tissue work alone. Whilst many people report that osteopathy has been of great benefit in relieving backpain, it is also claimed to be able to alleviate many other conditions such as migraine. The number of sessions required will vary from one or two, to regular treatment over a period of months for chronic conditions. Osteopaths are often qualified in other areas of complementary therapy such as naturopathy or homoeopathy and can give advice in these disciplines as well. When to avoid osteopathy Osteopathy is contra-indicated for certain conditions. Because it involves a degree of force, great care is indicated when osteoporosis is present, when bones are brittle or joints inflamed. It can therefore be inappropriate when rheumatoid arthritis is present, especially as this condition arises from auto-immunity, rather than from structural dysfunction. Osteopathy is also contra-indicated during the early weeks of pregnancy. Osteopaths advise against combining the treatment with physiotherapy or chiropractic as these physically based therapies could conflict with osteopathic treatment. Osteopathy is said to combine fairly well with the Alexander technique and sometimes with acupuncture, though osteopaths caution against over-treating as the body can become stressed and may not have sufficient reserves to cope with a number of different therapies at once. Cranial osteopathy Some osteopaths specialise in cranial osteopathy. It is a much gentler therapy, where the practitioner works with the cranial rhythmic impulse perceptible in the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid in which the brain and the spinal cord lie. This rhythm is clearest at the cranium and the sacrum and has a pumping effect on the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid in the spine and the brain. It is thought that by manipulating the skull, the body's vitality can be enhanced. Treatment involves lying on a table while the practitioner gently manipulates the skull, neck, diaphragm and sacrum. Cranial osteopaths can diagnose from the cranial rhythm if the body's vitality is low and much of the treatment is dedicated to restoring this. The treatment is very relaxing and so non-invasive as to require a certain act of faith as to its efficacy. Many people experience it as similar to healing; it certainly involves a close therapeutic relationship with the practitioner. The large amount of anecdotal evidence suggests that its claims are not imaginary however, and conditions as wide-ranging as depression, insomnia, headaches and asthma have been said to benefit. Cranial osteopaths are trained in classical osteopathy and can provide the more robust high velocity thrusts if necessary. HIV and osteopathy Osteopaths are intensely aware of the role stress plays in the body, both in relation to posture and to the body's ability to heal itself. Cranial osteopathy is said to be successful in treating stress-related conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. Osteopaths are cautious in their approach and will always recommend another therapy if they feel it to be more suitable. Alternately, if no progress is being made or a relapse occurs they are likely to re-refer the patient to the doctor. Recurrent chest pains, neck pains and problems with swallowing, breathing and with the bowel function are all amenable to improvement from osteopathic intervention. The improved circulation and nerve function that can result from osteopathy may enhance the body's vitality. Some osteopaths think that night sweats may be alleviated when treatment is aimed at restoring the balance between the sympathetic and para-sympathetic nervous system. Improvement may well be expressed through 'healing crises'. This may involve an over-working of the sinuses, fevers and high temperatures and swollen glands. In women there may be increased uterine bleeding. These all need constant monitoring. In a residential setting fevers can be relieved with hydrotherapy, the application of cold and hot water to the body. Many practitioners will operate a sliding price scale, or will treat individuals for what they can afford. Treatment is sometimes available at GP's practices. Finding a practitioner Practitioners can be found through the Register of Osteopaths. They should be supportive and caring; have tact with the opposite sex with matters such as undressing; they should be able to make the patient feel comfortable, neither traumatised or invaded. Complaints are usually due to misunderstandings about treatment; one practitioner 32 OSTEOPATHY [Page 33](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/37?q1=directories) gave the example of correcting the position of the coccyx. This may need to be carried out from the inside of the rectum and needs explaining carefully to the patient. Training and accreditation Osteopathic training takes four years; there are four main schools, one of which runs a 13 month course for qualified doctors. Cranial osteopathy is now taught at undergraduate level alongside classical osteopathy. Post-graduate specialist courses are available in subjects such as anatomy, physiology and sports injuries. In 1995 the General Osteopathic Council will be set up and will regulate the profession by statute, following the passing of the Osteopathy Act in 1993, making osteopathy the first complementary therapy to gain this status. Contacts There are several different registers of practitioners, the oldest and largest being: The General Council and Register of Osteopaths 56 London Street, Reading, Berkshire RG1 48Q This encompasses about three-quarters of the profession.

The British Naturopathy and Osteopathy Association 6 Netherhall Gardens, London NW3 5RR SReflexology Reflexology, or reflex zone therapy as it is sometimes known, is a system of manipulation ofpressure points in the feet. It is believed that by stimulating these points, the body's own healing mechanisms can be mobilised. Particular areas of the body, usually the feet or hands, are seen as a map of zones which correspond to, or are linked to, other structures or organs of the body through a flow of energy. Disease or damage in one part of the body will show up in the corresponding zone on the foot and can be favourably influenced by careful massage or pressure on that zone. The origins of reflexology Although reflexology in its current form has only been practised in the UK since the 1960's, there is evidence of the use of foot massage in many primitive and ancient cultures. Wall paintings have been found in Egypt, and foot massage is said to have been used therapeutically by native Americans. In the early part of this century, in the USA, an ear, nose and throat specialist, Dr. William Fitzgerald, noticed that pressure on parts of the nose resulted in some local anaesthesia, and on investigating further through the body he was eventually able to map out which parts of the body corresponded to others, calling his discoveries 'zone therapy'. How a refllexologist practises The body is said to be divided into ten vertical zones; structures and organs along these zones are connected by energy flows to areas on the foot which function as terminals for the entire zone. Pressure on a zone in the foot will stimulate various organs which are located along the same zone. There are further zones present in the body, enabling a sophisticated grid of reflex points for the entire body to be drawn up. Besides the taking of a detailed case history, practitioners diagnose state of health both through skin colour and condition, condition of bone structure and muscle tone and by careful pressure on the various reflex zones; pain may be experienced in a reflex zone if some disorder is present in an appropriate part of the body, though sometimes discomfort may be due merely to some current strain, rather than to organic disease. Treatment is gentle, relaxing and calming; while there may be some pain, this may be accompanied by a sense of well-being. Very rarely treatment might also make you sweat, but if it causes shivery feelings and coldness this could be due to over-stimulation and the practititioner should be informed straightaway. Some side-effects may be experienced in the days after treatment has commenced; these can take the form of mild diarrhoea, sweating, runny nose or increased passing of urine and are said to be due to increased elimination of toxins from the system. Disorders which are said to benefit from reflexology cover a very wide area and include acne, some allergic disorders, bowel and bladder problems, menstrual problems and pain. Caution should be exercised with circulatory disorders such as varicose veins. Reflexology and HIV The 'hands-on', calming effect of reflexology makes it an attractive option for people with HIV; it is useful for alleviating stress and the importance of touch should not be under-estimated for those who are dealing with a stigmatised condition. In relation to specific conditions, success has been reported with bone ache, neck stiffness and back ache though all these problems have a tendency to recur if treatment is not continued. Respiratory, circulatory, excretory and digestive problems have been helped, though it is important that excessive pressure on these systems is avoided. Insomnia has responded well to reflexology. Reflexologists will also work on zones which they believe can strengthen immune function. They will concentrate on the lymphatic and endocrine systems at all stages of treatment. They will treat the pituitary gland, the liver, the REFLEXOLOGY 33 [Page 34](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/38?q1=directories) spleen, the ileocaecal valve (the junction between the small and large intestines) and the kidneys. The cleansing processes activated by reflexology, urinic or colonic, may cause some temporary disruption; there may be increased dreaming activity, mild temporary hair loss, deafness with full hearing being regained later, and skin rashes, although these side-effects are reportedly rare. Particular caution needs to be exercised by practitioners when treating people with PCP as treatment can cause an over-reaction; mucous is brought up but the process can go on without relief, further weakening the individual. It may sometimes be possible to combine reflexology with acupuncture, which sometimes has better results when treating conditions such as arthritis. Finding a competent practitioner Many professional bodies exist, usually attached to particular schools. Courses can vary from two years to a weekend. The most reliable organisation appears to be the Association of Reflexologists which functions as an umbrella organisation to register practitioners trained at approved schools, who have been in practice for two years and who have submitted two very full case histories. Their practitioners will have insurance. There is a reflexology division of the British Register of Complementary Practitioners. The British Reflexology Association registers graduates from the well-established Bayley School of Reflexology. Contacts Asssociation of Reflexologists 37 Standale Grove, Ruislip, Middlesex British Reflexology Association 12 Pond Road, London SE3 9JL Books Reflex Zone Massage Handbook of Therapy and Self-Help Franz Wagner (Thorsons) Shiatsu Shiatsu is a form of manipulation which developed in Japan and which combines many of the benefits of massage with those of acupuncture. Shiatsu is not the same as reflexology. The term means 'finger pressure' and shiatsu uses acupressure, the manipulation of acupuncture points with the fingers or different part of the hand. Treatment will be carried out with the patient lying or sitting on the floor, usually on a thick mat or futon. Treatment is applied through clothing and patients will be asked to wear light, baggy clothing. Practitioners usually commence treatment by relaxing the patient's body, then more specific procedures are applied. Pressure is applied in different ways to tonify the body by increasing the flow of blood and energy, to disperse and break up blockages or to counteract and calm agitations in the energy flow. Sometimes shiatsu massage can be quite vigorous and even mildly painful. Shiatsu claims to be effective in treating a large number of conditions which include headaches, migraine, respiratory conditions such as asthma and bronchitis, sinus problems and catarrh, digestive and bowel disorders, circulatory problems and rheumatic and arthritic complaints. In particular, shiatsu is effective in treating stress and anxiety and related conditions such as insomnia. Like massage, shiatsu's close contact may give the patient a sense of reassurance and validation. Shiatsu practitoners say that a particular point on the inner side of the wrist can be used to relieve nausea, and experiments have taken place with special bands which can be used by individuals to apply pressure to this point when feeling nauseous. These experiments showed relief of nausea in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and pregnant women suffering from morning sickness. It is therefore likely that individuals may be able to use shiatsu to alleviate nauseous side-effects caused by AZT and other drugs. Shiatsu is contraindicated in patients who have a risk of haemorrhage, or thrombosis. This is because the treatment works by increasing blood flow. For this reason too it should be avoided when there is a tumour in the area to be treated. Because of the pressure involved, caution should also be exercised when osteoporosis, recent tissue damage, fractures or inflammation are present. Parts of the skull should be avoided where the patient suffers from epilepsy or high blood pressure. This list demonstrates the importance of giving your practitioner a very full and up-to-date medical history. After a session of Shiatsu, patients will probably feel relaxed with a sense of well-being. There may, however, be a temporary crisis while toxins and negative emotions are released; these may take the form of a headache or flu-like symptoms and it is important to contact the practitioner for reassurance. Shiatsu was introduced to the West in the 1970s; its professional body is the Shiatsu Society, established in 1981. It acts as an information centre for the public and keeps a register of members who are required to have completed a three year training. Different institutions teach different styles and philosophical approaches to Shiatsu and the society requires its members to train with two teachers who use other styles to the one they have studied.

It is a medical tradition which first began to be written down more than two and a half thousand years ago. It is still the main form of medical care used by nearly one and half billion people in the world. TCM uses a combination of herbs and acupuncture (the insertion of fine needles into certain points on the skin) to heal illness. Most of the remedies now in use by practitioners of TCM have been prescribed for hundreds of years, and a large body of knowledge has accumulated regarding their correct use and their potential side-effects. In comparison most Western drugs are extremely new. The origins of acupuncture are unknown but it has been practiced for at least five thousand years. Some say that acupuncture was discovered after it was noticed that arrow wounds in certain parts of the body caused the disappearance of long-term health problems. Today it is known that the points used by acupuncturists to insert needles are sites of heightened electrical conductivity and lowered resistance. Prehistoric healers seem to have learnt that by stimulating these points illness could be relieved and energy levels increased. They also discovered a form of energy, or qi, which flows through channels in the body known as meridians. These meridians link together organ systems. The qi is best understood as something more than an electrical impulse; it is the life force, \"that which differentiates life from death, animate from inanimate\", as the authors of Treating AIDS with Chinese Medicine put it. The insertion of needles into points along the meridians acts in the same way as throwing the switches in an electrical current; it encourages the flow of qi around the body to specific organs. Healers learnt to measure the strength of this energy and to detect whether there were imbalances of energy in meridians related to specific organs. In TCM illness is considered to be a consequence of an imbalance of energy in the body, which can come about due to external or internal factors. The task of the physician is to assist the patient in re-balancing the body's energies. To assess an individual's state of health, or energy balance, a practitioner of TCM will take a detailed case history using the tongue and pulses as important diagnostic tools. The flow of energy can be assessed by testing various body pulses. TCM also uses the concepts of yin and yang, which are sometimes translated as active and passive, positive and negative, masculine and feminine or light and shadow. Yin and yang encompasses all these meanings. TCM has a very different understanding of the organs and the substances of the body such as blood, fluids and its personality. Of all the forms of alternative medicine, TCM is the system which is most alien to a Western scientific, materialist view of the world. Many Western doctors have complained that the concepts used in TCM, such as Heat, Cold, Wind and Damp, bear no relation to the physical reality of the body as it has been described by Western science. TCM practitioners say that it is only in the field of quantum physics that scientists have begun to come up with explanations for energy-related phenomena such as qi which materialistic science finds impossible to quantify or explain. Chinese herbal medicine is used to treat deficiencies within the body and to clear disease causing factors such as Damp, Cold, Phlegm, Heat and the waste materials of the metabolism. Acupuncture is used to augment this medication. For instance, if a practitioner decides to give treatment for a kidney deficiency, acupuncture treatment will be given to enhance the effects of the herbs on the functioning of the kidney. Acupuncture is also used to treat structural problems, such as back or muscle pain, and to alleviate arthritis. Some practitioners see acupuncture as just as important as herbs or may use only acupuncture in their practice. There are a number of different theories in TCM about the nature of AIDS, all of which start with the invasion of an 'external evil'. However, there are different schools of thought about the deficiencies and disorders which occur in the body as a result of this 'invasion' and how these should be interpreted. This means that different practitioners of TCM may follow rather different treatment strategies for treatment depending on whether they view AIDS as a Warm disease, a Deficiency disease, a deficiency of Yin and Kidney, or a Heat-induced disorder. All are agreed that the external evil factor - HIV - will take the path of least resistance. It is therefore important to protect the areas of weakness at all times. Of all the complementary therapies, TCM is the one which has been subject to the greatest scientific scrutiny. Since the 1950s Chinese and Western scientists have sought to identify the active ingredients in traditional herbal medicines, and have tested them in clinical trials. In recent years there has been great progress in making Chinese and Western medicine truly complementary. For instance, Chinese doctors report considerably greater success in treating some forms of cancer using a combination of herbs plus Western medication and radiotherapy than with one method alone. In particular, some herbs appear to be very successful in reducing the toxicity of cancer chemotherapy. TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE 35 [Page 36](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/40?q1=directories) Chinese herbal medicines A wide range of Chinese herbs have been tested to observe their effects on the immune system and some of the herbs observed to have anti-viral effects have been tested to observe whether they kill HIV. In Chinese medical theory it is more important to know whether a herb can affect the body's ability to fight disease than it is to know whether the herb inhibits replication of a specific virus. This is because TCM takes the view that viruses and other external factors (such as bacteria, parasites and fungi) can only cause illness when the body's life force is depleted. Many of the herbs which have been shown to inhibit HIV infection appear to do so by enhancing the ability of cells to resist infection rather than by directly inhibiting the processes by which the virus reproduces itself. An example is violae yeodensitis, which cannot kill HIV outside the cell, but which does prevent HIV from infecting other cells in a laboratory cell line. How the herb might produce this effect is still unknown. Violae yeodensitis is commonly used as part of formulae to treat tuberculosis. A large number of herbs have now been documented as increasing T-cell counts, white blood cell counts and many other cell-mediated immune functions in animal studies and in healthy adults. Many other herbs have been shown to increase antibody production, regulate the production of interferon, reduce allergic reactions and increase platelets and red blood cells. Anti-bacterial, anti-protozoal, anti-fungal and anti-tumour herbs have also been documented by Chinese researchers in the past fifteen years. The immune enhancing effects of acupuncture have also been studied. Treatment at specific acupuncture points has been shown to increase interferon production, to boost the ability of leukocytes to kill bacteria, to increase red blood cells in anaemic people, to reduce pain and to bring down fevers. These findings are discussed in detail in Treating AIDS With Chinese Medicine (see Books, below) Anti-viral herbs are mostly defined as heat-clearing and toxin-eliminating in traditional Chinese medicine. Most of the herbs discovered to have virus-clearing properties have a wide-spectrum anti-viral effect. Chinese doctors take the view that anti-viral herbs are effective because they induce immune responses which lead to the elimination of viruses, not because the herbs prevent viral replication. Nevertheless a number of studies have now shown specific anti-HIV effects of a range of anti-viral Chinese herbs in the test tube. Unfortunately, much of this research has not been translated into English, and we must rely on a number of secondary sources written by Chinese physicians for English speaking readers for summaries of this research. The most important herbs include: 36 TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE Viola yeodensitis - inhibits HIV replication in the test tube, but does not kill HIV. Does not inhibit herpes simplex. Does not stimulate interferon production. Also inhibits mycobacterium tuberculosis and many forms of bacteria, and is commonly used to treat viral infections. Andrographis paniculata - inhibits HIV replication and is used to treat tuberculosis Lonicera japonica - inhibits HIV, shigella, salmonella, tuberculosis and many forms of bacteria. Commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis, diarrhoea and lung infections Prunella vulgaris - inhibits HIV, a wide range of bacteria and tuberculosis Senecio scandens - inhibits HIV and protozoa; commonly used as treatment for protozoal and bacterial diarrhoea Epimedium grandiflorum - inhibits HIV and a Hypericum perforatum - inhibits HIV; synthesised as hypericin. Used to treat Hepatitis B in China. The immune-enhancing properties of numerous herbs have been documented by Chinese researchers. The most extensively studied is astragalus (huangqi). It promotes phagocytosis and interferon production in mice, and has also been shown to stimulate antibody production in healthy humans. Astragalus has formed the basis of most Chinese immune enhancing formulas prescribed to people with HIV/AIDS. AIDS and Chinese Medicine and Treating AIDS With Chinese Medicine both summarise research on more than thirty herbs which have demonstrable immune enhancing effects, ranging from increasing the number of white blood cells to increasing antibody production and suppression of allergic reactions. A number of herbs also stimulate the production of red blood cells. Chinese medicine relies upon anti-protozoal herbs to treat malaria, and it has been suggested that some of these herbs might be active against a wide spectrum of protozoa, and therefore of use in treating protozoal infections in people with AIDS. As with anti-viral herbs, Chinese medicine takes the view that the job of herbal treatment is to enhance the body's ability to expel protozoa and parasites, so herbs which are used to treat such infections in China may have no discernable anti-protozoal effect when studied in the test tube. As yet no laboratory or clinical studies have reported results with either Pneumocystis carinii or Cryptosporidium. The basis of most anti-fungal treatments in Chinese medicine is coptis chinensis, which has been extensively studied for its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties in China. Research into TCM treatment for AIDS A number of reports have now assessed the benefits of herbal treatment and acupuncture, but so far there have [Page 37](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/41?q1=directories) been no controlled trials of TCM treatment compared either with no treatment or with orthodox treatment. Doctors at Lincoln Hospital Acupuncture clinic reported on 27 patients who received 7 acupuncture treatments or more. Twenty of these patients reported improvement in symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, and diarrhoea after 1-3 weeks of treatment (Smith). The patients were treated during 1982 and 1983; five were still alive and in good health five years later, four were dead, and the remainder were lost to follow-up. The clinic also reported two cases in which KS tumours cleared completely in individuals receiving acupuncture treatment alone, but no long-term follow-up details are available. Chinese medical researchers working in collaboration with doctors in Tanzania reported improvements in a wide range of symptoms of patients diagnosed with AIDS treated with Chinese herbs. These include relief or disappearance of fever in 22 of 30 cases; relief or disappearance of fatigue in 21 of 29 cases; disappearance or relief of night sweats in 22 of 23 cases; disappearance of diarrhoea in 9 of 18 cases (Su). The report does not provide information on the subsequent health of the people treated; we do not know for instance how many people suffered subsequent opportunistic infections or how many died despite treatment, and how these results compare with standard treatment in that hospital. All the symptoms reported in these studies are subjective, that is to say, they aren't diagnosed by standard tests. What people define as an improvement in symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats and diarrhoea will vary from one person to another. Although a wealth of anecdotal reports exist concerning the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine in relieving symptoms, increasing energy levels and improving a sense of well-being, we still await results from studies which are able to demonstrate that Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture treatment reduce the incidence of opportunistic infections, clears them up and prolongs life. Given the growing number of HIV-positive people who are turning to traditional Chinese medicine as a treatment option, it is vital that research in this area begins to take place which can demonstrate whether or not TCM can provide the dramatic benefits in AIDS which users hope for. The first steps towards such research have been taken by a team of doctors from San Francisco General Hospital and traditional Chinese medical practitioners in the city, who are conducting a randomised, double-blind trial of a Chinese herbal formula against a placebo. The formula is already prescribed by many TCM practitioners to HIV-positive people. Preliminary results presented at the 1993 Ninth International AIDS Conference suggested that those receiving the Chinese herbal preparation were reporting less fatigue and nausea and fewer night sweats. However, a comparison of harder endpoints such as opportunistic infections and CD4 counts was still awaited as this directory went to press. Side-effects There has been considerable publicity attached to recent reports of poisoning by Chinese herbal medicines. It is therefore essential that anyone choosing Chinese herbal medicine as a therapy knows how to choose an experienced practitioner, what situations increase the risk of dangerous reactions to herbal treatment, and the thinking that underlies Chinese herbal prescriptions. No form of medicine can guarantee freedom from adverse reactions. Although Western medicines are tested on large groups of people to check that they are safe and effective, individuals who are subsequently prescribed these 'safe' medications may suffer serious side-effects either because of individual characteristics which could not be controlled for in a large-scale clinical trial, or because the trials which led to the approval of the drug were not conducted carefully enough in the first place or were not large enough to pick up rare but severe adverse reactions. This is where Chinese herbal medicine claims an advantage. Experienced practitioners say that it is possible to devise a combination of herbs to suit the constitution and medical history of the individual. Since the side-effects of all the herbs used in Chinese medicine have been observed over many centuries, it is possible to prescribe a combination of herbs which includes some that alleviate the side-effects of the more toxic ones. A Chinese herbal formula consists of the Emperor, the strongest herb for the principal function of the formula (e.g. clearing Heat); the Minister, a herb which strongly assists the Emperor and may also have an additional function; the Assistants, herbs which either act synergistically to boost the effects of the key herbs, or which act to modify the side-effects or 'over-effects' of the key herbs; and the Messengers, which direct the other herbs to the proper area. Practitioners need to spend quite a lot of time assessing a patient's symptoms before they make a prescription. You should be wary if a practitioner makes a prescription after a five minute consultation, especially if you are told the herbs are strong. Anyone with liver problems should have liver function tests before taking some herbs, and a good practitioner will want to know whether you have had such tests recently. Concern is often expressed by those sceptical of Chinese medicine that batches of herbs may be poisonous or that the potency of the herbs will vary from one batch to another. Chinese herbal practitioners say that the gathering of herbs is conducted according to strict rules which have developed over hundreds of years to ensure that each year's harvest will be similar to that of previous years, and therefore contain active ingredients of the same strength. Incidents of poisoning attributed to Chinese herbs have occurred as a consequence of prescription by incompetent practitioners or because they are contaminated with drugs such as steroids. TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE 37 [Page 38](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/42?q1=directories) Taking Chinese herbal medicines Many medicines are still prepared as teas from dried herbs which are boiled for anything from ten to thirty minutes. Some people find this process tedious and time-consuming. Some commonly used formulae are sold as tea bags which are prepared in much the same way. A common complaint is that herbs taken in this way taste very unpleasant, so much so that some people are unable to continue with the treatment, and there is an increasing trend towards supplying formulas in tablet form. Many of the formulas commonly used by practitioners in the USA to treat AIDS are prescribed as tablets. The drawback of using tablets is the difficulty of adjusting the formula to take into account later changes in symptoms, and this is why practitioners say that studies of such formulae in people with AIDS tend to show inconclusive results. Powdered forms of herbs can be tailor-made into capsules for each prescription, which avoids the unpleasant taste of herbal teas and the chance that the tablet formula will not contain all the suitable ingredients. In chronic conditions and acute problems powdered herbs or tablet forms of herbs are said to be just as effective as boiled herbs, but people suffering from some infections may be prescribed herbs which must be boiled. The form of the prescription will also depend on the patient; some people are more able to tolerate the unusual taste of some herbs than other people. All practitioners we spoke with stressed the importance of avoiding patent medicines commonly sold in Chinese pharmacies; these remedies often contain Western drugs and are responsible for the most of the poisonings attributed to Chinese herbs. Acupuncture Besides herbs, TCM practice also involves acupuncture, dietary advice, massage and QiGong, a form of physical/meditative activity which aims to move qi around the body. Acupuncture treatment involves the stimulation of particular points on the body in order to improve the flow of qi. Sometimes this is done with needles, but in very debilitated people it may be done with finger pressure, massage or moxibustion, the burning of herbs above the skin. Acupuncture treatment will last anything from fifteen minutes to an hour. The patient will have a number of very fine needles inserted into points on the body. This process is usually painless apart from a mild tingling sensation, although some people complain that acupuncture points become slightly painful after a while, especially those in the hands. Acupuncture is reported by many people to be especially helpful in managing fatigue and stress; many people find acupuncture so relaxing they fall asleep on the acupuncturist's table. It's important to be aware that you 38 TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE may well feel very sleepy within a few hours of treatment, depending on the treatment you received. It's best not to plan a long car journey or an active day after receiving acupuncture without consulting the practitioner on the likely effects of the treatment you are receiving. Acupuncture has been reported by many to be helpful in the management of pain and there has been considerable research to investigate why this might be. Researchers have discovered that acupuncture treatment can increase the flow of endorphins, chemicals which can relieve pain. Acupuncture is very widely used for pain relief in China, and even for anaesthesia before operations. Points may also be stimulated manually by a number of massage techniques; shiatsu is the Japanese equivalent (see Shiatsu for further information). The purpose of massage is also to stimulate the flow of qi. Traditional Chinese dietary advice is based on the belief that foods have energetic properties and that a balanced diet is one which balances these energies and also balances out an excess of an energetic force in the body. Thus Cold foods are often indicated when the patient's condition is Heat-induced. Many of these dietary recommendations differ little from those practiced by Western doctors for hundreds of years. Chicken broth, for instance, is considered to be Warm, and is indicated to assist recuperation from illnesses of a Cold nature, such as flu and colds. Treating AIDS with Chinese Medicine contains a very good section on Chinese dietary advice. The duration of the treatment Practitioners of Chinese traditional medicine aim to prescribe to patients for the shortest time possible. However, it is not a quick cure, and a practitioner may use a succession of remedies to deal with different problems as they arise, especially in an immunocompromised individual. With HIV, the treatment is expected to be long-term, because the patient is being treated for prevention, as well as alleviation, of conditions, and continual assessment is essential. Practitioners say that they felt the attitude of the patient is crucial to the success of the treatment, as was a good support system. TCM practitioners who work in hospices say that helping patients to approach death is one of the main functions of their treatment in such circumstances. Treatment can be aimed at the emotions, helping to deal with anger or fear, for instance. Combining TCM with conventional medicine In TCM care must always be taken to avoid unhelpful reactions between herbs or excessive doses of some herbs. Mixing Chinese and Western medical treatment can bring problems such as the exaggeration of drug effects unless the practitioner is fully aware of any other medication you are receiving. [Page 39](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/43?q1=directories) TCM and conventional medicine may be combined in several ways: - TCM treatment to alleviate the side-effects of conventional medications - TCM treatment to rebuild the constitution after conventional medication has eliminated the microorganism causing the problem - TCM diagnostic techniques may predict the forms of opportunistic infection to which the patient will be most vulnerable, and treatment will then work to alleviate problems in these areas - TCM as the main form of treatment, with conventional drug treatment reserved for circumstances in which TCM offers little in the way of effective remedies - TCM may also be of benefit in treating symptoms for which orthodox medicine cannot identify a cause and therefore offer treatment, such as night sweats. However, it should not be used as a substitute for ongoing investigation of the cause of these symptoms. TCM practitioners are conservative in the claims they make about the benefits of TCM in AIDS, but most report considerable success in dealing with symptoms such as night sweats and unexplained fevers, and in rebuilding strength after opportunistic infections. TCM practitioners consider KS to be the most difficult of all opportunistic infections or tumours to treat, and none of the sources we consulted report any success in treating the disorder. Combining TCM with other complementary therapies TCM combines well with reflexology, but Chinese herbs should not be mixed with Western herbs (although acupuncture may combine with Western herbs). Practitioners should always be told what therapies patients are using. Finding an experienced practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine As with any complementary therapy, it is essential that you go to someone who is properly trained and registered with a professional association. Acupuncturists have not by and large received training in Chinese herbal medicine; conversely, many members of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine have studied not only Chinese herbal medicine but acupuncture too. Anyone else who is practising acupuncture and herbal medicine needs to be assessed individually on the basis of their training and experience. You should be suspicious if the practitioner seems uncomfortable about answering questions. The patient should remember that the practitioner is the employee. It is important to know about hygiene: are disposable needles used, or does the practitioner have sterilisation procedures which involve autoclaving acupuncture needles (steam cleaning at a very high temperature)? What experience does the practitioner have with HIV? Experience with cancer may be helpful since it is also a long-term chronic illness. It is important to be aware that different practitioners may have different models of AIDS, and this will lead them to make different decisions about treatment. These issues are discussed in detail inthe book Treating AIDS With Chinese Medicine (see below).

In HIV-positive people for instance, visualisation therapy may take the form of conjuring mental images ofHIV-infected cells being eliminated from the body, or imagining the whole body as healthy and active once more. Visualisation has been used by many people with cancer, and a considerable amount of research now exists to show that whilst people are doing visualisation exercises, their bodies show a physical response. Although some of these physical responses may simply be a consequence of relaxation and concentration, others are less easily explained. A number of experiments, some more well-controlled than others, have shown changes in immune system function following visualisation exercises involving the visualisation of specific immune system cells. These experiments included the use of guided imagery as part of a programme of relaxation and hypnosis in a group of HIV-positive men with symptoms. When compared to a control group, the treatment group demonstrated a significant decrease in HIV-related symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, nausea and insomnia, and felt more energetic and able to cope (Aeurbach). Visualisation exercises are often sold as expensive packages of tapes and training courses, but if you want to test the usefulness of such exercises for yourself, you may find that making up your own exercises or working with a group of like-minded people will prove just as effective. Aeurbach JE et al A behavioural medicine intervention as an adjunctive treatment for HIV-related illness Psychology and Health (1992) * Vitamins and minerals This section looks at claims that vitamins and minerals can enhance or impair immune responses. It summarises current opinion and studies looking at the use of particular vitamins and minerals in HIV-positive people. It is important to note that most vitamins and minerals play an anti-oxidant role and as such work in combination by contributing to many different bodily processes. Anti-oxidants prevent damage to tissues and cells by electrons called free radicals, which are generated as a by-product of inflammation, infection and a host of other bodily processes. Deficiencies or over-abundance of one particular vitamin may have serious effects on the usefulness of others. The rationale for the use of micronutrients in the treatment of HIV and AIDS has been examined in a series of articles in AIDS Treatment Update (issues 13/14, 16 and 17) with an in-depth look at the use of glutathione, beta-carotene and vitamin C in AIDS Treatment Update issue 17. The importance of vitamin deficiencies It is important to bear in mind that whilst research reports deficiencies of many micronutrients in HIV-positive people, especially in people diagnosed with AIDS, the significance of these deficiencies is unclear. They may be due to: - temporary fluctuations as a response to viral infection 40 VISUALISATION [Page 41](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/45?q1=directories) - malabsorption of micronutrients due to gut infections - oxidative stress On the other hand, levels may appear normal in some people as a consequence of the breakdown of tissues during wasting syndrome. Vitamins and minerals previously stored in the tissues may flood into the circulation. The extent to which immunity can be boosted by supplementing micronutrients is a matter of controversy, as indeed is almost any form of 'nutritional medicine'. In the sub-section below on micronutrients we have summarised what is known about the relationship between micronutrients and immunity and where the areas of doubt exist. Until clinical trials currently in the planning stage have been completed, it is unlikely that a clear answer will be available to the question of whether micronutrient deficiencies and supplementation affect the development of immune deficiency in HIV-positive people. In the absence of clear-cut evidence from clinical trials, many HIV-positive people have decided to use vitamin and mineral supplements in order to take advantage of any immune enhancing potential they may have. If you decide to use vitamins and minerals as an adjunct to other treatments, there are several issues worth considering: An absence of some nutrients may negate the usefulness of others. A good baseline is to take a multivitamin and mineral supplement. A multivitamin supplement is available on prescription. Ask your doctor or dietitian about this. Take care not to exceed the toxic dose. If you are taking large doses of some vitamins in addition to a daily multivitamin, check that the combined total doesn't approach a level at which toxicities could occur. Look carefully at the form of the vitamins you choose. Some forms of vitamins are much more easily absorbed by the body than others. See Quality and bioavailability below. Shop around. Vitamins and minerals purchased through reputable buyers clubs are often cheaper than those purchased through health food shops and nutritional advisers. Be sceptical about claims regarding the superiority of some products. It is very hard to be sure whether new formulas really are better than others on the market, or whether they are innovations designed to give companies a competitive edge. Like the pharmaceutical market, the vitamin market is highly competitive and also big business, so many claims made may have a financial incentive. Just because one study has shown that an ingredient appears to improve absorption, is this a convincing reason for spending an extra ~5 a week on that product? Quality and availability of vitamins Most doctors will say that the best place from which to get vitamins and minerals is food. But if you have deficiencies, this suggests that your diet is not currently providing the micronutrients you need (although see above, What is the importance of deficiencies?). Learning more about nutrition will help you identify foods which may be high in micronutrients, but supplementation may give you a better chance of absorbing what you need. In anyone with gut or digestive problems, the breakdown of food is required before vitamins and minerals can be absorbed. This may not always occur. An NHS dietitian can assess your food intake and tell you if you are seriously deficient, but the primary objective of most NHS dietary advice is to avoid weight loss and to maintain energy levels. Supplementation may increase the chance that vitamins will be absorbed, depending on the condition of the gut. Less than half the dietitians at the 1993 HIV Nutrition Team conference said that they provided a full nutritional assessment for HIV-positive patients soon after diagnosis, but a common complaint is that doctors fail to refer patients to dietitians until weight loss has already occurred. Opinions differ on the levels of micronutrient supplementation which are appropriate for people with HIV. The HIV Nutrition Team, in guidelines presented at its annual conference in October 1993, recommended that those with low dietary intakes should be prescribed supplements. Only one complete multivitamin supplement, Forceval, is licensed for prescription through the NHS. Doctors cannot prescribe other over-the-counter supplements which may contain much higher levels of some vitamins such as vitamin C unless they have agreement from the pharmacist of their district health authority to reimburse the cost of these drugs. Inevitably, virtually all pharmacists are unwilling to allocate funds to vitamin supplements without evidence from clinical trials. People with HIV are faced with a bewildering array of vitamin and mineral supplements if they choose to supplement. If you believe that vitamin supplements are useful, you should look for varieties which are more bio-available: those which contain a liquid form of the vitamin, or capsules which contain a powdered form of the vitamin. Compressed tablets take longer to dissolve, especially in people with digestive problems, and the usefulness of time release tablets depends upon the vagaries of your digestive system. Fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin A and E are only absorbed when food reaches the end of the small intestine and time release tablets work by releasing small amounts of mixed nutrients all the way down the digestive tract, not by releasing nutrients at the optimal absorption site. If the tablet is not dissolved VITAMINS AND MINERALS 41 [Page 42](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/46?q1=directories) properly, it may already have passed the point in your gut at which some nutrients are best absorbed, in which case these will be excreted rather than taken up further down the gut, or the tablet may release vitamins before the site at which they can be absorbed. After dissolving into a bioavailable form in the stomach, the nutrient must then be absorbed through the wall of the gut. Some are more easily absorbed than others. Minerals are more easily absorbed when in a chelated form (i.e. attached to amino-acids which can aid the absorption of the mineral). There seems to be little difference between synthetic and natural forms of vitamins in their biovailability, except in the case of vitamin E, the natural form of which is much more easily taken up by the body. Similarly, natural beta-carotene supplies a wider range of carotenoids than synthetic forms and this may make it a more effective anti-oxidant. Supplements should be taken with food in order to enhance their absorption and bioavailability. For people who wish to reduce their yeast intake to avoid stimulating the development of candida, it may be necessary to avoid vitamin tablets which contain yeast in the formula: a surprising number do. Vegetarians are likely to wish to avoid gelatin capsules: gelatin is boiled-down animal hide and bones. Some supplements contain unspecified amounts of sugar and food colourings and some may also contain lactose. Buying vitamins Since many vitamin supplements are not routinely available on NHS prescription, it is worth shopping around to find the best price. A number of organisations are beginning to establish buyers clubs in order to obtain supplements at wholesale prices. Such buyer's clubs are a longstanding feature of US AIDS treatment. Information about buyers clubs will be reported in future editions of AIDS Treatment Update, and can be found in NAM's HIV/AIDS Treatments Directory, Chapter V5. Nutritional advisers who advise on the use of supplements often receive commission from manufacturers or make a profit from selling supplements in addition to charging for consultations. Vitamin A (Beta-carotene) Beta-carotene is converted into an active form of vitamin A in the body as and when needed. Vitamin A on the other hand is toxic in doses above 25,000 international units (i.u.) per day if taken for more than a few weeks, and pregnant women are not recommended to consume more than 25,000 i.u. per day. Signs of toxicity include headaches, nausea, blurred vision, sores on the skin and in more serious cases, internal bleeding, spontaneous fractures and bone malformations. There is some evidence from a small two year study in Italy that beta-carotene improves symptoms and 42 VITAMINS AND MINERALS stabilises CD4 counts in HIV-positive people. These promising results suggest further research is needed to investigate the benefits of beta-carotene. The dose used in this study was 60 mg a day for twenty days out of thirty. The rest period is assumed to be necessary to avoid the gradual lessening of the potential immune-boosting effects of the vitamin. The only side-effect of high doses of beta-carotene is the acquisition of orange skin tone. When this happens it means that fatty tissues are saturated with the vitamin. Food sources: Vitamin A is found in high levels in meat and liver - 75,000 i.u. in half a pound of calves' liver. Look for orange, red and yellow fruits and vegetables for good sources of beta-carotene - carrots, tomatoes, apricots, sweet potatoes - and also broccoli, kale, spinach, lettuce. Vitamin Bi (Thiamin) Alcohol consumption interferes with the absorption and storage of this vitamin, which is essential in the formation and maintenance of muscle and efficient use of carbohydrates as energy in the body. Requirements for this vitamin probably increase during feverish illness as the demand for carbohydrates increases. Food sources: whole grains, wholemeal bread, brown rice and pulses are good sources. Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) Essential building block for glutathione, a key anti-oxidant (See Glutathione below). Deficiency symptoms include cracking at the corner of the mouth and on the lips. Diets low in dairy products are especially likely to be deficient. Food sources: Dairy products, green leafy vegetables, fruits, meat and cereals. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) Essential for the formation of new cells and for maintaining immunity. Studies in animals show a range of immune defects when the diet is deficient. Although deficiency is rare in people eating a normal Western diet, low levels have been observed in people with HIV. Deficiency is difficult to diagnose. The vitamin can reduce the toxicities of the tuberculosis/MAl drug Isoniazid, and one study amongst HIV-positive gay men suggested that those deficient in vitamin B6 were more likely to be depressed and anxious and that when this deficiency was corrected, there was a significant decrease in depression (Shor-Posner). It has been suggested that AZT use increases the need for this vitamin, although studies have shown no clear link. Another study treated 12 HIV positive people with 20-25 mg of vitamin B6 and observed a small increase in CD4 count amongst 8 of the 12 over a six month period. In contrast, an untreated control group showed no improvement in CD4 count (Mantero-Atienza). Doses of more than 2 grammes a day have been shown to cause nerve damage. Watch the quantity contained in [Page 43](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/47?q1=directories) multivitamin supplements; most nutritionists believe 50 mg to be adequate for anyone. Food sources: Meat, whole grains, brewer's yeast and whole grains, wholemeal bread. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Several studies have shown low levels of vitamin B12 in HIV-positive people (Burkes; Harriman). Depletion in body tissues may begin to occur at least a year before blood levels become abnormally low. Vitamin B12 is thought by some doctors to protect against nerve damage and neurological disorders. Injected supplementation has been tested in HIV-positive people by Dr Richard Beach and appears to improve mental functioning (Beach). Another study also showed that vitamin B12 supplementation for at least six months improved mental functioning in HIV-positive people who had been deficient; an untreated control group did not show improvement (Baum). Peripheral neuropathy, a symptom sometimes seen in HIV-positive people and often related to the use of drugs such as ddl and ddC, can be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, so this should always be ruled out before assuming that the neuropathy is HIV-related. As yet there is no evidence that prophylactic treatment with vitamin B12 will reduce the likelihood that neuropathy will develop in those receiving ddl or ddC. It has been suggested that B12 supplementation may reduce the risk of neutropenia and anaemia resulting from AZT use. B12 is used in the production of thymidine phosphate, necessary both to break down AZT in the blood and to create red blood cells. Unless enough of this vitamin is present, AZT competes with red blood cells for available thymidine triphosphate. People who are already deficient in B12 when they begin AZT therapy may be more vulnerable to anaemia and neutropenia (Richman). However, a 1989 study showed that B12 supplementation does not reduce AZT toxicities once therapy has begun (McCutchan). Absorption of vitamin B12 in HIV-positive people with gastrointestinal problems is poor unless the vitamin is injected or taken in a form that will dissolve in the mouth and be absorbed across the mucous membranes, according to some nutritionists. This vitamin treatment is available on NHS prescription for dietary deficiency. All the B vitamins operate in combination, and also act in conjunction with other vitamins and minerals, so vitamin B12 is best taken alongside a B-complex formula. Food sources: Fish, dairy products, kidneys, liver, eggs, beef, pork. Vegans' diets are especially likely to lack vitamin B12. Vitamin C Essential for immune functions; a deficiency may result in lowered levels of T-cells. Jariwalla and colleagues have observed in laboratory studies that very high concentrations of vitamin C can prevent HIV from infecting new cells and prevent the activation and replication of HIV in dormant infected cells. Vitamin C also dramatically reduced the formation of syncytia, clumps of dysfunctional T-cells which form around an HIV-infected T-cell in the test tube (Harakeh). Syncytia tend to appear more frequently when CD4 counts are falling rapidly, and it has been theorised that their appearance may indicate an increased chance that AIDS-related illnesses will develop. As well as being a potentially powerful anti-viral, vitamin C is required by the immune cells which fight bacterial and fungal infections. High levels of vitamin C assist phagocytes in identifying and destroying candida and other fungi, suggesting that vitamin C may play a role in protection against fungal infections. Vitamin E is thought to to play a similar role, and has been shown to reduce the level of such infections in the elderly, who often have poor immune function. The presence of vitamin C is also crucial to the effectiveness of enzymes in the liver which remove toxins from the body. However, high doses of vitamin C cause diarrhoea, a sign that the gut can absorb no more of the vitamin. Bowel tolerance varies from one person to another and is believed to depend upon the ability of the individual to metabolise the vitamin. People with acute illnesses such as PCP are reported to have tolerated doses of 60-150 grammes a day before the onset of diarrhoea, but in people with no symptoms, Professor Jariwalla (director of Immunodeficiency Research at the Linus Pauling Institute in California) says he believes doses of at least 10 grammes a day are needed in order to produce the viral inhibition he observed in his laboratory studies. Other researchers and treatment advocates take the view that doses much higher than 10-12 grammes a day may have unforeseeable long-term side-effects and that doses higher than this should be used only in the case of an acute infection, and only then under medical supervision. High doses of vitamin C may cause kidney stones, due to excess acidity. It is possible to test for susceptibility to kidney stones by doing tests for oxalic acid excretion in urine at different levels of vitamin C use. If oxalic acid excretion increases as the dose increases, an individual is vulnerable, but protection against elevated levels of oxalic acid is provided by taking 50 mg of vitamin B6 and a magnesium supplement alongside vitamin C. A more serious reaction to high doses of intravenous vitamin C may be experienced by people who have a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This deficiency affects about 10% of people of African, African-American and Mediterranean origin, and intravenous high dose vitamin C may lead to a severe reaction as red blood cells cease to transport oxygen. If you are taking high doses of vitamin C it is important to be aware that high levels of the vitamin can affect the results of blood tests for glucose, so you if are having such tests you should tell your doctor. VITAMINS AND MINERALS 43 [Page 44](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/48?q1=directories) Different forms of vitamin C are available. Ascorbic acid is a highly acidic powder, which can cause stomach pain and discomfort when taken in large doses. Calcium ascorbate is a less acidic form of vitamin C buffered with calcium which tastes so unpleasant it makes some people feel sick. It can be dissolved in fruit juice or any liquid to mask the taste. Tablets are a much more expensive way of taking the vitamin in large quantitities, but some manufacturers claim that one form of tableted ascorbate, ester-C, yields three times as much vitamin C in the body i.e. a 1 gramme tablet yields 3 grammes when metabolised. Food sources: Fresh fruit and vegetables, although these sources cannot supply the high levels claimed to be protective. Vitamin D Limited evidence about this vitamin suggests that high levels may actually have an immune suppressive effect and that it may stimulate HIV production. This evidence is based on test tube studies. On the other hand, the active form of vitamin D has also been shown to stimulate macrophages, white blood cells which combat opportunistic infection such as tuberculosis. Food sources: Vitamin D production is stimulated by sunlight, but the vitamin is not abundant in foods, except for oily fish, egg yolks and liver. Vitamin E An important anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory, often lacking in HIV-positive people. Vitamin E is necessary to ensure the optimum functioning of cell membranes. Deficiency may interfere with efficient immune functions, but so may doses above 600 i.u. a day. Vitamin E stimulates CD4 cell proliferation at high doses. It's not known whether this is beneficial at all, or any, stages of HIV infection. The safe dose is not yet known. Vitamin E has been shown to improve the anti-viral effect of AZT in the test tube, but it has no anti-viral effect on its own. There are no studies of its specific benefits in HIV-positive people except in the improvement of seborrheic dermatitis. Italian doctors found that HIV-positive people with ARC who took 300-600 i.u. of vitamin E with selenium and methionine saw improvements in seborrheic dermatitis and overall white blood cell count (Ippolito). Food sources: Whole grains, cereals, eggs, sunflower and olive oil, green leafy vegetables. Folate / Folic acid Supplements of folate are already prescribed to many symptomatic HIV-positive people due to deficiencies caused by a range of treatment drugs and by malabsorption in the intestine. Folate deficiency is also common in smokers. Serious deficiency can lead to platelet disorders and a decrease in white blood cells. Food sources: Green leafy vegetables, oranges, beans, liver, rice and brewer's yeast Glutathione HIV-positive people have unusually low levels of glutathione, often referred to as GSH in scientific reports (Staal). Glutathione is essential for the proper functioning of T-lymphocytes and is an important anti-oxidant (Hamilos). A shortage of glutathione impairs immune response. A number of researchers have speculated that boosting levels of glutathione will have a protective effect in people at risk for the development of AIDS. Very high levels of glutathione have been observed in the CD8 cells of those species of monkeys which do not go on to develop simian AIDS after SIV infection, whilst those which develop simian AIDS display a rapid fall in glutathione levels soon after infection. This research suggests that glutathione plays an important role in the cellular immune response, and that human inability to hold HIV in check may relate in part to glutathione deficiency (Staal, 1992; Droge). When fifteen asymptomatic HIV-positive people treated with 600-1200 mg of NAC for six months were compared with a an untreated group, the NAC-treated group showed a clear advantage in terms of T-cell function and T-cell loss. The two groups were not compared for the effect of NAC on symptoms related to immune suppression (Gougeon; Olivier). NAC/glutathione may also protect against some of the adverse effects of anti-PCP drugs such as dapsone and Septrin. Those who are deficient in glutathione are more likely to experience toxicity from these sulphonamide drugs, because glutathione is essential for the metabolism of such drugs by human cells. 15-30% of people with HIV experience serious allergic or hypersensitive reactions to sulphonamide drugs, compared with just 1% of the HIV-negative population. A trial is now underway in Canada to test whether NAC, given alongside Septrin used as PCP prophylaxis, can reduce the incidence and the severity of allergic reactions. In the test tube, NAC's anti-HIV activity increased eight-fold when combined with ascorbate (vitamin C). Because glutathione is recycled over and over again if sufficient vitamin C and other antioxidants are present, it has been suggested that high doses of vitamin C (1 2 grammes a day minimum in the view of Professor Jariwalla) may preserve glutathione levels more effectively than NAC or other cysteine precursors, as the building blocks for glutathione are called. Toxicity studies have noted diarrhoea, heartburn and occasional vomiting as side-effects, but these effects did not increase in incidence or severity as researchers increased the dose. NAC is inadvisable for people with a history of stomach ulcers, a high level of alcohol consumption or those who use aspirin daily. Drug interactions may occur with the antifungal amphotericin B and the antibiotics ampicillin, erythromycin and some forms of tetracycline. The standard dose being used is 600 mg three times daily. Levels higher than this are probably counter-productive. 44 VITAMINS AND MINERALS [Page 45](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/49?q1=directories) The results of studies which can tell us whether glutathione prevents the development of AIDS-related illnesses are still awaited. In the meantime many people with HIV and AIDS in the USA continue to use NAC obtained through buyers clubs. Acetylcysteine, a related form of cysteine, is available on prescription in certain circumstances in the UK, but it is very unlikely that it will be prescribed to HIV-positive people. NAC can be obtiane from buyer's clubs in the USA, details of which can found in Chapter V5 of NAM's HIV/AIDS Treatments Directory. Food sources: Eggs, meat, dairy products and some cereals. Iron Iron is important for immunity, but at certain times too much iron may be counter-productive. During an acute infection, iron is removed from the blood and stored in the liver. There is some evidence that this response prevents the growth of bacteria, since high levels of iron seem to stimulate the growth of bacteria. On the other hand, iron deficiency causes a fall in T-cell numbers, reducing immunity to infection. Unless there is clear iron deficiency anaemia (not AZT-related anaemia) there is no good reason to supplement iron. Food sources: Meat (especially liver), poultry, fish L-carnitine L-carnitine is an amino-acid which helps move fatty acids in cells. When the body doesn't get enough carnitine, fats are trapped in cells, and immune system cells may be less responsive to infections. Deficiency results in malfunctioning of the heart. Deficiency has been noted in people with AIDS, and one study in 20 men with advanced AIDS showed that patients given 6 grammes a day for two weeks showed marked reduction in serum triglycerides when compared with a placebo group, and their beta-2 microglobulin fell to almost normal levels. In the test tube carnitine is able to suppress the production of tumour necrosis factor, elevated levels of which are thought to be responsible for wasting in HIV-positive people. Researchers also found that those who received carnitine reported less fatigue and greater energy (De Simone). Selenium Another important anti-oxidant which plays a role in immune responses; a lack of selenium in the diet has been shown to increase the risk of cancer in both USA and China. Selenium is an essential building block for glutathione and is crucial in preserving healthy cells. Low levels of selenium have been observed in a number of studies of HIV positive people. Although only tiny quantities of selenium are needed, and can be found in a wide range of foods such as onions, garlic, broccoli, fish, wholegrains and cabbage, deficiency is usually the result of very low levels of selenium in the soil in which plants grow rather than poor diet. A good multivitamin should contain adequate quantities of selenium to ensure that nutrititional needs are met. Large quantities (above 750 micrograms) may cause immune suppression and the loss of hair, as well as affecting the skin, nervous system and teeth. Food sources: Broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, celery, cucumbers, onions, garlic, grains, radishes dependent on the selenium content of the soil in which they grow. Zinc An important anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mineral which plays a key role in immune functions. An adequate level of zinc improves resistance to infections, boosts antibody production, maintains levels of hormones in the thymus (the organ responsible for producing T-cells) and permits vigorous T-cell responses. Zinc competes with copper for absorption. A two and half year study in asymptomatic HIV-positive people showed that significantly lowered levels of zinc in serum (and correspondingly elevated levels of copper) were a strong predictor of progression to AIDS. The study failed to show any relationship between dietary intake of zinc and serum levels, suggesting that supplementation may not slow disease progression (Graham). However, another smaller study showed that when compared with an untreated HIV-negative group, eleven HIV-positive men who received 1 mg/kg body weight (about 60-70 mg a day for the average adult male) of zinc sulphate for ten weeks gained weight and showed a moderate increase in CD4 count (Isa). Italian researchers found that giving 200 mg of zinc sulphate for 30 days to AZT-treated people reduced the subsequent incidence of opportunistic infections in the study group when compared with a control group of AZT-treated patients. The study followed 18 people with lymphadenopathy but no other symptoms and 12 people who had already been diagnosed with AIDS. The study followed patients for two years and noted 9 opportunistic infections in the symptomatic, zinc-treated group compared with 26 in the control group. In the lymphadenopathy group only one zinc-treated individual developed an opportunistic infection compared with 13 in the AZT-only group. There was a clear difference in the incidence of PCP, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus and TB between the AZT-only and the AZT plus zinc groups, but none in the incidence of CMV disease or oesophageal candidiasis. The study report provides no information on whether patients were matched for length of time on AZT or CD4 count, nor whether they were randomised to the control group or the zinc treatment group (Mocchegiani). This study needs to be treated with caution because of the confounding effect of AZT treatment on zinc status. Dr Richard Beach has noted that in a group of patients who began AZT treatment, serum zinc levels continued to decline, whilst a matched group of patients who did not receive AZT showed no change in zinc status. Some studies have shown that low serum zinc is a strong predictor of CD4 decline. Overdosing with zinc is dangerous: it can impair immune responses and disrupt the metabolism of iron in the VITAMINS AND MINERALS 45 [Page 46](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/50?q1=directories) body, leading to anaemia. Doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended and anaemia and neutropenia have been noted in people receiving doses above 50 mg a day. Zinc comes in several forms; if taking a supplement you should check what quantity of elemental zinc is contained in the supplement. High zinc intake is especially dangerous in people with candida. If supplementing it is important to ensure an adequate intake of copper and selenium, since these minerals compete for absorption. Intakes of zinc as low as 50mg a day have been shown to interfere with the utilisation of copper and lead to symptoms such as lowered white blood cell count, lack of resistance to bacterial infections and to anaemia. Food sources: Whole-grian products, brewers' yeast, wheat bran and germ, seafoods and animal meats.

We have included only those compounds we know to have a history of use amongst HIV-positive people. This section summarises research findings on each compound, as well as summarising the trends in ancedotal evidence. This section is included in recognition of the fact that for many people with HIV, the use of plant derived medicines has gone hand in hand with the use of complementary and alternative therapies. Many of these substances have been used and advocated in the belief that they are natural and non-toxic alternatives to orthodox medications. * Aloe vera The aloe vera is a succulent plant long used to heal burns and cuts. Today an extract from the leaves is used as the basis of many cosmetics, especially to soothe sunburnt skin. Aloe vera juice and a freeze-dried extract from the plant, acemennan, have both been used by HIV-positive people in the United States. Aloe vera has been investigated widely in the US and Russia in an attempt to discover which chemical constituents have made it such a useful medicine to herbalists. Investigators have noted high levels of anti-inflammatory and antiseptic compounds, as well as pain killing and wound healing constituents. Aloe vera also contains chemicals active against parasites and high levels of minerals, vitamins and amino-acids. The plant also contains high levels of a ALOE VERA 47 [Page 48](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/52?q1=directories) polysaccharide, acemennan, which has been shown to inhibit HIV replication in the test tube, stimulate macrophages and boost the anti-viral effects of a combination of AZT and acyclovir in the test tube (MacDaniel). Acemennan is also known by its trade name, Carrisyn. Most aloe vera products contain such low concentrations of juice from the plant that it is doubtful that any of the potentially beneficial substances are present in high enough concentrations to inhibit viruses or kill bacteria. Aloe products using only the juice (the water stored in the leaves) are much less potent than those containing the sap (the bitter yellow resin) and the best extracts of aloe vera are likely to be those which are heat-processed extracts of the whole leaf. No processed aloe vera extracts are likely to have the dramatic wound-healing powers of the leaf, which is often applied to cuts and burns with speedy results in areas where the plant grows wild. This is because the enzymes which accelerate healing are destroyed by all processing methods. If not processed, aloe vera extracts can cause severe diarrhoea. Purified acemennan is produced by a number of processes; some AIDS treatment publications have suggested that it may enhance the effectiveness of anti-viral drugs such as AZT and reduce their toxicities. However, a Canadian placebo-controlled study showed no benefit (Ruedy; Singer). Carrington Laboratories, a manufacturer of acemennan in the United States, presented data at the Ninth International AIDS Conference which provided follow-up information on participants in a 1986 trial of acemennan. Those who had maintained a daily intake of 500-800mg of acemennan over six years had an average CD4 count of 346, almost identical to their average CD4 count on entry to the trial in 1986. The average CD8 count had risen from 359 to 1395. In contrast, those who had not maintained acemennan intake had died (although the report does not provide clear information on how many individuals were recruited to the original trial, so we cannot be certain that everyone who ceased acemennan therapy subsequently died). The authors suggest that the survival of these patients may be explained by the very high levels of CD8 cells, and that acemennan may activate CD8 cells, as previously demonstrated in laboratory studies. The report does not give any details of other treatments received during the six year follow-up, nor of any symptoms reported during the follow-up period (MacDaniel). On the basis of this report alone it is difficult to be certain whether or not acemennan provides long term benefit and more rigorous trials are needed.

Artemisia has been used as an anti-malarial drug in China for two thousand years, but it has recently been discovered that artemisia also inhibits toxoplasmosis in the test tube (Ou-Yang). It has been suggested that artemisia may also be active against Pneumocystis carinii, but there is no laboratory or clinical evidence to support this view. References Ou-Yang K et al Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 34: 1961-65 (1990) * Astragalus Astragalus is an extract of the plant Astragalus membranaceus and is used in Chinese herbal medicine to boost the immune system. It has been shown to reverse immunosuppression in rats and to boost the proliferation of human lymphocytes in the test tube (Da-Tong; Yan Sun). Astragalus, a major component of many Chinese herbal preparations, has been shown to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation. However, astragalus can trigger low blood pressure and low blood sugar and can increase the amount of urine produced, resulting in feeling of dizziness and fatigue. In addition, the effects of astragalus on the replication of HIV are still unknown. It is possible that astragalus, like many immune boosters, might stimulate the production of HIV by infected cells.

It resembles a bumpy cucumber and comes from the same family as trichosanthes,from which compound Q is derived. Bitter melon has long been used as a diabetes treatment. Juice from the leaves and fruit has anti-bacterial and anti-parasitic properties and the leaves, fruit and seeds all contain chemicals which can induce abortion (Cunnick). A chemical which inhibits the replication of viruses, including the herpes simplex virus, has been identified (Foa-Tomasi), as has a compound which can prevent HIV from infecting cells in the test tube. This compound shows strong similarities to the anti-HIV compound isolated from trichosanthin, compound Q, which has been shown to kill HIV-infected macrophages. It has been suggested that bitter melon may represent a less toxic source of the agent which makes compound Q such a potent anti-viral in the test tube, but so toxic in the body. Bitter melon also stimulates the production of natural killer cells in the test tube, which play a role in regulating the development of tumours (Jilka). Another study suggests that bitter melon may have harmful effects on the immune system. One study using extracts of bitter melon seeds showed that the seed extracts could severely suppress immune functions such as the proliferation of lymphocytes, the activation of macrophages and the overall activity of T-lymphocytes in mice. Many people with AIDS in the United States have taken to using bitter melon after reports began to circulate of the extraordinary effect it was thought to have on the T-cell count and general health of HIV-positive users. No research has yet been conducted to measure the effects of bitter melon on the health of HIV-positive people, so it's impossible to tell how valid these reports might be. Bitter melon fruits and leaves are available from many Asian grocery stores and advocates of this therapy in the US recommend that it be taken as an enema of the liquefied or boiled fruit or leaves. An enema is recommended in order to avoid contact with stomach acids which might inactivate some of the beneficial compounds in bitter melon. The enema should be held in the bowel for as long as possible, say advocates of the treatment. It is suggested that 12-16 ounces of boiled leaves or pulp be used each day.

Echinacea was subsequently adopted by herbal practitioners who learnt of its value from native Americans, and it became a commonly used herbal medicine in Germany where much research has been conducted into the effects of the plant. Two species of echinacea are commonly used for medicinal purposes: echinacea purpurea and echinacea angustifolia. Echinacea is a potent immune stimulator and may also have anti-viral properties. These properties cannot be isolated from an individual chemical constituent of the plant, but seem to act in combination in extracts of the whole plant. Unfortunately much of the research on echinacea has been conducted using purified forms of the plant extract rather than the powdered or diluted forms commonly available through health food stores. Any differences in strength or effectiveness are unknown. BITTER MELON 49 [Page 50](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/54?q1=directories) Adverse reactions to echinacea are few and far between, according to herbalists, although application of strong tinctures of echinacea to the skin sometimes causes irritation. This can be avoided by diluting the tincture. Echinacea has not been tested as an anti-HIV compound, but may have anti-viral properties. Cells treated with echinacea extract have been shown to resist subsequent infection when a virus is introduced into the cell culture. Echinacea did not prevent viral replication when it was added to cell cultures already infected. Laboratory studies using a purified extract of echinacea have shown that it stimulates macrophages to release tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-1 and beta-interferon. Whether this form of immune stimulation is beneficial in HIV-positive people is a matter of debate. In people with already elevated levels of TNF-alpha and beta-interferon, further immune stimulation may be counter-productive. Some herbalists do not prescribe echinacea to HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 200. It is often suggested by herbalists that for echinacea to be an effective immune stimulant, it should not be used daily. Many practitioners will recommend periods of abstinence of perhaps ten days a month. A 1989 study by the US National Cancer Institute suggests that daily use of echinacea may suppress the immune response (Luettig). Other studies using very high doses have drawn similar conclusions. At present there is no hard evidence either that echinacea is a beneficial immune stimulant in HIV-positive people, or that it has harmful effects on immunity, but these findings indicate that it should be used with care, in consultation with an experienced herbalist whilst undergoing regular monitoring. Echinacea has also been shown to reduce the recurrence of vaginal yeast infections such as candida. In a study comparing those who had been randomised to received echinacea in oral tablet form as a supplement to a standard vaginal anti-fungal cream with those who received only standard treatment, only 16% of the echinacea group experienced a recurrence within 6 months, compared with 60% of the standard treatment group. It should be noted that this study was not conducted in HIV-positive women and looked at localised anti-fungal treatment rather than the systemic anti-fungals commonly prescribed to HIV-positive individuals.

The Greeks and Romans used raw garlic as an antibiotic, to cure coughs, to heal wounds and sores and to prevent colds. In recent centuries garlic has been reputed to provide protection against bubonic plague and to cure cholera and smallpox. Garlic extract is often prescribed as an antibiotic, particularly in cases of ear, nose and throat infections, by doctors in Russia and Eastern Europe. It was also widely used during the Second World War by German and Russian doctors to treat septic wounds when drugs were scarce. Recent research has shown that garlic contains a potent anti-bacterial, allicin, the compound responsible for the pungent taste and smell of garlic. Garlic also contains adenosine, a chemical which has been shown to reduce levels of cholestorol in the blood. Chinese doctors report that a garlic oil extract given intravenously to bone marrow transplant patients was more succesful than a conventional drug regimen in preventing the development of CMV-related interstitial pneumonia (Lu). However, this study was conducted in only a small number of patients, and does not provide enough information on the standard incidence of CMV-related interstitial pneumonia amongst bone marrow patients treated in China to judge whether it is a superior form of treatment. Garlic extract has also been used in combination with amphotericin B to treat cryptococcal meningitis in cases where amphotericin B has failed to produce improvement or had produced marked liver toxicity (Cai). It is also widely used as anti-fungal agent in China (Davis). The mechanism suggested to account for garlic's anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-protozoal effects is its ability to affect lipid and cholesterol synthesis in the capsule of the microorganism. Garlic is unable to inhibit the replication of viruses which lack a lipid capsule. Its inhibitory effects have not been tested on HIV. There is some dispute amongst garlic experts as to the best form in which to take garlic in order to benefit from its potent anti-bacterial effects. Raw, crushed garlic is said by some to be the most potent form but taking garlic in this way is uncomfortable for many because it causes burning in the mouth and throat, and leads to an unavoidable stench as garlic fumes are excreted from the pores and on the breath. It may also cause discomfort in the gut. Use in very large quantities for long periods could result in bleeding and ulceration in the digestive tract. Mixing raw garlic with honey may make it more palatable, as may chopping up the garlic and swallowing it without chewing, but most people prefer garlic to be cooked. Whether or not cooking garlic diminishes some of its beneficial effects is a matter of debate amongst garlic researchers. 50 GARLIC [Page 51](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/55?q1=directories) Garlic pills are now widely available in health food stores, containing garlic oil. This is probably less effective than fresh garlic because it contains diallyl disulphide, a weaker anti-bacterial than allicin. However, aged raw garlic extract is thought to be as potent as raw garlic, and does not cause the bad breath, flatulence or body odour associate with raw garlic and garlic oil. Animal toxicity studies suggest it can be used at very high doses for long periods without appreciable toxicity (Imada). However garlic can have unpleasant side effects if used raw: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and skin rash have been reported. In addition, garlic can also inhibit blood clotting, and if taken in large quantities for long periods, may interfere with thyroid function.

In test tube studies it has been shown to improve the ability of phagocytes to engulf foreign organisms and to increase natural killer cell activity. It has also been shown to increase CD8 cell activity against foreign organisms or infected cells which have been 'tagged' by antibodies. Iscador is an unlicensed, experimental drug. It has also been used experimentally for the treatment of cancer. A small study in people with HIV who had CD4 counts above 200 suggested that it may have immune-stimulating and/or antiviral effects which merit further study. After 12 weeks 28 of 36 partcipants in the study had experienced increases in CD4 count greater than 20%, and 2 of 8 participants who had been p24 antigen positive had become antigen negative by the end of the study (Gorter). Iscador is given by injection. Some people have reported painful swelling at the injection site and slight fever. It can cause photosensitivity - a severe skin rash following exposure to sunlight - which is thought to be dose-related. In addition, hypericin heightens the effects of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor anti-depressants mentioned under ginseng.

Glycyrrhizin is the name of the extract from the root of the liquorice plant glycyrrhizia radix. Although little is known about the immunomodulatory or anti-viral effects of liquorice, there has been some interest in glycyrrhizin as an anti-HIV treatment in Japan, where the root extract is prescribed in a formulation called Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC), which also contains cysteine and glycine. These ingredients target the compound specifically to the liver and prevent it from disturbing the regulation of reabsorption of sodium and potassium in the kidneys. Another formulation of glycyrrhizin, Glycyron, also contains glycine and cysteine. Adverse reactions reported include low potassium levels, muscle weakness and soreness, high blood pressure and fluid retention. In 1993 Japanese researchers reported a significant improvement in liver function amongst 42 HIV-positive haemophiliacs treated with intravenous doses of either 100-200 or 400-800 ml of glycyrrhizin for eleven weeks. Some improvement in other HIV-related symptoms such as lymphadenopathy was also noted during the treatment period. There was no control group. The authors suggested that prophylactic treatment with glycyrrhizin to prevent liver dysfunction in seropositive haemophiliacs is indicated by the results (Mori). Laboratory studies show that glycyrrhizin has anti-HIV effects; in particular, it has been demonstrated that glycyrrhizin can block cell-to-cell HIV infection, whereas AZT cannot (Ito; Tochikura; Hirabayashi). The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, since it has no measurable effect on reverse transcriptase. It can also reduce levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production ISCADOR 51 [Page 52](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/56?q1=directories) by cells in the test tube. TNF plays a role in the wasting seen in AIDS and may trigger dormant viruses such as HIV to reproduce in cells. (Mashiba). Glycyrrhizin is not an anti-oxidant, as some researchers have speculated, but does exert an anti-inflammatory effect (Akamatsu).

Extracts of StJohn's Wort are sold in health food shops as herbal remedies. A substance derived from St John's Wort, hypericin, has been shown to have powerful anti-HIV effects in the test tube. It was shown to inhibit the production of new virus particles from the surface of infected cells. A synthetic form of hypericin was developed and tested in humans, but the results have been mixed. Hypericin has a serious side-effect: it causes severe sensitivity to sunlight in lighter-skinned people, and hypersensitivity to hot and cold. This side-effect is reversible when hypericin is stopped. Extracts of St John's Wort available from health food shops tend to contain around 0.14% hypericin. Studies using such preparations have shown no evidence of benefit. A higher concentration herbal preparation, containing 4.4% hypericin, is also available through buyers' clubs. * Siberian ginseng Siberian ginseng (eleutherococcus senticosus) is an adaptogen, a compound thought to be able to normalise the functioning of the body whatever form of disease is present. It should not be confused with forms ofpanax ginseng (Chinese or Korean) available in health food shops. All the research into Siberian ginseng has been carried out in the former Soviet Union. Siberian ginseng has been shown to stimulate the activity of killer and helper T-cells (CD8 and CD4). It has also been shown to reduce chemotherapy side-effects and appears to increase resistance to viral infections. Eleutherococcus has been shown to produce cases of insomnia, morning diarrhoea, nervousness, depression, confusion, skin rash and high blood pressure. Ginseng is also known to increase the effects of a family of anti-depressant drugs called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (prescribed as Marplan, Nardil, Parnate and Manerix), and patients taking these drugs should refrain from taking ginseng. In addition, women taking ginseng sometimes experience swollen and tender breasts as well as the absence of periods, probably due to the small amounts of oestrogen in these plants.

Research into the use of tea tree oil as an antiseptic and antifungal has been going on since the 1930s. In 1937 it was shown that an undiluted solution of tea tree oil could be used safely in the treatment of skin conditions, thrush, gingivitis, psoriasis and mouth ulcers (Penfold). Subsequent labortaory tests have shown that tea tree oil is active against a wide range of bacteria and fungi in very low concentrations, including forms of staphylococcus and candida. 52 ST JOHN'S WORT [Page 53](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.002/57?q1=directories) In 1960 a study of 96 cases of vaginal thrush showed resolution of symptoms in all cases after 6 treatments of 0.4% tea tree oil solution (Feinblatt). In 1985 a study of 28 women suffering vaginal thrush demonstrated disappearance of symptoms in 23 of 28 women treated with pessaries of tree tea oil (Belaiche). Tea tree oil is widely used in Australia as a treatment for athlete's foot and other fungal infections of the feet. In 1972 it was reported that 58 of 60 patients applying tea tree oil to the affccted area experienced an improvement in symptoms; in 38 cases symptoms were either eliminated or virtually disappeared (Walker). A 1991 study recruited 50 patients with a wide range of skin and mouth complaints such as acne, apthous ulcers, fungal infection of finger nails, eczema and unspecified skin rashes. They were treated with 100% tea tree oil for one to four weeks depending on the severity of their condition. All apart from one showed signs of improvement, although the study report is unable to specify the nature of the improvement experienced by participants in the study (Shemesh). There are also anecdotal reports of success in treating gum disease and infected wounds with tea tree oil. Tea tree oil can also stimulate profuse sweating if used as a bath oil, but may act as an anti-fungal prophylaxis if used in this way.
