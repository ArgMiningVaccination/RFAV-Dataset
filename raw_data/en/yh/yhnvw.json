The goal of energy therapy is to unblock the flow of energy and restore energetic balance. Based on ancient healing traditions from Asia, energy therapies are now well-established throughout the world as techniques for easing pain, reducing anxiety and combating side effects of cancer treatment. Energy work is meant to be a complementary therapy, used in conjunction with, but not as a replacement for conventional medical treatment. Sutter's Institute for Health & Healing offers a variety of energy therapy services, including: - Acupressure, part of [Traditional Chinese Medicine](/services/holistic-integrative-medicine/acupuncture-traditional-chinese-medicine), uses the same energy meridians and pressure points as acupuncture, but using fingers and elbows \u2014 rather than needles \u2014 to apply pressure. - Craniosacral therapy uses a soft touch to release energy restrictions in the craniosacral system, made up of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround the brain and spinal cord. - Jin Shin Jyutsu energy work, based on the principles of acupuncture, seeks to restore the energy flow in your body along energy meridians. - Healing touch therapy uses gentle, non-invasive touch to restore balance and health to the energy system. It can be used to relieve anxiety and control pain. - Reiki energy therapy, which originated in Japan, is based on the principle that a trained Reiki therapist can channel energy into a person through touch. This energetic healing activates the body's own natural healing process to restore physical and emotional well-being. - Polarity therapy uses bodywork, counseling, nutritional healing and exercise to balance and heal the body's energy system.
