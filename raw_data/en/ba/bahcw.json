Metta/Loving-Kindness Meditation Metta is an Indian word translated into the meaning of loving-kindness, benevolence, or good will. In this meditation, rather than focusing on the breath, loving, kind, and compassionate thoughts are sent out into the world with the hope of releasing pain or discomfort in others. In Metta meditation, loving-kindness is directed towards ourselves, secondly to someone we love, then to someone we are neutral towards, then to someone we have difficulty with, and then toward all human beings everywhere. An example of a Metta meditation would be: - May you be safe and protected - May you be happy - May you be healthy and strong - May you be at peace and at ease Transcendental Meditation Transcendental Meditation (TM) was created in India by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1950s, and became popular in the 1960s and 1970s. TM is taught by certified teachers who have been trained by the Maharishi Foundation's Transcendental Meditation program. There is an instruction fee for the TM courses. The TM technique involves the use of a mantra which is repeated silently twice a day for 20 minutes with closed eyes. Zen Meditation Zen meditation is an ancient Buddhist tradition originally from China. From China it spread to Korea, Japan, and throughout Asia. Zen is usually practiced seated crossed legged on a mat or cushion. The back is straight, the mouth is closed, and the eyes are kept lowered. Zen meditation is practiced by focusing all of one's attention on the movement of the breath going in and out of one's nose. Another technique is to allow thoughts to flow through the mind without judgment, remaining in the present moment, without dwelling on thoughts or anything within the environment. Mindfulness Meditation Mindfulness meditation is modeled after the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program created in 1979 by Jon Kabat-Zinn. It is the practice of focusing on the present moment, accepting, but not judging the bodily sensations, thoughts, and emotions that arise. When your mind wanders during the meditation, gently return your attention to the breath. Mantra Meditation Mantra meditation is composed of chanting mantras and meditating. A mantra is composed of a few words or syllables that can be easily repeated. When chanting mantras, the vibration can be felt in the lower belly, and each mantra has a different vibration which corresponds to your intention for the meditation. Therefore, it is important to set an intention for your meditation practice, and select an uplifting, inspiring mantra. Qigong Qigong (chee-gong) is an ancient Chinese mind-body exercise and healing technique which consists of meditation, controlled breathing, and movement exercises. The translation of Qigong is mastery of your energy. Tai Chi is considered a form of Qigong. Christian Meditation Christian Meditation is a form of contemplative prayer which calls on Christians to fill their minds with God and His truth, and to increase their knowledge of Jesus' life. This can be done through focusing and meditating on the teachings and the meaning of Biblical scriptures and their relationship to God's love. Guided Meditation Guided meditation is a method using the senses of sight, sounds, smells, and textures, and images of relaxing places or situations are mentally formed. Guided meditation is led by a teacher either in person, or through audio or video media. Instructional apps are available for expert meditation guidance, or patients can participate in local in-person meditation classes in their area. Whichever method of meditation is preferred, common features include focused attention, relaxed breathing, a quiet setting, a comfortable position, and an open attitude.
