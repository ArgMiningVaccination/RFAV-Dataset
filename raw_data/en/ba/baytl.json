They are manufactured from human plasma containing anti-D. A single dose of RhoGAM contains sufficient anti-D (300 \u00b5g or 1500 IU) to suppress the [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm) to up to 15 mL of Rh-positive [red blood cells](https://www.rxlist.com/red_blood_cells/definition.htm).4,15 A single dose of MICRhoGAM contains sufficient anti-D (50 \u00b5g or 250 IU) to suppress the immune response to up to 2.5 mL of Rh-positive red blood cells. The anti-D dose is measured by comparison to the RhoGAM in- [house](https://www.rxlist.com/house/definition.htm) reference standard, the potency of which is established relative to the U.S./ [World Health Organization](https://www.rxlist.com/world_health_organization/definition.htm)/European [Pharmacopoeia](https://www.rxlist.com/pharmacopoeia/definition.htm) Standard NIBSC 01/572 (285 IU/ampoule).16 Plasma for RhoGAM is typically sourced from a [donor](https://www.rxlist.com/donor/definition.htm) center owned and operated by [Ortho-](https://www.rxlist.com/ortho-_prefix/definition.htm)Clinical Diagnostics. All donors are carefully screened by history and laboratory testing to reduce the risk of transmitting blood-borne pathogens from infected donors. Each [plasma donation](https://www.rxlist.com/plasma_donation/definition.htm) is tested and found to be non-reactive for the presence of [hepatitis B](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis_b/definition.htm) surface [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm) [viruses](https://www.rxlist.com/viruses/definition.htm) ( [HIV](https://www.rxlist.com/hiv/definition.htm)) 1 and 2. Additionally, plasma is tested by FDA licensed [Nucleic Acid](https://www.rxlist.com/nucleic_acid/definition.htm) Testing (NAT) for HCV and HIV-1 and the results must be negative. Plasma is also tested by investigational NAT for [hepatitis](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis/definition.htm) B ( [HBV](https://www.rxlist.com/hbv/definition.htm)) and must be non-reactive. However, the significance of a negative result has not been established. Plasma is tested by NAT for [hepatitis A](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis_a/definition.htm) virus and [parvovirus B19](https://www.rxlist.com/parvovirus_b19/definition.htm). Fractionation of the plasma is performed by a modification of the cold alcohol procedure that has been shown to significantly lower viral titers.10 Following plasma fractionation, a viral clearance filtration step and a viral inactivation step are performed. The viral filtration step removes viruses via a size-exclusion mechanism utilizing a patented Viresolve 180 ultrafiltration membrane with defined pore-size distribution of 12-18 nanometers to remove enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Following viral filtration, quality control tests (CorrTest and diffusion test) are performed on the Viresolve 180 ultrafiltration membrane to insure filter integrity.17 The viral inactivation step utilizes Triton X-100 and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP) to inactivate enveloped viruses and [West Nile Virus](https://www.rxlist.com/west_nile_virus/definition.htm) (WNV)10,18 ( [Patent](https://www.rxlist.com/patent_adjective/definition.htm) Pending). The donor selection process, the fractionation process, the viral filtration step and the viral inactivation process increase product safety by reducing the risk of transmission of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) intended for [intramuscular](https://www.rxlist.com/intramuscular_im/definition.htm) use and prepared by cold alcohol fractionation has not been shown to transmit hepatitis or other infectious diseases.19 There have been no documented cases of infectious disease transmission by RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM.

Do not inject RhoGAM Ultra-Filtered PLUS (rho(d) immune globulin (human)) (RhoGAM) PLUS (rho(d) immune globulin (human)) (MICRhoGAM) intravenously. In the case of postpartum use, the product is intended for maternal administration. Do not inject the newborn infant. Inject the entire contents of the syringe(s). For single use only. (See [WARNINGS](/rhogam-ultra-filtered-plus-drug.htm#W) AND [PRECAUTIONS](/rhogam-ultra-filtered-plus-drug.htm#P)) RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM should be administered within 72 hours of delivery or known or suspected exposure to Rh-positive red blood cells. There is little information concerning the effectiveness of Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) when given beyond this 72 hour period. In one study, Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) provided protection against Rh immunization in about 50% of subjects when given 13 days after exposure to Rh-positive red blood cells.1 Administer every 12 weeks starting from first injection to maintain a level of passively [acquired](https://www.rxlist.com/acquired/definition.htm) anti-D. If delivery occurs within three weeks after the last antepartum dose, the [postpartum](https://www.rxlist.com/postpartum/definition.htm) dose may be withheld, but a test for fetal-maternal hemorrhage should be performed to determine if exposure to > 15 mL of red blood cells has occurred.2 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter, discoloration and syringe damage prior to administration. Do not use if particulate matter and / or discoloration are observed. The solution should appear clear or slightly opalescent. Indications and Recommended Dosage |Indication||Dose||Notes| |Pregnancy and other obstetrical conditions.| | Postpartum (if the newborn is Rh-positive) | Administer within 72 hours of delivery. | RhoGAM | (300 \u00b5g) (1500 IU) |Additional doses of RhoGAM are indicated when the patient has been exposed to > 15 mL of Rh- positive red blood cells. This may be determined by use of qualitative or quantitative tests for fetal-maternal hemorrhage.| | Antepartum: || | If antepartum prophylaxis is indicated, it is essential that the mother receive a postpartum dose if the infant is Rh-positive. If RhoGAM is administered early in pregnancy (before 26 to 28 weeks), there is an obligation to maintain a level of passively acquired anti-D by administration of RhoGAM at 12-week intervals. | || MICRhoGAM | (50 \u00b5g) (250 IU) may if MICRhoGAM is not available.| |Transfusion of Rh-incompatible blood or blood products||Administer within 72 hours of suspected or proven exposure to Rh-positive red blood cells.| | | < 2.5 mL Rh-positive red blood cells | | MICRhoGAM (50 \u00b5g) (250 IU) | | RhoGAM may be administered if MICRhoGAM is not available. | || RhoGAM | (300 \u00b5g) IU) (multiple syringes) |Additional doses of RhoGAM are indicated when the patient has been exposed to > 15 mL of Rh- positive red blood cells. Administer 20 \u00b5g of RhoGAM per mL of Rh-positive red blood cell exposure. Multiple doses may be administered at the same time or at spaced intervals, as long as the total dose is administered within three days of exposure.| RhoGAM Administration Each single dose prefilled syringe of RhoGAM contains 300 \u00b5g (1500 IU) of Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human). This is the dose for the indications associated with pregnancy at or beyond 13 weeks unless there is clinical or laboratory evidence of a fetal-maternal hemorrhage (FMH) in excess of 15 mL of Rh-positive red blood cells. MICRhoGAM Administration Each single dose prefilled syringe of MICRhoGAM contains 50 \u00b5g (250 IU) of Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human). This dose will suppress the immune response to up to 2.5 mL of Rh-positive red blood cells. MICRhoGAM is indicated within 72 hours after termination of pregnancy up to and including 12 weeks gestation. At or beyond 13 weeks gestation, RhoGAM should be administered instead of MICRhoGAM. Multiple Dosage Multiple doses of RhoGAM are required if a FMH exceeds 15 mL, an event that is possible but unlikely prior to the third trimester of pregnancy and is most likely at delivery. Patients known or suspected to be at increased risk of FMH should be tested for FMH by qualitative or quantitative methods.3 In efficacy studies, RhoGAM was shown to suppress Rh immunization in all subjects when given at a dose of > 20 \u00b5g per mL of Rh- positive red blood cells.4 Thus, a single dose of RhoGAM will suppress the immune response after exposure to < 15 mL of Rh-positive red blood cells. However, in clinical practice, laboratory methods used to determine the amount of exposure (volume of transfusion or FMH) to Rh-positive red blood cells are imprecise.5,6 Therefore, administration of more than 20 \u00b5g of RhoGAM per mL of Rh-positive red blood cells should be considered whenever a large FMH or red blood cell exposure is suspected or documented.6 Multiple doses may be administered at the same time or at spaced intervals, as long as the total dose is administered within three days of exposure.7 Dosage Frequency To maintain an adequate level of anti-D, RhoGAM should be administered every 12 weeks. The exact timing for the injection is based on 12 week intervals starting from the administration of the first injection. If delivery of the baby does not occur 12 weeks after the administration of the standard antepartum dose (at 26 to 28 weeks), a second dose is recommended to maximize protection antepartum. If delivery occurs within three weeks after the last antepartum dose, the postpartum dose may be withheld, but a test for FMH should be performed to determine if exposure to > 15 mL of red blood cells has occurred.2 Administration Administer injection per standard protocol. Note: When administering an intramuscular injection, place fingers in contact with syringe barrel through windows in shield to prevent possible premature activation of safety guard. Slide safety guard over needle. After injection, use free hand to slide safety guard over needle. An audible \"click\" indicates proper activation. Keep hands behind needle at all times. Dispose of the syringe in accordance with local regulations.

Ortho-Clinical Johnson company, Raritan, New Jersey 08869. Issued March 2007. FDA rev date: n/a SIDE EFFECTS Adverse events (AE) after administration of RhoGAM and MICRhoGAM are rare. The most frequently reported AEs are anti-D formation and injection site reactions, such as swelling, [induration](https://www.rxlist.com/induration/definition.htm), redness and mild pain or warmth. Possible systemic reactions are skin rash, body aches or a slight elevation in temperature. Severe systemic allergic reactions are extremely rare. Patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after administration. There have been no reported fatalities due to [anaphylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/anaphylaxis/definition.htm) or any other cause related to RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM administration. As with any Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human), administration to patients who are Rh-positive or have received Rh-positive red blood cells may result in signs and symptoms of a hemolytic reaction, including fever, [back pain](https://www.rxlist.com/back_pain/definition.htm), nausea and [hypertension](https://www.rxlist.com/hypertension/definition.htm), and creatinine and decreased haptoglobin. RhoGAM and MICRhoGAM contain a small quantity of IgA (less than 15 \u00b5g per dose).10 Although high doses of intravenous immune globulin containing IgA at levels of 270- 720 \u00b5g/mL have been given without incident during treatment of patients with high-titered antibodies to IgA,11 the attending physician must weigh the benefit against the potential risks of hypersensitivity reactions. DRUG INTERACTIONS Immune globulin preparations including Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) may impair the efficacy of live [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) such as [measles](https://www.rxlist.com/measles/definition.htm), [mumps](https://www.rxlist.com/mumps/definition.htm) and [varicella](https://www.rxlist.com/varicella_chickenpox/definition.htm). Administration of live vaccines should generally be delayed until 12 weeks after the final dose of immune globulin. If an immune globulin is administered within 14 days after administration of a live vaccine, the immune response to the [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm) may be inhibited.12 Because of the importance of rubella [immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/immunity/definition.htm) among women of childbearing age, the postpartum vaccination of rubella-susceptible women with rubella or [MMR](https://www.rxlist.com/mmr/definition.htm) vaccine should not be delayed because of the receipt of Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) during the last trimester of pregnancy or at delivery. Vaccination should occur immediately after delivery and if possible, testing should be performed after 3 or more months to ensure immunity to rubella and if necessary, to measles.12 REFERENCES 10 Data on file at Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. 11 Cunningham-Rundles C, Zhuo Z, Mankarious S, Courter S.

Do not store frozen. - Do not use after the expiration date printed on the syringe. Use of Plasma Derived Products RhoGAM and MICRhoGAM are made from human plasma and may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically the [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease](https://www.rxlist.com/creutzfeldt-jakob_disease_cjd/definition.htm) (CJD) agent. The risk that such products will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing plasma for the presence of certain current virus infections and by using [pathogen](https://www.rxlist.com/pathogen/definition.htm) removal and inactivation techniques during the manufacturing process. All of the above steps are designed to increase product safety by reducing the risk of pathogen transmission. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products. All infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by these products should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider in the United States to Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. at 1-800-421-3311. Outside the United States, the company distributing these products should be contacted. The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of these products with the patient. PRECAUTIONS Laboratory Tests Recovery of anti-D in plasma or serum after injection of RhoGAM or other Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) products is highly variable among individuals. Anti-D detection in a patient's plasma is dependent on assay sensitivity and time of sample collection post- injection. Currently there are no requirements or practice standards to test for the presence of anti-D in order to determine adequacy or efficacy of dose following an injection of RhoGAM. The presence of passively acquired anti-D in the maternal serum may cause a positive antibody screening test. This does not preclude further antepartum or postpartum prophylaxis. Some babies born to women given Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) antepartum have weakly positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) tests at birth. Fetal-maternal hemorrhage may cause false blood typing results in the mother. Late in pregnancy or following delivery, there may be sufficient fetal Rh-positive red blood cells in the [circulation](https://www.rxlist.com/circulation/definition.htm) of the Rh-negative mother to cause a positive antiglobulin test for weak D (Du). In this instance if there is any doubt as to the patient's Rh type, RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM should be administered.9 Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM. The available evidence suggests that Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) does not harm the fetus or affect future pregnancies or the reproduction capacity of the maternal [recipient](https://www.rxlist.com/recipient/definition.htm).13,14 Rh Blood Type RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) should only be administered to Rh-negative patients exposed or potentially exposed to Rh-positive red blood cells to prevent Rh immunization.

Patients who receive RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM for Rh-incompatible transfusion should be monitored by clinical and laboratory means due to the risk of a hemolytic reaction. CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of RhoGAM and MICRhoGAM is contraindicated in Rh-positive individuals. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action RhoGAM and MICRhoGAM act by suppressing the immune response of Rh-negative individuals to Rh-positive red blood cells. The mechanism of action is unknown. RhoGAM, MICRhoGAM and other Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) products are not effective in altering the course or consequences of Rh immunization once it has occurred. Obstetrical Use The Rh-negative obstetrical patient may be exposed to red blood cells from her Rh- positive fetus during the normal course of pregnancy or after obstetrical procedures or abdominal trauma. Use after Rh-Incompatible Transfusion An Rh-negative individual transfused with one unit of Rh-positive red blood cells has about an 80% likelihood of producing anti-D.4 However, Rh immunization can occur after exposure to < 1 mL of Rh-positive red blood cells. Protection from Rh immunization is accomplished by administering > 20 \u00b5g of RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM per mL of Rh-positive red blood cells within 72 hours of transfusion of incompatible red blood cells.13,22 Pharmacokinetic Properties Pharmacokinetic studies after intramuscular injection were performed on sixteen Rh-negative subjects receiving a single dose of (368 \u00b5g or 1840 IU) RhoGAM.10 Plasma anti-D levels were monitored for thirteen weeks using a validated Automated [Quantitative](https://www.rxlist.com/quantitative/definition.htm) Hemagglutination method with sensitivity of approximately 1 ng/mL. The following mean pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained from data collected over the first ten weeks of a thirteen-week study: |Parameter||Mean||SD||Units| |Maximum Studies Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) administered at 28 weeks, as well as within 72 hours of delivery, has been shown to reduce the Rh immunization rate to about 0.1-0.2%.23,24 Clinical studies demonstrated that administration of MICRhoGAM within three hours following pregnancy termination was 100% effective in preventing Rh immunization.25 Multiple studies have been performed that prove the safety and efficacy of RhoGAM in both the obstetrical and post transfusion settings. Freda, Gorman and colleagues26, 27 studied the efficacy of RhoGAM in the postpartum setting in a randomized, controlled study completed in 1967. The control group received no immunoglobulin therapy after delivery, while the test group received 300 \u00b5g of RhoGAM intramuscularly within 72 hours of delivery of an Rh-positive infant. Six months after delivery, the incidence of Rh immunization in the control group was 6.4% (32/499) versus 0.13% (1/781) in the RhoGAM group 0.001). Pollack et al. performed two randomized, placebo-controlled studies in the post transfusion setting that were designed to establish the dose response relationship of RhoGAM. In the first study,15 178 (176 males, 2 females) Rh-negative volunteers received varying volumes of Rh- positive [red cells](https://www.rxlist.com/red_cells/definition.htm); 92 subjects then received RhoGAM. A single dose of RhoGAM (1.1 mL @ 267 \u00b5g/mL) was shown to suppress anti-D formation after injection of up to 15.1 mL of Rh-positive red cells. In a companion study,4 Pollack administered 500 mL of Rh-positive whole blood to 44 Rh-negative male volunteers. Twenty-two (22) subjects received 20 \u00b5g RhoGAM per mL of Rh-positive red cells and 22 received no RhoGAM. None of the RhoGAM-treated subjects developed anti-D; 18/22 control arm subjects developed anti-D (p < 0.0001). Human clinical studies10 were subsequently performed to prove the efficacy of MICRhoGAM and the low protein (5%) formulations. In the MICRhoGAM study, 81 Rh-negative male volunteers received an initial injection of 2.5 mL Rh-positive red cells, followed by a booster injection (0.1 mL) of red cells at 26 weeks; 40 subjects received an injection of MICRhoGAM after the initial red cell injection. None of the subjects who received MICRhoGAM developed anti-D, both before and after the booster red cell injection. A similar study was performed in 1985 using the low protein formulation of RhoGAM. None of the 30 Rh-negative male volunteers who received RhoGAM after injection of 15 mL of Rh-positive red cells developed anti-D. REFERENCES 13 Zipursky A, Israels LG.

PATIENT INFORMATION As with all immune globulin preparations, the physician should discuss the risks and benefits with the patient. The most common adverse reactions are local reactions including swelling, induration, redness and mild pain at the site of injection, and a small number of patients have noted a slight elevation in temperature. Systemic reactions to RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM are extremely rare, however allergic responses to RhoGAM or MICRhoGAM may occur. Patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after administration. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized [urticaria](https://www.rxlist.com/urticaria/definition.htm), tightness of the chest, [wheezing](https://www.rxlist.com/wheezing/definition.htm), [hypotension](https://www.rxlist.com/hypotension/definition.htm) and anaphylaxis. The physician should provide the patient with a completed RhoGAM Patient Identification Card and advise the patient to retain the card and present it to other health care providers when appropriate.
