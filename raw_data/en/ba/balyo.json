Our aromatherapy herbal soaps are made the old fashioned way, with lots of love! They aren't made by machine, but carefully crafted by hand in small batches using the \"cold processing\" method. This means that no heat is added to the soap pots, which ensures that all the beneficial properties of each ingredient is retained in every bar. Why do we love what we do? Because of you! When you use Plantlife products, you can be assured that they are the highest quality available in the marketplace in natural body care. Why? Because you matter. "}
