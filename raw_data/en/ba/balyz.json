Butler is committed to its mission of providing the highest quality of liberal and professional education and integrating the liberal arts with professional education, by creating and fostering a stimulating intellectual community built upon interactive dialogue and inquiry among students, faculty, and staff. In the 2015 \"Best Colleges\" edition of U.S. News & World Report, Butler was listed as one of the nation's best in five categories: the first-year student experience, internships, study abroad, service learning, and undergraduate research. Butler was one of only three schools in the United States recognized in five or more categories, and was recognized in more categories than all other Indiana schools combined. Such recognition reflects Butler's dedication to providing students with a broad, liberal arts foundation with nationally recognized programs, coupled with countless experiential learning opportunities in Indianapolis and beyond. Through this comprehensive approach, Butler students are prepared to step directly into a career or graduate school with confidence, as is evident in our current graduate success rate of 95 percent. Student Learning In furtherance of its teaching and learning goals, Butler has established learning outcomes for all students. The outcomes are assessed in students' coursework and elsewhere throughout their undergraduate years, yielding continued refinements and improvement in teaching. The University learning outcomes are that students will: Explore various ways of knowing in the humanities, social and natural sciences, creative arts, and quantitative and analytic reasoning Articulate and apply required content knowledge within their area(s) of study Know how to find, understand, analyze, synthesize, evaluate, and use information, employing technology as appropriate Explore a variety of cultures Recognize the relationship between the natural world and broader societal issues Communicate clearly and effectively Demonstrate collaborative behavior with others Practice ways and means of physical well-being Make informed, rational, and ethical choices Appreciate diverse cultures, ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations Share their talents with Butler and the greater community at large Be exposed to the value of lifelong learning Students are afforded ample opportunities to achieve these learning outcomes through a combination of courses\u2014both in the major and in the Core Curriculum\u2014and through co-curricular experiences. A History of Inclusiveness, Diversity, and Equality From the beginning, Butler has been ahead of its time among institutions of higher education for its commitment to racial and gender equality. The University was chartered as North Western Christian University by abolitionist Disciples of Christ members, who wanted a university away from the \"pernicious influences of slavery.\" Upon establishment in 1855, the University immediately began setting educational precedents: Butler admitted students representing all minorities, and has continued to do so throughout its history. Butler's first documented African American graduate was Gertrude Amelia Mahorney, who graduated in 1887 and subsequently taught in the Indianapolis Public Schools. Women were admitted on an equal basis with men\u2014a first for Indiana\u2014and Butler was only the second university in the nation to do so. The first woman to graduate from the full four-year program, in 1862, was Demia Butler, daughter of founder Ovid Butler. Butler was also the first university in the state to allow its students, with parental consent, to choose subjects suited to their needs under a new \"elective\" system.Butler university2 In 1870, Butler became the first university in the nation to establish an endowed chair specifically for a female professor (Catharine Merrill, English literature), and only the second university to appoint a woman to the faculty. Professor Merrill also was the first to use the lecture method for any subject other than science. The country's first chapter of Sigma Gamma Rho, a sorority for African American women, was founded on the Butler campus in 1922. When Butler University opened its doors in 1855, 20 students were enrolled, taught by two faculty members. Today, Butler is an independent university with a total full-time enrollment of nearly 4,600 students (more than 4,200 undergraduates and approximately 360 graduate students) and 417 faculty members. True to the vision of its founders, the University emphasizes the warmth and sense of community characteristic of a small liberal arts institution while offering the educational and cultural advantages of an urban center. The University maintains a favorable student-to-faculty ratio of 11:1. Because of its size, Butler can offer its students opportunities to work closely with the faculty. Classes are small, and students are encouraged to seek out faculty in their offices, studios, or laboratories. Undergraduate research and independent study are encouraged. Although Butler professors are teaching faculty, they understand that first-rate teaching must be complemented with scholarly activity that extends the boundaries of knowledge. Butler students currently represent 46 states and 56 countries, reflecting diverse cultures, interests, aspirations, personalities, and experiences. Students can join one of approximately 140 student organizations, 14 Greek organizations, and 19 varsity athletic teams. More than 94 percent of Butler students are involved in campus activities; 69 percent participate in community service. As it has since its founding, Butler continues to both value tradition and embrace innovation. The Campus Butler's 295-acre campus, within a historic north-side Indianapolis neighborhood, comprises nearly 30 buildings, playing fields, and a nature preserve. Located five miles from the heart of the city, the campus offers easy access to downtown. Its urban location allows Butler to offer students a wide range of internship opportunities that are excellent preparation for careers and graduate schools. In addition, full-time faculty in several disciplines, such as accounting, journalism, and instrumental music, are supplemented with adjunct instructors, drawing on the resources of professionals in the surrounding community. Campus facilities include: Jordan Hall, built in 1927 and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition to housing several departments of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Education, the building incorporates computer labs, an electronic language laboratory, administrative and faculty offices, alumni and parent programs, student accounts, registration, and classrooms.

Athletic fields, CUE Farm, and the Butler Prairie nature preserve, linked to the main campus by two pedestrian bridges across the Central Canal. A multi-use parking facility, with 1,033 parking spaces and 17,000 square feet of retail space, opening in fall 2015.Indianapolis Butler University remains deeply committed to serving its community. Clowes Memorial Hall and Jordan College of the Arts fulfill a cultural responsibility by presenting a vast array of performing arts and spoken-word programs open to the public; many of these programs offer enrichment to area elementary and secondary students. Indianapolis schools, corporations, and cultural organizations benefit from the University's cooperation, and student interns serve in a wide variety of Central Indiana businesses, governmental offices, nonprofit agencies, schools, hospitals, and pharmacies. Butler seeks to continue to strengthen its partnership with a vital, growing city and region. Indianapolis is the 12th-largest city in the United States, with a metropolitan-area population of more than 1.9 million. In recent years, the city has emerged as a leader in science, medicine, research, technology, and sports. Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company is located in the city, as are top-ranked regional hospitals. Many performing arts companies call Indianapolis home. Museum offerings include the world's largest children's museum, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, Conner Prairie, and the nearby Indianapolis Museum of Art. Widely known for the annual 500-mile race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the city has tw o major league professional sports teams, and it also has hosted hundreds of national and international amateur sporting events.Butler university4 UNdERGRA dUATE AN d GRA dUATE ACA dEmIC pRoGRAmS 5 The Core Curriculum Butler University is home to six colleges, all of which believe that the University's first responsibility is the liberal education of its students. At the heart of Butler's undergraduate education is the University's Core Curriculum, a set of academic requirements embodying our definition of what it means to be a liberally educated person. Created in 1945, the Core Curriculum is one of Butler's oldest academic entities. Like all good ideas, the core has not remained static but has expanded to meet the needs of a changing society. Today's Core Curriculum, implemented in fall 2010, emphasizes the development of key skills that transfer directly into careers after graduation. Employers are seeking flexible, creative, and critical thinkers who can demonstrate competencies in strong written and oral communication, information fluency, intercultural awareness, and analytical and ethical reasoning skills. Through direct experience working in the Indianapolis community, study-abroad opportunities, and rich co-cultural experiences in the Core Curriculum, Butler students also engage central issues of our increasingly globalized world, including diversity, personal and social responsibility, and social justice. In these varied ways, the Core Curriculum provides Butler students with transformative learning experiences that prepare graduates to make a meaningful impact on the world. The Core Curriculum is required for all baccalaureate and associate degrees. All Butler undergraduates, no matter their major field of study, complete the Core Curriculum. Core Curriculum courses are not open to graduate students. Students are expected to consult with their academic advisor prior to registration each semester to plan their experiences in the Core Curriculum. For more information, visit www.butler.edu/core. Core Curriculum Structure The Core Curriculum consists of several key components, all of which must be fulfilled prior to graduation: The First Year Seminar (6 credit hours) Global and Historical Studies (6 credit hours) Areas of Inquiry: Students are required to successfully complete one course in each Area of Inquiry. Students select courses each semester to fulfill each Area of Inquiry from approved course lists in the online Course Search utility using the appropriate course attribute. The six Areas of Inquiry are: AR: Analytic Reasoning (3 credit hours) NW: The Natural World (5 credit hours, lecture plus lab) PCA: Perspectives in the Creative Arts (3 credit hours) PWB: Physical Well-Being (1 credit hour) SW: The Social World (3 credit hours) TI: Texts and Ideas (3 credit hours) To ensure academic quality and integrity, some Core Curriculum requirements may be satisfied by taking courses only at Butler University. Other Core Curriculum requirements have provisions that allow for completion via transfer credit, AP , IB, or other exemptions. For details, see www.butler.edu/registrar. First Year Seminar (FYS) The First Year Seminar (FYS101 and FYS102) is a topics-based, two-semester sequenced course that serves as an introduction to the vitality of the liberal arts. FYS101 is taken in the fall semester; FYS102 is taken in the spring semester. Students will develop, practice, and advance their abilities with critical reading and thinking, effective oral communication and academic writing, and information literacy. Students assigned to EN101, Writing Tutorial, must enroll in EN101 during their first semester at Butler concurrently with FYS101. Some students also may be required to take EN101 concurrently with FYS102, contingent upon student performance in EN101 or FYS101. The English Department administers EN101, including placement tests. Transfer students who have completed two semesters of 100-level English, or other critical reading, thinking, and writing coursework at another institution, may be allowed to satisfy the FYS requirement with a total of not fewer than six transferred semester hours. All students are expected to complete the First Year Seminar during their first year at Butler.UNdERGRA dUATE and GRA dUATE ACAdEmIC pRoGRAmSButler university6Course Structure: A two-semester sequence taken in the first year.

Students will carry out research for the purpose of supplying evidence and support for claims made in exposition and argument. Global and Historical Studies (GHS) Global and Historical Studies (GHS201-209) is an array of interdisciplinary courses that allow students to engage in investigation of and reflection about a culturally diverse and increasingly globalized world. Students will learn to employ a conceptual framework that appreciates cultures as dynamic, heterogeneous, and constantly in conversation with one another. In doing so, students will draw on a variety of sources and disciplines, including the arts, the humanities, and social and natural sciences, and they will continue to develop the skills of expository writing introduced in the First Year Seminar. Course Structure: All students are required to complete two semesters of GHS201-209 (six credit hours), ideally during their sophomore year. Students may not take both GHS203 and GHS209 to complete the GHS requirement, but any other combination of courses is allowed. Course titles and descriptions can be found through the online Course Search utility using the GHS course attribute. Exemptions: One semester of GHS is automatically waived for international students. If a student studies abroad in a Butler-approved program and successfully completes nine or more credit hours of coursework while abroad, the student automatically receives a one-semester/three-credit-hour waiver from GHS. However, students are not allowed to receive two waivers for GHS; they must take at least one GHS course at Butler University. Exceptions require the approval of the faculty director of Global and Historical Studies.Learning Objectives Employ a conceptual framework for global and historical studies that appreciates cultures as dynamic, heterogeneous, and constantly in conversation with one another Draw on a variety of sources and disciplines\u2014including the arts, the humanities, and the social and natural sciences Recognize both the benefits and challenges of living in a culturally diverse and increasingly globalized world Continue development of skills of expository writing Areas of Inquiry Course titles and descriptions for all Areas of Inquiry courses can be found at the beginning of each departmental course listing and in the online Course Search utility, identified by the relevant course attribute.

All students who wish to study abroad must apply through the Center for Global Education and are expected to select their program from the Center's List of Approved Programs for Overseas Study. Students may study abroad during their sophomore and junior years, and possibly their senior year, if their academic dean approves their petition to intrude upon their final 30 hours at Butler. Butler Semester in Spain Program Butler offers a faculty-led program at the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares each fall term. Butler students are able to take an entire semester's load of 12 credits that can be applied toward the Spanish major and minor, or can count as electives. All participating students take one course with the Butler faculty director, while the rest are taught by professors at the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares in courses designed for non-native speakers of Spanish. Students with superior Spanish language skills can petition to enroll in university courses for native Spanish speakers. The program includes guided excursions to other regions of Spain. All students live with carefully selected Spanish families, thus enriching their opportunities for cultural immersion. Students must have completed two 300-level Spanish courses in order to be eligible for the program. Global Adventures in the Liberal Arts (GALA) Programs Each spring semester, Butler offers a faculty-led study program in a particular world region. Previous destinations have been Europe, Latin America, South Africa, and East Asia. Up to 20 students travel to several countries in the region while taking four or five undergraduate courses taught by Butler faculty members. The courses are designed to satisfy Core Curriculum requirements that are usually undertaken in the sophomore year. Some cross-listing is possible in order to provide flexibility for students who already may have completed some of the core requirements included in the program. Faculty-led Summer Courses Students can take summer classes while traveling abroad with a faculty member and a group of Butler students. All the colleges at Butler organize three- to four-week summer courses in overseas locations. Students consistently report that these experiences offer a valuable opportunity to learn about the course content while visiting the actual locations they are studying. International Exchange Programs Reciprocal exchanges provide opportunities for Butler students to attend carefully selected partner universities abroad while students from those universities attend Butler, on a one-for-one basis. Butler has developed some of these exchange opportunities; others are available through the International Student Exchange Program. The University's faculty and study-abroad advisor will work closely with individual students to select the program that best fits each student's academic and personal development needs. Butler has established reciprocal student exchange relationships with premier universities in other countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, and Wales. A wide range of courses are available at the partner universities in areas such as business, education, languages and cultural studies, and many other disciplines in the arts and sciences. Students also have access to the comprehensive services available to all students attending the university, as well as the continued support provided by the Center for Global Education. Butler is a member of the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), headquartered in Washington, DC. ISEP is a worldwide network for international education, consisting of 340 institutions from more than 35 countries, through which students may exchange on a one-for-one reciprocal basis. Each student Butler sends to an ISEP member institution receives tuition, room and board, and other benefits as defined by the hosting institution. Since ISEP is a totally integrated program, students studying in countries where the language of instruction is not English must prove sufficient language proficiency in order to participate.UNdERGRA dUATE AN d GRA dUATE ACA dEmIC pRoGRAmS 15 Study-Abroad Programs Butler University has been fortunate to have a cooperative agreement with the Institute for Study Abroad (IFSA-Butler), founded on Butler's campus in 1988. IFSA-Butler is one of the main study-abroad program providers for Butler students. The organization annually sends about 3,000 students from 400 U.S. universities to more than 90 universities in Argentina, Australia, Chile, Costa Rica, Egypt, England, Mexico, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, and Scotland. IFSA-Butler is a separate service organization that helps students through the application process, assists with travel plans, arranges overseas housing, and advises on a variety of related issues. In addition to the Indianapolis office, IFSA-Butler maintains fully staffed offices in each country where it has programs. The overseas offices conduct student orientations, sponsor excursions, and provide various student services. All grades earned through an IFSA-Butler program are posted to an official Butler University transcript. Students also may select their overseas study opportunity from programs offered by more than 15 other colleges, universities, and well-respected study-abroad organizations. All provide a wide range of student services and give careful attention to safety and security issues. Approved programs represent a broad range of geographic regions and areas of study. Educational opportunities may be classroom-based or experiential, including internships or service learning. Tuition and Financial Aid Applicability for Study Abroad In most cases, federal and state aid will apply to study-abroad costs if the student currently is receiving aid. Students who study abroad will pay Butler University tuition during their semester(s) abroad. Those who participate in the Butler Semester in Spain program and the Global Adventures in the Liberal Arts program as well as in reciprocal exchange programs\u2014through Butler's bilateral exchanges or ISEP\u2014may apply 100 percent of their Butler institutional financial aid to their tuition for their semester(s) abroad. Those who participate in other approved study-abroad programs may apply 50 percent of their Butler institutional financial aid toward their tuition for their first study-abroad semester, and 25 percent for their second semester abroad. Center for Global Education (CGE) The Center for Global Education provides leadership, coordination, and administrative support for the comprehensive internationalization of the University. CGE manages all study-abroad activity; it provides advising, organizes pre-departure and reentry sessions, and maintains Butler's list of approved programs for overseas study. These programs offer a wide variety of options to Butler students interested in studying abroad during the academic year. All programs on the list meet Butler's high standards for academic excellence. Students are expected to select their overseas study program from the approved list. The programs fall into two broad categories: reciprocal exchanges and study-abroad programs, in addition to some of Butler's own programs. For more information, contact CGE in Jordan Hall, or visit www.butler.edu/global-education.

Included are the University Honors Program; programs to support undergraduate research and activity; a domestic semester-away learning program in Washington, D.C.; advising for pre-health and pre-law students; a Mock Mediation team; advising for nationally and internationally competitive fellowships and scholarships, and administration of the University's chapter of the honor society Phi Kappa Phi. Additional information about CHASE-sponsored programs is available at www.butler.edu/chase or by contacting the Center at chase@butler.edu or 317-940-9581. Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity With support from the Holcomb Endowment and the Fairbanks Foundation, the Programs for Undergraduate Research Committee and CHASE assist the research and creative projects of students in all disciplines in a variety of ways: The Butler Summer Institute provides an opportunity for students to work one-on-one with a faculty mentor for nine weeks during the summer on a creative, scholarly, or research project. Students who are accepted to the program receive $2,500 and free lodging for the duration of the program. In addition to conducting their projects and presenting their findings, students participate in luncheon seminars and other activities. They also are encouraged to engage in a group community service project. Through the Butler Summer Institute, students can experience a close working relationship with a member of the faculty and an opportunity to expand their scholastic and professional horizons. The Undergraduate Student Research Program encourages undergraduate students in the sciences (broadly defined) to collaborate on research projects with a member of the faculty by providing a grant to support their joint project through the academic year. The Butler University Undergraduate Research Conference, held every spring, attracts more than 500 participants from colleges and universities around the Midwest and beyond. Presentations are given in a wide variety of disciplines. Student Thesis Grants support some of the costs of conducting research necessary for completion of honors theses. Travel Grants are available to support the travel costs of presenting the results of research or creative endeavors at international or national conferences. Competitive Scholarships and Fellowships The CHASE office provides recruiting, mentoring, advising, and coaching for students interested in applying for nationally competitive scholarships such as Fulbright, Goldwater, Marshall, Rhodes, and Truman scholarships. In recent years, Butler has had a distinguished record of success in these competitions. Most, but not all, support graduate study, and many support study at overseas institutions. Most of these programs require institutional endorsement through an internal selection process. For more information about specific scholarship programs and internal deadlines, visit the CHASE website or contact CHASE at chase@butler.edu. Pre-Health Professions (pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, pre-veterinary medicine, pre-optometry, pre-physical therapy) Although any major may be chosen, most pre-health students elect a major in either the biological sciences or chemistry. For admission, most professional schools require a minimum of one year of biology, one year each of general and organic chemistry, and one year of physics; however, the expectations of professional schools vary, and students should consult with their Butler advisor and the pre-health advisor concerning the requirements of the particular professional schools in which they are interested. Pre-health coursework varies according to the student's goal, but every student has the choice ACAdEmIC ENHANCE mENT pRoGRAmS AN d RES oURCES 19 of a number of elective courses. These are offered both to enhance pre-professional training and to broaden and deepen the student's education. Students also may participate in research programs, shadowing experiences, and campus and community service opportunities. Many pre-health students also are in Butler's Honors Program. A science major (biology, chemistry, etc.) in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requires a minimum of 30 hours of coursework in that department. Regardless of the major area of study, courses in biology, chemistry, and physics are required to adequately prepare the student for success in his or her professional field. Faculty advisors work one-on-one with students to tailor an academic program designed to meet individual needs and career goals. Students' individualized academic schedules will allow them to meet all professional school entrance requirements and prepare them for the nationally administered entrance examinations for health professional schools. Pre-Law Butler pre-law students may choose any major. The Law School Admission Council advises that \"Law schools want students who can think critically and write well, and who have some understanding of the forces that have shaped the human experience. These attributes can be acquired in any number of college courses, whether in the arts and humanities, the social sciences, or the natural sciences.\" In addition, courses introducing legal principles may be helpful to students in assessing whether to continue to pursue law. Finally, courses in logic, mathematics, and analytical reasoning may enhance preparation for the Law School Admission Test. Students also may participate in engaged-learning experiences such as our Mock Mediation team, networking events, and internship opportunities in Indianapolis or in the Washington D.C. Learning Semester. University Honors Program The CHASE office serves as the administration for the University Honors program.

Visiting Students\u2014Students who are attending other collegiate institutions and wish to enroll at Butler as visiting students must submit to the Office of Admission a non-degree application and an official transcript or statement from the registrar at the home school indicating an overall average of C (2.0/4.0) or higher and eligibility to return. Non-Degree to Degree-Seeking Status Students who have been attending Butler University in a non-degree capacity may apply for degree-seeking status by submitting an application for admission and following the guidelines listed in this Bulletin. Check with the Office of Admission or the Office of Registration and Records for the appropriate application dates. Graduate Studies Graduate Degree-Seeking Admission The following information generally is applicable to all graduate programs. For exceptions and special requirements, refer to the specific admission requirements by college. Admission is based upon undergraduate grades and other information, as may be required for a specific program. Some programs may require standardized test scores (e.g., GMAT, MAT, GRE, etc.) in order to be considered for graduate admission. These test scores are valid for five years. Prospective students may visit the departmental website of their respective programs in order to obtain more information regarding standardized test requirements and waivers. Students whose first language is not English must demonstrate English proficiency by taking either the TOEFL or IELTS exams. This requirement may be waived, however, if the student has already received a baccalaureate or equivalent degree from a regionally accredited university in the United States or other country in which English is the official language. Butler seniors desiring to take graduate courses may make special arrangements with the dean of the college in which the graduate degree is to be earned. Credit for such courses will not be recorded on a graduate record until the bachelor's degree is awarded, and the student has been admitted to a graduate program. Note: Students must be degree-seeking MBA or MPAcc admits to be eligible to enroll in College of Business graduate-level courses. Students intending to work toward an advanced degree must satisfy the prerequisites for the program. If prerequisites are to be completed, the student may, under some circumstances, be admitted with a stipulation that the courses be completed satisfactorily. If not admitted, a student may, depending on the college, enroll as a non-degree student while completing the prerequisites. Graduate Non-Degree-Seeking Admission A person holding a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university who AdmISSIoN INF oRmATIoN AN d REQUIRE mENTS 37 wishes to enroll in graduate courses at Butler University for purposes other than obtaining an advanced degree (e.g., for teacher licensure, to transfer to another institution, or for self-enrichment) may file a non-degree application. Application forms may be obtained from and submitted to the Office of Admission. An official transcript with an attached baccalaureate degree posted must be mailed directly from the issuing institution to the Office of Admission. Applications and supporting materials must be received one week prior to the first day of the term. If a non-degree student chooses to enter a graduate degree program, the student must complete a graduate degree-seeking application and follow the application procedures for that graduate program. Check with the Office of Admission for exact dates. A maximum of 12 graduate credit hours completed as a non-degree student may be applied toward the selected degree program. Prospective students should check with individual colleges with regard to policies governing converting from non-degree to degree-seeking status. Applying for Graduate Admission Applications may be obtained from the Office of Admission and on Butler's website. All candidates for admission to graduate programs must submit the following: Application for Graduate Admission, accompanied by the nonrefundable application fee. Former Butler students are not required to submit the application fee. If a student applies online, the application fee is waived as well. Official transcript from each college or university previously attended, mailed directly from the issuing institution. International students must hold a degree from a school recognized by the government or educational ministry within the country. International students also must provide official financial documentation, as required by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services and the U.S. Department of State. Students whose first language is not English must meet a minimum level of proficiency in the English language and submit proof of this proficiency to the Office of Admission, unless they have already received a baccalaureate or equivalent degree from a regionally accredited university in the United States or other country in which English is the official language. Minimum English proficiency can be met by the following: Test of English as Foreign Language (TOEFL) indicating a minimum score of 213 (computer-based test), 79 (internet-based test), or 550 (paper-based test); students not applying for the master of science in pharmaceutical science may choose to meet English proficiency by completing the International English Language Training System (IELTS) with a score of 6.0. Additional requirements for programs in each college, if any, are listed below. All application materials become the property of Butler University. Transcripts received from other institutions will not be returned to the student or released to another institution or third party. Renewed Enrollment\u2014Graduate Students See Other Admission Options/Renewed Enrollment section above for general information. In addition, students enrolled in a graduate program at Butler University 10 or more years previously, as well as students seeking enrollment into a new degree program or degree level, must submit a new degree-seeking application (see Applying for Graduate Admission) and meet current admission requirements. Only coursework taken subsequent to the new admission will be counted toward degree requirements. All academic records, however, will be maintained so that the transcripts will reflect all of the studies and cumulative GPA undertaken at Butler University. Graduate Transfer Credit All work toward a graduate degree should be completed at Butler. However, under special circumstances and within certain limits, graduate work taken at a regionally accredited institution may be transferred and applied toward the degree. Note: College of Business graduate transfer credits must be from an AACSB-accredited institution. In order for credit to be transferred, a prospective student must receive a grade of A or B. All coursework must be approved by the student's Butler University academic advisor. Subject to these restrictions, up to nine semester hours may be transferred in 30-hour programs and up to 12 hours may be transferred in 36-hour and longer programs. The student should file a transfer credit form with the Office of Registration and Records for acceptance of transfer credits.Butler university38Time Limitations Beginning at the time when their first graduate degree-applicable course is taken, students in 30-hour programs have five years to complete the degree requirements, and students in longer programs have seven years to complete the degree requirements. Degree Requirements Thesis/Project: Some graduate programs may require a thesis or scholarly project. Generally, three credit hours are allotted for a thesis/project, although six-hour projects may be authorized. Regulations governing the preparation and submission of the thesis are available from the college in which the work is being done. If a comprehensive examination also is required, half of the exam is allotted for the thesis defense. Students may contact their respective graduate program to see if their specific program requires a thesis. GPA: Students must achieve a grade average of B or better in all graduate courses attempted. Courses in which a student earns a C-, D, or F will not be counted toward degree requirements. While grades below a C are not counted toward the completion of degree requirements, they are counted in determining the student's GPA. In no case may a student take more than 12 credit hours in excess of the degree requirements in order to satisfy the foregoing GPA requirement. Any graduate student who fails to make satisfactory progress in the coursework\u2014whether degree-seeking or non-degree-seeking\u2014may be declared academically ineligible for additional enrollment. Student Status Full-time: An individual must take a minimum of six and a maximum of 12 credits of graduate-eligible courses per semester in order to be considered a full-time student. A petition can be filed for consideration of lesser credits for the final semester before graduation. International students with F1 visa status can be admitted for full-time status only. A maximum of four years is allowed to complete all the degree requirements. Part-time: Prospective students should contact their respective program to determine the feasibility of part-time enrollment for timely completion of the degree. Applicants must comply with all admission requirements. Professionals admitted in the program must take a minimum of three credit hours per semester and complete all degree requirements within a maximum of seven years, with the didactic coursework being completed within five years of entry in the program. Research toward a thesis for the MS in pharmacy and health sciences program must be independent of research projects ongoing at the student's place of employment and be publishable under an affiliation with Butler University. Research must be conducted during the course of the program. Part-time students will not be eligible for any financial assistance from Butler University. The research advisor for the MS in pharmacy and health sciences program must be a full-time faculty member in the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. Financial Assistance A limited number of stipends in the form of graduate assistantships will be provided to qualified full-time graduate students conducting research in College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences laboratories. Graduate assistants will be required to work up to 20 hours per week on campus on projects assigned by the director of the graduate program, subject to valid immigration status. A full-time student must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and show satisfactory progress in his or her research project in order to qualify for financial assistance. Stipends will be competitively awarded every year, with previous recipients given preference. Graduate assistantships will be limited to a two-year period for each recipient. Each student is required to pay regular tuition and maintain approved health insurance during the course of study. There is no assurance of financial assistance for any admitted applicant. The freedom to leave the program, for any reason and at any time, will be available to all students; however, untimely withdrawal from the program causes financial and emotional distress to the University community. Therefore, to protect the University's investment, it is the policy that any student accepting the stipend as graduate assistant is expected to complete the MS program. Any such student leaving the program prior to completion and without compelling reason will be required to pay back the full amount of the stipend that has been awarded by the University.AdmISSIoN INF oRmATIoN AN d REQUIRE mENTS 39 Butler university40 TUITI oN AN d FEES 41 Tuition, fees, and other charges paid by the student cover approximately 80 percent of the educational costs at Butler University. The University provides the remaining funds through income from its endowment and gifts from foundations, business and industry, alumni, and friends. Tuition and fee levels are set by the Butler University Board of Trustees and are subject to change by action of the board. The college year consists of two semesters and a one-session summer school. The academic year includes the fall and the spring semesters. The unit of instruction is the semester hour, which normally signifies one recitation a week throughout a semester or an equivalent. Educational Costs 2015-2016 Tuition charges are based on the number of credit hours (with the exception of PharmD, 6th year) and the college of enrollment.

This information should be available by April 2016. Accept Financial Responsibility Butler University policy requires all students to complete the Acceptance of Financial Responsibility statement, accessible via my.butler.edu (located under the Finance section in the Student Center). Acceptance is required prior to enrollment each semester. The Acceptance of Financial Responsibility statement outlines the student's responsibility for paying all expenses incurred, including any applicable penalties. Payment Terms Students who register through the early registration process for fall 2015 will receive an electronic billing statement (E-Bill), July 8, 2015, for tuition, fees, room, and board. (E-Bill notification is sent via a student's Butler email address.) Payment is due in full August 4, 2015, if the student is not enrolled in the Monthly Payment Plan for fall 2015. Students not enrolled in the Monthly Payment Plan who have not paid in full by the first day of classes will be assessed a monthly finance charge of 1.5 percent (18 percent APR). Course registration may also be cancelled. Students who register after their regular registration timeframe will be required to pay all charges in full to receive grade or transcript information. If enrollment is added after the term or semester has ended, the student must pay for the course(s) before grade and/or transcript information will be released from the University. Monthly Payment Plan Option Butler University offers a payment plan that allows students and families to divide the semester charges (e.g., tuition, fees, room, board, etc.) into manageable monthly payments. There is a nominal participation fee of $25 (four payments). Further information regarding the 2015-2016 payment plan is available at www.butler.edu/student-accounts. A late fee of 1 percent of the past-due amount will be charged to your account if payment is not received by the due date on the E-Bill, or if the amount received is less than the payment indicated on your E-Bill. Payment plan participation may be jeopardized and discontinued after two missed payments or payments submitted that are less than the amount billed. If the payment plan is discontinued, the balance will accrue interest and will be due in full immediately. Students with past-due balances may also have classes cancelled. Individuals with past-due balances or poor payment histories with the University may be denied participation in the plan. E-Pay and E-Bill The Office of Student Accounts accepts electronic billing (E-Bill) and electronic payment (E-Pay), for which information is available at www.butler.edu/student-accounts. Payment is accepted electronically by check (no fee) or credit card. Credit card payments include a 2.75 percent nonrefundable convenience fee. MasterCard, Discover, American Express, and Visa are accepted. Note: The Office of Student Accounts also accepts paper checks, cash, money orders, and 529 savings plan distribution for payment. Prepaid Tuition The University provides a tuition prepayment plan, which guarantees a fixed tuition rate for all prepaid semesters. The prepaid tuition TUITI oN AN d FEES 43 rates are based on the first term in which the student participates in the prepaid program. This program applies only to students enrolled on a full-time basis in an undergraduate degree program or the PharmD program during the fall and spring terms only. The prepayment plan does not apply to graduate programs and does not apply to summer tuition charges. Contact the Office of Student Accounts for contract and cost information. Federal Student Permissions Federal regulations require that Butler University apply federal (Title IV) financial aid funds first to \"allowable charges,\" which are tuition, mandatory fees, and room and board charges contracted with Butler University. To apply any remaining federal funds to miscellaneous charges (e.g., bookstore charges, parking fee, health services charges, traffic fines, interest charges), the University is required to obtain student authorization. If authorization is not received before financial aid funds post to the student account, the federal Title IV funds will not be applied to miscellaneous charges. This may result in an outstanding balance on the student account, resulting in late fees and services restricted until the outstanding balance is paid in full. Students may grant permission for federal Title IV funds to pay miscellaneous charges at my.butler.edu. Navigation instructions are available at www.butler.edu/student-accounts. Once Federal Student Permission is granted, it continues to be valid for future years. The permission can only be revoked if the student submits a written request directly to the Office of Student Accounts. Tuition Refund Schedule The official schedule is available at www.butler.edu/student-accounts. Students should refer to the refund schedule prior to making any schedule changes. Also, it is critical for students receiving financial assistance from any aid program (University, federal, and/or state) to contact the Office of Financial Aid before changing enrollment. Withdrawals Students who fail to attend class and/or pay tuition charges are not considered withdrawn from the course(s). Withdrawals must be made through the advisor or dean of the college in which the student is enrolled. All past-due balances must be paid before a student will be permitted to enroll for a new semester/term.Butler University Return of Funds Procedures Federal regulations require that, as a part of an institution's Return of Funds Policy, an office or offices must be designated as the point of contact for students to begin the withdrawal process. The designated office(s) must document the date the student withdraws or otherwise provides official notification to the institution of the intent to withdraw. At Butler, the Office of Registration and Records is the designated office at which a student must withdraw. Official notification from the student must be in writing. The date of withdrawal will be utilized by the Office of Financial Aid in determining the amount of financial assistance that may be retained by the student, based upon the percentage of the enrollment period (semester) which the student completed to that point in time. In the case of a student who does not withdraw or otherwise notify Butler University of the intent to withdraw, the date used will be the midpoint of the payment period for which assistance was disbursed, unless the attendance records document an earlier or later date. Credit Balance Accounts The Office of Student Accounts requires students to complete a refund request form to receive a refund check for a credit balance on the account. However, if the credit on the account is due to federal (Title IV) financial aid funds, the Office of Student Accounts will issue a check automatically. If the credit balance is due to a federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), the refund check will be issued in the name of the parent borrower and mailed to the address on file for the PLUS borrower. If the student is anticipating a credit balance, it is recommended that a refund request form be completed regardless of funding sources. Refund checks are issued weekly while classes are in session. Forms must be submitted by end of day on Tuesday to receive a check on Friday. Refund checks are not issued when classes are not in session. Unpaid Items Charges A student who is past due in any debt to the University is not permitted to register in any school or college of the University and is not entitled to an official transcript, grade report, or diploma from the Office of Registration and Records until the indebtedness has been paid in full. Any check presented to the University that fails to clear the bank shall be subject to a nonrefundable $25 handling charge. If the check is for payment of a debt, it also will be considered Butler university44as nonpayment. Any E-Check transaction that is rejected by either banking institution will be charged a nonrefundable returned E-Check fee of $25. Students may be assessed reasonable collections fees, attorney fees, and court costs without relief of evaluation and appraisement law to collect outstanding balances. When a student is in possession of University property or owes a particular department for charges not applied to the student account, the department may call for a hold to be placed on a student's record. The hold prevents the release of University records and future enrollment. This hold is removed upon confirmation from the requesting department. Delinquent Bill Accounts Students who have not met their financial obligations to Butler University will be refused grades, transcripts, and readmission. Delinquent accounts will be charged interest on the unpaid balance. Accounts that remain delinquent will be assigned to a collection agency. All costs of collection will be the responsibility of the student. Interest charges and collection fees will be charged to the student account. Outside Billing The University will bill a third party for tuition, room and board, and miscellaneous fees, provided that: 1) a voucher and/or written authorization is received by the Office of Student Accounts prior to the beginning of each semester; and 2) payment will be made on or before the first day of the semester. The University will not bill any employer or third party who pays upon completion of the course(s). Any balance remaining unpaid on the first day of the semester will be assessed a monthly finance charge of 1.5 percent (18 percent APR). If the third party will not pay the finance charge, the student will be responsible for payment. Students will continue to receive a billing statement directly from Butler University until the account balance is paid in full. It is the responsibility of the student to contact the third-party payer to determine why a delay in payment has occurred. Business Services Check cashing: up to $100 per day for enrolled students with a valid Butler I.D. during cashiering hours for the Office of Student Accounts. The University reserves the right to deny check-cashing privileges for students on financial hold or students with a history of returned checks with the University. The release of grades and/or transcripts will be prevented for any unpaid returned checks. Anyone with an unpaid returned check may lose check-cashing privileges. Money orders: available for purchase with cash only up to a maximum of $200 each for a $5 fee. A valid Butler I.D. must be presented to purchase a money order.TUITI oN AN d FEES 45 Butler university46 FINANCIAL AI d 47 Butler University offers a variety of financial aid programs based on academic excellence, performance ability, and the family's ability to contribute. Financial aid may be offered in the form of scholarships, grants, student loans, and on-campus employment. Funding for these programs is provided by federal, state, and Butler University resources. Students who are seeking financial aid are encouraged to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by March 1 each year, complete their financial aid file by May 1, and be registered for full-time enrollment by May 15. Any application materials or documents submitted to the Office of Financial Aid by the student or on his or her behalf become the property of the University and a permanent record of the Office of Financial Aid. The Office of Financial Aid is responsible for compliance with federal, state, and University regulations and guidelines. Financial aid counselors are available at 317-940-8200, 877-940-8200 (toll-free), or finaid@butler.edu. Financial aid information is available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. All information was correct at the time of publication. Changes to any program may occur without notice. Butler University Gift Programs Butler University awards gift assistance through programs like the First-Year Student Academic Scholarship, Jordan College of the Arts Audition Award, Athletic Grant in Aid, and Butler Grant. These awards are available for tuition only to full-time undergraduate students pursuing their first bachelor's degree, unless otherwise stated. Additional programs and details are available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. Federal and State Grants Students who complete the FAFSA may be eligible for federal and state grants. Program details and application requirements are available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. Loans Student loan programs are available for students who complete the FAFSA. Loans must be repaid and managed carefully. Additional information regarding loan programs is available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid.Financial Aid and Study Abroad at Butler University Butler University is supportive of students who wish to study abroad. Butler University funds may be used in the full amount for overseas study in an approved exchange program. An approved non-exchange program is limited to 50 percent of the award amounts for the first semester of overseas study and 25 percent of the award amounts for the second semester of overseas study. Butler funds are only eligible for two semesters of overseas study. The full amount of federal and state awards (i.e., Federal Pell Grant, Federal Direct Loans) may be used for the study-abroad semester, depending upon the cost of the program. Other Financial-Aid and Loan Policies Leave of Absence Policy To reserve merit awards if you leave the University for personal reasons, you must request a leave of absence from the Office of Financial Aid. The written request must be submitted prior to the 10th day of the semester for which the leave is requested. If the Office of Financial Aid approves the leave of absence, the merit awards may be reserved for a maximum of two semesters. Personal reasons may include those that are medical, financial, or experiential; however, attendance at another university or college does not qualify. Outside Scholarships According to federal regulations, scholarships received from donors outside of Butler University are considered to be a resource available to meet your financial aid eligibility. As a financial aid recipient, a student must report all outside scholarships from sources other than the federal, state, and University programs. The policy for treatment of outside scholarships is at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. Satisfactory Academic Progress Federal regulations require that all financial aid recipients make satisfactory academic progress toward a certificate or degree. The standards apply to all terms, regardless of whether or not the student received financial aid. The Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards can be found at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. FINANCIAL AI dButler university48In addition, students must meet the retention standards of the University as outlined in the Butler University Handbook. Special Circumstances If a significant loss of income is projected, resulting in circumstances that restrict your parents' ability to contribute to your education, write a letter explaining the circumstances, and the Office of Financial Aid will review your situation. Special circumstances are defined as situations that the family has minimal control over: death, disability, loss of income due to lay-off, and unemployment. Voluntary circumstances are not eligible for consideration. Such voluntary items would include consumer debt, voluntary leave of employment, and loss of income due to change in job or school attendance.Withdrawal Before withdrawing from all classes, a student should visit the Office of Financial Aid. The University's refund policy is administered through the Office of Student Accounts. However, federal law dictates that the refund of financial aid is calculated based on days of attendance (earned aid), which can result in a balance owed to the University or to financial aid programs. Student Consumer Information The Student Consumer Information regulations of the U.S. Department of Education require universities to provide students with access to certain information to which they are entitled as consumers. This information is available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. FINANCIAL AI d 49 Butler university50 ACAdEmIC REGULATI oNS AN d dEFINITI oNS 51 All undergraduate students are urged to review the Student Handbook, at www.butler.edu/campus-life/student-handbook, which details the academic rules and regulations of the University. While academic advisors are available to help students plan their academic career, the Butler student is responsible for: Knowing and meeting degree requirements Consulting with an advisor prior to each registration period Enrolling in appropriate courses to ensure timely progress toward a degree Discussing issues related to academic performance However, the availability of an advisor does not relieve the student of the responsibility for knowing and following the published programs and policies. Each student should become an expert on the program being pursued, and on the regulations and procedures of the University. A student must maintain high standards of conduct to continue in, and to be graduated from, the University. The school year at Butler consists of two semesters approximately 15 weeks in length and two seven-week summer sessions. Unit of Instruction Each course carries an approved number of semester hours credit. A semester hour is generally equivalent to one lecture per week, or two or three hours of laboratory work per week. Most degree programs require an average of 16 semester hours each semester for eight semesters. Neither more nor less credit than the amount stated in the Registration and Records student information system is permitted in any course. Grading System Each student is expected to attend all class meetings in which he or she is enrolled. Being absent from class therefore may affect the final grade assigned for the course. Butler is on a 4.0 grading system. When a student completes a course, one of the following grades with the corresponding grade points will be assigned: A 4.00 gr ade points A- 3. 67 grade points B+ 3.33 gr ade points B 3. 00 grade points B- 2.67 gr ade points C+ 2.33 grade poin ts C 2.00 gr ade points 1.67 points D+ 1.33 grade poin ts D 1.00 gr ade points D- 0. 67 grade points F 0. 00 grade points The following grades are not computed in the grade point average (GPA):W\u2014Official withdrawal. Permitted through the 10th week of a fall or spring semester. Students should contact Registration and Records for withdrawal dates during the summer. P\u2014Passing grade. Semester hours are counted as hours passed, but are not used in computing the GPA. PV\u2014Pass with validation. Grade given in student-teaching classes to students who may be certified to teach. AUD\u2014Audited course. NC\u2014Enrollment in a course on a non-credit basis. A student may change from credit to non-credit in a course through the 10th week of a fall or spring semester. The instructor's signature is required. An instructor may change the non-credit grade to withdrawal if the student does not attend class. NR\u2014Grade not reported. I\u2014Incomplete grade. This grade may be assigned by an instructor when exceptional circumstances prevent a student's finishing all work required in a course. The \"I\" must be removed within the next regular session of the student's enrollment or within two years if the student is not again enrolled during that time. If the \"I\" is not removed within the stated time, the \"I\" will be changed to \"X.\" X\u2014Unredeemed incomplete grade. This indicates no credit earned, no hours attempted, and no grade points. T\u2014Transfer credit. Z\u2014Undergraduate course taken by a graduate student ; no credit or grade points earned. Academic Standing A student's GPA is figured by dividing the total number of hours attempted into the total number of grade points earned. When a student's cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0, he or she is placed on academic probation. ACAdEmIC REGULATI oNS and dEFINITI oNSButler university52Excessive probation, or continued probation without improvement, can lead to the student being declared academically ineligible. Repeat Policy A student, with the approval of his or her advisor, may repeat a course one time that is not otherwise repeatable for credit. Upon completion of the subsequent attempt, only the second attempt will count in his or her GPA. When repeating a course, a student may not withdraw from the course or change the course credit registration to non-credit unless the student withdraws from the University. This policy shall apply only to courses taken at Butler. The same policy applies to graduate students. Independent Study Policy Not more than six hours of credit in independent study may be counted toward an undergraduate degree, except for students majoring in science, who may take a maximum of nine hours of independent study. Dean's List Any degree-seeking undergraduate student earning at least 12 academic hours of graded credit in a given semester may be placed on the Dean's List of the college of enrollment if the semester GPA is in the top 20 percent of all eligible students in that college. Courses taken under the pass/fail option do not count toward 12 academic hours of graded credit. Classification of Students To attain a class standing, a student should have twice the number of grade points as hours attempted and have earned the following number of hours. Classifications are applicable to all colleges of the University. First-Year Student 0-28 hour s Sophomore 29-58 hours J unior 59-90 hours Senior 91+ hour s 5th year Pharmacy 133-1 70 hours 6th year Pharmacy 171+ hour s Registration Each fall and spring semester, enrollment begins with a two-week rollout of individually assigned My.Butler registration appointments. Registration remains open until the fifth day of class each semester. Students must meet with their advisor before registering. Registration in any course for credit or in any course under the pass/fail option, or any change involving the addition of a course, is not permitted after the published deadlines. If a student wishes to make a change in his or her registration, permission must be secured from a student's academic advisor and/or from the dean of the college in which the student is enrolled. Permission also is required if a student intends a complete withdrawal from the University. A student may register for an \"independent study\" course with permission of the department chair or dean concerned. Consortium for Urban Education The Consortium for Urban Education comprises the following higher educational institutions in and around Indianapolis: Butler University; Franklin College; University of Indianapolis; Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, including the Herron School of Art; Indiana Vocational Technical College; Marian University; and Martin University. The consortium allows a student of one member institution, under specified conditions, to enroll at another Consortium for Urban Education institution in a course not available at the home institution. Butler students interested in enrolling for a course not currently taught at Butler, but available at a member institution, are invited to consult the Registration and Records office, Jordan Hall, room 133, 317-940-9442, or visit www.butler.edu/registrar for details. Pass/Fail Option The University permits students to elect up to four courses from their total undergraduate degree for pass/fail credit. Courses offered only as pass/fail credit are not included in this total. Courses required for graduation by the University Core Curriculum, individual colleges or departments, or in the student's academic major or minor may not be taken as pass/fail. Students who have elected the pass/fail option earn credit and a \"pass\" grade for work equivalent to a D- or better. Courses taken for pass/fail do not count in the GPA if passed; if failed, they are counted as F . Upper-division courses taken pass/fail shall count for upper-division credit if passed. A change from pass/fail to grade credit or from grade credit to pass/fail shall not be permitted after the last day noted in the academic calendar. Pass/fail is not available to graduate students as an option, but some courses in the Jordan College of the Arts are designated as pass/fail.ACAdEmIC REGULATI oNS AN d dEFINITI oNS 53 Special Non-Credit During the fall and spring semesters, full- time degree-seeking students may, with the approval of the department chair or dean whose subject matter is involved and if resources are available, register for a maximum of two courses per semester on a non-credit basis without additional tuition, with the exception of independent study and applied music (individual instruction) classes. Students should register for special non-credit courses at the end of the registration period. Student Social Security Numbers New students will receive a random student identifier when they are admitted that will be used as the student's I.D. The Social Security number is a secondary identifier for all students. In accordance with federal and state law, students have the right to refuse disclosure of the Social Security number. Final Year of Academic Residence Normally, a student is expected to take his or her final 30 hours of academic work at Butler University; however, the dean of the college concerned may, for reasons deemed valid, allow intrusions up to 30 semester hours if the student has completed at least 64 semester hours at Butler with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. Graduation The student must file a degree application in the Office of Registration and Records by the specific dates as published in the academic calendar.

Poor, PhD, Associate Dean for Student Affairs College Website www.butler.edu/las The power, importance, and centrality of the liberal arts are affirmed daily in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS). The College offers 29 majors and 31 minors across 12 departments and four programs in the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Students in the College are encouraged and expected to explore different ways of understanding the world, to experience cultures diverse from their own, to practice critical thinking, to appreciate the value of and joy associated with learning, and to recognize the power their education provides them for personal gain and social change. A liberal arts degree from Butler positions students to do almost anything with their lives beyond Butler and to make a difference in their lives and in the lives of those with whom they interact. We work on a daily basis to strengthen ties between students and faculty members. Students and their faculty mentors work closely together both in and out of the classroom. They conduct collaborative research projects, make joint presentations at professional meetings, and publish the results of their work in the literature of their disciplines. They talk about ideas, the future, and the world. And they very frequently remain in touch long after graduation. We also believe that learning takes place in many settings in addition to the classroom. Students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences participate in internships in Indianapolis and around the world, and they regularly study abroad and in various field locations.Core Values of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences The liberal arts' basic and historic purpose is at once to teach us to think for ourselves, to act wisely and well in the world, and to undertake occupations useful to ourselves and others. Liberal arts education seeks ultimately to open us to the human condition in its pains and joys, thereby to nurture our personal integrity, and to foster in us compassion and respect for those whose lives we share in our own communities and around the world. Liberal arts education rests on a paradox: thinking soundly oneself means first listening carefully to the thoughts of others. The liberal arts urge us to cultivate ourselves through the consciousness of others; careful attention to their ideas and actions help us refine our own. Liberal arts education is pluralistic. It is composed of many voices, each appropriate to time and place, some discordant, none absolute. It seeks to develop in us wit to judge which skills are appropriate at which times. Liberal arts education is restless. It takes nothing for granted. Its characteristic activity is not uncritical assent but critical judgment. It scrutinizes sacred truths of every sort. The liberal arts develop not only critical but also creative skills, not only rational analysis but also creative expression. They seek to develop and realize the fullness of the human personality. Their exercise aims as well at preparing students to educate themselves long after they have left formal school. Liberal arts education is meant to train its students for public responsibility, not just private good. A liberal arts education is as much about the journey as the destination. It takes as much delight in the minute-by-minute quirks of learning as in the fulfillment of distant goals. It balances the will to know with empathy and wonderment. continuedButler university56The Latin word \"ars\" means at once skill, knowledge, and practice. A liberal arts education begins with the skills of language and thought. It teaches us to read well; to listen well; to write clear, concise prose; to speak privately in conversation, publicly in discussion, and formally in speeches; to judge one's audience and regard one's own words through the eyes and ears of others; to learn proper ways of integrating and citing the words and thoughts of others into one's own work; to do these things reasonably well in languages and worldviews other than our own. It teaches us to set out a case or hypothesis or argument; to evaluate the rigor of others' arguments; to find and judge information in libraries, on the internet, and in other repositories. It teaches us modes of ascertaining truth and falsehood; resourcefulness appropriate to moral and aesthetic judgment; methods of logical, experimental, scientific, mathematical, and statistical reasoning. These skills allow us to tackle and solve increasingly difficult and challenging problems, appreciate sources of bias and means of overcoming them, and entertain arguments from dissonant points of view. They develop in us a sense of subtlety, depth, and complexity. A liberal arts education sees the cultivation of these skills not only as an end in itself but also as a preparation for the pursuit of knowledge and the other purposes of human life. The Chinese I Ching (Book of Changes) well captures a fundamental quality of liberal arts education when it intimates that knowledge and practice cannot be mastered until they have been regarded from different perspectives. As students of the liberal arts, we cultivate as fully as possible the legacy of human thought, imagination, creativity, and research; observe nature; confront and evaluate important theories that shape our understanding of the world and how to care for it; figure out how societies, our own and those of others, work and can be improved; weigh the costs and benefits of modern human life to the individual and the planet; seek to grasp and reduce the sources of human hatred and conflict; aim to understand and strengthen what inspires human cooperation; explore the workings of the human mind and body; unknot claims of teachers, politicians, advertisers, scientists, preachers, columnists, and your roommate; ponder history from the earliest epochs to the unfolding present; investigate the mechanisms of the cosmos, from the atom to the stars; delve into the past experiences of our own and other societies, as well as the current news; make ourselves at home in other cultures; make those from other cultures at home among ourselves; see the interplay between our beliefs about the natural world and our beliefs about religion, politics, and culture; search out purpose, ponder the meaning of life, scrutinize the human heart, and weigh conscience; discover the sweep of living systems, from microbes to biomes; learn to account for ourselves in a moral world that is neither black nor white; engage in a careful search for truth; know the ways of money and the nature of work; wrestle with ideas about God; fathom the relations between technology and human life; raise children\u2014our own and those of others; consider the well-being of future generations; appreciate the beauty and uses of mathematics; forge agreements with loved ones, friends, and enemies; and engage ourselves in the principles, purposes, and practice of public life. As students of the liberal arts, we do these things as part of a community with venerable roots\u2014a community still evolving in space and time, a community of thought, imagination, value, labor, and action.

Shellhaas, PhD Associate Professors Shelley Etnier, PhD; Jennifer R. Kowalski, PhD; Katherine M. Schmid, PhD; J. Villani, PhD Professors Sean T. PhD; Nathanael R. Hauck, PhD; Lindsay K. Lewellyn, PhD; Andrew M. Stoehr, PhD Instructors McKenzie Beverage, MA; Dolan, PhD, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/biology Why Study Biology? Biology is the study of living things, including plants, animals, and microbes. A major in biology will provide you with a broad education in the biological sciences, exposing you to many different facets of this diverse science. Biological sciences is a liberal arts major, and therefore it is largely about teaching students how to learn and think about the world. Students will develop an understanding of the scientific method, a process that develops analysis and reasoning skills. Butler university60Students will learn to think logically, for example, by designing and following an experiment through to its conclusion and analyzing the results. Many students do not realize the amount of creative thinking and problem-solving skills that also go into biology; these will be developed as well. Biology majors also have the opportunity to hone their communication skills, both oral and written, as they present the results of their experiments. While many of these skills are emphasized in the classroom, independent research projects with faculty members and external internships afford many students the opportunity to apply these skills to real questions and problems. A biology degree is versatile. While many students major in biology as a precursor to medical or dental school, there are a number of other fields that students may pursue as well. Students may go on to work as lab technicians at hospitals, or at the state crime lab; others may go on to teach at the primary, secondary, or college level. Many choose to pursue environmental careers, such as working in forestry or parks, or even as an environmental lobbyist. Many biology majors choose to go on to graduate school, where they pursue research in genetics, ecology, cell biology, medical research, or any other of the wide variety of fields in biology. Many other career opportunities are available in biomedical research, agriculture, and environmental management, among other fields. Why Study Biology at Butler? The Department of Biological Sciences offers a curriculum emphasizing broad training in biology as the key to success in graduate school, professional school, teacher education, and technical careers. The major is built upon a strong foundation of core courses in the liberal arts, general biology courses, and biology electives to meet student interests. Students studying science should be exposed early and often to the methods of discovery, inquiry, and problem solving used by scientists to explain the natural world. Our faculty members are familiar with these methods as we apply them in our individual research programs, and we strive to develop such capabilities in our students. Therefore, we give our students opportunities to actively use the tools of scientific investigation in the lab and the field through a variety of courses at the molecular, cellular, organismal, and population levels of biological organization. Personalized attention is an important aspect of studying biology at Butler. Our biology class sizes are small relative to those at many institutions; even most of our introductory classes typically have fewer than 30 students, and many upper-level courses have fewer than 20 students. Classes are thus interactive learning environments that foster not only hands-on scientific inquiry skills, but also communication and critical-thinking skills that serve students well no matter what professional path they may choose after graduation. The low student-to-faculty ratio also provides opportunities for students to gain more intensive experiences through independent study with a faculty mentor. During the academic year, students are welcome to register for research credits. Another popular option, the Butler Summer Institute, is a nine-week program in which participants undertake independent projects they design with a faculty mentor. Student research is frequently showcased during the annual Butler Undergraduate Research Conference, which attracts college students throughout the Midwest each spring to present their research results to their peers. Students may also apply for funds to travel to other regional or national meetings via the Holcomb Undergraduate Grants program. Finally, students often co-author papers with faculty members for publication in professional journals or presentation at conferences. For example, recent joint student-faculty articles have been published in Biochemical Genetics, Evolution, Journal of Experimental Biology, Journal of Herpetology, American Naturalist, and Animal Behavior. Students studying biology at Butler also have opportunities for off-campus study, internships, and career exploration through special affiliated programs. For example, the Center for Urban Ecology educates and engages Butler students and citizens in the local community about the discipline of urban ecology and aims to create \"citizen scientists\" dedicated to continued stewardship of the natural world. Students can attend workshops, take classes, devise independent research projects, or participate in internship opportunities in ecology and environmental topics. Another option, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, is dedicated to understanding tropical biodiversity. The Butler-STRI partnership includes opportunities for students to serve as paid interns in Panama for existing research projects conducted by STRI scientists and for students to engage in new research initiatives with Butler faculty in Panama. Further, the partnership includes two CoLLEGE oF LIBERAL ARTS AN d SCIENCES 61 field-based courses taught on site in Panama by Butler biology faculty. Students may also want to apply for biology internships, which are available throughout Indianapolis, the state of Indiana, and surrounding states. Some students choose a major in biology as a gateway toward a career in health-related fields. Butler students who have qualified themselves with outstanding academic performance in the major have had great success in entering professional schools in medicine, dentistry, optometry, physical therapy, and veterinary medicine. Students receive individual advising by faculty on the selection of courses that will both satisfy the minimum entrance requirements and prepare them well for the professional school of their choice. In addition, the pre-professional school advising area within the Center for High Achievement and Scholarly Engagement plans co-curricular activities, maintains a reference library of useful publications, and coordinates the application process. Biology Student Learning Outcomes We expect that students will be able to show mastery of various types of learning during their progression through different types of courses in the major. By the time they complete the biology major, students should be able to: Demonstrate content knowledge and proficiency in using and explaining techniques essential to the study of fundamental areas of biology: genetics, cellular and molecular biology, and ecology and evolutionary biology Use and apply scientific literature properly to ask and answer questions in the biological sciences Design experiments and collect, analyze, and interpret data using graphical and statistical analyses, in order to evaluate hypotheses Communicate scientific ideas, concepts, and findings through writing and speaking Apply scientific findings to relevant societal issues Degree Programs Major in Biology (BS, BA) Minor in Biology Requirements for the Major A total of 37 biology credit hours are required. All first-year students must complete BI111 (Contemporary Issues in Biology) and the three fundamentals courses, which consist of BI210 (Genetics\u2014Fundamentals), BI220 (Cellular and Molecular Biology\u2014Fundamentals), and BI230 (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\u2014Fundamentals). BI230 is a prerequisite for all BI courses numbered 300 and higher. All students must also complete BI299\u2014Biology Seminar (pass/fail) in the spring semester of their second year in the major. To acquire the remaining credit hours for the major, students must take biology electives at the 300 level or above; at least four of these electives must be lab courses. One of the electives must be an organism-based course chosen from the following: BI301, BI302, BI311, or BI438 (indicated with an asterisk below). All senior biology majors must complete BI480 (Biology Capstone). In addition, all biology majors must take general chemistry (CH105-106 or CH107). Note: BI325, Principles of Pathogenic Microbiology, cannot be counted toward the 37-hour minimum required for the biology major. Students will be allowed to use a maximum of three hours of independent study credit, internship credit, research, or honors thesis credit toward the 37-hour minimum required for the biology major. Students must earn a grade of C- or better in all prerequisite courses as well as in all required courses for the major. Required Courses Note that all BI courses numbered 300 and above require BI230 with a C- or better except where noted below: BI111, Contemporary Issues in Biology (first-semester majors and exploratory students only; transfer students and those joining the major after their first semester at Butler are exempt from BI111, but must complete an additional hour of biology elective credit at the 300 level or above) BI210, Genetics\u2014Fundamentals BI220, Cellular and Molecular Biology\u2014Fundamentals (prerequisite BI210 with C- or better) BI230, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\u2014Fundamentals (prerequisite BI220 with C- or better) BI299, Biology Seminar (pass/fail) BI480, Senior Biology Capstone (prerequisite BI230 and senior standing) BI301*, Principles of Zoology Principles of Botany BI306, Mammalogy BI307, Vertebrate Biology BI308, Tropical Field Biology BI309, Local Flora BI311*, Biology of Algae and Fungi BI320, Animal Behavior BI323, Principles of ImmunologyButler university62 BI339, Philosophy of Biology BI401-403, Independent Study BI405-409, in Biology BI411, Principles of Physiology BI413, Vertebrate Histology and Microtechnique BI417, Terrestrial Biology BI418, Ecology BI419, Conservation Biology BI423, Advanced Evolutionary Biology BI430, Animal Development BI431, Plant Development BI432, Plant Physiology BI433, Advanced Cell Biology Transmission Genetics BI435, Molecular BI442, Comparative Biomechanics BI460, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology BI490, Internship in Biological Sciences BI499, Honors Thesis * Indicates organism-based courses, one of which must be taken as an elective for credit toward major.

Jeremy Johnson, PhD; LuAnne McNulty, PhD Instructors Adam Azman, PhD; Elizabeth Davis, PhD; Paul Morgan, PhD; Erin Whitteck, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/chemistry Why Study Chemistry? Chemistry is often referred to as the \"central science.\" It plays a role in the discovery of better medicines, in the development of safer chemicals for household use, and in the development of the next generation of electronic gadgets. An essential aspect to chemistry is the necessity of doing these things in a sustainable manner. The study of chemistry will do more than just impart technical knowledge, ideas, and techniques useful in a laboratory setting. It will allow for experiences that will develop problem-solving abilities and critical-thinking skills. Class and conference presentations, poster sessions, and lab reports will help develop proficiency in communicating in a variety of settings. The skills gained can be applied not just to careers in chemistry, but also to careers in health care, law, business, and education, and to the pursuit of advanced degrees in a variety of fields. Why Study Chemistry at Butler? The faculty and staff are dedicated to providing a supportive yet challenging environment for students interested in studying chemistry at the undergraduate level.

Classical Studies Administration Chad Bauman, PhD, Department Chair Associate Professor Christopher Bungard, PhD Assistant Professor Lynne Kvapil, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/classics Why Study Classics? The culture, history, and literature of ancient Greece and Rome have long captivated the imagination of people throughout history and across the globe, from the Renaissance to the founding fathers of America, to modern writers from the Caribbean. We continue to live in a world of classical roots, whether it be the Athenian roots of democracy or the Roman origins of our republic, the Greek love for the beauty of athletics, or an enthusiasm for theatre that moved from Greece to Rome to Shakespeare and beyond. The Greeks and the Romans helped articulate the liberal arts that are at the heart of a Butler education. As we engage with the thinking and the art of the ancients, we aim to develop an understanding, enjoyment, and critical appreciation of some abiding principles of our world. We enter into dialogue with minds of the past in order to understand ourselves better now. Studying the Greeks and Romans, we become part of our larger family over time. We enrich our minds and our imaginations, and we sharpen our skills for work and life today. Why Study Classics at Butler? Intimate and vibrant learning community: Students in the Classical Studies Program at Butler have the opportunity to work closely with a small but dedicated faculty. Smaller classes give students a greater opportunity to engage directly with faculty and with each other. As part of a smaller major, students develop a stronger sense of being part of a community of thinkers engaging in a subject they are passionate about. Building on past knowledge: Our program recognizes the quality of work many students have done before arriving on our campus. Students placing into the second or third year of Latin and completing at least six hours of study in Latin are eligible for 3-9 advanced placement credit hours, which may count toward the major or the minor. Real engagement with the ancient world: Students are encouraged to immerse themselves in the environments that inspired the ancient Greeks and Romans. Our program offers the opportunity to study the culture and literature of the Romans while traveling to important sites in Rome and Italy, or to participate in an archaeological field school in Greece. Our program is also supportive of students who wish to study abroad in programs in Greece and Italy specifically focused around classical studies. Practical experience: Our students are encouraged to take advantage of opportunities to work with faculty on research of their own, whether in the form of a Butler Summer Institute project or a senior thesis. Students who have done quality research have presented their work at undergraduate conferences and regional classics conferences. Making your education your own: Thanks to generous support from the Georgia Watkins Fund, our program provides funds to help students participate in archaeological digs, select summer study programs, or conferences in classics. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis. Embracing the liberal arts: Since the field of classical studies embraces a wide variety of approaches to the study of the ancient Greeks and Romans, our program CoLLEGE oF LIBERAL ARTS AN d SCIENCES 71 encourages students who wish to relate their interest in classics with work in other disciplines. Our students often take courses in English, history, philosophy, religion, political science, and the modern languages. Classical Studies Student Learning Outcomes Students majoring in classical studies are expected to gain factual knowledge about key figures, historical events, and concepts from Greek and Roman antiquity. They will interpret and analyze significant works from antiquity, and at the same time gain a better understanding of cultural diversity by comparing current values and practices to those of the Greeks and Romans. They will become proficient in reading Latin or Ancient Greek texts and discover how knowledge of Latin or Ancient Greek helps in the understanding of modern languages.

These disciplines are an excellent choice for students who enjoy problem solving and are good at mathematics and the sciences. Good communication skills are also a plus, as this type of work is typically done in small groups or as part of a team. Computers and software have become essential tools in all disciplines, so you can pair the study of computer science or software engineering with a major or minor in any other area of study, including the sciences, business, fine arts, or the humanities. Employment prospects in computer science and software engineering are excellent. Why Study Computer Science or Software Engineering at Butler? Our Engineering Projects in Community Service Program combines service learning with the practice of software engineering; student-run teams develop software for charity and nonprofit clients. Our supercomputer is available for student research projects, with possible support available through the Honors Program and the Butler Summer Institute. Our students learn parallel programming theory and techniques both in the first-year-level CS142 course and in the junior/senior-level CS452 course. Most of our students add a second major or minor and still graduate on time. Quality internships and part-time jobs are plentiful in the Indianapolis area. Our alumni advisory board is active and engaged, not only mentoring our students and visiting for pizza lunches with our students, but also advising the department on curriculum and career preparation. Our software engineering program prepares students for professional careers as software system designers, developers, testers, maintainers, and project managers. Our computer science program is more broad-based and prepares students not only for a variety of careers in the computing disciplines, such as systems or database administration and web development, but also for graduate study either in computer science or a related discipline, or for professional programs such as law school.

Economics provides you with problem-solving and data-gathering skills to make informed decisions in a variety of settings, e.g., government, law, finance, business, and journalism; and for a variety of job responsibilities\u2014from college intern to a newly hired bank credit analyst at one end of the spectrum, to U.S. senator, Supreme Court justice, or CEO of a successful business on the other. Besides being a strong major in its own right, economics is a nice complement for students who have interests in philosophy, political science, sociology, history, mathematics, psychology, foreign languages, engineering, and English. Indeed, the Nobel Prize in Economics is often awarded to economists who also have a keen interest in one of the above areas.Why Study Economics at Butler? You can study economics as a major in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and also as a major in the College of Business. The student in Liberal Arts and Sciences may have a given career path in mind but often does not. He or she knows that economics offers an array of opportunities and takes economics to learn critical-thinking skills and about the dynamic economic environment in which we live. The career choice will follow. The same applies to a student who majors in the College of Business, but the career choice in that case is more targeted to the business sector. The economics courses taken in either college are the same; the courses outside of economics, though, are different between the two colleges. Economics Student Learning Outcomes Students will learn and discuss issues such as how the Federal Reserve creates money and influences interest rates domestically and around the world, why the euro changes in value against the dollar, and the reason behind Zimbabwe inflation. You'll learn about the \"Wealth of Nations\" from rich countries (e.g., the United States) to poor ones (e.g., Bangladesh), about growing countries (e.g., China) and countries transitioning to capitalism (e.g., Russia). You'll learn about the invisible hand of the market and the different roles of government in a mixed economy. The tools in addressing these questions include supply and demand, international trade and exchange rate determination, monetary and fiscal policy, market structure, and statistical relationships.

It explores how economic life is intertwined with a society's culture, politics, values, and history. Further, it considers the limitations of the economic methodology to place economics in a context with the other social sciences. (U)(3) Fall and spring. SW221-COB, Sustainability in Institutions: There is an emerging body of thought that argues that, in order to be successful in the long run, institutions of all sorts\u2014including but not limited to businesses\u2014need to take into account economic performance, environmental impacts, and social justice. The course will explore what these concepts mean and the challenge of implementing a workable integration of these concepts. The course is crossdisciplinary and will get into issues of science, social science, ethics, and economics. Historically, environmental and social impacts have been considered, if at all, as costs to be ignored, minimized, or externalized as much as possible. This new body of thought argues that environmental quality and social performance should be integrated into institutional strategy. This course will introduce students to economic and ethical analysis in order to help them to have appropriate bases for making judgments. The course will then explore the challenge of minimizing environmental and social impacts.

Engineering Dual Degree Program Administration Joseph L. Kirsch, PhD, Program Director; Jessica R. McCormick, MST, Academic Program Coordinator and Advisor Program Website www.butler.edu/engineering The Engineering Dual Degree Program (EDDP) is a partnership between the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Butler University and the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indianapolis. Through this five-year undergraduate program, students can earn two degrees: a degree in engineering from Purdue University along with a degree from Butler University in one or more of the following disciplines: sciences; mathematics; economics; Butler university80or science, technology, and society. Application for the EDDP is through Butler University, as well as student enrollment and residence for the duration of the program. Why Study Engineering at Butler? Two universities. Two degrees. One program. The EDDP provides a student with the opportunity for a diverse, creative, professional, technical, and liberal educational experience occurring through two quality, neighboring universities. Students have access to engineering degrees that are ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) accredited and Butler University majors that rest upon a strong tradition of professional and liberal education. Our curriculum is integrated throughout the entire program. Most engineering courses are taught at Butler for the first three years of the program with courses taken at both campuses (a five-mile commute) during the last two years. Students receive individualized academic support and regularly graduate with their two degrees in five years. Career services are available to EDDP students through Butler University, the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indianapolis, and Purdue University at West Lafayette. One internship is required, which is typically completed during the summer; however, many students complete more than one or complement their internship with a research experience. Students have diverse educational experiences that lead to a wide range of career opportunities with a highly successful placement rate for graduates. EDDP students select a major from both institutions.

Walsh, PhD Associate Professors Chris Jason Goldsmith, PhD; Professors MFA; Brynnar Swenson, PhD Instructors Barbara MFA; Nicholas Reading, MFA; Robert Stapleton, MFA; Susan Sutherlin, MA Department Website www.butler.edu/english Why Study English? The English major offers students the tools to master close reading, formal analysis, literary history, critical theory, research strategies, and creative expression. English majors enjoy the beauty of great works of art as they simultaneously ask important questions about the relationship between language and the production of meaning and value. Our students learn to discuss and write critically about the many ways literature and language have influenced the values and lived experiences of societies over centuries, among genders and classes, races and ethnicities, and across geographical boundaries. When English majors head out into the world, we expect that they will carry with them a passion for reading and writing, and a commitment to use language clearly, purposefully, and with sophistication and elegance. Why Study English at Butler? The English Department at Butler University balances the study of traditional fields of English and American literature with a commitment to CoLLEGE oF LIBERAL ARTS AN d SCIENCES 81 interdisciplinary work, involving contemporary fields such as gender and sexuality, film studies, comparative literature, cultural studies, rhetoric of science, and creative writing. Our full-time faculty includes formalists and theorists, cultural historians and rhetoricians, and novelists and poets. Our course offerings reflect diversity: students can choose a traditional English Literature major, or a major with a concentration in Creative Writing; Literary Theory, Culture, and Criticism; or Public and Professional Writing. In each case, students will find small classes, dedicated teachers, and an active and engaged group of fellow students. Butler's English Department is home to one of the country's most important Visiting Writers Series, which encourages a sense of literary and creative community that goes beyond the classroom. Recent visitors to the series have included Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Russo, Yusef Kumonyaaka, Elmore Leonard, Jorie Graham, and Junot Diaz. The popular Visiting Writers Series course offers students the chance to meet and talk to many of these writers. The department's secondary programs also extend the opportunities for our majors, including a city-wide creative writing camp, a large peer-tutoring program where students help students across the University, an award-winning Writing in the Schools service-learning initiative, and an internship program where students gain experience in classrooms, pressrooms, and in small and large businesses. English Student Learning Objectives Our students graduate as incisive readers, cogent thinkers, and powerful writers, well prepared for any profession requiring a rigorous understanding and mastery of language. Because of their exposure to a vast array of human experiences in literature, English majors are more likely to be able to listen to the voices of opposition and disagreement; to accept the persistence in the world of ambiguity and complexity without resorting to facile simplification, clich\u00e9, or stereotypes; to consider evidence rather than rush to judgment; and to react to human dilemmas and suffering with compassion. English majors also carry with them a lasting ability to take informed pleasure in all forms of literature and creative production. We believe that the education our majors gain as readers and writers is invaluable whether they work in education, the legal field, the arts, electronic communication, publishing, business, the nonprofit sector, government, or other careers.Degree Programs Major in English (BA) Concentrations in Creative Writing; Literary Theory, Culture, and Criticism; Literature; and Public and Professional Writing Master of Arts in English (MA) Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing (MFA) Minor in English Literature Minor in Creative Writing Minor in Public and Professional Writing Requirements for the Major Minimum of 36 hours beyond first-year English Sophomore Requirements: EN185 and three of the four courses in the Literary and Cultural History Sequence (EN245, or literary criticism; two 300-level literature courses; one 300-400-level course in subject area not covered in the Literary and Cultural History Sequence; for seniors, one 400-level seminar and one 450-level senior essay with emphasis in writing.

Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies Administration Irune del R\u00edo Gabiola, PhD, Program Director Assistant Professor Brooke Beloso, PhD Program Website www.butler.edu/gender-studies Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies provides an interdisciplinary setting in which students can examine gender\u2014the social meaning of the distinction between the sexes\u2014and sexuality\u2014sexual identities, discourses, and institutions\u2014as they intersect with race, class, ethnicity, nationality, and transnational movements. In required courses, students analyze gender and sexuality from a variety of academic fields, and they explore the theoretical and historical basis of such study. Upper-division electives are chosen from at least three disciplines, allowing students to pursue their inquiries in more depth without narrowing their focus to a single field. Internships provide students with the option to apply theoretical knowledge to work and/or community-based learning opportunities. Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies is an excellent complement to all majors at Butler University, regardless of whether the student plans to attend graduate school or seek employment immediately after graduation. For students interested in graduate school, Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies provides a strong foundation in women's and gender studies, as well as for advanced work in any academic discipline that lends itself to gender Butler university88critique.

(U)(3) History and Anthropology\u2014 Including Geography Administration Elise Edwards, PhD, Department Chair Professors Bruce Bigelow, PhD; Paul Hanson, PhD Thomas Paradis, PhD Associate Cornell, PhD; Hunter, PhD; Zachary Scarlett, PhD Instructor Elizabeth Pfeiffer, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/history-anthropology The disciplines of history, anthropology, and geography share the same home because they address the same fundamental questions about life from different perspectives, the interplay among which enlarges our students' minds and lives. Butler is singular among American universities in knitting these three disciplines into a working organism. Prospective majors in both history and anthropology take a first-year course together, introducing them to each other and to the disciplines in their departments, thus offering all the advantages of self-standing disciplines and interdisciplinary approaches. CoLLEGE oF LIBERAL ARTS AN d SCIENCES 91 Members of the department offer expertise in wide-ranging areas of the world: the United States, Latin America, East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Within these areas we offer courses on the fundamental conditions that shape human life past and present: citizenship, politics, peace and war, gender, race, class, sexuality, language, economics, religion, and thought. The department offers a small student-faculty ratio, individual attention, and abundant opportunities for undergraduate research. Most of our students also study away from Butler, either abroad or in Washington, DC, offering them a taste of this increasingly global world we inhabit. Why Study Anthropology? Anthropology explores the human condition, appreciating humans and human practices holistically. The primary focus of our program is cultural anthropology, which studies the ways that humans create meaning, forge alliances, assert differences, reinforce social and political hierarchies, and expose vectors of inequality. Students are trained to read critically and understand the complexities of ethnography\u2014the research method and product that defines the discipline. They also have the opportunity to produce their own original ethnographic work in course research assignments as well as larger honors thesis projects, which may be the outgrowth of study abroad, field school, or internship experiences. The ability to analyze different cultures, figure out how they work, and step into them\u2014applying the characteristic methods and theories of our discipline\u2014readily prepares students for a variety of careers: health care, education, NGOs, and, increasingly, various forms of business. Anthropology majors are also well prepared for advanced study in anthropology and archaeology, public health and medicine, social and nonprofit work, law, and business. Why Study History? History explores the human condition throughout the world from earliest time to the present moment. It investigates what happened in the world and how it was understood in order to comprehend why people think what they think and do what they do. There is no question or problem of human life foreign to history. One age-old purpose of history is to ready people as citizens to care for the common good and public life. Another, equally venerable, is moral: history trained people to consider carefully the possibilities of good life or better life together. Not so long ago historians focused most of their attention on the politics, wars, and thought of elites. In recent years, history has broadened its scope to encompass the lives of all people. History as a discipline characteristically teaches its students to read and analyze texts and artifacts of every sort. Its search for meaning requires of its students creative intelligence to develop from their findings hypotheses and theories that seek an ever better, often changing, understanding of the patterns of human life. History is perforce a conversation, since it takes many eyes, ears, and minds to fathom the complexities of life on this planet, so historians offer their own thoughts and listen carefully to the thoughts of others to refine both. It is uncommonly fun. Students of history take these skills and habits of thought in every imaginable direction, to graduate and professional study, often to teaching, law, government, civil service, and business, frequently to vocations that care for people, and finally to building communities and raising children. Why Study Geography? Cultural geography brings together history, culture, and spatial patterning, and reinforces the message of both history and anthropology in a common department. Geography at Butler starts by studying Indianapolis, then moves outward to Indiana, the United States, and the world. These courses are generally valuable but particularly so to students preparing to teach social studies in secondary school. Why Study Anthropology and History at Butler? We are one of just a few joint undergraduate history and anthropology departments in the country, and we're the only one that approaches the disciplines in an integrated way. So you can be a history major, an anthropology major, or both. While ultimately you will decide your focus and course of study, your basic grounding in both of these closely related disciplines will deepen your understanding of how we work to understand humans and their worlds and make you a better historian or anthropologist. Both programs work together to train students to read with acuity, attend carefully to detail, write clearly, listen carefully, say well what they have to say, think both imaginatively and analytically, and work fruitfully with other people. We ask students to pose their own questions, seek answers to their questions in archival research or ethnographic investigation, develop their own ideas and opinions and address the ideas and opinions of other people throughout time and across the world, and grapple with the fundamental moral questions that life poses for Butler university92us. We seek to give students practice in thinking for themselves and good company in which to do so. Our small class size and student-to-faculty ratio guarantee one-on-one attention, mentoring, and guidance to all majors and minors. We know our students well. Because our students graduate with well-developed reading, writing, and critical-thinking skills, there's no limit to what they can do career-wise. Our graduates have become teachers and social workers, lawyers and doctors, business owners and consultants, museum curators and Teach for America alums, and even scientists and public health officials. During the past few years, students in the department have undertaken internships in circumstances as varied as the Indiana State House, the Indiana State Archives, the Indiana Historical Society, the U.S. Attorney General's Office, the Center for American Progress, archaeological fieldsites in Kenya, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Legal Aid Society of Indianapolis, the Kinsey Institute, a Tibetan refugee camp in India, Father and Families Inc. of Indianapolis, the Monroe County Historical Society, a women's domestic violence organization in Buenos Aires, Earth House in Indianapolis, and humanitarian organizations in Palestine. Anthropology Student Learning Objectives The anthropology program seeks to teach students to think for themselves, appreciate human and cultural differences, and master the basic tools necessary for understanding those differences. They learn to employ the ethnographic method, understand issues from a diversity of viewpoints, and ready themselves for responsible citizenship. More specifically, we seek to teach students the characteristic methods of anthropology and the basic range of anthropological theories, to analyze evidence and develop arguments, incorporate the views of other people into their projects, understand issues in all their complexity rather than oversimplify them, and share their ideas and research effectively. History Student Learning Objectives The history program seeks to teach students to think for themselves independently and critically, master the history of one part of the world, apply the past to understand the present, appreciate those who are different from themselves, appreciate academic and civil discourse, and ready themselves for responsible citizenship. More specifically, we seek to teach students the characteristic methods of history and the basic range of historical theories, to analyze evidence and develop arguments, conduct historical research, incorporate the views of other people into their projects, look at problems from a variety of perspectives, and share their ideas and research in proper form.

(G)(3) Individualized Major Program Administration Stuart Glennan, PhD, Chairperson, LAS Individualized Majors Program Committee Program Website www.butler.edu/individualized-majors Individualized majors meet the needs of students whose primary academic interests cut across traditional academic disciplines. This program allows students who have shown interest in crossdisciplinary work to design their own majors. The purpose of the individualized major program (IMP) is to provide an option to study a crossdisciplinary topic in depth, not to constitute a general-studies option or to replace a double major. The IMP may appeal to nontraditional and returning students as well as to students who have completed an associate degree and wish to complete a bachelor's degree with a different focus than their associate degree. Recent IMP students have graduated in Chinese language and culture, ancient Egyptian language and culture (Egyptology), music business, and medical illustration. Requirements The IMP consists of at least 36 hours of coursework, which must form a coherent whole. This may include work taken at other colleges, including work taken through the Consortium for Urban Education interchange in Indianapolis. All normal Core Curriculum and LAS College requirements must be met. In LAS, the same course cannot be counted toward two different majors. The proposed program should include an experience beyond the normal classroom-based course, such as an internship, a semester of study abroad, an honors or departmental thesis, a senior seminar in a relevant department, or a service-learning project in the junior or senior year. Because each IMP is unique, there is no fixed list or sequence of courses for the major.Butler university102Admission A student should submit to the IMP committee through its chairperson a proposal for an IMP anytime between the beginning of the sophomore year and the end of the fall semester of the junior year. In general, this application will include a general statement that describes the nature of the proposed IMP , how this IMP relates to the student's goals, and why these goals can better be pursued as an IMP rather than within a traditional major or double major. The proposal also should demonstrate the coherence and integrity of the proposed IMP , show that course resources are available to support the IMP (including courses to be taken outside of Butler), and provide evidence that the student has the motivation and initiative to carry out the IMP . The student should also recruit an advisor for the IMP and provide a detailed list of courses, which will constitute the major (subject to revision each year due to changes in available courses relevant to the IMP). The IMP committee will evaluate the proposal and decide whether to approve it. More information and the proposal application can be found at the program website.

Webster, PhD; Christopher J. Wilson, PhD Instructors Lacey P . Echols, MAT; Kathie J. Freed, MS; Karen Holmes, PhD; Mary Z. Krohn, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/math The department offers both majors and minors in each of the disciplines of mathematics and actuarial science. In addition to the departmental requirements listed below, a student must complete the Core Curriculum requirement, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences language requirement, and other general requirements listed in this Bulletin. A bachelor of science degree is also available in natural science and mathematics or in natural science and actuarial science for majors who complete a total of at least 60 credits combined from the two chosen areas. Why Study Mathematics? The mathematics major is well suited to and designed for students who are interested in gaining employment in government or industry jobs that require problem-solving skills, attending graduate or professional school, or teaching in secondary schools. Why Study Mathematics at Butler? The department faculty provides a personal education in a close-knit community. Students and faculty members know one another in supportive, professional relationships, and faculty members care about their students and their success and know every student by name. All of the department's classes are small\u2014fewer than 30 students in each one, including introductory-level courses. Every course is taught by faculty members with advanced degrees and with a wide range of specialties in the different mathematical subfields, and there are no graduate students teaching departmental classes. In these ways, the department offers a consistently student-oriented education. The department's curriculum is top-rated in quality. It adheres to the Committee for Undergraduate Program in Mathematics guidelines\u2014one of the few collegiate mathematics departments in the United States to commit enough teaching resources to do so. The Butler mathematics major is a wonderful choice for a strong investment in any student's future. Department professors are available to students. Each one maintains office hours\u2014no appointment necessary. The department's office doors are open every single workday. Faculty members support each other, and students may talk with any faculty member to get help needed. The department's Mathematics Tutoring Lab hires mathematics and mathematics education majors to provide support to students enrolled in lower-level and core mathematics classes\u2014at no charge. Mathematics faculty members are always open to sponsoring student/professor collaborative research for the department's majors, such as in the Butler Summer Institute. Dual degrees are available in engineering through a partnership with the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indianapolis (IUPUI). One dual-degree option is that a student can earn degrees in two majors\u2014for example, mathematics (from Butler) and engineering (from Purdue). (See Engineering Dual Degree Program\u2014EDDP .) Degree Programs Actuarial Science (BA, BS) Mathematics (BA, BS) Minor in Actuarial Science Minor in Mathematics Mathematics Student Learning Outcomes Our graduates are problem solvers with a broad knowledge of mathematical subfields. They are extraordinarily strong at thinking about and proving abstract mathematical statements, and they communicate mathematical solutions and concepts clearly and effectively. Butler mathematics majors carry with them an ability to understand mathematical arguments and assess their validity. They can identify the fundamental concepts in the main areas of mathematics, including set theory, logic, calculus, discrete mathematics, linear and modern algebra, and real and complex analysis. They can construct mathematical proofs using standard techniques such as induction, contradiction, and contraposition, and they can solve mathematical problems by applying abstract theory and/or mathematical models as Butler university108appropriate. Our graduates communicate well to various audiences\u2014to individuals who might be trained in mathematics and to those who are not. This ability includes the use of mathematical word processing systems to write mathematics. In these many ways, our majors understand various interconnections among the branches of mathematics, the discipline's breadth and depth, and its beauty.

An actuary is a mathematician responsible for estimating risks, primarily in the insurance and financial security industries. The Butler program prepares each major for a successful career as an actuary, as well as for the professional SOA (Society of Actuaries) Examinations in Probability (P), Financial Mathematics (FM), Actuarial Models (MLC and MFE), and Construction and Evaluation of Actuarial Models (C). Why Study Actuarial Science at Butler? Butler is one of only a few institutions in Indiana to offer an undergraduate degree in actuarial science. The department additionally offers a combined actuarial science/management curricular option, in which students can earn both an actuarial science undergraduate degree and an MBA degree. The department has a very active student club in actuarial science. It also works with a departmental board of advisors for actuarial science, whose members are alumni who work with the department faculty and student majors. For example, they often offer advice for the program and support departmental efforts to help students find internships and jobs. Each year, upper-level actuarial science major courses give students a chance to see, from a faculty member who can provide an industry point of view, how classroom ideas and issues arise naturally in the workplace. The actuarial science curriculum prepares students to take as many as three or four actuarial science examinations while still a student at Butler, giving them a jump-start on their career. Actuarial Science Student Learning Outcomes Our graduates enter the job market with a strong working knowledge of the basic concepts and theories of actuarial science. They are qualified to sit for the first five exams given by the Society of Actuaries (as listed above: examinations P , FM, MLC, MFE, and C). These actuarial science majors can solve insurance and financial problems related to risk assessment, and they know how to perform related calculations in applications of standard actuarial methods. Finally, they are able to communicate sophisticated quantitative analysis clearly and correctly to various audiences in both written and spoken presentations. In this way, our actuarial science majors are well prepared to take leadership roles in businesses that require risk-management services.

Modern Languages, Literatures & Cultures Administration Terri Carney, PhD, Department Chair Professors Terri Carney, PhD; Larry W . Riggs, PhD; Sylvie Vanbaelen, PhD; Juan Pablo Rodr\u00edguez Prieto, PhD CoLLEGE oF LIBERAL ARTS AN d SCIENCES 113 Instructors Melissa Etzler, www.butler.edu/mllc Why Study Modern Languages, Literatures & Cultures? The study of languages, literatures, and cultures gives students access to a broader global community, invites them to deepen their engagement with other linguistic and cultural traditions, and teaches them to be sensitive and critical readers of cultural texts. Becoming proficient or fluent in another language also enhances self-reflection, increases self-knowledge, and heightens awareness of one's own community and place in the world. Furthermore, a modern languages degree increases opportunities for employment because Butler students provide companies, nonprofits, and governmental entities with communicative and cultural analytical advantages in an increasingly shrinking world. Why Study Modern Languages, Literatures & Cultures at Butler? Small classes are led by internationally recognized and published faculty members hailing from such countries as Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, Colombia, El Salvador, France, Italy, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Senegal, Spain, the United States, and Uruguay. Our faculty members' wide variety of linguistic and cultural expertise enriches the curriculum and keeps students connected to the global communities they represent. Also, modern languages students consistently complete in-depth research with faculty and present at conferences both at Butler and around the country. Students who study with us find they are well- supported by the resources we have available in the Modern Language Center (Jordan Hall, room 391), where they receive tutoring, watch foreign language films, and work on group projects with our state-of-the-art media and computer stations. Modern languages students choose from a wide variety of well-established study-abroad options, including a three-week, faculty-led program in Costa Rica; a semester-long, faculty-led program in Spain; summer programs in China coordinated with the Confucius Institute at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; and more than 100 other programs offered by Butler's Center for Global Education, IFSA-Butler (Institute for Study Abroad), ISEP (International Student Exchange Program), and The Alliance for Global Education. Students receive credit for courses abroad with approval from the department chair. Students can take advantage of the Indianapolis community by completing a service-learning course and/or independent study that connects them with local language communities\u2014in which they can use their language skills to communicate with native speakers\u2014as well as by completing internships with governmental entities, educational institutions, nonprofits, and businesses. Modern languages studies can lead to these University course fulfillments and exemptions: If a student completes nine or more approved hours abroad, he or she can be exempted from one required Global and Historical Studies core course. If a student completes three eligible modern languages courses, he or she can be exempted from the Texts and Ideas core course requirement. Students can fulfill the Speaking across the Curriculum (SAC) and Writing across the Curriculum (WAC) University requirements by completing approved courses during eligible semesters.

Neuroscience Minor Administration Tara T. Lineweaver, PhD, Program Director Program Website www.butler.edu/las/neuroscience Neuroscience, an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the nervous system and its impact on behavior, cognition, and emotion, is a relatively new and rapidly expanding scientific field. Neuroscientific research describes the normal functioning of the nervous system, examines how the nervous system develops across the lifespan, and investigates the consequences of and potential interventions for neurological dysfunction due to abnormal development, disease, or injury. However, the implications of neuroscience stretch well beyond Butler university124this scope and provide both a cornerstone and important tools for understanding all human behavior. The neuroscience minor at Butler University introduces students to an interdisciplinary viewpoint regarding the science as well as the philosophy of the mind. Students from any major may elect to complete a neuroscience minor by taking courses in the fields of biological science, psychology, and philosophy. Requirements for the Minor The minor consists of 21 hours, including: Biology: 12 hours BI210, Genetics\u2014Fundamentals BI220, Cellular BI460, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology Psychology: 6 hours PS235, Biological Bases of Behavior PS412, Advanced Applied Neuroscience Philosophy: 3 hours PL346, Philosophy of Mind Peace and Conflict Studies Administration Craig W . Auchter, PhD, Program Director Program Website www.butler.edu/peace-conflict The Peace and Conflict Studies Program seeks to promote a critical understanding of the nature and dynamics of conflict, violence, and the conditions and practice of peace. It provides a structured program of study for students who wish to make issues of violence and conflict (interpersonal, intergroup, and interstate), social justice, human rights, ecological integrity, and peace at multiple levels more central to their university education. Contemporary peace studies is an arena of interdisciplinary research, study, dialogue, reflection, and action that is supported by a broad disciplinary base drawing on all of the social sciences and courses in the arts and humanities, sciences, education, and business. Through multi- and interdisciplinary study and practice, students in peace studies prepare for graduate study and a wide variety of careers in policy analysis, government, nongovernmental organizations, journalism, teaching, law, and business.Peace and Conflict Studies Student Learning Objectives Acquire a complex understanding of the nature and origins of violence, its dynamics, and different manifestations and modes of expression Better understand why conflict occurs, when and how conflicts become violent, and constructive methods of approaching and processing distinct types of conflicts that occur along a continuum from interpersonal to global settings Critically evaluate and devise strategies for peace through reflection on ethical, religious, philosophical, and cultural approaches to peace, the work of leading thinkers and activists in the field, and public policy Develop knowledge, analytical skills, and practical training through analysis of theories and theoretical models, case studies, language and value systems, and historical precedents and trends; service learning; practical training in conflict mediation skills; selected internships; and study-abroad experiences.

Philosophy and Religion Administration Chad Bauman, PhD, Department Chair Professors Allan Boesak, DTh (visiting); Katharina Dulckeit, PhD; PhD; Paul Valliere, PhD; Harry van der Linden, PhD Associate Professors Chad Bauman, PhD; Tiberiu Popa, PhD Instructor Brent Hege, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/philosophy-religion Philosophy Why Study Philosophy? Philosophy can help you hone some very practical skills. As a philosopher, you learn to distinguish between sound reasoning and empty rhetoric. Philosophy majors learn how to communicate clearly both in speech and in writing. Philosophy helps you to think carefully about ethical decisions. Collectively, these are skills that will help you in future graduate and professional education. They will also help you to live your life well, and what could be a more practical skill than that? Philosophy majors regularly outscore other majors on standardized tests such as the LSAT and MCAT, because they do equally well on both the verbal and analytic/quantitative sections. Philosophy is the only liberal arts major that specifically teaches both verbal and logic skills. In addition, the most basic assumptions in law, the sciences, and other disciplines are studied not in those disciplines but in the philosophy of law, philosophy of science, etc. Why Study Philosophy at Butler? Our philosophy classes are fairly small, which further encourages students to participate in class discussion and allows the faculty to devote considerable attention to each of our students. The enrollment limit in our introductory classes is generally 25, and the number of students enrolled in our upper-level classes is roughly between 10 and 20. Professors teach all courses; there are no teaching assistants at Butler. Many students engage in independent study and write honors theses under the supervision of professors. Additional learning opportunities include the Philosophy Club, which meets regularly for discussion, film viewing, speakers, and social activities. The reasoning skills of our majors are valued by graduate and professional schools as well as by employers. For example, a growing number of our majors have been accepted into reputable medical schools and prestigious law schools. Philosophy Student Learning Outcomes Students majoring in philosophy at Butler University will learn about a wide range of philosophical ideas and outlooks, and will become acquainted with some of the most influential thinkers in Western philosophy. Besides exploring fundamental questions pertaining to knowledge and reality, students will be able to discern and respond to philosophical issues that arise in areas as diverse as religion, science, politics, the arts, and the law. While critical thinking is encouraged and emphasized throughout the liberal arts, it is especially at home in philosophy; our majors are able to read and write clearly, to critically evaluate evidence and arguments, and to determine the quality of their sources of information. Philosophical training helps deepen our students' reflection on issues in the here and CoLLEGE oF LIBERAL ARTS AN d SCIENCES 127 now. Our professors encourage engagement in the community, including internships or research projects in which students' work can inform and be informed by their philosophical study. More generally, philosophy majors' ability to examine and question their own and others' values and convictions puts them in a position to make wise choices that will affect the quality and course of their lives and those of the people with whom they interact.

For some, the academic study of religion is a way of exploring their own commitment to a particular religious tradition. For others, it is a way of trying to learn about and understand the perspectives, values, and traditions of others. Whatever the student's motivation, the religion major offers the opportunity to engage in a critical and sympathetic study of various religious traditions; to study religious literatures, practices, and beliefs; and to investigate general questions regarding the nature of religion and the scholarly study thereof. A major in religion is a liberal arts major, and as such, exposes students to a wide spectrum of subjects and skills in order to produce broadly educated, sophisticated, and flexible leaders. What can one do with a religion major? Just about anything. Recent graduates of the program have gone on to study religion, law, public policy, medicine, and creative writing at the graduate level. Others have entered the nonprofit sector or religious ministries. Still others have found employment in a range of professions, like teaching, acting, and politics. Why Study Religion at Butler? Vocational discernment: Butler's religion program offers a close mentoring process designed\u2014through careful advising, experiential learning, and internship opportunities, and in collaboration with Butler's Center for Faith and Vocation\u2014to connect theory and practice and help students discern their vocational direction, integrating who they are (in terms of the values they hold most dear) and what they want to do. A big \"back yard:\" Within a few minutes of the campus are numerous churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and meditation centers representing all of the world's largest religious traditions. Butler's urban location therefore allows students to explore both traditional and emerging American religious phenomena, and the ways in which these are increasingly intertwined with and inseparable from global religious trends. Butler religion majors also often study abroad sometimes with support from departmental awards. Close contact with top-notch faculty: Butler's religion program offers small classes and boasts an unparalleled faculty-to-student ratio. Students therefore get to work closely (whether in class, through independent studies, or as research assistants) with professors who are active and widely recognized scholars. Empathetic approach: Whereas religion programs in religiously affiliated colleges and universities sometimes teach religion from a specific doctrinal perspective, Butler's religion major is designed to expose students more broadly to the world's major religious traditions. This approach challenges students to hone their skills of critical thinking, develops the ability to appreciate multiple religious perspectives, and provides an excellent preparation for many professions, including for those who intend to enter seminary or graduate work in religious ministry. An education both sound and savvy: The religion program at Butler University grounds its students in the classically broad tradition of the liberal arts, while at the same time providing them with the skills that are most crucial in the digital age. Religion Student Learning Outcomes Students majoring in religion are expected to gain a basic core of factual knowledge about the world's major religious traditions, acquire skills in critical thinking and textual analysis, develop the ability to identify and deploy credible sources of information (digital, print, or otherwise), cultivate understanding of and empathy for people of other faiths (in Indianapolis and beyond), and nurture a collaborative and civil disposition, that is, to work critically, openly, and with humility in the context of academic discussion and dispute.CoLLEGE oF LIBERAL ARTS AN d SCIENCES 131 Degree Programs Major in Religion (BA) Combined Major in Philosophy and Religion (BA) Minor in Religion Requirements for the Major Majors must fulfill each of the following six requirements.

Brabant, PhD Associate Professors Craig W Jett, PhD Assistant Professor Su-Mei Ooi, PhD CoLLEGE oF LIBERAL ARTS AN d SCIENCES 139 Professor Emeritus Dave Mason, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/political-science Why Study Political Science? The faculty members of the Political Science Department at Butler University see our discipline as connected to liberal arts, which are about studying and understanding ourselves, other peoples, and different ways of being and knowing, as well as about developing tolerance and empathy, and learning to use evidence and think critically. As political scientists, we seek to understand the causes of wars, social injustices, economic disparities, and uneven technological growth for the purpose of alleviating suffering. Because a liberal arts education encourages an activist disposition, we look for ways to address problems such as world poverty, inadequate health care, educational disparities between neighboring communities, and environmental degradation, and seek nonviolent solutions to human rights violations worldwide. The department deliberately challenges systems, institutions, and leaders that dehumanize, marginalize, and oppress any persons and other living beings. We seek to engage in intellectual practices that provide sustainable solutions for the betterment of all. Why Study Political Science at Butler? The department is committed to teaching students how to effect positive social change. In practicing citizenship skills that include empathetic listening, moral reasoning, personal responsibility, and a greater awareness of one's responsibility to the human polity, our students develop as active and engaged citizens at the local, national, and international levels. We offer courses that include service learning and community-based research, encourage students to accept responsibility for their learning, and recognize that knowledge may be obtained from a variety of different people and situations. Political Science Student Learning Outcomes Analyze and differentiate various political movements, structures, and institutions in the United States and other countries Differentiate and make connections between theory and practice, between global and local events, and between political science and other disciplines Demonstrate an awareness of different cultures and their effect on domestic and international affairs Demonstrate leadership and collaborative skills through active engagement in service learning and internships Apply research and communication techniques effectively Value the fundamental importance of one's membership in the human polity, emphasizing citizenship and political community Degree Programs Major in Political Science (BA) Minor in Political Science Requirements for the Major The major requires 33 hours of political science courses, of which at least 20 hours must be in courses numbered above 299.

But, what about the difference between Kerala and Beijing or between India and China? How does the USA compare to Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom? And why are some places less developed than others? While economists often rely on economic growth rates and GDP/capita to measure development, these measures tell us little about citizens' access to opportunities, their quality of life, or their political rights (or lack thereof ). If development is the \"process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy,\" as Amartya Sen argues, these indicators are radically incomplete. Focusing on the deeply contested concept of development, this seminar examine at the politics of economic growth and well-being. We will delve into the classical and contemporary literature on the political economy of development and will look closely at the development questions, trajectories, and challenges facing people across the globe.

First-hand insights gained through dialogue with those who make and implement policy and close scrutiny of key international issues provide students with a \"laboratory\" for understanding the politics of foreign policy making in the U.S. capital, how these policies are shaped, and why they succeed or fail to achieve their stated objectives. (U)(3) Occasionally. PO360, Political Regimes Latin America: Comparative study of the politics of development in Latin America with particular attention given to the interdependence of economic, social, cultural, and external influences upon political regimes as well as the efficacy and legitimacy of the regimes themselves.

Padgett, PhD Associate Professors R. Brian Giesler, PhD; Amanda C. Gingerich, PhD Assistant Professors Alison L. O'Malley, PhD; Scott Oster, PhD (visiting) Department Website www.butler.edu/psychology Why Study Psychology? The goal of an undergraduate psychology program is to introduce students to knowledge of the principles of emotion, behavior, and cognition as established by scientific methods. Students majoring in psychology study the core content areas of psychology and scientific methodology in preparation for graduate study and later professional pursuits in psychology or related fields. Why Study Psychology at Butler? Students in our program develop an understanding of psychological science through instruction in the classroom and hands-on participation in research projects. The classroom portion of the curriculum is structured so that students first receive a general overview of the topics and methods in psychology, followed by a more thorough exploration of specific content areas. We emphasize a broad and stable base of content: every psychology major studies the same basic core of subject matter and methods in psychology. Further, each psychology student has the opportunity to add depth to that knowledge by studying particular content areas more specific to his or her interests. Participation in student-faculty collaborative research is the hallmark of our program. We encourage students to become involved in research projects with one or more professors during their undergraduate years. Research involvement is structured so that students evolve from apprentices to collaborators by taking progressively greater responsibility for the design and execution of psychological research projects. Some students complete an honors thesis, a yearlong research project. They routinely make presentations at the Butler Undergraduate Research Conference and at national professional meetings such as the annual convention of the Association for Psychological Science. Approximately 80 percent of our graduates have collaborated on at least one research project. Students benefit from participating in student- faculty collaborative research in several ways. They have the opportunity to apply the concepts, theories, and ideas learned in the classroom. They also learn how to think like psychologists and how to conduct scientific research. No amount of reading about psychology or listening to instructors can replace the experience of conducting research in behavioral science. Because a career as a professional psychologist requires a graduate degree, the knowledge and skills students acquire through coursework and research experience in our program prepare them for graduate study. About two-thirds of our students attend graduate school either immediately after completing our program or after working for one to five years in a field related to psychology. Most of these students enter graduate programs in psychology, social work, and counseling. Some attend medical or law school. The remaining students begin careers in a wide range of fields, most of which are health-care- or service-related (pharmaceutical companies, nonprofit organizations, health care services, management, computer services, human resources, sales, education, and advertising, to name a few). Psychology Student Learning Outcomes Psychology students will demonstrate mastery of the core content areas of psychology and use critical thinking to advance scientific inquiry. Psychology students will also communicate their knowledge of the field to others, apply ethical standards to evaluate psychological science and practice, and will have developed a meaningful professional direction for life after graduation.

(U)(3) Science, Technology, and Environmental Studies Administration Carmen Salsbury, PhD, Program Director Program Website www.butler.edu/science-technology The Science, Technology, and Environmental Studies Program supports two majors: Science, Technology, and Society and Environmental Studies. The program is dedicated to providing students with an interdisciplinary perspective regarding the complex relationship between science and technology and our health, our families and communities, and our environment. Students are challenged to explore the sociocultural, economic, and political dimensions of practices of scientific research and technological development, to learn how our understanding of these practices and their products are shaped by language and communication, and to contemplate the philosophical questions raised by this enlarged perspective on the natural world, our place in it, and our obligations toward it. The science, technology, and society major prepares students for a number of career paths in health, education, law, public policy, communications, and other fields. The environmental studies major prepares students for careers related to the exploration, Butler university148management, preservation, and conservation of the natural environment. Both majors integrate the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science), humanities (history, philosophy, and English), and social sciences (anthropology, political science, sociology, and psychology). Service learning and hands-on community service are strongly emphasized to afford students the opportunity to apply their knowledge to real-world problems and connect with community partners and potential employers. Science, Technology, and Environmental Studies Student Learning Objectives Students majoring in science, technology, and society will: Analyze and investigate the interaction between science and technology, and social forces (e.g., economics, culture, religion, and politics) Analyze and explain how science and technology influence and are influenced by language, communication, and practices of public translation and transmission Describe and assess the philosophical, scientific, and moral standards that should guide the conduct of scientific research and technological development Research, write, and speak from an interdisciplinary perspective about issues concerning science and technology as they relate to society Students majoring in environmental studies will: Analyze and investigate the scientific basis of environmental issues facing both human societies and the rest of the living world in modern times Analyze and investigate challenges to solving environmental issues that stem from practical considerations tied to the political, economic, social, and ethical perspectives on the environment Research and communicate (in writing, orally, and symbolically) information from an interdisciplinary perspective pertaining to the environment Degree Programs Major in Science, Technology, and Society (BA, BS) Major in Environmental Studies (BA, BS) Minor in Science, Technology, and Society Minor in Environmental StudiesRequirements for the Science, Technology, and Society Major Core courses (12 hours): ST200, Introduction to Science Studies ST205, Science and Society Speakers Series (1-credit course that must be completed three times) Two of the following: ST310, Social Studies of Science and Technology ST320, Philosophy of Science ST330, Language, Rhetoric, and Science Eighteen hours of elective courses from various departments.

Sociology and Criminology Administration William Watts, PhD, Department Chair Professors Kenneth D. Colburn Jr., PhD; Antonio V . Menendez, PhD; Katherine B. Novak, PhD; Marvin B. Scott, PhD Assistant Professor Krista M. C. Cline, PhD Instructor Jess Butler, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/sociology-criminology Why Study Sociology and Criminology? Sociology and criminology majors are taught the basics of human interaction and relationships and acquire an understanding of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of social behavior. As all human behavior is primarily social, sociology promotes an awareness and understanding of a wide range of social and cultural issues, from the study of crime and deviance, to the study of social inequality and social welfare, to the study of racial, gender, and sexual diversity, to the study of globalization and multiculturalism. With an understanding of society and how the social context and social forces shape behaviors and an emphasis on strong critical-thinking and research skills, majors in sociology and criminology are well prepared for a wide range of opportunities after graduation. Why Study Sociology and Criminology at Butler? The Department of Sociology and Criminology aspires to be a cornerstone program in the social sciences, emphasizing writing and critical thinking, analytical skills, experiential learning, and an in-depth understanding of the changing world, including multicultural and global issues. The department provides comprehensive, sociology-based coursework in sociology, sociology with a specialization in social work and social policy, and criminology. Our program is distinguished by: A curriculum that emphasizes the connection between theory and practice. Students have numerous opportunities to apply what they have learned in the Butler university152classroom to real-world settings and to everyday life. Majors that culminate in a capstone experience. Students undertake and complete an independent empirical research project in their senior year that demonstrates their mastery of sociology or criminology. Students present their research findings at the Butler Undergraduate Research Conference or a professional meeting. An emphasis on multicultural and global issues. Our curriculum introduces students to other cultures and societies and prepares them for participation in an increasingly diverse and multicultural world. Student participation in internships and service-learning courses. Internships in criminal justice, human services, business, and community contexts provide students with practical experience and career opportunities. Service-learning courses promote learning through the active participation of students in the local community. Student engagement in the research process. Students have many opportunities to engage in the research process and to collaborate with faculty on research projects. A curriculum that prepares students for the job market and for advanced study. Graduates of the department work in a wide range of employment fields, including human services, social policy agencies, the criminal justice system, health care, and business. Majors also pursue advanced professional degrees in law and social work, as well as degrees in sociology, criminology, and other related fields. Numerous student opportunities beyond the classroom. The department sponsors a chapter of Alpha Kappa Delta, an international honor society for sociology. The Student Sociology Association conducts community-service projects such as tutoring disadvantaged youths and collecting food and blankets for the homeless. The association also sponsors speakers and a career panel each year. A diverse faculty of dedicated teachers and researchers. Faculty work closely with students and encourage student learning through hands-on experiences in and out of the classroom.Sociology and Criminology Student Learning Outcomes The core values of the Sociology and Criminology Department are placed squarely within a liberal arts tradition that strives to foster critical reflection, social awareness and responsibility, sociocultural diversity, and a global perspective. The department's central mission is to (a) foster a knowledge of social and cultural issues, theories, and research methods; (b) cultivate students' abilities to succinctly and clearly express this knowledge in oral and written form; (c) provide opportunities for students to utilize these acquired skills in an applied context; and (d) develop an awareness of global and multicultural issues. Students will develop a perspective that emphasizes critical inquiry and reasoning to address challenging social problems. Ultimately, our program and curriculum cultivates values that will shape students into lifelong, active, responsible, and informed members of the greater community.

Elementary Education In addition to receiving a comprehensive liberal arts background, students in the Elementary Education program are prepared for teaching and instructional leadership in elementary schools. With extensive site-based instruction, students learn alongside their professors, through guided practice and reflection that increases in scope over time, culminating in a full year of student teaching. Students will be in the classroom, working with children and program faculty, seven of their eight semesters. The elementary program and its faculty emphasize learning through doing, collaborative inquiry, a nurturing environment, and the development of a professional identity. By completing the program and all required standardized tests, students will meet state licensing requirements for grades K-6. Minors and/or licensing are also available in Reading, Special Education, English as a New Language, Early Childhood, and Recreation and Sports Studies. Specific curriculum requirement sheets are available at www.butler.edu/coe. This program addresses these University Student Learning Outcomes: Students will articulate and apply required content knowledge within their area(s) of study (cognitive). Students will communicate clearly and effectively (psychomotor). Students will share their talents with Butler and the greater community at large (affective).Middle/Secondary Education The Middle/Secondary Education program is committed to preparing teachers and other professionals to work toward achieving our College's core values and shared vision for education. We believe all our programs must prepare our candidates for schools and communities as they should be, not simply perpetuating them as they currently exist. The program is a comprehensive teacher education program that combines in-depth preparation in the academic content areas of English, mathematics, science (biology, chemistry, physics), social studies, physical education, health education, or foreign language (French, German, Spanish) with the professional teacher education skills necessary for success in educational contexts for undergraduates seeking licensure in grades 5-12 in these areas. Indiana teacher licensure for physical education, health education, and music education is P-12. Minors and/or licensing are also available in English as a New Language, Special Education, and Recreation and Sports Studies. Specific curriculum requirements for each content area are available at www.butler.edu/coe. The program is grounded in a set of beliefs, which serves as a compass to guide the work we do with students within our program. They are the principles that we hope will guide the work our candidates will do with their future students. We believe in the following: Primacy of the Learner Core Value: Diversity and Similarity Meeting the needs of the learner through the development of caring relationships is the most important part of our work. Learner needs are social, cultural, linguistic, developmental, physical, emotional, and cognitive in nature. Meeting the foregoing needs provides safe opportunities for learners to take risks that lead to individual growth. Learners come first. Ethic of Care Core Value: Integrity and Responsibility Our work with students, schools, teachers, the community, and each other will be grounded in an ethic of care, compassion, honesty, respect, and transparency. Developing caring relationships creates space for transformative experiences to happen.Butler university162Significance of Knowledge Base Core Value: Collaboration of Theory and Practice Content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge are inextricably intertwined. Theory and practice are linked, but ever-changing. This means we must intentionally model lifelong learning. Having a deep understanding of this knowledge base strengthens educators' ability to make informed curriculum decisions in the classroom. Integrated Inquiry Curriculum Core Value: Collaboration of Theory and Practice Content areas are integrated through meaningful connections and shared assessments. An inquiry mindset is modeled by learning alongside our students and being open to living with uncertainty and yet-to-be-answered questions. Site-Based Collaborative Experiences Core Value: Teaching, Learning, and Mentoring Placements are purposeful, and community stakeholders are considered a part of the larger learning community. Relationships are nurtured with classroom teachers, University supervisors, and faculty. Collaboration is seen as an intentional part of an educator's work. These beliefs further reflect our College's core values and guide the student learning outcomes we strive to achieve. These outcomes are as follows: Based on both formative and summative assessments, COE Middle/Secondary students will develop, implement, and adapt developmentally appropriate, inquiry-based, and engaging instructional lessons for students in middle school and high school. Using critical reflection as a basis for improving their professional practices, our students will create positive and inclusive instructional environments using their understanding of social, cultural, literacy, academic, and cognitive developmental characteristics of adolescent learners. They will demonstrate responsibility for their interpersonal and instructional interactions with students, parents, colleagues, and community partners.Approved Minors in the COE Mild Intervention Minor Licensure in Mild Intervention is only available, with additional coursework and passing the state-approved licensure exams, to students pursuing an elementary license.

Students have access to top internship opportunities, immersive study-abroad experiences at our partner schools around the globe, and the opportunity to participate in research with faculty through the Honors Program. COB students often continue their studies at top graduate and law schools. Students begin their journey with the First-Year Business Experience, in which they engage in guided self-exploration, hone their teamwork skills, and develop a business plan. This leads into an innovative sophomore experience in which students develop and run a live business for real money. Students and faculty work alongside professional consultants in the Butler Business Consulting Group, a consulting firm that is run within the College. Students also participate in a four-year career development program that involves two internships and career mentors. Interaction with real business continues throughout the curriculum\u2014from the first year through the senior year. The College also offers two graduate degrees. The Master of Business Administration (MBA) is a part-time program that connects theory with business practice. Students kick off their graduate coursework by participating in a one-day business problem-solving immersion experience with a local company in the Gateway Experience. This course gives students an initial exposure to the experiential, hands-on learning process in the MBA program. At the end of the program, students participate in the integrated Capstone Experience, which serves as the bookend to the Gateway Experience. This course pulls together everything the students have learned throughout the MBA program into a practical, applied, semester-long consulting project. In addition to these two unique learning experiences, students encounter \"real life, real business\" in a number of other ways on their path to graduation, including participating in a leadership development program, traveling with a faculty member on an international study trip, or serving as a Board Fellow. The Master of Professional Accounting (MPAcc) program prepares students for successful careers in the accounting profession, both public and corporate, as well as successful completion of the CPA exam. The one-year curriculum includes a set of fundamental accounting core classes and allows students to choose additional courses from two concentration areas: tax and financial reporting. In addition, students may incorporate a number of electives, including a Becker FastPass CPA review course and an international study trip. Vision and Mission The Butler University College of Business will become a recognized national center of excellence in business education. The COB mission is to prepare students for success in life and leadership in business through experiential learning guided by a research-oriented faculty with relevant business experience.

Curriculum guides, which list the specific courses required for each major and their sequencing, may be obtained from the COB office. All students complete the following four modules: University Core Curriculum The purpose of the core is to build broad interests and knowledge as a foundation for a change-oriented business career and useful life. Roughly half of the hours required for graduation are in liberal arts and sciences. The largest portion of the core is taken when the student is a first-year student or sophomore. Common Business Studies These courses provide students with a thorough understanding of business basics. The component comprises approximately 50 credit hours of accounting, economics, marketing, finance, business law, operations management, organizational behavior, and information technology courses. A capstone academic experience also is required in addition to practical experiences. Most of this element is taken in the sophomore and junior years. Professional and Career Development Program This portion of the program helps the student develop a career interest, a sense of emerging professionalism, problem-solving skills, and communication experience, as well as aid in attaining entry-level employment. This program includes two required internships as well as a series of experiential courses and career development courses and activities. Majors\u2014The Fourth Module Accounting The accounting major focuses on developing the knowledge and skills necessary to become a successful professional. Knowledge includes coursework in a variety of accounting topics\u2014financial, managerial, tax, auditing, and information systems. The program emphasizes the development of intellectual, communication, and interpersonal skills. Graduates may prepare themselves to sit for professional exams, including the CPA and CMA exams, and are equipped to become professionals in diverse environments including public accounting, private business, government, and other organizations. Accounting Student Learning Objectives Graduates will be able to: Explain and apply GAAP and identify the authoritative sources in which they are found. Explain the basic purpose of financial reporting and the theoretical concepts that underlie GAAP as described in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Conceptual Framework.Butler university194 Identify and describe the information system's internal control procedures as required by external accounting regulators. Economics The major in economics builds on the nine-hour requirement of economics taken by all business students and focuses on the behavior of both large and small decision-making units. It provides the student with problem-solving and data-gathering skills to make informed decisions in a variety of settings (e.g., business, government, and nonprofit) and for a variety of job responsibilities, from an entry-level position in a management training program, on the one hand, to a CEO of a corporation, on the other.

See website for detailed information. Doctor of Pharmacy/Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences www.butler.edu/cophs/dual-degrees One of the factors that limit many doctor of pharmacy (PhramD)students from pursuing advanced degrees is the time commitment of eight or nine years required to complete the PharmD degree, plus an advanced pharmaceutical sciences degree. The objective of this program is to provide students with a time- and financially-efficient way to meet their professional goals. The curriculum for the PharmD/MS dual degree integrates the existing curricula of the PharmD and the MS in pharmaceutical sciences. The PharmD degree allows students to work in many facets of the practice of pharmacy. Offering a PharmD/MS dual degree allows PharmD students to pursue additional training in the area of pharmaceutical sciences research. Having a PharmD/MS dual degree aids in the recruitment and retention of outstanding pharmacy students with a strong interest in research, and makes graduates more competitive for positions in the pharmaceutical industry or for academic positions.CoLLEGE oF pHARmACY AN d HEALTH SCIENCES 223 Years 1-3 as above Summer Research Following P1 Year Students will engage in summer research and receive independent study credits (five credits).

To qualify for the NAPLEX examination, a person must be a graduate of an ACPE-accredited pharmacy program, be at least 18 years of age, and be of good moral character. Persons convicted of a felony may not be eligible for licensure in Indiana. In order to participate in the experiential portion of the curriculum, students are required to submit the results of a background check for felony and/or misdemeanor convictions conducted by an independent agency. Students may be restricted from participating at certain experiential sites as a result of this information. Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences www.butler.edu/cophs/ms-pharmaceutical-sciences The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences offers the master of science in pharmaceutical sciences in five areas of emphasis: pharmaceutics, pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, pharmacy administration, and clinical sciences. The mission of the program is to educate students for pursuing research careers in the pharmaceutical/biomedical industry or in academia, and/or in obtaining advanced degrees. Admission Applicants are required to possess a basic degree in chemical, biological, or pharmaceutical sciences, or other appropriate degrees. Following admission, any applicant identified to be deficient by the Research and Graduate Review Butler university224Committee with a bachelor's-level background in chemical or biological sciences will be required to take courses in the respective areas in addition to the MS in pharmaceutical sciences requirements. Requirements Bachelor's degree in appropriate discipline with a minimum 3.0 GPA or equivalent (official transcript required). Aptitude tests (official scores must be received from Educational Testing Services). Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) (not required of anyone with a U.S. bachelor's degree). A TOEFL score of 213 (computer-based test), or 79 (internet-based test) meets Butler University's English language proficiency requirements. Butler's TOEFL school code is 1073. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score. The minimum GRE cutoff score for admission for each year will be determined by the Research and Graduate Review Committee. Brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Personal statement indicating a specific area of research interest and career goals. Three letters of recommendation evaluating the applicant's ability to complete the program successfully. International students must meet the financial independence criteria established by the University. Each applicant is evaluated based on a comprehensive review of undergraduate transcripts, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, previous research experience, and GRE score. International applicants will be interviewed over the telephone, and domestic candidates may be invited for a campus interview. Quality publications or other scholarly experience, although not required, serve to strengthen the application. For international students, admission is valid subject to obtaining appropriate visa credentials. Meeting minimum admission requirements does not ensure admission. The admission process follows two steps: preliminary inquiry and formal application with required nonrefundable fees. The response to the preliminary inquiry will be issued by either the Butler University Office of Admission or the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; however, the formal application can only be made to the Office of Admission. After initial screening, the Office of Admission will forward the eligible applications to the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences for the decision. The director of the COPHS graduate program, in discussion with the interested research faculty, will send the recommendations to the Office of Admission. Student Status Full-time: A full-time student must take a minimum of nine and a maximum of 12 credits of graduate-eligible courses per semester. If a graduate student is registered only for research and thesis courses (RX701-RX706) that apply toward the completion of the research projects, the student is considered to be enrolled full time, although the number of credits enrolled may be below the normal full-time course load. A Reduced Course Load authorization form must be submitted by F-1 graduate students under any circumstance when such students are taking fewer than nine credits. A maximum of four years is allowed to complete all the degree requirements. Part-time: Working professionals may pursue the MS in pharmaceutical sciences on a part-time basis. The conditions are: Applicants must comply with all admission requirements. Professionals admitted into the program must take a minimum of three credits per semester and complete all degree requirements within a maximum of seven years, with the didactic coursework being completed within five years of entry into the program. Research toward the MS thesis must be independent of research projects ongoing at the student's place of employment and must be publishable under an affiliation with Butler University. Research must be conducted during the course of the program. Part-time students will not be eligible for any financial assistance from Butler University. The research advisor must be a full-time COPHS faculty member. Financial Assistance The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences does not normally provide scholarships or tuition waivers for MS students. Depending on the availability of external funding, a limited number of partial-tuition stipends in the form of graduate assistantships will be provided to qualified, full-time graduate students conducting research in COPHS laboratories. Graduate assistants will be required to work up to 20 hours per week on campus on projects assigned by the Director CoLLEGE oF pHARmACY AN d HEALTH SCIENCES 225 of the Graduate Program, subject to valid immigration status. A full-time student must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and show satisfactory progress in his or her research project to qualify for financial assistance. Tuition stipends will be competitively awarded every year, with previously awarded students given preference. Graduate assistantships will be limited to a two-year period for each recipient. Each student is required to pay regular tuition or discounted tuition and maintain approved health insurance during the course of study. There is no assurance of financial assistance for any admitted applicant. The freedom to leave the program, for any reason and at any time, will be available to all students; however, untimely withdrawal from the program causes financial and emotional distress to the University community. Therefore, to protect the University's investment, it is the policy that any student accepting the tuition stipend as a graduate assistant is expected to complete the MS program. Any such student leaving the program prior to completion and without compelling reasons will be required to pay back the full amount of the stipend that has been awarded by the University, with the only exception being compelling medical reasons. Curriculum The master's program is an intensive curriculum of didactic courses and thesis research. Successful completion of the MS in pharmaceutical sciences degree will require at least 30 semester credit hours with not fewer than six hours of research credit. The findings of the research must be compiled into a thesis and defended with an oral presentation and an oral examination by the thesis committee. Coursework is as follows: Required Core Courses for Emphasis Areas of Pharmaceutics, Pharmacology, and Medicinal Chemistry (total 12 credits) RX780, Current Topics in Pharm Science* 1 (2 semest ers) Seminars in Pharm Sci* 1 (2 semest ers) RX782, Ethics in Research 1 RX7 83, Introduction to Pharm Research 2 RX7 84, Exp Design & Data Analysis 2 RX7 85, Biopharmaceutical Analysis 3 * Each student will be enr olled in one credit hour of Current Topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences or Seminar in Pharmaceutical Sciences per semester, for a minimum of four total credits in the program. Each student is required to present at least two seminars as part of his or her master's program, one of which may be the thesis defense. Students must enroll in RX781 during the semester in which their seminar presentation will take place, and RX780 during the remaining semesters. Regardless of the course in which the student is enrolled, all graduate students are required to attend all graduate seminars presented in COPHS. Elective Courses (minimum six credits)RX630, Advanced Toxicology 3 RX632, Drug A buse\u2014Pharmacol, Chem, and Soc Aspects 3 RX7 29, Cancer Pharmacology 3 RX7 87, Industrial Pharm: Pref/Prod Dev 3 RX7 86, Advanced Drug Delivery 3 RX7 88, Molecular Biology/Pharmacology 3 Additional electiv e courses will be included as per the recommendation of the Research and Graduate Review Committee. Deficiencies in curricular background may be addressed by requiring appropriate undergraduate courses as determined by the thesis committee and/or director of the graduate program. Additional coursework and/or research credits to fulfill the requirements of the MS degree will be determined by the thesis committee. Academic Progress The Research and Graduate Review Committee will evaluate the academic progress of MS students. Master's students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 for satisfactory continuation of study. Students with a cumulative GPA below 3.0 will be placed on probation. Any appeal for non-research course grade disputes and/or disciplinary action should be submitted to the Research and Graduate Review Committee. A decision can be appealed to the COPHS Academic and Professional Affairs Committee. A decision of the thesis committee on the thesis and the thesis defense will be considered final. A grade of incomplete will be assigned for Research and Thesis (RX701-RX706) at the end of the respective semester until the thesis defense is complete, as it is difficult to justify the research outcomes based on the student's performance for a particular semester. Research Proposal A research proposal summarizing the goals, objectives, and timeline of the research project must be submitted within one year of admission. The proposal must be approved by the thesis committee and the director of the graduate program.Butler university226Classified or Proprietary Study Each MS student is required to submit a thesis and present an open seminar on his or her research findings. In addition, the student is required to disseminate the research findings at national meetings and submit manuscript(s) for publication. Therefore, in order to protect the student's interest, it is not advisable to involve him or her in any classified or proprietary research. MS Thesis Each student is required to submit a thesis prepared on the research findings. The thesis should be compiled following the format provided. Publication The research project should aim at publication of the findings in peer-reviewed research journals and submission of the work as preliminary data for extramural funding by the research advisor. Thesis Defense The student will present an open seminar and appear for an oral examination by the thesis committee. The committee will recommend the graduation of the student to the faculty and to the dean of COPHS subject to satisfactory completion of the didactic courses and other requirements. A student failing in the open seminar or the oral examination may appear for a second opportunity to complete the specific part of the thesis defense. Student Ownership of Intellectual Property For students who help create a copyrightable work or patentable invention with one or more University employees (faculty and/or staff ), the following guidelines from the University's Intellectual Property Manual may help determine when the University has certain rights in a work or invention the student has been involved in producing while at Butler. If the work or invention was created or conceived with the \"substantial use\" of University resources, then the work or invention may be subject to University ownership and control, with the student and/or faculty member having certain rights as described in the University Intellectual Property Policy. For example, rights in a patentable invention arising from a student's participation in a faculty research project that makes \"substantial use\" of University resources will be owned by the University, with any income from the patents being shared between the University, faculty, and student as set forth in the University Intellectual Property Policy. The policy thereby establishes the means and incentive for commercialization of the invention. The rights vest with the University. However, the ownership of copyrightable works that are not produced at the direction of the University, even those created with \"substantial use\" of University resources, will generally continue to be owned by the creators of the work with some rights being reserved for the University. While the above is a general overview with some examples, do not hesitate to ask a faculty member for guidance, or refer to the Butler University Intellectual Property Manual, at www.butler.edu/birs, for specific guidelines. Additionally, the Butler Institute for Research and Scholarship is a valuable resource to help with questions related to these matters, and can help ensure that any intellectual property is properly protected and given the best opportunity to be commercialized. Master of Physician Assistant Studies www.butler.edu/physician-assistant The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences offers a master of physician assistant studies (MPAS) degree for those completing the requirements of the physician assistant (PA) program. Physician assistants are well-recognized and highly sought-after members of the health care team. Working interdependently with physicians, PAs provide diagnostic and therapeutic patient care in virtually all medical specialties and settings. They take patient histories, perform physical examinations, order laboratory and diagnostic studies, develop patient treatment plans, and provide patient education. In all 50 states, PAs have the authority to write prescriptions. PAs practice in all specialty fields; 33 percent of all PAs provide primary care services, especially in family and general internal medicine. Their job descriptions are as diverse as those of their supervising physicians, and also may include nonclinical roles such as medical education, health administration, and research. While these positions do not involve patient care, they depend on a strong clinical knowledge base. The MPAS curriculum is 24 consecutive months designed to provide an understanding of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes used as a physician assistant. The first 12 months of the MPAS program are devoted to didactic studies in the basic medical, clinical, and behavioral CoLLEGE oF pHARmACY AN d HEALTH SCIENCES 227 sciences, and the remaining 12 months are largely focused on the clinical experiences in primary care, medical, and surgical specialties. The didactic curriculum is integrated to introduce the student to medical sciences as they relate to specific organ systems and clinical problems. Learning strategies include the traditional lecture format and basic science laboratory, hybrid, small-group tutorials, and patient case discussions. Regular patient contact is an important part of the first-year curriculum. Students begin to see patients during the didactic year. Standardized patient evaluations, through simulation and actors, are also a part of the didactic curriculum. As part of the clinical curriculum, students participate in rotations and didactic coursework. Students are required to take core rotations in emergency medicine, family medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, mental health, pediatrics, and women's health. Students also choose an elective rotation. In the clinical year, students also participate in Core Topics, Issues of Professional Practice, and the Summative Practicum. Goals/Student Learning Outcomes Select highly qualified applicants through the admission process, who will successfully complete our physician assistant program Provide a quality educational experience that provides students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for entry-level practice as physician assistants Provide an educational experience that prepares our graduates to provide primary care in a wide variety of clinical settings Help our students develop a sensitivity that will allow them to effectively work with patients who are different than themselves Maintain our status as the longest accredited PA program in the state of Indiana Promote professionalism, service, and leadership of students and faculty Eligibility and Admission There are two admission pathways to gain entry to the PA program: the direct admit pathway and the standard admission pathway. After reading the information regarding the admission process, contact PAadmissions@butler.edu for any additional questions. Direct Admit Pathway The direct admit pathway, designed for incoming University first-year students who wish to become physician assistants, is a competitive process. Students will complete a bachelor of science (four-year) degree in health sciences (BSHS). This degree is designed to meet all PA program prerequisites and provide a strong foundation for a career in a health profession. Students selected in this pathway who successfully complete all requirements will be offered a seat in the PA program. These students will not be required to complete the standard admissions process (AE or NAE evaluations). Students within the direct admit pathway are required to fulfill all criteria listed below to maintain eligibility for direct admission. A student who fails to meet any of these requirements will lose direct-admit status, but will be able to apply to the PA program using the standard admission process. The requirements are: Maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.4 at Butler University by January 15 of year of matriculation Earn no grade of C- or less in any course on first attempt Complete the BSHS degree by the end of the fifth academic year from start of matriculation Maintain full-time enrollment during fall and spring semesters Remain free of conduct code violations (per COPHS and Butler University policies) Interested Applicants. To be admitted via the direct admit pathway, applicants will be required to meet the minimum entry requirements for Butler University and the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences with regard to GPA and standardized test scores (SAT/ACT). The minimum entry requirements are 3.3 GPA, 1200 SAT, and/or 26 ACT. However, the average GPA for those actually being accepted is 4.18 on a 4.0 scale; the mean ACT is 31.5 and the mean SAT is 1274. The Office of Admission also considers a student's nonacademic involvement (e.g., early application, extracurricular involvement, service, discernment, personal statement, etc.). The number of students admitted to this program will be approximately 30 per year, and offers of admission will be based on a competitive process. Students should apply to Butler University as a senior in high school and identify that they are interested in applying to the PA program as a direct admit student. It is strongly recommended that applications be submitted as early in the admissions process as possible, as offers are extended in a modified rolling admission process. Questions should be directed to Aimee Rust-Scheuermann at arust@butler.edu in the Office of Admission.Butler university228Standard Admission Pathway Students not meeting the direct admit pathway criteria may apply to the standard admission pathway. Admission to the Butler University physician assistant program requires online application through the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA), at portal.caspaonline.org. The application is available from April 17. In addition to completing and submitting the web-based application by August 1, candidates must also submit: CASPA application fee. Official transcripts from all colleges/universities (including Butler University) and other post-secondary institutions attended. A baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution is required. College seniors are eligible to apply, provided they receive the baccalaureate degree prior to the May starting date for the PA program. Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores (general test) submitted no later than August 1 for the year prior to matriculation (Butler University's GRE Code: 1073). No other test scores are accepted in lieu of the GRE. Scores must be sent directly from Educational Testing Services to Butler University. The standard admission pathway comprises an academic evaluation and a nonacademic evaluation, described below. Note: The PA program has the right to change interview processes as it deems appropriate. Academic Evaluation. The academic evaluation (AE) is determined through a combination of collegiate GPA based on any college course at the 200 level or above and the composite GRE score. These items are weighted, and candidates are rank-ordered based on these markers. The top AE candidates are selected for an on-campus nonacademic evaluation. Rankings from the AE will be zeroed, and candidates moving into the next phase will be considered equal at the start of the nonacademic evaluation. The minimum eligible overall GPA for coursework is 3.4. The median GPA for those students matriculating each year is dependent on the cohort; however, in 2014, it was 3.77. The PA program currently does not use a minimum GRE score; however, the current mean score is 308. The GRE score must be provided to CASPA at the time of application. Nonacademic Evaluation. Multiple mini- interviews are used in the nonacademic evaluation (NAE). Candidates complete a series of task-oriented stations that are evaluated by PA program faculty, alumni, active preceptors, and/or community-based PAs. The stations are designed to demonstrate characteristics necessary to be successful within the program and/or discernment appropriate for the PA profession. Special Considerations The Butler University PA program recognizes the special heritage to our profession provided by the U.S. Armed Services. A minimum of one seat in the program will be \"reserved\" for either a veteran or active military member (Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard). The military candidate must meet all minimum AE criteria and must complete the NAE. While the program does not require health care experience for consideration of admission, it is recommended to help with the discernment process. International students are important to the fabric of the Butler student community; however, no special consideration is granted for an international student. If you are a student planning to study in the United States under an F-1 or J-1 visa, we hope you will consider Butler University. International students must have a TOEFL score and evaluation of any international transcripts. Please note that this takes additional time, and that deadlines will not be extended for these purposes. A TOEFL score of 550 (paper-based test), 213 (computer-based test), or 79 (internet-based test) meets Butler University's English language proficiency requirements. Butler's TOEFL school code is 1073. Contact Emily Robison at erobison@butler.edu for additional guidance and/or questions. Offers of Admission. After the NAE process, selected candidates will be extended a conditional offer of admission into the Butler University PA program. The candidate will have one week from the date of the offer to either accept or reject the seat. The candidate must meet all University and PA program prerequisites and requirements. Upon acceptance of the offer, the candidate will have one additional week to provide a nonrefundable $1,000 deposit to secure admission. Background Check Candidates offered admission to the Butler physician assistant program will undergo a criminal background check during orientation and at least once during enrollment. Continuation within the program is dependent on an acceptable background check that CoLLEGE oF pHARmACY AN d HEALTH SCIENCES 229 would allow completion of the program and credentialing requirements. Application Timeline The PA program has the right to change timelines as it deems appropriate; however, the following timeline should provide guidance to interested applicants. Contact PAadmissions@butler.edu for additional admission questions. April 17: CASPA application available August 1: All material must be received and verified by CASPA August 1-September 1: Academic evaluation of candidates Mid-October (generally): Nonacademic evaluations Following NAE: Offers of admission to top candidates extended until class filled Prerequisites Students must complete the following course prerequisites with a grade of C or better to be considered for admission to the PA program. Earned Advanced Placement exam scores of 4 or 5 may substitute for prerequisite courses. Scores less than 4 are not acceptable. Appropriate earned AP scores may replace no more than two prerequisite courses. Applicants should submit copies of exam scores to PAadmissions@butler.edu. Chemistry Inorganic (general) with lab (2 semesters) Organic with lab (1 semester) Additional chemistry course at or above 300 level (1 semester) Biology Any biology-related course at or above 200 level (5 semesters). Examples might include but are not limited to anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, genetics, microbiology, immunology, physics, bioengineering, biomedical science, exercise science, neuroscience, zoology, and nutrition. Statistics/Biostatistics Any course (1 semester) Social Sciences Psychology or sociology courses or combination (2 semesters) For information about transfer credits and course equivalencies, contact the PA program at PAadmissions@butler.edu. Degree Requirements Students are required to complete 108 semester hours to be awarded the MPAS degree. The proper sequence of courses must be maintained. The student is responsible for making certain that he or she has completed all required courses in the curriculum. The curriculum is offered in two sections (didactic and clinical years) that are individually indivisible and to be taken in an uninterrupted sequence over two years. Therefore, it is expected that students first matriculated into the AP- or MPAS- didactic year will maintain simultaneous enrollment in all courses offered as a component of each year's curriculum. Students may not progress to the coursework in the next year of the program until they have successfully completed all courses within the current year. PA students must earn a grade of B- or better in all courses. PA students may be dismissed from the College following failure of any two AP- or MPAS-designated courses, in addition to not adhering to the policies listed in the COPHS Student Handbook. A PA student, after presenting a written request to the dean of the College (with a copy to the PA program director), may be granted an official leave of absence for personal, medical, or academic reasons for a period not to exceed one calendar year. If the leave of absence is approved, the dean provides written notification including applicable beginning and ending dates to the student, the University registrar, and the director of the Office of Financial Aid. The student must notify the program director in writing of his or her wish to return to the program or to extend the personal leave at least 60 calendar days prior to the anticipated date of reentry. The student desiring an extension beyond one calendar year may be required to apply for readmission to the program. When a leave of absence is taken, the program director may require the student to repeat some or all of the courses completed prior to the leave of absence. In all cases of leave of absence, the student is required to complete the full curriculum to be eligible to earn the BS and/or MPAS degree. Any student who is absent from clinical rotations for three months or more must perform and pass an observed history and physical examination (on a real or simulated patient) before being allowed to return to clinical rotations. The student will have two opportunities, evenly spaced over a two-month period of time, to pass this assessment. If unsuccessful, the student will be dismissed from the College. For purposes of deferring repayment of student loans during a school-approved leave of absence, federal regulations limit the leave to six months. All questions regarding financial aid or student loans should be directed to the Office of Financial Aid.Butler university230Curriculum The program reserves the right to change the curriculum at the discretion of the faculty. A student must successfully complete all courses in each didactic semester before being allowed to advance to the next semester. Only students admitted to and currently enrolled in the PA program of the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences may register for courses offered as part of the curriculum numbered with AP or MPAS designators. Such students also must maintain their eligibility to continue in the PA program.

Clinical Year The clinical phase of the program is largely composed of four- or eight-week core rotations. Core rotations include behavioral medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, general surgery, and women's health. Pediatrics, also a core rotation, is three weeks in length. At the conclusion of each core rotation, students will be required to take an examination. There is not an associated exam with the elective rotation. There is one four-week limited-elective rotation. All questions regarding rotations for PA students should be directed to the Office of Experiential Education. Advising and Registration Students must participate in early advising for clinical rotations. Further, students must be officially registered for all clinical rotations/experiences for the professional liability insurance policy carried by the University to cover them in the clinical portion of the curriculum. Students participating on rotations/experiences without registering will be referred CoLLEGE oF pHARmACY AN d HEALTH SCIENCES 231 to the Academic and Professional Affairs Committee for appropriate action (e.g., warning, probation, suspension, dismissal). End-of-Rotation Examinations The Butler University PA program faculty utilizes the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA) written End of Rotation (EOR) Examinations and endorses the objectives utilized to develop these exams as imperative to enter into practice as a physician assistant. Students will take an examination at the end of each supervised clinical practice experience. In order to be permitted to sit for the required EOR exam, each student must:1.

At least 50 percent of the credits in any emphasis must be unique to that program and may not overlap with another emphasis, major, or minor (except as free electives). Composition Jazz Studies Music History Music Performance Music Theory Piano Pedagogy Music Minor A minor in music is available to students who are not enrolled in a music major. It consists of 24 semester hours, of which 14-16 are specified. The remaining hours are unspecified and may be taken in applied music, ensemble, music education, music history, diction, or music theory. Jazz Studies Minor A minor in jazz studies is available to students who are not enrolled in a music major. It consists of 26 semester hours. Graduation Requirements Common to All Undergraduate Music Degree Curricula The last two semesters of applied study must be earned in residence at the University. In most areas, students are given a choice of applied instructor dependent upon teacher availability and approval of the Chair of the School of Music. Each student who makes use of a University-owned band or orchestral instrument is responsible for any damage or loss. There is also a fine for unauthorized use of University-owned instruments. Applied upper-divisional examination: required of all music majors whose degrees JoRdAN C oLLEGE oF THE ARTS 271 require applied major study beyond the sophomore level. Students must audition for upper-level applied study during board examinations following the fourth semester of lower-level applied study. Failure to pass the upper-divisional exam will require repetition of lower-level applied study until such time as the exam is passed; applied credits taken during this period will count as electives but will not fulfill the required applied credits. A student who does not pass the upper-divisional exam may reapply by the end of the next semester of applied study. If a student does not pass on the second attempt, the student may not complete a music degree that requires the applied upper-divisional exam. A student must have obtained upper-level status in applied music in order to present a degree-required recital. Details of the contents of this exam are available online. Students in a degree program that does not require an upper-divisional examination may continue to take lessons at the major level (200 level) without passing an upper-divisional examination, with the approval of the applied instructor. If a Butler student, regardless of major, is taking applied lessons, he or she must register for the lessons for credit and pay the appropriate applied music fee. Students may not pay a music faculty member directly for private instruction. Music education students are required to pass an upper-divisional examination in music education at the end of the sophomore year. Specific requirements are available online. Music composition students are required to pass an upper-divisional examination in composition. This is normally done at the completion of the fourth semester of composition study.

Journalism is all around us. It appears on our televisions, computers, mobile devices, and on the printed page. It is both a discipline that is indispensable to the world's democratic societies, and an approach to communication that has been universally adopted by news organizations and the media industry as well as government bodies, law firms, trade associations, corporations, nonprofit groups, and digital entrepreneurs. In fact, almost every profession uses the knowledge, skills, and mindset of journalism to tell their stories and present information. In short, journalism has become a gateway degree that applies regardless of where your career path leads. As highly innovative and creative professionals, journalists today use a wide range of digital tools and investigative approaches to produce meaningful, multidimensional content and stories that inform, teach, attract, entertain, and engage audiences. Individuals who produce journalism are adept at finding, questioning, analyzing, interpreting, and explaining complex information and data. While vast opportunities abound for students trained in journalism, the true value of the profession flows from its commitment to seek the truth and provide people throughout the world with accurate, verified information that is used to effect change, chronicle the human condition, and improve and enrich lives, communities, and nations.

Sports Media Administration Ken Creech, PhD, Co-Chair; Nancy Whitmore, PhD, Co-Chair Department Website www.butler.edu/sports-media Why Study Sports Media? The sports media industry has grown into a multibillion-dollar business that involves ongoing technological innovation that allows media professionals to expand sports content across multiple media platforms. While sports continues to deliver massive audiences and advertising revenue to the media, sports coverage has become the product that drives audience interaction and interest in sports. In short, the sports media industry has become the defining commercial and cultural connection for both industries. Given its proliferation, numerous career opportunities exist for graduates with a sports media degree. Why Study Sports Media at Butler? Butler's Sports Media Program places students in one of the nation's leading sports cities, covering NCAA and pro-sporting events like the Final Four, NFL Monday Night Football, and \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing\"\u2014the Indianapolis 500. Students develop and broaden their skills and understanding of the industry on the field, in the press box, and in the locker room at some of the nation's biggest sporting events. Offered through the Eugene S. Pulliam School of Journalism and the Creative Butler university316Media and Entertainment Department, our interdisciplinary approach to sports media provides students with a solid foundation in multimedia journalism and digital media production. We offer: Rich, hands-on education in sports journalism, sports media and information, sportscasting, and sports media production High-quality internships with professional sports organizations, such as the NFL Colts, the NBA Pacers, the NCAA, and Indianapolis Sports Corporation Wide-ranging opportunities to participate in our student-led, multi-platform sports media outlet, BU:30; produce live streams of Butler Athletics; and build your professional network through Butler's sports industry connections Sports Media Student Learning Outcomes The sports media degree will provide students with a: Solid foundation in the fundamentals of multimedia journalism and digital media production Rich experiential education in sports journalism, sports media and information, sportscasting, and sports media production Broad understanding of the sports media industry; its cultural, legal, ethical, and economic impact; and the role media professionals play in the industry In the process, students will develop professional skills, competencies, and knowledge in the following areas: The sports media industry and its historical, cultural, economic, and evolutionary aspects Information gathering, i.e., source development, interviewing, observational reporting, documentary/public records research, and investigation Synthesizing information, i.e., critical analysis, skeptical thinking, complex reasoning, and evaluation Communicating information, i.e., writing, audio and video communication, on-camera delivery, and mediated communication Digital software, platforms, and technology appropriate to the field of sports media Team-building, collaboration, and leadership Media economics Professional, ethical, and legal standards and responsibilities of the field Application of relevant analytical and theoretical frameworks to the practice of sports media Degree Program Major in Sports Media (BA) Requirements for the Major One course in media technology: CME106, Survey of Digital Media One introductory course in print journalism: JR112, News Writing: Print One introductory course in electronic journalism: JR113, News Writing: Electronic Two introductory courses in digital media production: CME102, Media Aesthetics and Basic Studio Production CME215, Fundamentals of Videography and Video Editing One introductory course in digital journalism: JR235, Digital Journalism Two applied courses in sports media: JR355, Sports Journalism JR407, Sportscasting One elective course in the sports industry: STR356, Sports Promotion JR427, Special Topics in Journalism: Sports Media Topics One advanced course in journalism or digital media production: CME415, Advanced Editing JR312, Multimedia Journalism II One practicum course: JR350, Media Internship (3 hours) JR353, Media Internship (6 hours) CME455, Internship (3 hours) CME475, Internship (6 hours) One capstone course: CME457, Digital Media Project Design and Management JR412, In-depth Journalism Three conceptual courses: JR358, Perspectives on Sports and Media JR409, Media Economics and Regulation CME452, Entertainment Media and the LawCoLLEGE oF Comm UNICATI oN 317 Strategic Communication: Public Relations and Advertising Administration Rose Campbell, PhD, Department Chair Department Website www.butler.edu/strategic-communication Why Study Strategic Communication? Strategic communication emphasizes the creation and distribution of socially responsible, research-supported, and theoretically sound targeted communication messages for both internal and external audiences. Strategic communication majors, therefore, learn the theories and skills required for successful written, visual, and oral communication. In addition, majors gain valuable skills related to research, strategic thinking, and problem solving that will serve them well in professional careers or graduate school. Why Study Strategic Communication at Butler? While many programs offer courses in advertising and public relations, few have successfully merged their curriculum to reflect the increased blurring of lines between these two disciplines. Butler's Strategic Communication Department, however, recognizes that it is necessary for our majors to understand the synergistic nature of advertising and public relations to succeed in the diverse fields that comprise strategic communication. But success in strategic communication relies on more than this, of course. Our courses are rigorous, highly interactive, and experiential. Students are not only introduced to concepts, processes, and theories, but also are challenged to apply their knowledge to solve real-world strategic communication challenges through problem-based learning and service-learning opportunities, and national-level public relations and advertising competitions. We like to say that our students \"practice the profession\" from day one. Class sizes are also small, typically around 18 students, and led by passionate and dedicated professors. Strategic communication students also learn outside of the classroom as active participants in the various extracurricular opportunities the program offers. Through participation in the Public Relations Student Society of America Butler University chapter, ADrenaline advertising club, and an internship program, our students have outstanding experiential learning opportunities with a diverse array of businesses, advertising, and public relations agencies, as well as government and nonprofit organizations in Indianapolis and throughout the country. In this way, students gain the real-world knowledge necessary for a successful career. Strategic Communication Student Learning Outcomes In keeping with the liberal arts tradition, students majoring in strategic communication will gain a broad-based education that emphasizes an understanding of the larger cultural context in which strategic communication occurs. On a practical level, students will also gain the theoretical foundation and industry-relevant skills to create and produce effective oral, written, and visual communication messages for distribution via a diversity of media, including print, broadcast, and digital platforms. To achieve these ends, students learn to research, analyze, select, and organize relevant data and information; they learn and apply relevant analytical or theoretical frameworks to professional practices and situations; they critique and evaluate the effectiveness of communication messages; they work collaboratively to achieve desired goals; and they integrate communication technology effectively into all of these efforts. Further, as the strategic communication major emphasizes the production of socially responsible messages, students learn to appreciate and respect the professional, ethical, and legal standards that govern our field.
