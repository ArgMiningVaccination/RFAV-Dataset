But when the media (inevitably) does report (one-sidedly) on some kind of (flimsy) link, are you and your fellow industry leaders ready to squash yet another onslaught of #energy lies as enthusiastically as my kids have been squashing lanternflies this summer? If your answer is no, then check out this episode of 'The Energy Detox,' which uses the \"Kill it! Squash it, smash it\" campaign from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to help arm you and your stakeholders with the tools necessary to eradicate (figurative) spotted lanternflies that are wreaking havoc inside and outside of your organization. To learn more about the figurative lanternflies that inspired this episode\u2014those being the recently released Pitt health and environment studies\u2014check out the Marcellus Shale Coalition's latest blog, which demonstrates how to effectively stomp out media misrepresentations that, if left unchallenged, could be even more damaging than the real lanternflies: https://marcelluscoalition.org/2023/08/25/pitt-studies-contain-serious-methodological-flaws/ Summary of the 4 tools outlined in the episode: 1) Squash lanternflies head-on: Address misleading narratives or misconceptions directly. Like spotted lanternflies\u2014which can't jump to the back or side\u2014they will escape the bottom of your foot unless you attack them from the front. 2) Seek, demand, and utilize good data about lanternfly whereabouts: Don't assume that an occasional employee engagement survey or town hall meeting is revealing everything you need to know about the location and severity of toxicity within your organization. 3) Make good use of internal and external predators: Ally with trusted, knowledgeable resources who can hunt out lanternflies and help you construct innovative control methods. 4) Require and demonstrate universal responsibility: Nobody\u2014including you and other leaders\u2014is exempt from the responsibility of squashing lanternflies; and if you're not demanding that everyone takes actions to protect the integrity of your organization, then you risk having an irreversible infestation. #ConsciousLeadership - [Are You Unwittingly Dumping Toxic Waste Into Corporate Waterways?](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-you-unwittingly-dumping-toxic-waste-into-corporate/id1503040340?i=1000623796579) Are You Unwittingly Dumping Toxic Waste Into Corporate Waterways? You may not have soaked your audience in human waste today...but there's a good chance your words & actions have unwittingly made a few of your stakeholders nauseous in the last 24 hours. So take a moment to dive into this conversation about the \"Dave Matthews Band Chicago River incident\" of August 8, 2004 and apply 5 tips from today's vomit-inducing anniversary that will help you shift your #leadership style from nauseating to energizing: 1) Avoid Toxic Communication Dumps: From late-night, non-urgent email requests to evasive-sounding conversations filled with hollow \"corporate-sounding\" clich\u00e9s, the easiest way to mitigate the impact of toxic communication releases is to avoid them in the first place 2) Lay Proper Containment: If you don't stop the ripple effect of toxic rumors among your gossiping front-line leaders, it can cause far more damage than a leaking pipeline or an overflowing tank 3) Filter and Rate Your Communications: Revisit your recent emails, meetings, phone calls, etc. and give them an emoji-based \"nausea rating\" from 1 to 5, where 1 nauseated () represents minimal vomit-inducing language; 5 nauseated faces () is on par with dumping 800 pounds of human waste on an unsuspecting group of tourists; and 2 to 4 nauseated faces represent ~90% of LinkedIn posts. 4) Translate Toxic Messages: transform corporate fluff into relevant and actionable messages BEFORE your audience starts coming up with their own (mis-)translations 5) Clean Up Your Messes: Whether it's a band who dumps human waste into a river, an #oilandgas company who has an inadvertent release, or a manager who suffers a flare-up of foot-in-mouth disease, owning up to mishaps and rectifying them swiftly gives you a chance to avoid leaving a permanently bad taste in stakeholders' mouths. #ConsciousLeadership - [Pitch Framing Principles to Keep Your Leadership Performance Above the Mendoza Line](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pitch-framing-principles-to-keep-your-leadership-performance/id1503040340?i=1000621618653) Pitch Framing Principles to Keep Your Leadership Performance Above the Mendoza Line How can the art of pitch framing help your leadership performance stay above the Mendoza Line?

For example, when speaking to an environmentalist about headlines linking fossil fuels and Canadian forest fires, acknowledge their disappointment regarding the millions of acres of lost trees...and calmly point out that you'd need to burn 3-4 million acres of forests per year to generate the same amount of energy the United States produces from #naturalgas. And when trying to convince a high-potential job candidate that early career, in-person work is more beneficial than remote work, calculate and present the potential increase in LIFETIME earnings; and make the value of this investment crystal clear. 2 - Manage excessive \"fuel loads\" in your team. Regularly clear out rumors, uncertainties, and unresolved issues that may be causing stress or confusion. 3 - Ensure effective \"fire suppression\" by giving people the space they need to execute, clearly defining roles and responsibilities, and avoiding micromanagement. 4 - Eliminate the \"diseases and insects\" leading to large areas of dead and dying wood. Actively remove any toxic or unproductive elements causing decay or harm. - [Energy & Environment: The Yin and Yang of MVP-Level Leadership](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/energy-environment-the-yin-and-yang-of-mvp-level-leadership/id1503040340?i=1000615913078) Energy & Environment: The Yin and Yang of MVP-Level Leadership As 2013 NL MVP Andrew McCutchen closes in on career hit number 2,000, another MVP (Mountain Valley Pipeline) is finally closing in on completion of its ongoing construction/permitting saga that will have taken over 2,000 days from start to TIL.
