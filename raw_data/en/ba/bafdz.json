Due to the extreme potency of native tetanus toxin, manufacturing and regulatory efforts often focus on TTxd production, standardization, and safety, rather than product modernization. Recently, a genetically detoxified, full-length tetanus toxin protein (8MTT) was reported as a tetanus vaccine alternative to TTxd (Przedpelski et al. mBio, 2020). Here we describe the production of 8MTT in Gor/MetTM E. coli, a strain engineered to have an oxidative cytoplasm, allowing for the expression of soluble, disulfide-bonded proteins. The strain was also designed to efficiently cleave N-terminal methionine, the obligatory start amino acid for E. coli expressed proteins. 8MTT was purified as a soluble protein from the cytoplasm in a two-column protocol to > 99 % purity, yielding 0.5 g of purified 8MTT/liter of fermentation broth with low endotoxin contamination, and antigenic purity of 3500 Lf/mg protein nitrogen. Mouse immunizations showed 8MTT to be an immunogenic vaccine and effective as a carrier protein for peptide and polysaccharide conjugates. These studies validate 8MTT as commercially viable and, unlike the heterogenous tetanus toxoid, a uniform carrier protein for conjugate vaccines. The development of a recombinant, genetically detoxified toxin produced in E. coli aligns the tetanus vaccine with modern manufacturing, regulatory, standardization, and safety requirements.
