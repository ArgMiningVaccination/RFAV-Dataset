ABOUT WENDY: Wendy Littlepage CHom, is a Certified Classical Homeopath. She was very unwell in her 40's and when typical Western medicine failed to bring relief and healing, she began to search out and use alternative healing modalities. In 2009, her dog fell ill from a reaction to an arthritis drug. A pet store owner recommended Homeopathy. Therein began a journey to provide comfort for her dog, that extended to the exploration of Homeopathic treatment for herself. It worked so well that she took an introductory Homeopathic course to learn about homeopathy, that ultimately led to four years of study. She became a Certified Classical Homeopath in 2018.
