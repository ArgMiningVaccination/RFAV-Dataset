Introduction Viral suppression is the process of suppressing or reducing the function and replication of a virus. People with higher viral loads have a greater risk for immune system damage which in turn, leaves the body at risk for opportunistic infections. When discussing antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, a regimen is highly successful if it reduces a person's viral load to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies/ml). The term \"viral load\" refers to the number of copies of HIV per mL of blood, i.e., the amount of virus in the blood. Achieving viral suppression by taking HIV medicines allows people living with HIV to have nearly normal lifespans and greatly reduced chances of transmitting the virus. It is now recommended that persons diagnosed with early disease are initiated on ART, and as these new guidelines are implemented, the prevalence of viral suppression should increase. Currently only 30% of all people living with HIV have achieved viral suppression. Yet, 76% of people in HIV medical care [achieve viral suppression](http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/hiv-aids-medical-care/index.html). If ART is discontinued, a person's viral load will likely return to a detectable level. So, to achieve viral suppression, it is important to have clients take their anti-HIV medications exactly as prescribed. This is known as \"treatment adherence.\" Disparities persist in the estimated rates of new HIV infections. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) of all races and ethnicity remain the population most profoundly affected by HIV. In 2010, the rate of new HIV infections for Latino males was 2.9 times that for white males, and the rate of new infections for Latinas was 4.2 times that for white females. Young Black/African American MSM aged 13-24 are at highest risk. These groups are the most difficult to engage in care and keep in care. They are less likely to have access to resources that promote health. They are likely to live in poverty and be homeless. Besides, some may not have health insurance or coverage, which might present extra challenges for accessing and maintaining care. Timely linkage to care and greater frequency of care visits are associated with faster time to viral suppression with implications for individual health outcomes and for secondary prevention. These also lead to an important public health outcome - community viral load suppression. Therefore, it is important for all clinicians to be aware of their client's frequency of medical care visits, treatment adherence, and viral load. This tool kit offers clinicians several resources to assist clients in increasing their knowledge about HIV infection, transmission, the importance of consistently taking their medication according to provider directions, maintaining low to no risk behaviors, and overcoming socioeconomic barriers. Getting and keeping people in HIV medical care saves lives. Keeping HIV at a low level helps clients stay healthy and live longer, and greatly reduces the chances of passing HIV on to others. 2.
