This requires understanding local determinants of outcomesand experiences and their dependencies on numerous interacting sectors.Measurement at human-centric scales is now possible because the digital data explosionenables near-real-time estimates of local scale, high frequency, stochastic indicators ofweather, environmental conditions, infrastructure capacity and response, andsocio-economic and behavioral patterns.We need analyses of the mechanisms through which co-evolving sectoral processes incities lead to differential impacts across social groups and changes in urban resilienceand vulnerability.Co-production with urban stakeholders is critical to ensure decision-relevant science.This is needed so that key processes in the systems and sectors of interest to stakeholdersare incorporated into scientific scope and so that the research community can benefitfrom local knowledge, understanding, perspectives on issues of critical local concern, andcommunity-based solutions.There are significant structural impediments to knowledge co-production; research thataims to advance equity and environmental justice goals in urban contexts must developstrategies to cope with these structural impediments.Digital Trace Data Explosion Enables Transformative Human-Centric ResearchThe recent explosion in digital trace data available about human behavior, mobility, andsocial processes is a transformative opportunity - for understanding fundamentalcharacteristics of anthropogenic processes; for measuring and understanding inequalityand its determinants; and for policymakers to understand what cities can do to mitigateand adapt to climate change on decision-relevant timescales.We need investment in data validation and comparison to infer representative real-worldmetrics from digital traces of anthropogenic processes. This requires rich computationalmethods - Bayesian data 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban InteractionsMachine learning models are a powerful strategy both for arriving at complex decisionswith the help of massive and heterogeneous datasets and for predictive forecasting indecision support for future urban scenarios.If the data management infrastructure can be streamlined and scaled, observations andinsights would be available for research and policy in a near-real-time manner.Understanding Urban Resilience Requires New Theory, Observations, andModeling that Integrates Human and Natural SystemsHazard-related risk is a function of environmental conditions as well as system-levelinteractions among infrastructural, behavioral, and institutional factors. Understandinghow these factors interact to mitigate or enhance risk is a critical area of researchrequiring new theoretical frameworks, observations, and modeling.Beyond vulnerability assessment, decision-makers need insight into the multi-objectivetrade-offs among alternative adaptation strategies. This requires scientific foresightregarding the implications of hypothetical investment decisions, management changes,and/or environmental changes that may be out-of-sample with respect to past observedexperience.In particular, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions can complementengineered infrastructure to enhance resilience and reduce urban emissions. Research isneeded to understand how these investments function and at what scale they can beimplemented.The physical characteristics of environmental extremes can be modified by the builtenvironment within urban areas. This highlights the importance of two-way couplingamong natural and human processes in urban areas.Cities are Concentrators of Complex, MultiSectoral InteractionsExamining how hazards propagate through urban systems is a useful way to understandcoupled system behavior, including interactions across multiple scales and sectors,tipping points, differential harm, and adaptive responses.The heterogeneity of urban geographies and communities has implications fordifferential outcomes as well as key processes that play out at fine geographic and socialscales. Determining which outcomes and processes require highly resolved data andmodeling methods is important for guiding scientific investments.The capacity to generalize knowledge from one case study to other cities and regions isunderdeveloped. Research on urban systems requires both depth that accounts forlocally specific conditions and breadth that enables comparative evaluation acrossregions.3October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban InteractionsSynthesis of Key Workshop Motivation51b: Workshop Objectives and Science Questions61c: Workshop Structure and Participation7Section 2: Summary of Plenary Session9Section 3: Environmental Hazards Breakout113a: Extreme Heat123b: Drought133c: Flooding133d: Wildfires and Smoke14Section 4: Social Scales Breakout164a: Individuals and Households174b: Communities and Neighborhoods184c: Cities and Regions194d: Nation to InteractionsSection 1: Introduction1a: Workshop MotivationUrban areas and the supply networks that support their resource use are inherently MultiSectoral systems composed of infrastructural, environmental, and socio-institutionalcomponents. These systems are vulnerable to accelerating and interacting stresses from climatechange, population growth, resource scarcity, and land-use pressure at the same time as theyhave a major influence on regional and global systems. For instance, a majority of the world'sgreenhouse gas emissions, food consumption, and economic activity can be attributed to urbanareas. Urban areas are highly heterogeneous, both across and within cities in terms of theirsocio-demographic, environmental, and infrastructural characteristics. This heterogeneityshapes how urban systems interact and co-evolve and contribute to different economic,environmental, and health outcomes for communities within urban areas. Urban heterogeneityalso generates differential vulnerabilities to stressors and differential capacity for adapting tochange. The evolution of urban space is thus critical in shaping how human societies respond toglobal change as they seek to improve resilience to stressors, support prosperous and equitablecommunities, and use natural resources in a sustainable manner. Developing a fundamentalscientific understanding of urban heterogeneity and system interactions across sectors andscales is critical for mapping the resilience, sustainability, and equity implications of alternativefuture pathways.Meanwhile, there is increasing recognition that urban systems are a key context for examiningfundamental questions related to system dependencies, tipping points, and uncertainties. Thereis also a recognition that urban areas are a fruitful context to explore methodologies for modelcoupling across sectors and scales. Likewise, within the federal agencies such as the Departmentof Energy (DOE), there is increasing interest in developing shared modeling and datacapabilities for understanding water- and energy-related challenges, many of which intersectwith urban infrastructural, environmental, and social systems. However, efforts to coordinateamong research groups and combine multi sector urban tools and insights to examine keyuncertainties, interactions, and trade-offs are still nascent.While social, ecological, and engineering domain-centered research is critically important, thissiloing has the potential to lead to incomplete solutions or unintended tradeoffs. Making onepart of an interconnected system more robust can introduce vulnerabilities elsewhere. Solutionsthat address only one system domain are unlikely to prove resilient in the future, under new anddifferent stressors across these system domains. 5October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Interactions1b: Workshop Objectives and Science MultiSector Dynamics (MSD) Community of Practice is a multidisciplinary collective ofresearchers based at universities and national labs across the United States that aims to improveour understanding of the co-evolution of human and natural systems over time, and build thenext generation of tools that bridge across sectors (energy, water, land, economy) and scales(spatial, temporal), and offer a holistic view of systems-of-systems.The MSD Urban Systems Working Group organized this workshop to provide a venue forcoordination and identification of shared objectives, research themes, and major knowledgegaps, as well as developing a shared strategy for addressing those gaps.Overarching science questions that motivated the workshop are:What are the risks and trade-offs faced by the world's urban areas as they seek toincrease resilience to changing stressors and balance multiple objectives such as humanhealth, economic development, and sustainable use of energy, water, and land resources?How does urban change influence larger-scale infrastructure, economic, and Earthsystem processes, and how is urban evolution constrained by these larger systems?What role does social, environmental, and infrastructural heterogeneity within urbanareas play in shaping evolutionary dynamics, and what are the implications of thisheterogeneity for outcomes related to environmental justice?Which processes and couplings must be represented in conceptual frameworks, models,and data tools to rigorously understand multi-sector dynamics and the evolution ofurban systems?Key objectives were to:Foster shared understanding and lay the groundwork for collaboration among urbanresearchers across disciplines.Identify synergies across existing tools, models, and analytic capabilities.Identify critical knowledge gaps and high-priority research topics for moving thecommunity forward that are particularly focused on identifying where the DOE'shistorical strengths in Earth system observation, model-data fusion, climate modeling,human-Earth interactions, high-performance computing, population demographics, andinfrastructure modeling can contribute to the fundamental science needs for urbanresearch. 6October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactions1c: Workshop Structure and Participation Figure 1: A conceptual diagram demonstrating multiple lenses that can be used for organizingthe complexity of urban systems and scientific research on urban systems. In the center,environmental, social, and built systems processes interact to produce outcomes of relevanceto resilience, equity, and sustainable use of resources. Moving outward, lived experiences anddecision-making take place on a continuum of social scales from individual to institutional.Key process interactions and heterogeneities differ across spatial scales from neighborhoods tonations. Sectors connect people and resources across urban landscapes and act as behavioralaggregators from smaller to larger scales through infrastructure networks and managementinstitutions. Urban systems are embedded within larger environmental systems and arevulnerable to changing hazards, which motivates questions regarding resilience andadaptation and provides a lens through which to understand differential outcomes andinteractions across sectors and scales. The outer circle highlights the ways that we createknowledge about urban systems. Scientific insight and data, in turn feedback to informdecision-making and behavior across the social scales highlighted in the center. Each of theselenses provides a useful perspective on urban systems, and each is incomplete on its own.7 October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban InteractionsThe workshop was held virtually on July 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, 2021 in coordination with theSnowmass Energy Modeling Forum, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Lawrence BerkeleyNational Laboratory.On July 21st, we hosted an open invitation plenary session with presentations and a paneldiscussion by four leading urban scientists: Luis Bettencourt, Karen Seto, Anu Ramaswami, andPaul Waddell. July 22nd and 23rd consisted of themed, small group discussions organizedaround the idea of research 'fault lines' - different ways of organizing the complexity of urbansystems through disciplinary, methodological, or sectoral perspectives. By acknowledging whatis often implicit, we aimed to better address the interactions across different ways ofunderstanding cities. This can create space for integration and fundamental insights into thesystems, sectors, scales, and processes that cities are composed of. The four breakout sessionswere organized around 1) earth system hazards, 2) social scales, 3) urban sectors and systems,and 4) research epistemologies and methodological strategies. Figure 1 highlights our vision forhow these lenses interact and complement each other.The keynote panel on July 21sthad about 100 participantsfrom 36 institutions includingattendees from five DOE national laboratories, the DOE, and many universities. There wereinternational participants from institutions in New Zealand, Germany, India, and theNetherlands.The in-depth discussion sessions on July 22 and 23 had about 50 participants, also from a rangeof DOE national laboratories, universities, and international institutions. Nine participantsattended from five minority serving institutions. Participants in these interactive sessions wereabout 30% women, and also included a large fraction of early-to-mid career researchers. A\"speed networking\" session provided a unique opportunity for informal conversation andbuilding community in the virtual meeting format. 8October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban InteractionsSection 2: Summary of Plenary Session In the keynote panel on July 21st, Dr. Karen Setohighlighted that urbanization is sufficientlywidespread and consequential that it can be considered a global change phenomenon. Dr. Setohighlighted that urbanization is central to many 21st century challenges, and because of its scopeshould be treated as an integral component of global change research. She emphasized thaturban systems are missing from global scale coupled climate models and that the expected rapidpace of urbanization in the remainder of the 21st century provides a very significant opportunityfor climate action. She highlighted five key knowledge gaps in our ability to measure andunderstand the role of urban spaces in the global climate system: particularly the importance ofcollecting and managing data measuring human activities and calling for the co-development ofcomputational methods to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data, with top-down andbottom-up approaches. Finally, Dr. Seto concluded with a 'call to arms' for communities likethis one to do the science that will contribute to knowledge and help policymakers understandwhat cities can do to mitigate and adapt to climate change.Dr. Lu\u00eds Bettencourt emphasized the role that cities play as concentrators of cross-sectordynamics, playing an outsize role in broader-scale changes. He argued that cities exist to solve aconnectivity problem; they function by facilitating multisectoral cost-benefit trade-offs; and theycreate change by creating and communicating new information through innovation, long termeconomic growth, and human development. Dr. Bettencourt highlighted the role of urbanscience as integrating scales and disciplines. Dr. Bettencourt highlighted existing DOE strengthsin computational modeling, especially that with an attention to optimization and resilience, andapplied to the infrastructural context. He wondered, though, if these methods are appropriate tothe goals for stable socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. He then proposed threeresearch gaps: flipping urban resilience research perspectives from a top-down view to a humancentric view, from detailed modeling to high-precision, real-time data, and from temporalaverages to high frequency, stochastic indicators. Each of these gaps requires integratingresearch gaps across population sizes, geographies, and time.Dr. Anu Ramaswami provided a vision for how to use multi-system system science to movetowards equitable, net-zero carbon cities. She showed ways in which urban decarbonization ispossible. Dr. Ramaswami demonstrated that knowledge co-production with cities is essential foridentifying key decision points towards a net-zero future, and has important local benefits. Shealso emphasized that attention to within city heterogeneity is critical for urban decarbonizationto be socially sustainable. She proposed a number of key knowledge gaps: transboundary andcross-sector linkages of both small and large-scale infrastructures, measuring equity acrossmultiple sectors and scales, the impact of land use decisions on greenery, the impact of greeneryon carbon sequestration, and the combined influence of urban form and greenery on buildingenergy use.Dr. Paul Waddell demonstrated mechanisms through which fine scale urban data, machinelearning, and cross-sectoral modeling can better inform urban planning and design. He9October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionshighlighted the significant advances in integrated Urban-Environmental modeling and planningthat have occurred over the last 20 years: moving from conceptual behavioral models throughurban microsimulation towards microdynamics, and the addition of uncertainty quantificationto urban models. He discussed the addition of machine learning techniques to complementexisting statistical models, and then discussed recent applications of dynamic microsimulationmodels for decision support in resilience planning in the context of climate change. Dr. Waddellconcluded by highlighting an open source, collaboratively developed urban data science toolkit(https://github.com/UDST).All four speakers highlighted the importance of multiscale perspectives in understanding citiesand the opportunities for research that have been enabled by the recent explosion of dataavailable about human behavior and social processes. 10October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban InteractionsSection 3: Environmental Hazards BreakoutEnvironmental hazards such as flooding, drought, wildfire, and extreme heat are a source ofdisturbance and stress on urban systems that range in magnitude from economically disruptiveinconveniences to dramatic cascading infrastructure failures with direct impacts on humanhealth and well-being. As climate change alters the characteristics and frequency of suchhazards, infrastructure systems and institutions that were built for another era must adapt inorder to maintain or enhance resilience to these stressors. To complicate things further, thebuilt environment itself can alter the characteristics of environmental extremes, for examplethrough the urban heat island effect or through changes in surface hydrological properties.Environmental extremes often do not impact just one sector, scale, or social group at a time. Forinstance, flooding can impact transportation, energy, and water infrastructure simultaneously.Extreme heat taxes the electricity grid, which has an exacerbating influence on health outcomesthrough the loss of air conditioning access. Moreover, environmental, infrastructural, and socialheterogeneity leads to differential vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities across urbanlandscapes. As a result, communities experience and respond to hazards in different ways,reflecting and frequently reinforcing existing inequities.Indeed what is understood to be a hazard is arguably as much a function of the sensitivity of oursocial and built systems to extreme conditions as the environmental conditions themselves. Andwhile some individual built assets may have clearly defined environmental thresholds thattrigger their failure, the conditions that lead to system-wide and cascading failures depend onthe overall system configuration including the role of redundancy, heterogeneity, and adaptivebehaviors.Examining how hazards propagate through urban systems is a useful way to understand coupledsystem behavior, including critical linkages across scales and sectors and the role of tippingpoints, feedbacks, and adaptive responses. The complexity of urban systems and theby-definition rarity and high impact of extreme events make the study of hazards challenging.Yet this complexity shapes both the risks and opportunities for resilience within urban systems,so it is critical to understand in order to both inform the options for future urban developmentand to understand urban evolution in a more fundamental sense.Participants in the environmental hazards breakout were tasked with taking a hazard-specificlens to examine the most pressing challenges faced by urban communities in maintainingresilience in the face of climate change. They were asked to examine:which sectors, systems, and groups of people are most vulnerable to these hazardshow these hazards play out through multi-sectoral systems,how the built environment interacts with the environmental processes that generate thehazard,the options available to adapt and create more resilience to these stressors and anytradeoffs these measures might have11October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsthe most pressing science gaps that must be filled to address the challenges identifiedabove and any promising directions for filling those gapsSeveral common themes emerged across the breakout groups including:What defines hazard risk is a function of social and infrastructural vulnerabilities inaddition to environmental characteristicsThere is a need to understand the changing risks faced by existing urban systems giventhe changing characteristics of environmental hazards and existing vulnerabilitiesThere is also a need to examine how risks would shift as a result of alternative futurepathways and their multi-objective implicationsPost-event decision making is important for understanding transformative dynamicsKnowledge and data are an important aspect of decision-making, and so observationalsystems and science are part of the dynamic system of adaptationWhile there is an opportunity for real-time data and modeling to inform adaptiveresponses, there can be a tension between developing tools for decision support vs.fundamental scientific understandingCo-production is a valuable process for ensuring relevance of science fordecision-making and so that key processes are incorporated into scientific scopeUnderstanding how case-specific insights scale across urban areas or across events is across-cutting challenge3a: Extreme HeatExtreme heat poses a major threat to human health as well as infrastructure systems such as theelectricity grid. It also contributes to other hazards such as poor air quality, wildfires andincrease in water temperature, posing additional threats. While these hazards make it crucial tounderstand the extent of the extreme events, there are various limitations associated with dataand modeling that restrict a comprehensive evaluation of extreme heat hazards at urban scale.For instance, the weather stations that monitor air temperature in a city are still sparse and donot provide an estimate of citywide temperatures. Satellite-based land surface temperature data,which is not the best indicator for heat stress, has been increasingly used to understand urbanheat intensity. Further, limited attention has been paid to humidity-driven exacerbation ofextreme heat impacts. Modeling studies typically make simplifying assumptions regarding therepresentation of surfaces and vegetation at urban scales, but it is difficult to determine howimportant these assumptions are for accurately representing key outcomes of interest given alack of data needed for model validation at fine scales. Furthermore, more research is needed toevaluate socioeconomic disparities and unequal exposure to heatwaves. However, the lack ofdata on air conditioning and indoor temperature present major gaps in evaluating thesedisparities. Overall, heat adaptation measures can play a key role in reducing extreme heatimpacts. There is a need for improvements in both infrastructure and governance to supportadaptation to extreme heat events.12October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactions3b: DroughtAccess to water is a critical element of human existence and drought (the lack of water access) isa direct threat to that existence. However, droughts in the current world are hard toconceptualize for the average individual because of the disconnect between where water isactually resourced (e.g., distant mountains or lakes or from deep underground) and how peopleexperience water (e.g., from the tap in their homes). This struggle to conceptualize drought isexacerbated by the physical scales involved. For example, a city that sources its water from theriver running through the city center can be impacted by natural or human controlled eventsmiles upstream. Even more dramatically, the existence of massive western water conveyanceprojects mean that many western residents' water availability is impacted by the climate athousand miles and two mountain ranges away. These massive pieces of infrastructure weredesigned ~150 years ago under a different climate and with different values in mind. They arenot equipped to respond to 21st century needs.The positive news is that there are varied and complex ways in which drought issues could beaddressed. However, these approaches require profound insight into the myriad of physical,social, and economic drivers of drought to be effectively implemented. Specifically, newregulatory and economic policies can facilitate changes in water resource management. Newtechnologies in treatment and reuse can increase water supplies. New environmental sciencecan help understand and predict changes in water availability, and new hard and softinfrastructure can be designed and built for better water management. These new approacheswill need to be supported by new science. Some water measurements are simple and have beendone for years. Others, like understanding municipal water loss, are highly complex. Similarly,understanding and predicting consumption patterns is a complex and likely data-drivenproblem where machine learning and AI could be impactful. Because of the clear complexity ofdrought and water resource management and allocation, solutions must come through aco-design and decision science approach.3c: FloodingFlooding poses a number of challenges for urban systems, particularly when compounded byadditional, related extremes like debris flows. It poses a major threat to infrastructure andpeople, challenges stormwater management systems, and at minimum levels it is an urbannuisance that degrades quality of life. Urban infrastructure is often long-lived and, in manycases, what exists today is not built for today's weather and climate extremes. During floodingevents, urban managers often face challenges keeping infrastructure functioning and may lackthe data necessary to make informed decisions on when to shut down systems to mitigate publicharm. Coordination across departments and sectors is another challenge. They may also facechallenges communicating flood-related risks to the public, particularly given the vulnerabilityof communications infrastructure to flooding and the events that cause flooding. Followingflooding events, there is often a lack of capacity to provide relief, and institutions and13October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsindividuals may face challenges making informed post-event adaptation decisions forthemselves.Natural and built engineering controls, as well as government actions surrounding land-use, arepromising strategies for urban flooding adaptation. Similarly, infrastructure improvements andnew infrastructure should be built to standards that account for potential future changes inurban flooding and equity in design. Moreover, land use practices can be adapted to allow forintermittent flooding in some areas, representing a shift away from the \"fail-safe\" paradigm thatinforms much of present-day infrastructure design(Kim et al. 2019). However, many gaps existthat inhibit science-informed adaptation and decision-making. Particularly, coordinated, hightemporal and spatial resolution datasets for meteorological variables like rainfall, runoff, andinfiltration do not always exist for the study and modeling of urban flooding, and criticalinformation on the infrastructure itself may be proprietary. Knowledge about existingconstraints on building/adapting and the costs/benefits of doing so is also needed. Additionally,the co-production of science is necessary but inhibited by gaps in incentives and the slow natureof co-production activities. Finally, challenges may exist in the scalability of research onflooding adaptation between different urban areas.3d: Wildfires and SmokeWildfires pose a direct threat to human and mental health through water pollution, airpollution, destruction or interruption of human infrastructure such as electrical grids, andintroduction of lived-trauma experiences before, during, and after the fire. Additionally,wildfires pose a major threat to ecosystems, impacting watersheds on a continuum fromgroundwater through the atmosphere and potentially leading to new ecological system states..Living with fire is the new normal in many urban systems, and to adapt, it is important todevelop strategies to reduce the risk of fire at the wildland urban interface (WUI), includingchanging building codes, implementing forest management practices, developing research thatutilizes direct observations on private and public property, and leverage knowledge frommillennia of indigenous practices including cultural burning.Many gaps exist related to observations. During fires, it is critical to have real time, spatiallycontinuous observations to map fire propagation and predict risk. Historical and recentenvironmental observations to use as baseline pre-fire datasets (soils, water quality, foreststructure, fuels) are almost non-existent, and to establish a wildfire research theme, investmentsare needed to gather spatially broad pre-fire datasets. Machine learning and modeling arepromising tools to approach the science gaps in addition to data collection. Modeling of firepropagation from wind, ignition sources, incorporating the WUI into fire models, and using therich, but localized dynamics of forest structure and fuels leads to three different classes ofmodeling: 1) real-time emergency response modeling, 2) modeling for scenario planning, riskmitigation, and adaptation under climate change, and 3) modeling for scientific discoveriesrelated to the important role of fire in landscapes. All modeling in this sense can be developed inthe traditional physically-based framework, or novel machine learning approaches. Multipletensions and value-differences exist between the idea of using models as research tools for14October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsscience, versus modeling for real-time decision support, protection, and emergencymanagement. While the public is asking for real-time tools to address the immediate emergencyrelated to evacuations and real-time updates on hazard progression, models are typicallydeveloped as research tools unfit for real-time, rapid-response use. Additionally, models haveincredible uncertainty because of the lack of data, thus any potential for real-timedecision-making will require spatially complete high-resolution Urban InteractionsSection 4: Social Scales BreakoutWe are accustomed to ideas of temporal and geographic scale. It is also sometimes useful toconsider 'social scales,' referring to the approximate number of people and complexity of theorganizational processes under observation. Different 'social scales' have unique dominantprocesses and characteristics, influence different aspects of an urban system, and are bestunderstood using different methodological strategies. Elinor Ostrom highlights the role thatinteracting social scales play in hierarchical decision-making processes in \"UnderstandingInstitutional Diversity\"(Ostrom 2005). At the individualscale, people generally make choicesthat take factors like the climate, local organizations' rules, state laws, and the builtinfrastructure as external constraints. At the next larger social scale, groups of people like firms,local governments, school boards, and community organizations make choices about the rules orlaws in their operating spaces, and make investments in infrastructure which take into accountthe local and regional climate and weather patterns and take higher order choices - likeapplicable state or federal laws and policies - as external constraints when making those localinvestments. Ostrom calls this the scale of collective choice. At this scale, there are substantialhierarchies within institutions - from groups to departments to schools in a university, and local,regional, and state governance processes. Finally, even higher order social processes are focusedon the rules under which collective choices are made - this 'constitutional choice' social scaleincludes things like the collective choice decision strategy: all the ways in which many opinionsare combined into an outcome.The science around people and human choices is most well-developed when looking atindividuals and households - Ostrom's individual choice scale. These can explore the behaviorof an individual in an exogenous social context, which may include things like transportationmode choice within an urban environment, energy use in buildings, or crop choices by farmersin a stationary climatic and economic context(Evansand Di Baldassarre, and Vico 2020). Anemerging science around individual behavior capitalizes on newly available mobility traces todefine regularities in travel distances or mobility patterns(Alessandretti, Aslak, Pappalardo et al. 2015).Interactions at the collective choice scale are both hard to model and important. We intuitivelyknow that social decision-making processes are highly non-linear. This makes prediction hard.But collective behavior is not random - there are underlying patterns. Historically, we haven'thad the data to even observe fundamental empirical regularities to be explained by theory. Thedata revolution that we're living through now may support a more empirical understanding ofsocial processes that are more complex than individuals in an exogenous context, and lessaggregated than averages at a national or citywide scale.At the scale of nations, 'constitutional choice' decision processes highlight the complexity ofmanaging coarse institutional decisions, and the effects this has on collective choices, andultimately individual outcomes. Some research at the urban and national scale explores the16October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionssystematic relationships between a broad set of socio-economic outcomes and infrastructurerequirements across cities within nations, dependent on urban population.In four breakout sessions, we explored:What are themost pressing science questionsneededto think about how yourfavorite urban system or climate hazard interacts with the decision processes occurringat the city and regional social scale?Whatdata, analytical strategies, theories, and modelsare needed to betterunderstand interactions between urban systems, regions, and the larger Earth system?In what ways would better understanding processes at the city scale support urbanresilience, especially consideringvulnerable andmarginalized communities?What role does social, environmental, and infrastructural heterogeneity within urbanareas play in shapingevolutionary dynamics (e.g.technology adoption), andwhat the implications of this heterogeneity foroutcomes related toenvironmental justice?Research about the basic properties of human systems covers many of the same topics asresearch which is designed to support decision-maker efforts to influence human systems.However, not all researchabouthumans isforhumans.This misconception may be partiallydriven by the reality that the distance between fundamental researchabouthumans and itsapplicabilityforour laws, technologies, and behavioris much smaller than it is for fundamentalresearch on other topics. Nonetheless, the distinction is important. In urban contexts, basicresearchabouthumans is badly needed to understandthe mechanisms through which differentsectors interact and co-evolve, particularly in the context of anticipated climate hazards.Human capacity to proactively respond to threats we anticipate is unique among the sectorswhich influence the Earth system. This means that careful characterization of ourthreat-anticipation behavior (across a full range of social scales) is necessary to understand thefunctioning and behavior of urban MultiSectoral Dynamics. At the same time, scientificinformation and data are among the factors that influence our threat-anticipation and riskmitigation behaviors, so there is a role for fundamental science to both support and understandthese processes.4a: Individuals and HouseholdsThe individual and household scale allows a bottom-up perspective beginning with the\"atomic\"unitsof climate hazard impacts (people), from whichone may consider cumulative impacts atsuccessively larger scales. Individual and household choices influence resource demands that inturn impact the functioning of infrastructure systems: electricity grids, water supply networks,transportation and communication networks can all be stressed by individuals' behavioraladaptations to climate-driven hazards.Underlying differences in adaptive capacity to hazards are cross-cutting questions about howpeople perceive risk and make choices (irrespective of the hazard or sector). For example, howdo short-term versus long-term perceptions of risk vary? How does the way individuals think17October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsabout pervasive forms of risk contrast with how they think about novel forms of risk? How doesthe experience of extreme events influence subsequent perceptions of risk and willingness toadopt new household measures or migrate? To what degree does information provided toindividuals and households from varying sources such as official communication, communityleaders, social media, and personal communication enable proactive vs. reactive measures?Many of these questions are rooted in spatial heterogeneity across demographics, socioeconomicstatus, and social contact networks. Spatial and social heterogeneity can both facilitate andinhibit early and full adoption of adaptive behaviors and technology. For example, householdtechnology choices can reveal trade-offs between mitigating risk and factors like the affordabilityof services, particularly in the context of energy poverty. Adoption of technologies andpreventative practices like migration away from a hazard may be influenced by ties with othersin one's immediate environment (family, neighbors).To better understand these issues and develop intervention strategies for mitigating hazardimpacts at the individual and household level, the climate research community could benefitfrom robust representations of social networks, more holistic data on household-level builtenvironment characteristics (i.e., land-use/land cover, elevation, age of structure, HVACtechnology, number of units, utility provision), survey-based measures of how perceptions anddecision-making process changes pre- to post- experience of extreme events (both lived andwitnessed remotely, e.g. through news outlets, social media), as well as how different physicalsettings and risk types (i.e., flood zones, wildland-urban interface) shape those perceptions.4b: Communities and NeighborhoodsCommunities are not merely collections of individuals. Social processes that occur at thecommunity scale can have significant influences on community resilience and preparedness inthe context of climate hazards and other adverse events. Schools, firms, and civic organizationsbuild infrastructure, make decisions, and set policies which influence local vulnerability,influence the choices that individuals make, and provide a meaningful backstop for disasterpreparedness. As highlighted in Bettencourt's keynote address, when formal infrastructuresystems fail, it is most typically individuals and community groups who temporarily serve asbackup infrastructure, seeking to minimize gaps in critical urban services.In seeking to minimize harms from climate change, community and neighborhood organizationswrestle with challenges around access to knowledge that can be applied to the local context, anddata at an appropriate scale. Community organizations do not always have the technicalcapacity, time, and expertise to infer how global or regional trends in some process mightinfluence their local context, nor access to the science professionals who could perform thattranslational research. There is dramatic within-city heterogeneity in educational attainmentand access, and so there is heterogeneity in local capacity to access and interpret scientificfindings. This can impede local efforts to understand and mitigate potential climateconsequences, particularly when they occur in the context of the many other stressorscommunities and neighborhoods also face.18October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban InteractionsThe substantial difficulties that community groups and organizations face in accessing scientificinformation which is accurate, relevant, and addresses their local context and particularcircumstances also impedes our broader understanding of the role that communities, groups,and neighborhoods play in shaping the overall anthropogenic response in the human-Earthsystem. The scale of collective response is partially dependent on the information that the groupaccesses. We lack a rich system of knowledge transfer between community-scale groups andEarth system researchers which could simultaneously improve local response capacity andincrease our ability to understand drivers and determinants of the human system responses.This would thus strengthen our skill in human-Earth system prediction.4c: Cities and RegionsThe city and regional scale is where collective decision-making starts to have large implicationsfor the social scales above and below, making urban and regional research heavily integratedwith the processes of individuals, communities, and nations. Research questions at this scalemust be contextualized by relationships and impacts to their sub-scales of communities andindividuals as well as national social and climate processes and policies. An importantconsideration for any urban and regional scale-specific science question is integrated modelingacross spatial scales. An example like Super Blocks (bigger than neighborhood, smaller thancity) help illustrate this challenge, as Super Blocks exist at community scales but createmeasurable changes in regional transportation patterns and impact policies around resourceallocation. Many other relevant ongoing scientific questions consider planned migration inresponse to climate change. This will create large changes in city/regional population, addingstress to infrastructure, altering resource demand, and changing mobility patterns. Animportant consideration in response to modeling efforts should consider the opportunity forimproving environmental justice outcomes. Lastly, many ongoing research agendas have a deepfocus on urban processes, but there is a gap in knowledge between the evolving dynamics ofurban and rural reliance. Scaling the knowledge transfer from one case study to other cities andregions is an underdeveloped research area and will be important.To develop strategies for reducing adverse climate impacts at city and regional scales, we need tobetter understandhowto use/interpret data/modelsfor policy purposes. This will likely bemore impactful than simply the creation and curation ofmore data. We needbetter evaluationsfor the fitness for purpose of models and understand what tools/models/data are appropriatefor different purposes as transdisciplinary gaps still exist. Barriers created by disciplinary silosmake informed decision-making extremely difficult. This leads to scenarios where cities andregions are forced to be reactive to hazards. How do we become proactive? Particularly withresource allocation between cities and to cities that are more vulnerable. How do these resourceneeds change over time particularly with environmental justice considerations?19October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactions4d: Nation to WorldSocial scales framing at national and global scales depends on the research objectives and topics,model, and data. Modeling the urban system and climate hazard interactions at national andglobal social scales is challenging due to the absence of urban representations in most Earthsystem models. Because of the complexity in multiscale modeling, it remains unsure of how tocapture the regional process for the global scale modeling. The inaccurate parameterization ofthe urban processes on a regional scale may even exacerbate the problem. On the other hand,uncertainties also come from the data, such as the global land use/land cover data. In additionto the sparsity of socioeconomic data for the global modeling, the social, environmental, andinfrastructural heterogeneity is usually not well represented in the global data, which furtherhinders the reliable assessment (e.g., environmental justice research). Recent efforts have beenput forth to develop high-resolution datasets (e.g., global urban footprint data) and unleash thepower of machine learning and remote sensing for data fusion and modeling. 20October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban InteractionsSection 5: Sectors and Systems BreakoutSectors are a useful frame through which to organize and understand the complexity of urbansystems. In the MSD context, sectors are made of infrastructure, social, and environmentalsystems that function together to provide a service. For instance, the water sector includes thesystems of conveyance and treatment infrastructure that move fresh water to and waste wateraway from users in addition to the source water supplies, water regulatory and managementinstitutions, technologies, and markets that influence the provision and use of water. Sectors actas behavioral aggregators through which many individual decisions combine to yield larger scaleimpacts. As an example, many individual water (or energy) choices impact regional resources(or the global atmosphere). Sectors also typically correspond with well-established regionalregulatory institutions such as water management agencies, departments of public health, publicutility commissions or land use authorities, so they are an important place to examine theoptions for system-wide adaptive responses and longer-term transformational change.Sectors do not operate in isolation. They are linked with one another through infrastructuresystem dependencies, environmental connections, and social dependencies. As highlighted inthe hazard breakout sessions, some of the most concerning impacts of environmental extremesare failures that cascade through multiple sectors. The water sector is a major user of energy;land use impacts water availability and quality; access to energy is critical for health in thecontext of extreme heat; and social inequality limits who can access the services within multiplesectors simultaneously, creating compounding risks and limiting both individual and collectiveadaptive capacity.In this breakout session, we took a sector-specific lens to examine the most pressing challengesfaced by urban communities in maintaining resilience in the face of climate change. For eachsector, participants were asked to examine:what are the key vulnerabilities faced by people and systems in this sectorhow do sectoral outcomes (e.g., provision of services, affordability, health outcomes)differ across communities and whywhat kinds of decisions or behaviors control the dynamics of the sector, and at whatsocial scale do those decisions and behaviors take placewhat are the key point of interaction across sectors and among human and naturalsystems within sectorsin addition to climate change, what other trends influence or create stress for this sector(e.g., decarbonization trends, population growth)what options are available to adapt and create more resilience within the sector and whattradeoffs might these measures have (e.g., financial or energy costs, land use constraints,barriers to full adoption, influences on other sectors)What are the most pressing science gaps that must be filled to inform the questionsabove and what are the promising strategies for addressing those gaps including21October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactions5a: EnergyThe energy sector is facing multifaceted challenges due to climate change, extreme weatherevents, and increasingly dynamic demands due to on-site renewable energy generation, chargingand discharging of electric and thermal energy storage including electric vehicles, as well asvariable supply from the power grid due to more intermittent renewable energy generation.Three overarching themes were identified and discussed at the breakout: 1) the challenge ofsimultaneously decarbonizing and adapting the energy sector to climate change, 2) energysecurity, and 3) energy burden and equity.The energy sector aims to fully decarbonize for 100% clean power, a strategy that is underpinnedby large-scale electrification of end-uses currently powered by gas and liquid fuels. However,electrifying the energy sector has important implications for the timing of peak demand. Forexample, widespread adoption of heat pump technology for space and water heating may lead toa winter peak electricity demand comparable to the current summer peak demand. Deepretrofitting of the existing building stock to increase efficiency and reduce energy demand canmitigate demand increases from electrification. Increased reliance on a single source of energy(i.e., electricity) potentially increases societal risk, especially during extreme weather events(e.g., heatwaves, cold snaps) that lead to power outages. Research on large-scale modeling andanalysis is needed to provide actionable and localized strategies and solutions to informstakeholders to plan and execute energy sector decarbonization in tandem with resilienceefforts.With energy supply and demand becoming more dynamic and hard to control, balancing bothsides is a growing challenge, especially during extreme weather events. Decentralizing powersupply may be one of the solutions, e.g., microgrid technology for a community to operate in anisland mode during grid power outage. Storage technology is essential to help balance demandand supply. Demand side management is another promising solution, which means designingand operating buildings and infrastructure to flexibly increase their energy use when the gridhas sufficient power and use less at other times.Communities with a high energy burden (defined as the percentage of household income spenton energy) often face multiple intersecting challenges that increase risks associated with loss ofenergy access and also prevent full adoption of clean energy technology necessary to supportdecarbonization. The building stock in such communities is often less energy efficient,contributing to higher energy costs and carbon emissions. Low-interest financing, incentivesand rebates, as well as low-cost technologies are needed for all communities to be part of theenergy transition.The energy sector interacts with the buildings, transportation, urban environment, andsocial-economic systems. In a warmer urban environment, buildings need more cooling, andthey emit more heat which can further warm the urban environment leading to more coolingdemand forming a closed loop. Modeling related sectors together can capture their interactionsand understand cascading effects. Large scale urban energy modeling supported with big data,22October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsmachine learning and high-performance computing will help researchers and stakeholdersidentify, evaluate, and prioritize strategies for the energy sector to achieve simultaneousdecarbonization and resilience goals.5b: WaterChallenges to the water sector fall into three broad (but interconnected) categories: climatechange, financial, and social. Challenges associated with climate change are further stratified byregion. The eastern parts of the United States (including the Gulf Coast) are increasinglyconfronted with too much water (as a result of more frequent/intense precipitation events). Thewestern parts of the United States are increasingly confronted with decreased availability andaccess to water, yet still must contend with increased intensity of wet extremes due to earlierspring snowmelt and enhanced magnitude of individual storms. Indeed, finding solutions tomanage wet extremes by capturing large volumes of water when they are available may be animportant aspect of managing dry extremes. Challenges associated with drought and increasedwater scarcity are exacerbated by social factors such as laws and institutions related to waterallocation and practices related to land use. The established rules and institutions for allocatingwater were established in a world with very different ecological and social contexts (i.e., a worldwhere water was more available and faced with less competing demands). However, these rulesand institutions appear to be misaligned with our current context (i.e., a world with a changingclimate, changing demands, and growing scarcity). Similarly, certain land use practices (e.g.,green lawns at every household; water-intensive agricultural activity in water-scarce locations)also appear to be misaligned with our current context. Finally, there are financial challengesassociated with the water sector. Generally speaking, water is not treated as a scarce good (i.e.,its price is often \"artificially\" low)Some of the pressing science gaps and associated opportunities for addressing the issues aboveinclude collecting more robust groundwater pumping data (to gain a better understanding of therate at which groundwater is being depleted) and modeling the reliability of nature-basedsolutions at large scales and under extreme conditions (to gain a better understanding ofwhether green infrastructure and nature-based solutions can actually be a one-for-onereplacement for traditional infrastructure). Some of the biggest gaps and opportunities in thewater sector are not purely scientific, but instead relate to our decisions and preferences abouthow water is used, and how much it should cost. This points to the value in co-producingscientific knowledge with decision-makers to ensure that those decisions are supported byscientific evidence and that the research community produces the evidence that is most needed.5c: HealthHealth is both a primary outcome of interest to society and an enabling condition for individualsto participate fully in the economic and social life of an urban community. Environmentalconditions such as air quality, and exposure to heat extremes have direct impacts on health.23October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban InteractionsSuch conditions are often correlated with sociodemographic factors, as well as builtenvironment characteristics across the heterogeneity of urban landscapes. In the context ofclimate change, these environmental health concerns may be exacerbated, certainly with respectto extreme heat.The health sector faces a unique data challenge that many other sectors discussed during thisworkshop do not: data access. This challenge does not imply a lack of data, per se, because thereis an abundance of health data. However, due to privacy concerns and other challenges, healthdata is often aggregated to a level that obscures the differential risks and outcomes acrossdifferent communities and makes it challenging to intersect that data with environmental andbuilt systems data at the native scale of their variability within urban areas. Therepresentativeness of health data is also a concern. Marginalized individuals who are missed indata collection efforts are often most at risk of numerous negative health outcomes. Citizenscience can help to bridge this gap, but such efforts are not systematic across the United Statesand world more different methodological strategies collectively contribute to advancingknowledge and informing future decisions in Environmental System Science. This cyclehighlights the role of observations, experiments, model development, and uncertainty analysis,all in a multiscale context, for continually refining our best understanding of environmentalsystems.In this workshop, we agreed that research which aims to understand and address fundamentaluncertainties about urban contexts needs to be grounded in human-scale and human-centricperspectives. This shift requires including additional epistemological strategies, both because ofthe different scale of potential uses, and because of the different levels of existing scientificconsensus in environmental system science as compared to the science of cities. Figure 2: 'Pasteur's Quadrant' model of scientific research objectives, reproduced from Stokes(1997). Science can be motivated primarily around seeking basic understanding of aphenomena, around meeting a goal or objective, or both. The DOE is a mission-orientedorganization, and so most DOE-funded research centers around its potential applications andimportance. Some of this research is fundamental: seeking a basic understanding ofimportant phenomena. Other aspects are directly applied: seeking to manage, control, orotherwise support the decision-making process.Figure 2 shows the 'quadrant' model of scientific research objectives(Stokes 1997). Theobjective of urban scientific research for environmental system science can include bothlearning how urban environments influence the larger scale Earth system, and the translation oflarger scale environmental system findings into human-centric and decision relevant scales.Translating environmental system findings into human-centric and decision relevant scales25 October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsallows and requires use of epistemological strategies which are not currently included in theModEx cycle. Communities, cities, and regions are the scale at which climate hazard impactsare felt, they are the scale at which decisions can be made, and there hasn't yet been enoughactionable science aiming to characterize the consequences of changing climate and climatehazards at these scales. Urban decision makers and stakeholders have the best availableunderstanding of how those climate risks and hazards impact cities across the range ofinteracting urban systems, sectors, and socio-economic groups. Using this knowledge to definecritical research questions will enable research to fill those scientific gaps at human-centricscales more easily. This is most efficiently done through knowledge co-production by includingurban stakeholders in the development of urban research questions and goals.Another epistemological shift from the ModEx cycle is related to the extraordinarily strongscientific consensus around the most significant parts of the physics and processes which aredriving climate change. The latest IPCC report makes the scope and breadth of this consensusvery clear(Masson-Delmotte et al. In Press). Researchat human and urban scales has nowherenear this level of scientific consensus.Human-centric research has long been hampered by a lack of sufficient human and behavioraldata at a scale large enough to observe generalizable patterns. For example, noted urbanist JaneJacobs (1992), generated a number of influential hypotheses about the processes whichwell-functioning urban environments must have. However, her work was entirely qualitativebecause at that time there was not sufficient data available to test or validate her corehypotheses. Quantitative testing of her hypotheses has taken decades, in part because of thesesubstantial data gaps. Now that the digital trace data explosion is providing large scaleobservational data on human-scale activities, interactions, and movement patterns, thequalitative hypotheses and theories resulting from decades of careful social science research canbe tested, validated, and eventually provide the foundation for empirical models andquantitative theories of urban systems and processes.From another perspective, Emanual (2020) writes about the risks of a research approach whichtoo-heavily weights simulation and computation in Earth System research. Emanual isconcerned that this context risks creating conditions where too little attention is given toprocess-based understanding and theoretical development, thus hindering our overall scientificprogress. In both cases, an epistemological approach is needed which balances observation,theory, modeling, and knowledge co-generation to advance basic understanding.In four breakout sessions, we explored strengths and weaknesses for epistemological strategiesacross the different urban hazards, sectors, and social scales, organized around identifyingresearch domains which have:sufficient data and synthesis strategies?theories which explain most of the observed phenomena?models which represent the system sufficiently well?26October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsan existing ecosystem of collaboration which can communicate decision-maker points ofuncertainty and leverage to modelers, and can communicate model content and findings todecision-makers?6a: Data and Machine-Learning ModelsGrowing availability of data and progress in data processing technologies create newopportunities for urban research and decision support. However, these advances also elucidateimportant remaining barriers, such as: imbalance in availability and quality of different datasetsthat become equally critical for complex questions (e.g., public versus environmental healthdatasets); constraints on granularity of accessible data (e.g., lack of household-level or utilitysystem data); limited consistency in data collection and quality controls, and similar. Given thebroader challenges and high costs of comprehensive and ubiquitous data collection, it may bemore practical to strategically focus on \"closures\" in complex research questions ordecision-making and key data required to achieve such closures. Similar considerations arisewith respect to urban environmental justice and hazard mitigation, where the decisions basedon the data often need to be made quickly. In this regard, it becomes especially critical tounderstand the pathways by which the data can lead to decisions swiftly and robustly, andstrategies to assess the efficacy of expenditures to tune future decision-making.Machine-learning models are increasingly seen as a powerful strategy both for arriving atcomplex decisions with the help of massive and heterogeneous datasets, and for predictiveforecasting in decision support for future urban scenarios. However, despite their expandinguse, machine-learning models are not yet widely regarded as trustworthy due to complex,\"black-boxy\" operation, potential sensitivity to sampling biases in data, and lack of rigorousparameterization and testing. The robustness of machine-learning models in urban applicationscan be enhanced by more ubiquitous adherence to best practices such as testing them as ahierarchy of models with increasing complexity that is analytically tractable; examining whetherthe same phenomena captured by different mixes of data can be robustly implemented by themodel, and combining machine-learning algorithms with hybrid or mechanistic models thatmore robustly account for realistic processes and causal relationships.6b: Theory and FrameworksThe development and application of quantitative theory about anthropogenic processessubstantially lags the development of theories for physics-based earth system processes. This isa major gap that impedes our ability to understand and predict outcomes in Earth systemprocesses that we care about. There are statistical models of aggregate patterns of humanbehavior, and tools like agent-based modeling are very useful for demonstrating a minimumrule set required to observe aggregate behavioral phenomena. This includes game theoreticresults such as the prisoners' dilemma and results on simple models of collective behavior suchas Schelling's rule. Any of these can be applied in aggregate, spatially or over a network. Thesekinds of tools have important applications in transportation modeling, crop choice, and other27October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsrepeated choices in a stable social and physical context. However, they are less applicable toreal-world changes as the physical, social, and ecological context changes because we lack robusttechniques for understanding howcollectivebehaviormay change in response to large changesin context.Understanding the aggregate signatures of behavior change that occurs in response to dramaticchanges in context (for example the COVID-19 pandemic) is critical to thinking throughpotential behavior patterns under a changed climate. However, these individual responses inchanging contexts are heavily dependent on higher order social choices - for example the extentto which threats are communicated to people, and the response strategy used by local and higherorder social organizations. Theoretical tools at the community, city and regional scale are morelimited, and while important models of global scale processes exist, such as GCAM(Calvin et al.2019), they are not designed to represent the kindsof widespread behavior changes that dooccur during extreme context changes - both short term and permanent. This leads to aparticularly significant gap in strategies for identifying statistical regularities in higher orderanthropogenic processes, like institutions and governance. Because of this gap on the 'human'side, Urban MSD research needs more investment in integrating theories across disciplines,urban sectors, systems and processes. These integrating theories could provide mechanisms forcharacterizing when and how systems influence each other, and when those influences arestrong enough to matter for a given outcome of interest. Addressing theory and modeluncertainty in the context of feedbacks across sectors, systems and scales is also important.6c: ModelingAccurate representation of urban areas and urban processes at microscale, regional, and globalscales and their feedback across scales, is required for understanding how humans affect and areaffected by climate change. Cities are responding to challenges related to migration,urbanization, inequity, and health, in addition to coping with extreme climate events withincreasing intensity and frequency. To address these challenges, cities must strategicallyincrease their adaptive capacity, and urban-resolving climate models are needed to facilitate thatadaptation and understand the role that cities play in local, regional, and global climate change(Sharma, Wuebbles, and Kotamarthi 2021).Agenciessuch as theWorld challengesnecessitate new typesof data, modeling, andservices such as dense observation networks, high-resolution forecasts, and multi-hazardwarning systems to build resilient and sustainable cities(Baklanov et al. 2018).To relate theseobservations and forecasts at city scale to their overall effect on global climate, processes thatare strongly non-linear and influenced greatly by urban phenomena must be identified andrepresented in global models in ways that preserve this non-linearity within their urban subgridparameterizations(Sharma, Wuebbles, and Kotamarthi2021).Ortman, Lobo, and urban areasas \"networks of social interactionembedded in physical space.\" Yet understanding the communication of these networks with thephysical space is partly where our modeling challenge lies. How economic activity, populationdynamics and growth, transportation, water treatment, energy, and other critical infrastructure28October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionsdrive and shape the physical space of an urban area still lacks cohesive theory. Furthermore,social, natura,l and structural aspects of urban areas are unique to each area and difficult togeneralize. Also, because characteristics of urban built forms play roles in weather and climatemodels as atmospheric boundary conditions and airflow pathways, and structures such as urbanwater distribution systems can contribute greatly to localized urban floods, but neither of thesecomponents are fully integrated into numerical weather simulations, modeling at the urbanscale must still be considered a nascent area of research. Even with the large manual andcomputation expense of representing these aspects uniquely to each city, mismatches amongthese urban assets can lead to difficulties in validating models and to ultimate model failure.Thus, integrated modeling at the urban scale is well poised for new research. If we can betterunderstand and represent fundamental atmospheric, environmental and human processes asinteracting systems, we increase our capacity to explore different urban land use trajectories orfuture climate scenarios and conditions and to integrate processes occurring at neighborhoodscale more reasonably with those at regional and global scale.6d: Knowledge Co-ProductionIn urban sustainability research, it is widely recognized that knowledge co-production is anextremely valuable strategy for ensuring that research investments produce knowledge thataddresses the problems they aim to solve(McPhearson,Iwaniec, and Bai 2016; et al.2018; Knowledge produced incollaboration with relevant stakeholdersis more tuned to the actual problems at hand and is consistent with the use-inspired science thatis central to the DOE mission. This knowledge is both designed around stakeholder needs andconcerns and is more readily accepted into practice both because it is more relevant and alsobecause there are already trusted emissaries between researchers, stakeholders, and the broadercommunity.However, a number of structural impediments in the research system make genuinecollaboration difficult. Centrally, academic investments typically have a very short investmentperiod relative to the timeline of the social processes that build trusting working relationships,most especially when stakeholders are volunteering their time, while the researchers are paid.When researcher-stakeholder relationships cross cultural, racial, and socio-economic lines,miscommunication is more likely, trust takes longer to build, and is easier to lose. People whosepersonal experience and history allows them to span those boundaries are particularly criticalfor ensuring success in knowledge co-production. Stakeholder burnout occurs whenengagement patterns don't meet their needs. However, these relationships must exist forknowledge co-production to become possible.Successful examples of urban researcher-stakeholder collaborations exist, for example throughtheDecision Center for a EcosystemStudy Long-Term Ecological The DecisionCenter for a Desert City is centered aroundurban water systems. UREx SRN and the SETS Convergence Network focus on integrating29October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionssocial, ecological, and technical systems to devise, analyze, and support urban infrastructuredecisions in the face of climatic uncertainty. The Baltimore Ecosystem Study investigates theecological, cultural, and economic forces that shape the Baltimore area.Research that aims to advance equity and environmental justice goals in urban contexts mustdevelop strategies to address these structural impediments to knowledge co-generation, so thatthe research community can benefit from local knowledge, understanding, perspectives onissues of critical local concern, and potential community-based areas are embedded within and co-evolve with larger environmental systems such as theatmosphere, ecosystems, and the hydrosphere. For any given field of environmental science, wecan ask two broad questions - how do the unique properties of urban areas alter keyenvironmental processes, and how do environmental processes in turn influence the evolutionof urban systems? For example, consider the field of hydrology. Impervious surfaces existoutside of cities, but their high prevalence in urban areas alters groundwater recharge andsurface runoff processes in important ways. There are also entirely new processes in urbanareas that must be considered to understand hydrologic phenomena, such as the existence ofdrainage infrastructure, and prevalence of highly managed and irrigated vegetation. On theother hand, hydrologic processes shape flood dynamics and water availability in ways thatconstrain or enable choices regarding what can be built and where, or what is a desirable andsafe place to live, work, and recreate. Environmental shocks can propagate through highlycoupled urban sectoral systems, such as when flooding leads to failure of energy ortransportation infrastructure. Likewise, uncertainty regarding future environmental conditionscan propagate through multiple systems to create uncertainty with respect to key outcomes suchas resource availability, infrastructure reliability, and health.The heterogeneity of urban areas poses several challenges for observing and modelingenvironmental processes, as does the presence of unique and highly coupled processes not foundoutside urban areas. Dense observations at the native scale of variability are valuable forground-truthing more coarse observational products, and the integration of multiple types ofobservation are often required to disentangle interacting processes and phenomena. From amodeling standpoint, it is important to investigate what degree of heterogeneity must berepresented to adequately understand and predict key outcomes of interest. Attention tofine-scale heterogeneity is particularly important for assessing factors related to environmentaljustice, where local-scale heterogeneity in exposure to environmental risks and hazards isregularly concentrated in socio-economic populations that are already most vulnerable alongother dimensions. Adequately characterizing highly variable human-influenced boundaryconditions (either observed or in the context of hypothetical future scenarios) can be a limitingfactor for models. Representing the unique processes that arise through interaction with builtand social systems within environmental system models can take place through the developmentand testing of new model codes or through coupling with existing models and data frominfrastructure system science and social science.7b: Infrastructure System ScienceInfrastructure systems are the most significant mechanism through which cities influence thebroader Earth system. The scale of human activity that our infrastructure systems enable31October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactionscreates the capability for very large scale carbon emissions. Transportation systems enable themovement of materials and resources from hinterlands into cities. Energy systems enable themovement of energy across long distances and into cities, providing the energy needed tosustain cities, while engineered water systems move water within and across hydrologic basins,meeting basic human water and sanitation needs. Telecommunication systems transmitinformation globally and enable ideas generated in cities to be used anywhere.Physical infrastructure systems are also a major mechanism through which the adverse effect ofclimate change will be experienced. They are designed to be long-lasting and extremely robustto a wide range of environmental and anthropogenic disturbances. However, theseinfrastructure systems typically cannot adapt to conditions outside their design parameters.This makes them vulnerable to failure when the environmental and human activity contextchanges. Because urban infrastructure systems are so closely coupled, infrastructure failures inone sector or location can have cascading and sometimes catastrophic consequences. Thispoints to a need for scientific insight into the vulnerability of existing built infrastructuresystems and their coupled behavior, as well as insight into the performance of hypotheticalfuture infrastructure systems and how they might perform in the context of futureenvironmental and social conditions.The increasing availability of real-time observations that include environmental conditions,infrastructure status, and behavioral responses is of great value for managing infrastructuresystems flexibly within the context of ongoing environmental extremes, and can also beleveraged to gain fundamental insight into the coupled behavior of these systems across a rangeof conditions. However, many anticipated extreme events of the future are out of sample in thehistorical record. This is due in part to the definition of extreme events as rare and therefore notfrequently observed, and in part to the non-stationary distribution of possible events due tochanges in the climate, socio-economic processes, and technology. Complementing data richmethods such as machine learning with physics-based and process-rich models is a promisingavenue for exploring a range of plausible hypothetical futures and gaining insight into themulti-objective outcomes associated with alternative infrastructure development pathways.7c: Social ScienceBy a substantial margin, the biggest sources of uncertainty in Earth system outcomes are due toanthropogenic processes. The largest uncertainty in the global future climate is anthropogeniccarbon emissions: as in Figure 3 below, uncertainty across climate scenarios is far larger thanuncertainty within any given scenario. This feature is repeated across geographic scales andenvironmental contexts: the biggest sources of uncertainty in urban water cycles are humandecisions about land use and land cover change; for coastal wetland loss it is \"will humansprotect wetlands, or not?\"; and for algal blooms it is the decisions farmers make about fertilizeruse. Lack of attention to the anthropogenic processes driving these outcomes impedes ourability to understand the coupled and co-evolving aspects of the human-Earth system, as well asour ability to reduce overall scientific uncertainty in the future climate.32October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral Urban Interactions Figure 3. Reproduced from IPCC 6th Assessment Report, Summary for Policy Makers, FigureSPM.8a.(Masson-Delmotte et al. In Press)Some of the most significant outstanding climate research questions are about its impacts:when, where, and by how much can we expect climate hazards and climate change to impacthuman activities, and the extent to which these hazards differentially impact marginalized andvulnerable communities. A critical aspect of understanding expected climate impacts isunderstanding how individuals and organizations might respond to climate hazards and theanticipation of those hazards. These responses depend heavily on the level of heterogeneity inaccess, resources, and exposure that different groups within a city experience. Cities andregions are a primary scale at which climate impacts are felt and at which decisions can bemade. Yet, there hasn't yet been enough actionable science aiming to understand theconsequences of changing climate and climate hazards at these scales. 33 October 2021Workshop Report: Multi-Sectoral 402-7. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2909-1.Aziz, H.
