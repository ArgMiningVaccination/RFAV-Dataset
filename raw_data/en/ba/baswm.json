These public health epidemics and pandemics are related, at least in part, to behavior and lifestyle. Emerging scientific evidence suggests that the integration of conventional medicine with traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine (TCAM) may be useful for the prevention and treatment of chronic and infectious diseases related to behavior and lifestyle. The aim of this issue is to explore the scientific evidence for these approaches of evidence-based integrative health, which hold promise for the future of medicine. Traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine (TCAM) is a group of diverse medical and health care approaches that are not presently considered part of conventional, modern medicine. TCAM includes a range of systems and modalities, such as Ayurveda, Yoga, traditional Chinese medicine, other traditional systems of medicine, meditation, herbal medicines and nutritional supplements, movement therapies, and other mind-body practices. There has been a surge in the public interest and the use of TCAM globally. Nearly 50% of the population in developed nations (United States, 42%; Australia, 48%; France, 49%; Canada, 70%), and similar or greater numbers in developing countries (India, 70%; China, 40%; Chile, 71%; Colombia, 40%; up to 80% in Africa) use some form of TCAM. The World Health Organization and governments of several countries have established agencies to support research and practical utilization of TCAM and integrative health care, also called TCIM (for traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine). At present, the growing use of integrative health and medicine has stimulated the scientific community to investigate the clinical utility, mechanisms, cost effectiveness and policy implications of these therapies. However, with notable exceptions, much of the research effort has been on quality, safety, and efficacy of TCAM products. This could be due to the potential for exploitation in drug discovery and commercial development. For other TCAM approaches, there is often a dearth of scientific studies or the research that has been conducted is of questionable quality and may lack modern scientific methodology. For ensuring the safe and effective practice of integrative care, there is a critical need to collect more evidence through well-designed scientific studies, to evaluate the available evidence, and to disseminate information\u2014so that policy recommendations for safe and effective use in clinical practice and reimbursement may be made. Besides the focus on efficacy, mechanisms, safety, clinical and cost effectiveness of integrative medicine, there is a need to educate modern health care practitioners, educators, researchers, policy makers and students on the basic science and theoretical models of TCAM that form the foundation of the practice of integrative medicine. The goal of this issue of Medicina is to address these gaps in collective understanding and to promote the integration of TCAM into contemporary medicine and public health. This collection of articles will stimulate further research and support healthcare professionals, consumers, and policy makers to make informed decisions about the utilization of evidence-based integrative medicine for the future of healthcare.
