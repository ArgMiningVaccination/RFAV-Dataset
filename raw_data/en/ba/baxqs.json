Although the primary purpose of this study was to refine a questionnaire on complementary and alternative therapy use by older adults, the findings of this pilot study identified knowledge and use of complementary and alternative therapies in a convenience sample of 60 older adults, 54 to 92 years of age from three ethnically diverse senior centers. Eighty percent of the participants used two or more therapies. There were no significant differences in therapy use by ethnicity. The most commonly used therapies were prayer, vitamins, diet, massage, and meditation. The participants rated the effectiveness of therapies higher than their knowledge of the therapies. Older adults need accurate information from health care providers to make safe decisions regarding the combination of complementary therapies and prescribed treatments to reduce the risk of interaction. Although health care literature reflects increasing interest in the use of complementary and alternative therapies,[ [1-6](javascript:void(0);)] few national or large-scale studies address such use by ethnically diverse older adults. The primary purpose of this pilot study was to acquire feedback from the ethnically diverse participants regarding the clarity and ease of use of the survey tool. The secondary purpose of this study was to assess, at the local level, older adults' self-rated knowledge level, perception of effectiveness, use for self, and source of information for common complementary and alternative therapies (CATs) and the use of prescription and nonprescription vitamins and supplements. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine[ [7](javascript:void(0);)] has described complementary therapies as all health systems and modalities that are not part of allopathic or traditional medicine in society. This includes all such practices that are self-defined by users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health. In 2002, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Section staff of the National Library of Medicine classified alternative medicine under the term complementary therapies and defined it as therapeutic practices that are not currently considered a fundamental element of conventional medical practice. Therapies are called complementary when they are used in addition to conventional medical practice and alternative when they are used in place of conventional medical practice.[ [8](javascript:void(0);)] Complementary therapies, according to Norton,[ [9](javascript:void(0);)] have the capability to enhance current nursing and medical practice. Examples of complementary therapies include such interventions as massage, dietary modifications, biofeedback, and guided imagery. Complementary therapies do not exempt physicians and nurses from treatment plans. The therapies are supplements to traditionally sanctioned medical treatments. Another definition of CAT is a wide sphere of healing resources that encompass all health systems, modalities, practices, and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those fundamental to the dominant health system of a specific society or culture in a given historical period.[ [10](javascript:void(0);)] Alternative therapies such as homeopathy and diet fads are offered as replacements for traditional Western medicine. For the purposes of this study, the term CATs is used to encompass complementary and alternative therapies. Geriatr Nurs. 2004;25(1) \u00a9 2004 Mosby, Inc.
