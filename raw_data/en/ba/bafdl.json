Hopman uses narrative to draw us into her world and introduce us to the plants she knows so well. It was the spirit of St. Francis who led her to her calling. In a small church which he helped to build, she heard a voice telling her to work with plants. She heeded the calling, setting out on a journey guided only by the plants themselves. Now she is introducing readers to the properties and uses of her special plant allies. My favorite section is the one on the \"doctrine of signatures\" which uses plant/leaf formation, habitat preferences, smell, color, and taste to determine the special properties of the plant. Part Four of the book takes a scientific turn. It begins with a concise treatise on formula making, followed by an extensive chart of the prescriptive qualities of plants, a glossary of contraindications for herbal remedies, and a resource list. Don't let customers miss the section on natural bug repellents, and be sure to let them know that the book is also laced with data on the multi-cultural, magical properties of plants.\" \u2014 Retailing Insight, Anna Jedrziewski, April 2016 \"Weaving together ancient wisdom, mystical folklore and modern plant research, this book explores the many uses of flowers, trees, common weeds and ornamental plants for food, medicine, spiritual growth and magical rituals.
