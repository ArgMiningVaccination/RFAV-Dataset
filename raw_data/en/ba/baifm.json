Each country fights the pandemic the way it can, involv - ing medical professionals. Yet, too often most countries in the world take political decisions without a direct correlation with medical and epidemiological experience, research and knowledge. Globally, we have succeeded poorly with vaccination. Country per - formance is very different for different countries, but unless vaccina - tion is global and the approach is proactive, the Covid-19 pandemic will continue. Such circumstances have formed the background also for the activi - ties and performance of the World Medical Association during the last two years. In reality, we have not met one another in person, but remote communication and distance meetings are not effective. Moreover, at remote meetings the corporate spirit and global view of development and challenges are declining. The WMA has worked hard and seriously and has been very active to promote limiting the pandemic, safety of medical workers and fight attacks against medi - cal professionals. However, information exchange is slower than we were accustomed to. Local problems, local lockouts, restrictions on medical activities, local discussions seem to be more important to many national medi - cal organizations. To be honest, I can say that in these two years I have lost the sense of identity and direction of the World Medical Journal (WMJ). The world's medical information room is inundated with a huge amount of information in a wide variety of electronic formats. Completely new methods for disseminating hybrid medical information have emerged. It seems that printed publications have lost their positions forever. I get the impression that the WMJ is issued in its classical form mainly due to customs and traditions. Therefore I address my readers in the national medical associations of the world. What are your ideas about the further development of the Journal? I truly believe that it is the time to change the editor- in-chief and my functions should be passed on to a younger, more modern and more energetic medical doctor with better knowledge of languages and information technology, with a wide circle of ac - quaintances among the world's younger physicians. I will be very happy to transfer my experience to a new colleague, just as I received a lot of good advice and knowledge from my predecessor Dr. Alan J. Rowe. I would like the Journal to be global, be more philosophical and unit - ing the interests of all doctors in the world. I would like Covid-19 to give us more knowledge, not only about masks, vaccinations and hospital treatments, but also about prevention, outpatient assis - tance, medical organisation, rehabilitation and even palliative care. But above all, let us face the future pandemics with confidence and readiness to act swiftly and accurately at any place in this world. Dr. med. h. c. Peteris Apinis, Editor-in-Chief of the World Medical Journal BACK TO CONTENTS2 Person-centered Medicine C. Robert Cloninger James Appleyard Juan E. Mezzich Ihsan SalloumHealth is a Creative Adaptive Process: Implications for Improving Health Care and Reducing Burn-out Around the World Jon Snaedal Abstract World medicine is currently suffering from multiple crises that can only be remedied by fundamental changes in health care pri - orities. Both genomic and biopsychosocial research on the basis of human health and well-being show that health and well-being depend on creative adaptive processes and that most common diseases are complex consequences of unhealthy lifestyles and inequitable socioeconomic conditions, not discrete diseases with specific causes. Evi - dence-based medicine works best for the acute treatment of injuries and rare homo - geneous disorders with specific causes, but its benefits are weak and inconsistent for common conditions that are heterogeneous and involve complex adaptive biopsycho - social processes. Treatment guided primar - ily by symptom-based diagnosis provides little insight into the actual biopsychoso - cial causes of the person's symptoms and is severely limited in its ability to promote healthy longevity in individuals or to reduce disease burden in populations. Health care that does not effectively and equitably pro - mote the well-being of individual persons and their communities violates a physician's innate sense of vocation and duty, so it leads to burnout among professionals provid - ing health care, as well as dissatisfaction and distrust by its recipients. World health needs and the professional duties of physi - cians can only be effectively and efficiently addressed by person-centred approaches to clinical care and by people-centred ap - proaches to health promotion and disease prevention as the major priorities in health care. Introduction Much of contemporary disease care is built on a paradigm that assumes people are separate from the rest of nature and un - der attack from pathogens or traumas that are specific causes of discrete diseases. It originated from scientific efforts to iden - tify separate diseases with a distinctive set of symptoms, discrete clinical boundaries from other diseases, a predictable natural course and outcome, and a specific caus - al abnormality [1-4]. Put another way, the goal of the discrete disease paradigm has been to \"carve nature at its joints\" by separating disorders from one another and from healthy functioning by specifying discrete natural boundaries [4, 5]. Natural boundaries require identifying evidence of zones of a rarity in symptoms that are supposed to distinguish each disease from similar conditions, using techniques like discriminant, admixture, and cluster analy - ses [4, 6, 7]. Are diseases really discrete? The discrete disease paradigm may seem reasonable and laudable to those of us who have been professionally educated and trained in this perspective for many years. In fact, it is difficult for most physicians to question the validity and effectiveness of the system of categorical classification of diseases because diagnoses do have practi - cal utility to provide substantial, but only approximate, information about aetiology, treatment, and health outcomes. Disease classifications can provide a simplified ac - count of ideal prototypes that allow phy - sicians to organize their work, simplify communication, and conduct large-scale statistical investigations, even though there are no real discrete boundaries to separate most diseases [5]. For example, there are obviously clinical differences among patients with cardiovascular dis - orders, diabetes mellitus, obstructive lung disease, cancer, dementia, and depression, but often there are shared etiological influ - ences and clinical overlap because all body components interact in the maintenance of health. Furthermore, as people age, they BACK TO CONTENTS3 Person-centered Medicine frequently have combinations of disorders, making distinctions difficult. The idea that diseases are discrete is more difficult to question for physicians who work in sec - ondary and tertiary care settings that are structured around diseases or organ sys - tems than for generalist physicians who provide a holistic person-centred approach to the patient's presenting symptoms, pref - erences, and priorities in their health care, rather than viewing them as a case with a specific condition [8]. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that most medical or psychiatric disorders re - ally have discrete natural boundaries, except for some rare conditions [4, 5]. Even when relatively distinct disorders are found by advanced statistical methods, they are only partially distinguished from one another and from normality because they are not fully dissociable from the complex func - tional systems necessary for the life of the person, who is, in turn, an inseparable aspect of the ecological web of all living things. As a result, despite sequencing the entire hu - man genome between 1990 and 2003, the causes of the common medical disorders are still not precisely specified because they have proven to be dysfunctions in complex biopsychosocial systems. Consequently, the search for precise causes of complex pro - cesses and the practical utility of approxi - mate disease categories for classification has distracted medicine from asking the larger questions of \"What is health?\" and \"What is disease?\". What is health? It is the larger questions about the funda - mental nature of health and disease that we must understand in order to prioritize rationally how we can really improve peo - ple's well-being and reduce the burden of disease in the world. Our current system of classification of diseases is actually rooted in outdated scientific constructs prevalent prior to the modern understanding of com -plex adaptive systems [9, 10], the quantum revolution in physics and biology [11, 12], and the recognition that symbiosis and co - operation are more fundamental to all liv - ing systems than competition and conflict [13, 14]. Rigorous modern scientific research shows that the well-being of all organisms in the web of life depends on complex biopsycho - social processes that are interdependent, adaptive, and creative, enabling dynamic changes that both shape and respond to changing internal and external conditions [13, 15, 16]. Because of the interdepen - dent functioning of the components of liv - ing systems, they function in ways that are qualitatively distinct from machines com - prised of independent and separable parts. Rather than being separate from nature and under attack from others, human beings even have the potential capacity to be aware of their being inseparably interdependent with other life forms and more-or-less able to regulate and integrate their own hab - its, goals, and values to live in harmonious ways that are healthy, satisfying and good for themselves and others [16, 17]. We are less healthy and happy when we revert to an outlook of separation in which fear, immod - erate self-interest, and vanity or self-doubt bias our perceptions and impair our aware - ness of our connections with other people and the mysterious glory of the universe as a whole [12, 17]. When are discrete diagnoses useful? Nevertheless, categorical diagnoses may also be adequate approximations for moni - toring the prevalence of clinical syndromes at different times and locations in epide - miology when it is not necessary to know the precise cause or causes of the syn - dromes [5]. Diagnoses of discrete diseases are sometimes adequate approximations to treat clinical signs and symptoms acute - ly, just as there are conditions in physics under which Newtonian mechanics is an adequate approximation to quantum me - chanics when engineers build a bridge [18]. Likewise, the Western paradigm of discrete diseases can be usefully applied by medical specialists to disorders with a specific and consistent cause, such as acute infections by specific bacteria, acute physi - cal injuries, or other disorders with a single specific abnormality (e.g., genetic, meta - bolic). Sometimes it is adequate in prelimi - nary discussions to use broad categories of diagnoses to distinguish disorders with few overlapping features, such as those treated by different medical specialities, but then assessment and treatment for even the acute condition are still likely to benefit from an expert understanding of the com - plex alternative pathways to similar clinical syndromes. Physicians have been criticized because they do not have solid evidence from randomized controlled trials or ad - here to recommended guidelines for most of what they do [19], but the reality is that greater information has not accumulated or been used because the definitive diagnoses imagined by the discrete disease paradigm itself are unrealistic most of the time and evidence-based guidelines are often not informative for the complex comorbidity of any particular patient [20-22]. Diag - noses are rarely discrete and homogeneous because their cross-sectional features and health outcomes are strongly influenced in complex ways by demographic charac - teristics, behavioural lifestyles and socio- cultural conditions [23]. In the rare cases in which diagnostic dis - creteness and causal specificity can be documented, the effective acute treatments (e.g., drugs or procedures) depend almost entirely on the specific and discrete diag - nosis, not on the person or their psychoso - cial, economic, or ecological circumstances. Then evidence-based treatment targets the single specific pathogen or tries to correct the defect or injury by specific drugs and/or procedures. Under these highly restrictive conditions, randomized controlled trials can identify differences in health outcomes BACK TO CONTENTS4 between actively treated cases and controls, which may then provide a consistent guide to effective treatment of individual patients, as is advocated in algorithms for evidence- based medicine. When are discrete diagnoses not useful? However, the discrete diseases paradigm with an emphasis on treatment by medi - cal specialists has limitations as a compre - hensive clinical approach because the most prevalent medical disorders have fuzzy clinical features that frequently overlap with one another across multiple specialities, have variable natural course and outcome, and causes that are heterogeneous with complex contributions from multiple bio - logical, psychological, social, environmental, and spiritual influences [6, 7, 23-25]. Gen - eralizations from outcomes of randomized controlled trials are also frequently flawed because of restrictive inclusion and exclu - sion criteria to produce a more homoge - neous population in the trial, which is not at all representative of the heterogeneous population of the disorder that physicians treat in clinical practice. For example, age and comorbid conditions are very common exclusion criteria, and results from clini - cal trials that restrict the upper age of par - ticipants are frequently extrapolated to the general older population that they do not represent well, leading to either under-or over-treatment [26]. The discrete disease paradigm also has severe limitations from a public health perspective because there are often, if not always, differences between individual persons in their susceptibility, response to treatment, and long-term outcome, as is well known even for infectious dis - eases [27], including infections of SARS- CoV-2 for which the socioeconomic de - terminants are indistinguishable from average all-sources mortality in the gen - eral population [28]. The discrete disease paradigm has also proven to be generally inadequate when extended to conditions in which there are multiple heterogeneous causal factors and biopsychosocial influ - ences on vulnerability and resilience; it is inadequate for such complex disorders be - cause so-called evidence-based treatments, which are based on the standard of aver - age differences between groups, yield weak and inconsistent benefits that are similar for diverse evidence-based or alternative treatments [29]. Put another way, reliance on the discrete disease paradigm is inad - equate for most common diseases because it fails to provide reliable guidance on how to treat any particular individual. The adaptive nature of the processes under - lying common and complex diseases also frequently leads to an inefficient and self- defeating treatment process when clinical symptoms and syndromes are the targets of treatment rather than the actual complex biopsychosocial process in the whole per - son. Over their long evolutionary history, human beings have acquired multiple reg - ulatory feedback processes for maintaining homeostasis and allostasis. Homeostasis involves maintaining body systems (such as blood pH and body temperature) within a narrow physiological range, whereas al - lostasis involves maintaining stable func - tional capacity despite changing situations, such as challenges from of stressors, trau - ma, pathogens, and circadian or seasonal environmental changes, which is a natu - ral and unavoidable aspect of adaptation to life [30]. For example, blood pressure is regulated by multiple interactive bodily systems, such as the kidneys, the heart, and the blood vasculature. In response to pain or stressful personal and social situations, blood pressure can increase to dangerous levels. Diuretics may reduce blood pressure initially even if the stressful psychosocial conditions are not corrected, but then the body continues to adapt to the stressful conditions by increasing blood pressure. Other drugs, such as calcium channel blockers, may then be added with tran -sient success, but the body will continue to adapt by increasing blood pressure in other ways unless the actual cause is corrected. The addition of beta-blockers may reduce blood pressure by reducing the pulse rate but also increase insulin resistance and lead to type-2 diabetes. The result of treating the symptoms rather than the causes of an adaptive process is polypharmacy, adverse drug effects, and other iatrogenic diseases with only a pre - carious regulation of symptoms because the actual psychosocial cause of the dys - function has not been recognized or treated. When one adaptive abnormality is treated, the treatment is likely to induce abnormalities in other systems, generat - ing adverse effects or interfering with the adaptation to comorbidity. The same pro - cess of trial, initial partial success and then weak benefits and adverse effects or failure occurs with the most common complex disease regardless of the medical special - ity to which the disorder is assigned in our classification of diseases. When this \"evidence-based\" approach is applied to common complex diseases or multimorbid conditions, the results produce inadequate benefits with no cure, so that people accu - mulate multiple chronic diseases [8]. This unfortunate result of long-term treatment of multiple chronic diseases without a cure is profitable for medical-industrial disease alliances, but not for the well-being of in - dividual persons or communities, or for the fulfilment of noble aspirations and duties of health care professionals to serve the well-being of others. What are the major challenges facing medicine as a result of current practices? Consequently, a holistic biopsychosocial approach is essential for effective and ef - ficient health promotion, disease preven - tion, and treatment of complex disorders that are strongly influenced by the unique Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS5 characteristics of a person, including their personality, lifestyle, and socioeconomic and environmental conditions [31-35]. Strong evidence that the paradigm for dis - crete diseases with specific causes is inap - propriate and has become unsustainable as a general comprehensive model of health care has become undeniable because of (i) the weak and inconsistent results and frequent adverse effects obtained from depersonal - ized evidence-based treatment for suppos - edly discrete diseases [33], (ii) the increas - ing global burden of disease from the high prevalence of people with multiple chronic diseases [8], (iii) the high prevalence of burn-out (40 to 60%) in health care profes - sionals from dehumanized and monetized health care environments [36, 37], (iv) the chronic underfunding of health promotion and disease prevention that is motivated by short-term special interests and falsely jus - tified by policies that assume the adequacy and sustainability of specialized and costly clinical care for discrete diseases as a com - prehensive system of health care [38], and (v) the growing pattern of dissatisfaction with disease care along with preference for self-care and holistic alternative medicine, which many, if not most, people find to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientation to healthy living [39]. To identify a constructive path to restore medicine to its effective and respected role in society, we will first consider a more sci - entifically grounded paradigm of health as a complex biopsychosocial process that is creative and adaptive based on rigorous ge - netic and biopsychosocial research. Second, we will then consider in more detail the inadequacies of the discrete disease model to which most physicians have become ac - customed without questioning its assump - tions and adverse consequences. Third, we will consider the fundamental shift in perspective underlying integrative medical approaches to person-centred care of indi - viduals and people-centred care of popu - lations. Finally, we make a call for action on initiatives that can efficiently enhance the health and well-being of both provid - ers and recipients of health care around the world. Research on health as a creative adaptive process Human beings are innately resilient We need to understand the complex pro - cesses that promote and maintain human health to make health care systems around the world more effective, efficient, and eq - uitable. To begin that process of under - standing it is useful to recall that modern Homo sapiens prospered as a species for over 100,000 years prior to the advances in med - icine that were introduced about 250 years ago in fields such as pathology, obstetrics, and vaccination. Increased human longevity in the industrial era is largely the result of reduced infant and maternal mortality due to improvements in many factors besides medical care, including nutrition, personal hygiene, environmental control, and socio - economic conditions [35, 40]. Prolonged healthy longevity after repro - ductive age has been a human character - istic since antiquity prior to the advent of modern medicine due to innate molecular mechanisms for adaptation to stress, inju - ries, pathogens, and degenerative processes under conditions that we now can specify from research on the science of well-being [41]. Throughout the ages, people who in - tentionally cultivated well-being (i.e., a healthy, happy, and good life) have been able to enjoy healthy longevity accompanied by prosocial behaviour and life satisfac - tion even without the advances of modern medicine [12, 17, 42, 43]. These facts may be startling until it is recalled that, even with all the amazing technological advances in disease care available today, the quality of clinical care only accounts for 16% of health outcomes compared to 84% from socioeco -nomic (47%), behavioural lifestyle (34%), and environmental conditions (3%) [44]. It has always been the lifestyle, socio - economic conditions, and an individual's personality and associated outlook on life (viz. separateness versus unity, self-interest versus self-transcendence) that contribute most to the health of individuals and their communities [16, 17]. Human beings co - evolved with other components of the web of life so that we have remarkable innate resilience to disease and injury when we are living in ways that naturally promote the health of ourselves, others, and our environ - ment [45]. What are the conditions for healthy living? As described by Hippocrates and Plato nearly 2500 years ago, healthy life is gen - erally characterized by prudent use of hu - man insight and judgment to regulate our lifestyle and habits in ways that are good for others as well as for ourselves [46-48]. Put another way, when people cultivate the character strengths of being self-directed, cooperative, and self-transcendent, they have the insight and self-control to regulate their habits to live in accordance with the goals and values that promote the physi - cal, mental, and social aspects of health in themselves and their community. They embody and enact virtues including mod - eration, perseverance, and social justice that correspond well to findings in modern re - search on the social determinants of health [49, 50]. Most reasonable people in diverse cultures and environments know that they would do well in life to eat nutritious food moderately, exercise regularly, treat oth - ers respectfully, act responsibly, and aspire to understand our role in the mysterious wonders of the universe in which we find ourselves [43, 47, 51]. There have always been some remarkable individuals who lived such a good life [12], but at dysfunc - tional times, like today, there are many who do not. Instead, many acts viciously out of Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS6 fear, greed, and arrogance, so that their life is unhappy, brutal, and short. Consequently, many medical sages since the time of Hip - pocrates have advised their colleagues that \"It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has [52].\" The challenge for the modern science of health and well-being has been to be able to measure and understand the philosophi - cal descriptions of healthy life in ways that are valid and objective. Over the past few decades, Cloninger and his colleagues have developed a comprehensive inventory of human personality that measures the bio - psychosocial learning abilities that allow a person to shape and adapt to ever-changing internal and external conditions that are essential for human health and well-being [53]. Using the Temperament and Char - acter Inventory (TCI), human personality is based on three genetic-environmental networks for learning and memory that are fundamental to human health: associative conditioning, intentionality, and self-aware - ness [17]. Three systems for learning regulate human personality and health Human temperament is based on associa - tive conditioning processes that regulate synaptic plasticity by activating the two major cellular mechanisms for responding to extracellular stimuli that we share with all animals (i.e., the Ras-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascades) [45, 54]. Differences between individuals in their irrational emotional drives (i.e., tempera - ment) can be measured in terms of differ - ences in four dimensions including willing - ness to take risks or to avoid them (\"Harm Avoidance\"), curiosity and approach to what is novel (\"Novelty Seeking\"), desire for social recognition and social attach - ments (\"Reward Dependence\"), and perse - verance despite inconsistent success (\"Per - sistence\").In addition, early humans evolved the abil - ity to regulate their temperament inten - tionally a little less than 2 million years ago, as shown by Homo ergaster (\"working man\") developing the capacity for being self-directed and cooperative for mutual benefit in social groups using brain systems involving the cellular Calcium-Second Messenger signalling system in the brain network for executive self-control [16, 55]. Then about 100,000 years ago modern Homo sapiens (\"wise man\") developed the capacity for self-awareness with associated capacities for healthy longevity, creativity, and prosocial behaviours including a sac - rifice for others to form communities with trust and altruistic support of one another [16, 41]. Hence health-promoting human self-gov - ernment is comprised of executive functions for self-direction (i.e., being intentionally resourceful, purposeful, and responsible to achieve personal goals), legislative functions for cooperation (i.e., being intentionally tolerant, helpful, and principled in interper - sonal interactions), and judicial functions for self-transcendence (i.e., insight in the appraisal of values and theories, so that a person can identify with something greater than their individual self ) [12]. The temperament and character traits can be measured reliably, and they are strongly predictive of differences between people in their physical, emotional, cognitive, and spiritual aspects of health and well-being [16, 17, 56]. The heritability of personality and of well-being is approximately 50% and nearly all of their heritability is ex - plained by 972 genes that are organized in clusters for particular functions that regulate and maintain health. Nearly all the genes are expressed in brain circuits for learning and memory, and over 70% are expressed in nearly all organs and tissues throughout the body, so they are organized in ways that support the adap - tive regulation of health for a person as a whole [17].Health depends on many complex adaptive processes The organization and development of the human systems for learning to adapt to changing conditions in a healthy, satisfy - ing, and meaningful way is complex [45]. At all levels of expression (molecules, cells, learning circuits, behaviour, cognition), the components interact through many feed - back and feedforward loops modulating their functions. At the behavioural-cogni - tive level, the same traits can have different outcomes (i.e., pleiotropy in genetics and multi-finality in development) and differ - ent traits can have the same outcome (i.e., heterogeneity in genetics and equi-finality in development). The genes that regulate the three learning systems are largely sepa - rate from one another and are expressed in different brain networks. Nevertheless, they operate cooperatively with one another, and within each system, they function in clus - ters of interdependent components, not as independent parts like a machine. Much more about this complexity is summarized in more detail elsewhere [45]. The complexity of systems regulating health and well-being is adaptive, that is, it involves learning to adapt to changing opportunities and conditions in order to maintain and improve health and reduce the risk of disorder in response to internal or external stressors and challenges [55]. Such complex adaptive systems allow for plasticity and meta-stability: that is, they allow maintenance of stable functioning despite changing internal and external conditions, but small changes can also lead to major functional shifts at tipping points (the so-called \"butterfly effect\") [12]. These properties of plasticity and meta-stability are also discussed in terms of the allostatic load of complex adaptive systems under stressful conditions [30]. When threatened or distressed, a person's blood pressure is likely to automatically rise to high levels as part of a fight-or- flight response, and their body will strive Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS7 to maintain hypertension as long as the threat to survival is present. People create health Furthermore, the human system for regu - lating health is not merely adaptive, it is creative [16, 33]. What is most important to recognize is that human personality is not fixed: it involves learning abilities so that human can deliberately and creatively change their own way of functioning and in doing so actually modify how their genome is expressed through epigenetic regulation by more than 200 long-non-coding RNA genes that are unique to modern Homo sapiens [16]. These regulatory lncRNAs orchestrate the functioning of other genes throughout the body to promote human awareness and well-being so that Homo sa - piens can cultivate practical wisdom. That is, human beings can become self-aware of their own habits, goals, and values, so they can exert self-control over their habits to bring them in accord with their goals and values. This integrative functional process in which we create health is called self- actualization in humanistic psychology [57, 58] and salutogenesis in health sociology [32, 59]. It has long been recognized that health is a complex integrative process that is both adaptive and creative [31, 32]. So how do we promote and create health? Most adults do not respond well to being told what they should do. That approach has been ineffec - tive when presented dogmatically by health care professionals. However, people can be motivated to change their knowledge, at - titude, and engagement with healthy liv - ing when it is encouraged in dialogue and participation in experiences that allow them to be creative in facing current realities and then to imagine vividly what they want for themselves [60]. Then they are creatively ac - tualizing their own vision of a satisfying and meaningful future, which is more valued by them than transient pleasures and maladap -tive habits [47]. Such self-identified mean - ingful goals motivate people to regulate and change their unhealthy habits to actualize what they aspire to be and to do for them - selves and for others. Much more about health care as a creative person-centred process is described elsewhere [29, 47, 60]. The self-actualization process requires the integrative activation of all three systems of human learning in order for a person to bring their habits into accord with their goals and values, as described below. What has been briefly summarized here is intend - ed only to provide the scientific foundation for recognizing why over-reliance on the simplifying and approximate assumptions of the discrete disease paradigm for practi - cal aspects of health care has led us to ignore the underlying creative path to health and well-being. Our ignoring the real pathway to health and well-being has allowed the current confluence of crises in health care to emerge around the world, but our mis - takes can be corrected. Now let's examine the limitations of the discrete disease para - digm in more detail to recognize where it goes wrong. Inadequacies of the medical model of discrete diseases with specific causes What is called \"evidence-based\" medicine is hardly what it claims to be because it re - ally provides little or no information about how to treat any individual patient except for people with rare homogeneous con - ditions with a specific cause and with no comorbidity. Evidence-based medicine is strongly guided by algorithms to treat dis - crete diseases with specific medications and procedures identified by differences in average health outcomes between groups of people in randomized controlled trials. This has serious limitations because of its false assumptions about disease taxonomy, specificity and homogeneity of causation, and socioeconomic determinants of health. Even advocates emphasize that evidence from randomized controlled trials must be supplemented by individual clinical experi - ence and patients' choice [61], but there is no systematic method for actually doing so within the discrete disease paradigm. As a result, most medical decisions are currently made without a high degree of scientific certainty [19]. Accordingly, we will consider the challenges of trying to do so in relation to each of these assumptions in turn for clarity. Diagnoses are not specific enough to be prescriptive First, regarding taxonomy , despite centu - ries of effort it has never been possible to develop a classification of medical diseases in which individuals have a consistent set of clinical features that are discrete (that is, with a non-overlapping set of pathogno - monic features) [5]. Put another way, the symptoms used for medical diagnosis and disease classification are nearly always non- specific individually and the boundaries be - tween neighbouring conditions are overlap - ping (\"fuzzy\") even when multiple features are combined in polythetic criterion sets. It has always been hoped and promised that diagnostic criteria based on symptoms and natural history will soon be replaced by spe - cific laboratory tests, but the same problem of fuzziness and non-specificity occurs with laboratory test results, symptoms, and signs of the disorder [3, 4, 18, 62]. Fuzzy bound - aries and non-specificity of criteria based on symptoms and/or tests persist because the causes of most medical dysfunction involve complex adaptive systems. In other words, different people with the same diagnosis become ill by way of different developmen - tal pathways in which multiple causal vari - ables interact with one another to produce similar signs and symptoms [25]. Diagnoses of disorders in all medical spe - cialities suffer from the limitations of het - erogeneity and complexity, even though it Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS8 is most widely acknowledged in psychia - try: that is, all common medical disorders turn out to be heterogeneous in aetiology and development because of their complex biopsychosocial nature. For example, about 40% of the risk of dementia may be delayed or prevented by changes in modifiable life - style factors and comorbid conditions, in - cluding a reduction in alcohol intake, smok - ing, obesity, exposure to air pollution, as well as improvements in sleep, frequency of physical activity and social contact, educa - tion, cognitive stimulation, hearing, control of diabetes, hypertension, and depression, and prevention of head trauma [63]. As a result, diagnostic categories lack prescriptive specificity : the pharmaceutical industry can offer a wide variety of drugs acting by dif - ferent mechanisms for people with the same diagnosis, which are usually prescribed by physicians to particular patients by trial and error with partial or transient success and no cure. For research purposes, the problem of heterogeneity within diagnostic catego - ries can be partly mitigated, but not elimi - nated, using advanced statistical methods of clustering, or by the exclusion of \"atypical\" cases [25]. However, general classification systems are expected to assign everyone to some class, and physicians must treat each person who presents for help without the luxury of accumulating a large series of sim - ilar cases or excluding atypical cases. Diagnoses are highly heterogeneous and imprecise Second, regarding causation , common medical disorders have multiple biological, psychological, and social determinants of risk that interact to influence vulnerability, so their pathogenesis cannot be reduced to material (physical, cellular, molecular) causes [44]. These biopsychosocial pro - cesses are not deterministic, but actually are adaptive in the sense that a person has multiple systems of learning and memory that function to maintain homeostasis and allostasis, as mentioned in the introduction. Consequently, there has been little success in developing specific laboratory tests that identify the actual causes of most diseases, which are most frequently attributable to lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, drinking, poor diet and exercise, reckless behaviour) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., economic inequity, poverty, inequitable access to care, social distrust, exposure to violence) [18, 49, 64]. Even markers of dysfunction, such as abnormal glucose tolerance tests, do not specify the actual fundamental cause of the abnormality, which may be based on a va - riety of biological abnormalities and/or on lifestyle, rather than a specific biogenetic defect. There are claims of a future of precision medicine based on analysis of the human genome [65], which is promoted by re - searchers and commercial companies, even though the validity of assessments of the vulnerability of any specific individual that is based on individual genes or polygen - etic risk scores without a personalized as - sessment of the whole person in their life context is doubtful [45]. In other words, even though genetic testing and genome sequencing are objective and reliable proce - dures, health does not depend on the aver - age effects of genes acting independently. Rather health depends on the interactions of many genetic and environmental factors operating in complex sets of biopsychoso - cial pathways that regulate the expression of genes, the co-expression of groups of genes, and the epigenetic modification of genes in response to individual life experiences, socioeconomic conditions, and creative hu - man aspirations [16, 17, 45]. The promise of precise treatment algorithms for common diseases is no more valid than earlier hopes and promises of reductionists over many de - cades that pathognomonic laboratory tests are expected to emerge in the near future. The undeniable reason for the persistent failure of this promise over centuries is that organs, cells, and molecules do not operate separately in living organisms; rather their functioning is interdependent and adaptive in order to maintain plasticity and allostasis as needed for health, as described in the in - troduction. Health and disease depend mostly on personal behaviours and socioeconomic conditions Third, regarding the social determinants of health , the discrete disease model assumes that categorical diagnosis is an adequate ba - sis to guide effective treatment without re - gard for an individual's personality, lifestyle, or their psychosocial, ecological, and eco - nomic circumstances, such as levels of eco - nomic inequity and social distrust in their community. In fact, health outcomes are much more influenced by such psychoso - cial influences on health, which account for more than 80% of the variability in health outcomes [44, 49]. Even for some specific infections, such as Sars-CoV-2, the social determinants of health are indistinguish - able from those for average all-sources mor - tality, so transdiagnostic health promotion, such as building communities that are more caring, equitable, and educated is likely to be more effective for overall societal well- being, socioeconomic stability, and disease prevention than a large set of specific treat - ments based on categorical diagnosis [28]. Despite this, current health policies do little to address the actual determinants of dis - ease despite prudent recommendations on what needs to be done [28, 63]. Heritable personality traits account for about half of the variability in physical, mental, social, and spiritual aspects of well- being, including overall healthy longevity and resilience to injury, ageing, and degen - erative processes by activating molecular processes that promote longevity, healing, and resilience from injury and disease [17]. It is important to recognize that what is in - herited are systems of learning to adapt in an integrative manner, not fixed traits or separate functions with individual cells or organs [16, 17, 30]. Three systems of learning underlie Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS9 the development of well-being: associative conditioning of habits and skills, intentional self-control of goal-seeking, and self-aware - ness of creative and flexible means to realize what is valuable and meaningful for one's self and others [16, 17]. Consequently, well- being depends on learning in which nature and nurture are always both involved. Put another way, health and well-being can - not be reduced to fixed materialistic deter - minants, so we cannot measure a person's health or even their vulnerabilities without also assessing their habits, goals, and values for their congruence and strengths. First, to predict the physical aspects of capacity for physical well-being and vulnerability to disease with precision, we must know the extent to which a person's habits are in ac - cord with their goals and values. Second, to predict the emotional and cognitive aspects of health, we must also know if they can self-regulate their work, lifestyle, social re - lationships, and aspirations in ways that ac - tivate molecular processes for plasticity, in - cluding energy production to support their resilience, cellular maintenance, and repair of injury, ageing and other degenerative processes. Third, to predict the social and spiritual aspects of health, we must know if a person is sufficiently self-aware of cre - ative ways of adapting in ways that will give their life meaning and purpose, as shown by their actively cultivating epigenetic changes in the expression of their genome by wise health-promoting ways of living, such as working in the service of others, letting go of fighting and worry, and growing in awareness of what is meaningful in life. For example, health-promoting self-actu - alization of a person's intrinsic aspirations and vocation is observed when a person cultivates positive emotions and social trust by awareness of their inseparable connec - tions with other people and nature [12]. Such social and spiritual aspects of health promotion and maintenance are expressed by frequent acts of kindness, compassion, gratitude, patience, fairness, moderation, humility, peace-making, and other virtues [47]. Such conscious health-promoting practices are quite distinct from the char - acteristics of the materialistic life that is strongly promoted in social media in secu - lar societies around the world; what is most often promoted in media is the desirability of self-interested profit-seeking, immoder - ate consumption, and striving for power or celebrity, which are harmful to health and well-being for both individuals and com - munities [43]. All three aspects of health (physical, mental, and spiritual) are interdependent, so all need to be cultivated simultaneously, not just one or two at a time . For example, reductionistic approaches that emphasize only one aspect of the path to well-being do not produce consistent and strong benefits: approaches that emphasize materialistic aspects of well- being, or behavioural and cognitive aspects, or social and spiritual aspects need to be combined in an integrative fashion for ef - fective and consistent health care. Optimal learning about physical, mental, so - cial, or spiritual aspects of well-being occurs in the context of a personal and therapeu - tic alliance directed toward common goals by the people involved in a person-centred relationship [66]. Such person-centred care has been described as \"of the person, by the person, for the person, and with the per - son\" [66]. As a result, continuity of person- centred assessment and care is crucial for effective health outcomes. Person-centred integrative diagnosis (PID) provides a comprehensive biopsychosocial model that includes illness categories in the context of assessments of functioning and quality of life, as well as risk and protective factors, and the person's health experience and val - ues planning [67]. In this way, the person's own resources, habits, goals, and values can are assessed so that both their strengths for positive health and symptoms of ill-health are considered jointly in treatment planning [68]. When health care administrators treat physicians as interchangeable parts, rather than prioritizing continuity of care by the same physician, much is lost in health out - comes of both the recipients and providers of care. Need to Prioritize Person- centered and People- centered Values Both health care and disease care are necessary and complementary A person is much more than their mate - rial body: our health depends on our learn - ing to take care of our individual self and one another in families, communities, and the world. Whereas the medical paradigm popular in the West has usually emphasized technological treatment of discrete diseases by specialists, the medical paradigm popular in the East has emphasized promotion of health of whole person and prevention of disease by person-centred generalists and people-centred promotion of public health. The technological approach emphasized in the West has been excellent for specif - ic injuries and diseases acutely, but it has unfortunately been ineffective for health promotion and disease prevention due to underfunding of public priorities and em - phasis on private profit. These are actually complementary strate - gies, but overall health promotion and dis - ease prevention are more effective and ef - ficient in improving health care than is the specialized clinical care of multiple diseases separately. Put another way, the shift to fo - cus on separate diseases and specialization in medical education has profited medical- industrial alliances, but it has dehumanized medicine by its failure to prioritize the well- being of the whole person and of the com - munity in health care [69]. Discrete disease care has provided inadequate attention to self-care, motivation of healthy lifestyle, and the social determinants of health. Both disease care and health care have their roles Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS10 to play: disease care can be most helpful when its foundation is person- and people- centred health care. Competition and cost control are not effective approaches to good health care . When person-centred health care is not understood and practised pervasively as the foundation of medical practice, the benefits of disease care become weak, inconsistent, costly, and inefficient. Consequently, the solution to the rising cost of the burden of disease is not stricter business manage - ment and competition in health care. In fact, the inefficiency and dysfunction of health care in developed countries in the West currently is the result of applying a model of health that is an extension of the industrial business perspective to hu - man health care. The Flexner report in the USA in 1910 was funded by industrialists, notably Andrew Carnegie and the Rock - efellers. It emphasized biomedical reduc - tionism in medical education and research and has had the long-term effect of reduc - ing person-centred communication and caring for the well-being of patients [70]. Any model of human nature that ignores humanistic and transpersonal sources of satisfaction and value has proven to be in - adequate to account for human evolution [16] or the conditions in which health and well-being flourish in individuals and na - tions [28]. Specifically, it turns out that the separatist view of human nature and func - tioning is simply not appropriate scientifi - cally for health care and is also doubtful for the long-term prosperity of business [71, 72]. Corporations that are recognized as having the rights of a citizen also need to accept the social duties of a citizen for societies and their economies to flourish, rather than focusing only on continuous economic growth unrestrained by respect for social justice. Socioeconomic inequity consistently leads to the collapse of econo - mies and societies, as is predicted for the world by 2040 unless we thoroughly revise the priorities of our socioeconomic [72, 73] and ecological [74, 75] policies. Unfortunately, the proposed solution to ris - ing costs from specialized disease care dur - ing the 1980s was to bring in strict busi - ness management to maximize profit and/ or to reduce costs, but these policies have not proven to be beneficial. Business man - agement, which adopted the profit policies of business with little or no commitment to social justice or personal well-being, was de - signed to reduce the cost of health care, but it has failed to do so [76, 77]. It has not only failed to achieve its cost-control objectives but has impaired the noble values and ide - als of medicine because health care is much more than running a profitable business or implementing scientific knowledge with no recognition or commitment to personal creativity, freedom, and dignity or to social justice and diversity [28, 70]. Furthermore, prioritizing profit over peo - ple has been detrimental to the health of both providers and recipients of health care, and has led to high rates of burn-out of providers (viz. 40 to 60%) and to dis - satisfaction and distrust of patients along with worse health outcomes when care providers have too little time to know who is being treated and what their life situ - ations and values are [36, 37]. The burn- out of health care professionals is due to the monetization and dehumanization of health care, as is also occurring in most other societal institutions [78]. Person-centred medicine is the foundation for effective health care Therefore, we propose that the solution to the current crises in health care is the recog - nition that effective and sustainable health care for the vast majority of disorders of health needs to adopt a person-centred and biopsychosocial approach that recognizes the intrinsic dignity of every person and the interdependence of the physical, men - tal, social and spiritual aspects of well-be - ing. The science of well-being is rigorously documented now and reveals the serious misconceptions and limitations of the dis - crete disease paradigm of health care, which prioritizes costly technological treatment of the ills of unhealthy lifestyles and inequi - table social conditions while neglecting the actual causes of disease. Policies for educa - tion and treatment are failing to provide for the health care needs of people in ways that are affordable, efficient, and effective in the long term. Call to action Medicine is now in several interrelated emergencies that are not sustainable: esca - lating disease burden, weak and inconsistent efficacy, burn-out of providers, and public distrust and dissatisfaction. There is an ur - gent need for change. What we know now about the basis for health and well-being calls for a shift in the priorities of medicine around the world. We need health care systems that are more eq - uitably accessible, more effective in promot - ing health and preventing disease, and less costly. Priorities need to address the major psychosocial determinants of health that promote healthy longevity, rather than pri - oritizing costly technologies for acute care of dysfunctions that becomes chronic while neglecting the psychosocial determinants of health. At the individual level, the health care envi - ronment needs to be personalized and hu - manized for all the providers and recipients of care, rather than treating persons like they were material robots and objects on an automated assembly line. At the population level, more recognition is needed about the interdependence of diverse communities around the world in order to reduce the global burden of disease in ways that are eq - uitable, efficient and effective.Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS11 In summary, health care around the world would benefit greatly if medicine as a profes - sion were to declare decisively that its prima - ry purpose to serve the health and well-being of people can only be effectively addressed by considering all the major biological, psycho - logical, social, and ecological determinants of health systematically. That priority of pur - pose needs to be sustained and developed by adopting universally shared values to achieve that purpose. Then clinical units serving the needs of communities need to drive the sys - tem to fulfil their purpose in unison with other components of an integrated system of universal health care. The role of manage - ment is to support the fulfilment of this pri - ority as a facilitative component of a diverse and multifaceted system, no central bureau - cratic control for extraneous goals of profit and politics that interfere with the autonomy needed by medical experts for flexible day- to-day functioning to address diverse needs of individuals and local communities in a person-centred manner [79]. Much needs to be weighed in order to act quickly and prudently about how to make transitions that are needed in education, clinical practice, administration, and fund - ing priorities. The current paradigm of discrete diseases is outmoded, and the ra - tionale for prioritizing disease care over person- and people-centred health care is invalid, harmful, and inefficient. Denial and procrastination about the inadequacies of current priorities in health care policies are no longer sustainable - medicine through - out the world needs to recognize that health care is primarily a complex and creative adaptive process of self-care, health promo - tion, and disease prevention, not a clinically managed multitude of chronic discrete dis - eases. People and communities can improve their health most effectively and efficiently by individuals learning how to live healthy, happy and good lives - that is, lives that serve the health and happiness of others, not just themselves. This is a lesson we are all learning and need to share with those willing to listen and take action.Acknowledgements This article is based on a presentation by the authors at the 13th Geneva Confer - ence on Person-Centered Medicine on Self-Care and Well-being in the Times of COVID-19, 5-7 April 2021 held virtually with partial WMA sponsorship.

Initial steps from 2005 to 2008 took place at the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) in the form of an Institutional Pro - gram on Psychiatry for the Person [2, 3]. Since 2008 to date, it is being extended to medi - cine and health at large and has matured concepts and procedures through annual Geneva Conferences. In these conferences, each receiving valuable support from the World Medical Association (WMA), per - son centered medicine has been addressed Self-Care, Inter-Care and Wellbeing in COVID-19 Times at the 13th Geneva Conference on Person Centered Medicine Juan E. Mezzich Jon SnaedalPerson-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS14 from various thematic perspectives followed by publication of a declaration on respec - tive themes. In addition, since 2013 Inter - national Congresses on person centered medicine have been held across the world, including Zagreb, Buenos Aires, London, Madrid, New Delhi, Tokyo, Montevideo and Kuwait. These declarations, published on the web - site of the College [4] involve placing the person in context as the center of the con - cept of health and the goal of health actions, and proposing clinical care as informed by evidence, experience and values [5]. It also involves the empowerment (rights and du - ties) of persons to care for their own health and that of others in the community. An innovative and virtual 13th Geneva Conference on Person Centered Medicine, Self-Care, and Well-Being in Pandemic Times was held on 5-7 April 2021. The program designed by Robert Cloninger, Professor of Psychiatry and Genetics at Washington University, St Louis, and Austen El-Osta, Director of the Self-Care Academic Re - search Unit (SCARU) at Imperial Col - lege, London covered the main theme of the event through five symposia as follows: General Health Strategies, Self-Care & Person-centeredness in Pandemic Times, Self-Care Measurement and Determinants, Concepts of Well-being and Self-Care amid Social Disruption, Self-Care & Well- Being in Contemporary Society and across the Life Cycle; and the Role of Public Health Systems & Professional Organiza - tions in Self-care and Health Promotion in Pandemic Times. The program also included four panels. One Panel on Advances on Mental Health dis - cussed person centered psychiatry and the World Psychiatric Association Action Plan 2020-2023; disasters and mental health, person centered clinical care and medical education in Latin America, how herme - neutics may promote person centered men - tal health in pandemic times, the pandemic impact on LIMIC mental health, coping with death and anxiety as an ICU psychia - trist and, community development, person- centered medicine and women's mental health among other interesting presenta - tions. A second Panel on Advances in Gen - eral Practice covered: The urgent need for people centered primary care - the case of COVID-19 in Bolivia; Critical gaps in understanding people-centered care Les - sons from the pandemic in Mexico; Latin- American perspectives on self-care and well-being in pandemic times, among oth - ers.The third Panel on Public Health included presentations on Contributions of a Na - tional Primary Care Registry to People- centered Public Health; Person-centered approach to non-communicable diseases in pandemic times; Global health security & pandemic preparedness; Age in times of a Pandemic: Some population centered public health aspects; Experience with person cen - tered medicine for the education of medi - cal students; Fostering Person- Centered Medicine in Times of COVID-19: The Uruguayan Experience; and Social deter - minants of health in Latin America during pandemic times. The fourth Panel on Person-Centered Nursing in Pandemic Times included pre - sentations on Impact of COVID-19 on nurses and person centered nursing; The duty to care dilemma and the psychologi - cal well-being among nurses in pandemic times: Preliminary findings from a cross- sectional study in Chile and Spain; Public health measures in Community Centers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic; As - pects of work of recent years and reflections on self-care and the pandemic in Norway. The program also included a session on Brief Oral Presentations. The topics cov - ered were: The origins of Tournier's legacy; Virtual Envi - ronment as a Factor of Adaptation in the Face of Social Constraints; Integrating self-care into mainstream health service; Art and Literature as Therapy for Healing and Health Promotion; Quality Circles - Learning processes of participants and the potential for strengthening the work in self- help groups; Self-Care and wellbeing in older persons during pandemic times; and Self-Care and wellbeing in families during COVID-19. At the ICPCM General Assembly, Ih - san Salloum (WPA Classification Section Chair) was elected President. An important session was dedicated to the Paul Tourni - er Prize, a yearly award supported by the Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS15 ICPCM and the Paul Tournier Foundation to recognize academics who had made major contribution to Person Centered Medicine internationally. The Paul Tournier Prize for 2020 was presented to George Christodou - lou and John Cox, and that for 2021 to Jim Appleyard. In order to extend the impact of the conference, a 2021 Geneva Declaration on Self-Care, Inter-Care and Well-Being in Pandemic Times was issued. It is displayed in full here. Geneva Declaration 2021 On Self-Care, Inter-Care and Well-Being in Pandemic Times Emerging from the 13th Geneva Conference on Person Centered Medicine organized as a virtual event on 5-7 April 2021 by the Inter - national College of Person-Centered Medicine (ICPCM) in collaboration with the World Medical Association, the International Council of Nurses, and the Pan-American Health Or - ganization. Considering 1. That person centered medicine (PCM) focuses on the health, needs and values of the whole person in their context. People-centered healthcare extends the concept to individuals, families, com - munities and society as a whole, thus shaping the health of a person through shared determinants and social inter - connectedness, making both concepts complementary. 2. That health is a state of complete physi - cal, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or in - firmity as affirmed in the WHO Con - stitution. This cannot be achieved by governments, the healthcare system and healthcare professionals without the full involvement of all in the community as proclaimed in the Alma Ata Declara - tion: (Integral care of all by all), and in the ICPCM Montevideo Declaration 2020 (Persons-centered integral health care). Consideration of other general social sectors is fundamental in order to attend to the social determinants of health and the UN Sustainable Devel - opment Goals. 3. That the dignity and responsibility of each person implies that individuals have the right to health and the duty to participate individually and collectively in the planning and implementation of self-care and care for each other in vari - ous contexts including health promo - tion, disease prevention, health restora - tion and palliative care. 4. That promotion of PCM, self-care and inter-care can effectively improve the quality of life of individuals and the wellbeing of communities. While Self- Care implies the cultivation of healthy lifestyles, avoidance of risk, maintenance of mental well-being, strengthening of health literacy, and the rational and re - sponsible use of professional healthcare professionals, products and services; Inter-care extends the concept to the interconnectedness of the self with oth - ers by way of their capacity to care for each other related to patients, families, the health and social care workforce, the wider community and the environment at large, connecting to the collective wisdom of ancient cultures. 5. That self-care and inter-care within a health framework that involves the gov - ernment and all stakeholders, can ben - efit from multisector support on train - ing and properly evaluated procedures, medication and technology. 6. That the progressive monetization and dehumanization of society's institutions including those actors and organiza - tions that constitute the medical infra - structure is undesirable and counters the public interest. Medicine as a field has been commercialized and prioritizes a biomedical individual disease focused approach to the exclusion of other ap - proaches, including a whole person-centered approach that seeks to pro - mote and preserve the health of persons and the general public in a humanistic and equitable manner. 7. That the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted an imbal - ance between how funding is priori - tized for medical-industrial complexes (technology) to the detriment of public health infrastructure (services), leading to widespread burn-out in healthcare providers and the erosion of trust. This demonstrates the need for well-inte - grated, balanced and resilient healthcare systems with humanistically-oriented, scientifically informed and competent governments, able to adapt the public health systems to evolving needs and to hold the health industry to account in promoting effective self-care and inter- care policies. 8. That the pandemic exacerbated health inequity caused by socio-economic and ethnic disparities. This calls for the wider implementation of people-centered care that is culturally informed and promotes solidarity, equity and social justice. 9. That the actual broadening of epide - miological concerns highlighted by the pandemic encompasses non-com - municable and communicable diseases, multi-morbidity, mental health chal - lenges, their interactions and syndemic complexity, all of which reinforces the importance of championing compre - hensive, integrated and people-cen - tered healthcare. 10. That the International College of Per - son-Centered Medicine, through its Geneva Conference and International Congress Declarations - and those of the Latin American Network of Per - son-Centered Medicine in collabora - tion with the Pan-American Health Organization- has proposed person- centered paradigmatic health concepts and procedures, articulating science and humanism to address broad health challenges including the current pan - demic.Person-centered Medicine BACK TO CONTENTS16 We call for 1. Health policies, services and actions that include person- and people-cen - tered self-care and inter-care practices aimed at promoting individual and col - lective well-being. 2. Educating people about health and its determinants and providing them with reliable and unbiased informa - tion and training to promote self-care and inter-care encompassing a wide range of person-centered activities. This includes enhancing people's awareness of the Seven Pillars of Self-Care and the emergent concept of inter-care. 3. Examining the relationship between people's health and their environment and the need to support them through well thought-out economic and social development policies that incorporate person-centered self-care and inter-care policies and practices. 4. Broadly engaging all societal institu - tions to affirm healthcare as a human right and to uphold humanism in medicine. This involves the account - ability of governments, health systems, health care professionals, health indus - try and the community at large in or - der to conduct and attain fully ethical health care. 5. The rededication of health systems and public health infrastructure to address the social determinants of health and to attain the Sustain - able Development Goals promoting health equity. These are fundamental requirements to activate self-care and inter-care, and to promote well-being, particularly when facing pandemics and other disasters. 6. Building public health and educational structures to effectively promote social trust, social justice and social equity to support both the mental and physical health and well-being of informed, self- aware and empowered communities. 7. Empowering people to become active in the development and monitoring of the proposed innovative health services and policies as well as creative protagonists of their own health. The latter would involve awakening individual and com - munity self-awareness, self-reliance and inter-care solidarity that may enhance the quality of life for all in a way that is congruent with personal and commu - nity goals and values. 8. Promoting cooperative international leadership to coordinate cohesive global responses to pandemics and to address the underlying causes of failure in many countries to strengthen their health sys - tems and policies, and to attend to the needs of the general population with dedicated efforts to support margin - alized communities. This should lead to the activation of mechanisms that promote and accelerate universal access to vaccines and other effective public health measures. 9. Examining and documenting through pertinent workgroups the fundamental relationships between self-care, inter- care, well-being and person-centered integral healthcare in response to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. 10. Committing the International College of Person-Centered Medicine to up - holding and fulfilling the above recom - mendations in collaboration with like- minded groups and institutions.As Conclusion, one could say that the 13th Geneva Conference on Person Centered Medicine was quite successful in terms of the interest of its themes and the quality of its presentations as well as because of its virtual format, imposed by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which allowed the participation of speakers and audience from across the world.

Since then, despite several evaluations and studies, little progress has been made in rectifying the serious shortcomings revealed. Influenza epi - demics of varying degrees of severity have repeatedly reminded us of the potential consequences a pandemic could have on societies and health services as demon - strated by the Asian flu of 1956 to 1958 and the Hong Kong flu of 1968 to 1970. Outbreaks in recent decades have also provided warnings; the Bird flu of 1997, Sars in 2002-2003, the Swine flu of 2009 and the MERS outbreak of 2012. The experience in Norway seems to indi - cate that the necessity of good levels of pre - paredness is \"forgotten\" after an event. The evaluations and studies of the 2009- pan - demic indicated a lack of: Intensive care units Stockpiles of personal protective equip - ment Medical technical equipment Registers on critical equipment Plans on how to rapidly increase the overall capacity A joint national system of contact trac - ing Plans for the operation of testing stations and contact tracing Plans and tools for the identification of and vaccination of vulnerable groups. A comprehensive database of contact de - tails for general practitioners and local public health officers The same deficiencies have been witnessed during the Covid-19 pandemic. While we may now see signs of the current pandemic receding, we need to start prepar - ing for the next. The NMA's evaluation [1], published April 2021, is based on descriptions and input from its members and officials who have been at the front line of the pandemic. In this article, to a large extent based on the Norwegian Medical Association's evalua - tion of the first year of the Covid-19 pan - demic, we will describe the Norwegian ap - proach and key learning points from the period. We will try and identify key failings and key success factors, ending with some general perspectives on factors that have benefited Norway in its attempts to manage the pan - demic. The message from the Norwegian medical experts is that despite failing to maintain an adequate level of preparedness in the hospi - tal sector, lacking a systematic preparedness at the municipal level, a failure to secure adequate stockpiles and secure supply lines of personal protective equipment and other essential materials, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Norway has experienced lower- than-normal mortality, no breakdown of the health care system, a remarkably high level of vaccine acceptance and maintained levels of trust in the political system. This outcome is due to an interesting mix of ef - fective governance from national politicians and health care officials, an extraordinary mobilisation of resources in the health care service, a high level of trust in the popula - tion and an extraordinary effort by local health officers. Such a combination of fac - tors cannot be counted on for the next pan - demic. What happened - Timeline February 2020 via three waves to end of summer 2021 February 26, 2020, the national broad - caster in Norway reported the first case of COVID-19 in the country [2]. Subse - quent weeks would see rising figures, one of the main sources would be travellers returning from a winter vacation in Eu - rope. On March 12, after increasing public pressure - and following the example from Denmark- the government implemented the strongest restrictions on personal free - dom in peacetime, albeit stopping short of curfew. Schools and kindergartens were closed with exemptions for the children of key workers. The government recom - mended teleworking for all who were able to. Travel on public transport was discour - aged, in order to make this a safe option for key workers, travel abroad was banned for health personnel, quarantine was intro - duced for people having been abroad in the previous 14 days, etc. Marit HermansenCOVID-19 the Need to Act, to Learn and to Prepare - Lessons for the Next Pandemic - the Experience of NorwayNORWAY BACK TO CONTENTS18 Covid-19 Pandemic This first phase saw shortages in personal protective equipment in hospitals, elderly care institutions and primary health care. Furthermore, it soon became clear that the country's intensive care capacity became stretched, even at the very low levels of infection witnessed during the first wave. Test capacity was also low, with strong rec - ommendations to only seek testing if the person was symptomatic. The low capacity stemmed from a lack of test kits, poorly de - veloped systems to analyse tests and poorly developed systems to register and log posi - tive tests. The infection numbers declined soon, and in early May, schools and kindergartens were back in operation, alongside many commercial services. The situation seemed under control until late summer, when isolated outbreaks connected with e.g., weddings, industries employing migrant workers were reported. Late October, the second wave struck, and stronger measures were again introduced - although less re - strictive than the first wave. Oslo saw these restrictions being lifted only toward the summer of 2021 - having gone through a third wave. At the time of writing - the situation seems again to be partially under control, with a very strong level of vaccine acceptance in the populace and while the delta variant - the variant of current con - cern - is dominant, and infection numbers are rising - the situation seems to be under control [3]. Primary health care service as the front line In the Norwegian experience, a well-devel - oped primary health care system composed of general practitioners and specialists in community medicine is a prerequisite to effectively deal with the current and future pandemics [1]. One of the key success factors in the man - agement of the first and second waves of the pandemic has been a strong, well-func - tioning primary health care service. The or - ganisation at the municipal level of testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine has clearly reduced the pressure on hospital ca - pacity. This approach has however highlighted other bottlenecks in the system such as the lack of efficient ICT tools for com - munication between local health officers and central health authorities, making coordinated efforts more demanding and time-intensive. A system relying on pri - mary health services to the extent seen in Norway needs, in the opinion of the Nor - wegian Medical Association, to be more resilient. Factors to achieve this would include a more central role of local public health of - ficers in the management structure of the municipalities, strengthened capacities of the local public health officer function and reducing the reliance on individuals. Hospitals with sub- optimal capacities As the first infections in Norway appeared in February 2020, it became clear that no hospitals in Norway were adequately pre - pared for such a situation. The first phase of the pandemic showed that Norwegian hos - pitals are still poorly equipped to handle a major pandemic [1]. Over the course of the previous decades, the number of hospital beds and Intensive care units has been reduced. The stockpiles built up after the Swine flu of 2009 were done away with, and new stockpiles of equip - ment necessary in a pandemic were not es - tablished. Several reports since the year 2000 have indicated the lack of concrete plans, of re - sources (e.g., respirators), of exercises of supply security and of other equipment.Norwegian hospitals were despite these shortcomings not overrun by Covid-pa - tients during the first wave of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. The main reason is the very low levels of infection and disease compared to many other countries. The ca - pacity of hospitals was not exceeded, hospi - tals did not run out of personal protective equipment and testing capacities were un - der less stress than in many countries. The Government's decision to close most public activities, including schools and kindergar - tens, is believed to have had a decisive effect on limiting the extent of infections. Deci - sions to put many elective procedures on hold as well as the well-developed primary health care system mentioned above fur - thermore contributed to reducing the strain on hospitals. Had the government's response been less resolute, or implemented at a later stage, it is believed that Norwegian hospitals would have found it difficult to manage the situation without serious negative con - sequences. Communication as key The pandemic has underlined the need to invest in more effective tools for com - munication that may be adapted to dif - ferent situations. Digital communication platforms have allowed large parts of the workforce to telework, freeing up public transport capacity and making it easier to maintain distance. We have also seen how many meetings may just as well be carried out via online platforms instead of face to face. Experience with e-consultations indicates that more consultations can be carried out online. Knowledge on patient outcomes is however lacking, and the physician will always need to consider on a case-by-case basis whether e-consultations maintain patients' safety and efficient operations. It is also clear that certain specialities lend NORWAY BACK TO CONTENTS19 Covid-19 Pandemic themselves more easily to e-consultations than others. While Norway, in general, is characterised by high penetration of digital public servic - es, strong and reliable internet connections and a high degree of computer literacy in the population, the pandemic has illustrated how many key systems fail to communicate with each other appropriately [1]. This situation often leads to the physician resorting to pen and paper and regular mail as the interface between systems, rather than logging into several separate systems in order to punch the same information multiple times. Similarly, we have witnessed how impor - tant it would be for the authorities to have an overview of contact details for the local public health officers in case there is a need to communicate contact tracing efforts, test results and the need to introduce quarantine and isolation. A contact tracing app was developed by the Norwegian Institute for Public health but was suspended due to data protection issues. Improving these shortcomings, the app was later reintroduced - but failed to generate sufficient use to be an effective tool. Such tools would also necessitate enough test - ing - which was not in place until later stages in the pandemic. A very high vaccine acceptance As vaccines were being developed and ap - proved, the national authorities entered into cooperation agreements with the EU on vaccine deliveries. As a result, the ar - rival of vaccines mirrored the situation in EU member states. A national vaccine programme was instituted, with geographi - cal distribution according to the distribu - tion of priority groups. The main target of the programme was to reduce mortal - ity. The vaccines employed during the first phase of the programme were from Pfizer/ BioNTech, Moderna and Astra Zeneca. The programme has been designed by the National Institute of Public Health [4] and implemented by municipal authori - ties. High-quality public registries and high penetration of digital communication tools in the populace has allowed for a strongly structured queue system, where the individ - ual citizen is contacted directly and offered a vaccine appointment at a clinic close to his or her residency. In March, cases were reported of deaths as - sociated with the Astra Zeneca. According to a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine [5], by researchers at the Rikshospitalet in Oslo, the case histo - ries of the first five deaths reported, indi - cated a powerful immune system response as causing thromboembolic events. Follow - ing these cases associated with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, and similar cases reported from other countries, associated with the Janssen vaccine, the health authorities de - cided to remove these vaccines from the national vaccine programme. The Janssen vaccine was further assessed, and decided to be offered on a voluntary basis, but with strict criteria. The Norwegian Medical As - sociation has strongly advised its members not to administer this vaccine, due to the potential risks associated with it, and the conclusion that the risk of, in Norway at the time being, of severe side effects from this vaccine, is greater than the risk of se - vere Covid-illness. At the time of writing, the acceptance levels of the vaccines against COVID-19 are exceptionally high, reaching 98 % of certain cohorts. While there are indica - tions that the acceptance rate is unequal in different groups of the population - the data is very promising. It could be argued that this is indicative of a very high level of trust in authorities, also reported in other instances [6]. Current projections indicate that the vaccine acceptance rates will be above 90 percent of the target groups by the end of October (all citizens above the age of 18). Levels of trust - a resource not to be squandered According to an article from Statistics Norway [6], Norwegians, and Nordic citi - zens generally have a high degree of trust in different political institutions. This high level of trust has been expressed during the current pandemic as well. There has generally been a high degree of accep - tance of the measures adopted, and while the measures introduced to increase social distancing has been moderate compared to some countries, evidence from e.g., mobile phone networks indicate that they have been quite effective in reducing the mobil - ity of the populace. As in most countries, there have been ex - amples of protests against the restrictions, against the use of face masks and other poli - cies implemented. A most disagreement has however been challenged through public debate and professional discourse on the ef - fectiveness and the need for different mea - sures, differences in professional opinion on the modalities of the vaccine programme, etc. We would argue that the level of trust in our population to a large degree stem from a well-functioning public sector, with uni - versal health coverage and similar service level provision to all groups in society. We would also argue that such a level of trust is a vital resource for the authorities but also for the health care service. It means that less resources are required to ensure compliance with medical advice. It means that the population is responsive to con - tact tracing and, in most cases accept rules on quarantine and isolation. It also seems to translate into a very high level of vac - cine acceptance without the need to offer incentives beyond the protection against disease.NORWAY BACK TO CONTENTS20 Covid-19 Pandemic The role of the Norwegian Medical Association The Norwegian Medical Association has traditionally maintained strong cooperation with health authorities, not least in terms of channelling professional medical advice to policymakers. During the first phases of the pandemic, as the health care services of sev - eral countries became stretched beyond ca - pacity, it became clear that guidelines were needed to assist prioritization within differ - ent specialities and patient groups. Through its colleges, the Norwegian Medical Asso - ciation, therefore, compiled comprehensive advice on which treatments to prioritize should resource become stretched [7]. The Journal of the Norwegian Medical As - sociation [8] took early measures to invite physicians to present Covid-19 case de - scriptions in order to facilitate rapid dis - semination of the rapidly increasing knowl - edge on the virus. Furthermore, several webinars were organ - ised where physicians from different parts of the country exchanged experiences The Association furthermore took measures to facilitate members' ongoing work during the pandemic - negotiating special rates and compensation schemes for physicians needing to work beyond normal working hours and for physicians losing income due to quarantine and other restrictions. The Association of General Practitioners and the College of General Practice established a task force to provide professional advice to general practitioners, to share practical solu - tions to prioritise capacity at the local level and to negotiate compensation schemes for general practitioners who had to quarantine or isolate due to Covid-19.Ethics in a pandemic Despite our efforts to continually update our ethical considerations, a new crisis will bring new ethical dilemmas. Some of these dilemmas pertain to society at large, others to us as a medical profession with responsi - bility for all our patients. During this pandemic, we have seen civil liberties constrained in order to control infection rates. The closing of services and maintenance of social distance has and will carry costs to individuals and society. We expect that rates of depres - sion and feelings of isolation will rise. We fear children needing support have received less than needed, exacerbating their situation. When treatment capacities are under strain, we need to be prepared to prioritise and tri - age. We found that engaging with our col - leges to identify key priorities for treatment was a valuable exercise that we will find a use for also in the future. A pandemic shows us the necessity to think globally, and to act both locally and globally. We need to consider the balance between caring for our own populations and striving for global solidarity. In an interconnected world, we cannot defeat a pandemic with national measures only. Discussions in the Medical Ethics Committee of the World Medical Association will surely reflect this in the years to come. COVID-19 has shown us again how vul - nerable our societies are to new diseases. We believe that a fundamental lesson learned is that we need to strengthen pre - paredness for new diseases. It is time to put health first.References 1.

Many restaurants were closed or the open - ing hours were strictly limited. In March 2020 also the southern part of Finland (capital region) was isolated from the rest of the country because the virus was spreading so rapidly. I must say it was most peculiar to see roadblocks and police guards assisted with soldiers on the border of our southern province. When lockdown and summer - time slowed down epidemy this isolation was cancelled after a couple of months. I must say that I never could have imagined seeing roadblocks and soldiers between Helsinki and my hometown in peacetime. Maybe that shows that we are at war - really fighting - against this virus. Also travelling to and from abroad stopped - as in many other countries. There was a heated discussion about the fundamental rights of citizens - because according to our constitution every citizen has the right to leave the country as well as to come back home. There was also great concern about the COVID-19 epidemy in our neighbour countries: Estonia, Sweden and Russia. All through this epidemy, our health care system has been under pressure and inten - sive care units and infection departments have worked hard. Doctors and nurses are rather tired but we have managed to take care of all the COVID-19 patients. Instead waiting times for surgery and diagnostics have lengthened. Especially in primary care, we have problems as so many nurses, dentists and doctors have been trans - ferred to do infection tracking or vaccina - tion. Now we have a new word in Finnish: HOITOVELKA , which translates to treat- ment debt . So the concern is rising, if we are getting more health problems because of this overload/lock-down and mental, social problems get worse and diagnosis for seri - ous diseases may be delayed. At the moment it looks like the fourth wave of this pandemic is rising in Finland, so we are competing with vaccination against this virus. Lately, there has been activity in social me - dia against vaccination and also a denial of the whole pandemic - different conspiracy theories like Qanon and unfortunately also campaigning in Instagram and TikTok to convince children not to take the vaccina - tion. Also, some dissident physicians are spreading fake news and disinformation. In Finnish Medical Association we are very proud of our members - how hard they have worked and also how rapidly scientists, medical researchers all over the world have been able to develop treatment and several vaccines against this virus. This truly proves the importance of international co-opera - tion in medical research. Kati Myllym\u00e4ki, MD, Specialist in general practice CEO, Finnish Medical Association E-mail: kati.myllymaki@laakariliitto.fi Kati Myllym\u00e4kiThe Coronavirus situation in Finland in brief (11th of August, 2021)FINLAND BACK TO CONTENTS22 Covid-19 Pandemic For more than a hundred years no world - wide pestilence has affected the world as much as the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 180 million people were infected worldwide and millions had to have cared for acute, severe COVID-19 disease. Of - ficial numbers document that close to 4 million people have died, and it is not yet over. Switzerland, like most other countries, has been much affected by COVID-19. Consequences for individu - als, society and life in general since Febru - ary 2020 have been enormous. This article highlights the main aspects and speci - ficities of the acute medicine response in Switzerland during the COVID-19 pan - demic. As of June 2021, Switzerland has docu - mented over 700'000 confirmed SARS- CoV-2-infections. Almost 30'000 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalised since February 2020 during the entire epidemic and 10'315 individuals have died from COVID-19. Switzerland has one of the most advanced healthcare systems world - wide. Over 150 acute care hospitals are dis - tributed throughout the country, with five University Hospitals and 9 larger Cantonal Hospitals (> 500 beds) as the main pillars of acute medicine. Switzerland is built up by 26 Cantons corresponding to States in other countries. In a normal situation, the health care system is mostly organized at the cantonal level, within the legal frame - work of federal laws and regulations. In ad - dition, Switzerland is characterized by four language regions (German, French, Italian, Reto-romanic), with significant cultural differences. Since February 2020, hospitalization num - bers strongly reflected the epidemiologi - cal situation, with the typical delay of one to several weeks between an increase in population cases followed by hospital and intensive care admissions and deaths. Vice versa numbers of infected patients who had to be hospitalized decreased quickly after strengthening measures against the spread of the virus. Peak values were observed dur - ing the first wave on March 23rd 2020 with 1'321 new daily cases and in fall with peak values on November 2nd 2020 with 21'926 new daily cases especially in the French- speaking part of Switzerland. Hospitalisa - tion numbers in particular in intensive care units were very high and at the very limit of hospital capacities, in particular in the French and Southern part of Switzerland during the first wave and in the German part of Switzerland during the second wave. At the peak of the 2nd wave, on November 16th 2020, 3'787 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, with over 900 ICU patients at this time. Very rapidly early in 2020, many profes - sional societies issued guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients. This was particularly the case for the Swiss So - cieties of Intensive Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine, who con - tributed to the coordination of acute care, mostly with joint recommendations. Acute medicine benefited also from the ongoing collaboration with the Federal Office of Public Health regarding the procurement of medications as well as the analyses of the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force regarding the development of the epidemic or the critical appraisal of new treatment strategies. During the first wave, it became obvious that the coordination of available hospi - tal and ICU beds across Switzerland was necessary to ensure balanced use of the acute health care system resources. Fol - lowing this first wave, the national coor - dination system was adapted to become fully functional for the second wave. The coordinated health care service ('Koordi - nierter Sanit\u00e4tsdienst', KSD), the Federal Office of Public Health, the Swiss Society for Intensive Care Medicine, the Hospital Manuel Battegay Thierry Fumeaux Nicolas J. Mueller Hans ParggerAcute Medicine during the COVID-19 Pandemic in SwitzerlandSWITZERLAND BACK TO CONTENTS23 Covid-19 Pandemic Organisation (H+) and the Board of Di - rectors of the cantonal ministers of health were able to collectively set up an organ - isational crisis platform and a live ongoing survey system with very detailed data on the hospital and ICU situation through - out Switzerland. Such data presented with dashboards included daily numbers of ICU occupancy (for COVID-19 and non- COVID-19 patients), numbers of hospi - talizations on wards and free bed capaci - ties. Based on this, a short-term prediction model was set up ( www.icumonitoring.ch ). Data were accessible also to the public and published in the news media on a daily basis. Based on this, the total number of available, staffed and functional ICU beds was increased from 865 to around 1100, in order to prevent deterioration of qual - ity of care. Based on available resources in trained personal, material, machines and locations the hospitals were prepared to further increase this number to about 1400, but with decreasing staff density. In addition, intermediate care unit capaci - ties were increased and normal wards were equipped and staffed to apply treatments such as high flow oxygen. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the high quality of the Swiss acute medicine was preserved, notably due to the quality of the general practitioners and hospital networks. According to the ongoing survey data of the FOPH, hospital mortality has been one of the lowest in the international setting, i.e. between 10% and 14% in different hospi - tals throughout the country. Several factors, likely a combination thereof, could have led to this low hospital mortality: 1. Switzerland has a well-developed health care system with a dense network of primary care practitioners through - out the country and universal access to high-level healthcare. This is reflected by one of the highest life expectancies worldwide. In particular, the good level of care of patients presenting the risk factors for COVID-19, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and other car -diovascular risk factors may play an im - portant role. 2. The low hospital mortality in acute hos - pitals can in part be explained by the fact that many elderly and frail patients were not admitted to a hospital or in - tensive care unit. Death rates reached a new height in 2020 never seen since the 1940'. Indeed, in Switzerland, many el - derly living either at home or in nursing homes were engaged in a shared deci - sion-making process, and opted to stay at home or in a geriatric hospital with - out acute care or intensive care manage - ment. Importantly, there were no restric - tions to the access to a hospital or ICU beds, so that there was no admission re - fusal at any time point, for any patients. A guideline for the ICU admission triage in case of limited resource avail - ability was published already in March 2020, based mainly on short-term prog - nosis determined by co-morbidities and the addition of frailty in a revised ver - sion in November https://www. samw.ch/dam/jcr:d0299ca3-c2be-49e8- 9a55-e3cff66dc3e7/guidelines_sams_tri - age_intensive_care_resource_scarci - ty_20200320.pdf ). But this guideline had never to be implemented through - out Switzerland. 3. Third and most importantly, high-end medicine could be maintained in all hospitals which ensured high qual - ity. Interdisciplinary collaboration with key teams contributing additionally to acute care included cardiology, pulmo - nary medicine, nephrology, radiology, microbiology, radiology, psychosomat - ics, in addition to intensive care, infec - tious disease, infection prevention and -control and internal medicine special - ists. All this teamwork was essential for maintaining a functional system, to - gether with an interprofessional work of physicians, nurses and supporting teams including hospital task forces to coordi - nate within the hospital but also with Cantonal authorities and primary care practitioners.Despite the adaptation of the organiza - tion of the healthcare system, Switzerland's hospital-and ICU-bed capacity has almost reached its limits in November 2020. How - ever, the level of quality of care seemed to be preserved throughout the whole pandemic, but this was at the cost of postponing non- emergent surgical interventions requiring postoperative intensive care. During the first and the second wave, there was also a clear decrease in the admission of patients presenting with acute stroke or myocardial infarction, and a lower than expected num - ber of 'usual' ICU patients including trauma patients. It became clear from this pandemic and epidemic in Switzerland that processes and coordination are the most important aspects. Trust building aspects were local and national guidelines of infection pre - vention and control within hospitals from the very beginning learning then already from the national and international ex - perience. In this context, a humble view helped much to learn and to constantly optimize.

Workplace violence is vio - lence that occurs at the workplace [2]. This includes physical and psychological abuse (emotional abuse), bullying, verbal abuse, sexual harassment and racial discrimina - tion. The exact burden of this problem is not known but according to the World Health Organization between 8% and 38% of healthcare professionals have been victims of physical abuse in the course of their work [1]. This prompted the International Labour Of - fice, International Council of Nurses, World Health Organization and Public Services International to launch a joint programme for the reduction and elimination of the im - pact of violence at the medical workplace [1]. Violence against doctors can occur on the way to work [3]. The consequences are direct and indirect effects; temporal or permanent physical disability, death, low worker mo - rale; increased job stress, turnover; hostile working environment, reduced confidence in hospital management and colleagues [2]. The perpetrators are doctors or patients and their families. Trainer - trainee bullying is common during residency training espe - cially in settings where there are no policies against it or policies guarding interpersonal relations within the medical workplace. Sig - nificant incidents of workplace violence oc - cur in the hospital because the emotion of patients and their caregivers are involved [4]. The Medical Women's International As - sociation (MWIA) is an international as - sociation of women doctors globally, for easier support and governing is divided into various regions; the Near East and Africa is one of the regions, comprising of countries in the Near East and African continent. The Near East and Africa MWIA region orga - nize a regional conference every three years. In 2021, the MWIA Near East and African regional conference took place in Abuja, the Nigerian Capital City. It was a hybrid confer - ence of physical and virtual participants due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference was earlier scheduled to take place in Sep - tember 2020 but it was rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were differ - ent sessions at the conference which included plenary sessions, opening ceremony, panel symposium, oral and poster presentations. The Violence against Doctors Panel Symposium The panel symposium on violence against doctors with a focus on women doctors was held at the MWIA Near East and Africa regional conference. The host for this symposium was Dr. Dabota Yvonne Buowari. The Chair of the symposium was Prof. Elizabeth Ogoli Nwasor, a Chief Consultant Obstetric Anaesthetist, Criti - cal Care and Pain management at the Ah - madu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria. This sym - posium was attended by 66 physical and 33 online conference attendees from four countries: Nigeria, Tanzania, Ghana, and Germany. The Panelists There were three speakers at the panel sym - posium: Dr. Ogugua Osi-Ogbu, a geri - training; and Dr. Dabota Yvonne Buowari. Brief Report on Individual Contributions The topics discussed by the panellists are: Panelists Topics Dr. Dabota Yvonne BuowariWorkplace violence in healthcare Dr. Margaret Owoliyi PopoolaViolence against female doctors, a growing trend Dr. Ogugua Osi-OgbuThe role of chief executives in the prevention of violence at the medical workplaceA Report on a Symposium Titled 'Violence Against Doctors with Focus on Women Doctors' Presented at the Mwia Near East and Africa Conference, Abuja 2021 Dabota Yvonne Buowari BACK TO CONTENTS25 Violence in Healtcare Workplace Violence in Healthcare The definition of violence according to World Health Organization was given as violence in the workplace. According to the World Health Organization, the workplace should be free from any form of violence and harassment. When friction, conflicts and grievances occur, they should be re - solved amicably. The International Labour Office, International Council of Nurses, World Health Organization and Public Services International launched a joint programme for the reduction and elimina - tion of the impact of violence at the medi - cal workplace in 2003 (5). In 2016, Nige - ria proposed Resolution 5 at the MWIA triennial conference in Vienna, Austria \"Whereas patient-initiated violence against health workers has serious health effects on the health workers and the community. MWIA resolves that health workers are en - titled to work free from occupational stress and threat in a safe environment free from harassment, discrimination, violence, verbal and physical abuse [6]. At the workplace, violence can occur between healthcare workers and patients, healthcare workers and patient's relatives/caregivers, between healthcare co-workers. In as much as any physician can be assaulted at the workplace, emergency physicians, psychiatrists and primary care physicians are at risk of be - ing assaulted while caring for their patients. Violence at the medical workplace can take various forms; verbal, psychological, physi - cal abuse and sexual harassment. The causes of violence against health work - ers as: Individual, organization and environ - mental factors. Patient-related, physician-related and healthcare institution related factors. Some of the risk factors that predispose doctors to be assaulted by patients and their caregivers are female health workers and young doctors. Violence at the workplace in healthcare is a global problem; therefore women doctors who have been assaulted needs support especially mental health support. It is necessary to conduct studies on workplace bullying and sexual harass - ment especially as the International Labour Office (ILO), International Council of Nurses (ICN), World Health Organization (WHO) and Public Service International (PSI) jointly developed a reliable and vali - dated research instrument \"The workplace violence in the health sector research instru - ments for quantitative research and guide - lines for focus group discussion through the joint programme on workplace violence in the health sector. This will enable vari - ous countries to provide a solution to this problem. Workplace Violence against Female Doctors, A Growing Trend The female sex is a risk factor for been as - saulted at the medical workplace. Women doctors face a lot of challenges in the course of their work. It is important various strate - gies are taken to end this menace. Violence against women is one of the oldest global public health issues and by extension to women doctors. Generally, receivers of psychological vio - lence are also likely to be victims of physi - cal violence. Though many cases tend not to be reported especially in developing countries, women doctors compared to their male counterparts are at a high risk of psychological violence which is perpe - trated by their patients, caregivers, male colleagues, senior colleagues and visitors to the hospitals. She gave the United Nations declaration on the elimination of violence against women (1993) states that \"as vio - lence against women is any act of gender- based violence that results in or is likely to result in physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women including threats of acts, coercion or arbitrary, deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in the public or private life. Doctors especially women doc - tors encounter several forms of violence at work making women doctors not to be safe at work. The emergency units and psychia - try are known to be hotspots for violence against health workers. Violence against women doctors has impacts on the carrier, finances, health institutions, economy and the society at large. On the way forward, the responsibilities of doctors, health in - stitutions, the media and the government was given. The annual 16 days of activism against violence against women should also be used as a campaign on violence against women doctors. There is a rising rate of violence against doctors and not neces - sarily women doctors is increasing leading to reluctance to take up challenging cases, thereby comprising healthcare delivery. There is therefore an urgent need to make health care facilities safe havens for doctors as only then can they work with complete dedication. The Role of Chief Executives in the Prevention of Violence at the Medical Workplace Some of the preventive strategies of vio - lence at the medical workplace include the provision of protection and security. Also, health workers should be trained on good communications, show empathy to their patients and also leave the scene once they sense any form of psychological abuse to avoid its progression into a physical as - sault. The topic of violence against healthcare workers is apt at this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the cases have been un - derreported and much attention has not been given to this issue. Sometimes health - care workers are beaten by patients and their caregivers outside the hospital premises on their way home after the close of work. BACK TO CONTENTS26 Conclusion Participants who are chief executives of hos - pitals were urged to put measures in place to protect women doctors from every form of workplace violence. Conducting studies on workplace bullying and violence against doctors is necessary to determine the actual burden of the problem. References 1. World Health Organization.

Nigeria. E-mail: dabotabuowari@yahoo.com The governance of healthcare in Sweden In Sweden, the state, regions and municipali - ties share the legal responsibility for health - care. The state has overall responsibility for the healthcare system and the state sets the requirements through legislation on which care is to be provided and the framework for its organisation. Governmental authorities are responsible for issuing binding guide - lines, exercise supervision and coordinate healthcare. The state also decides which care is to be considered national highly special - ized care. The state has the primary responsi - bility for research and education in the field of healthcare through state universities. Fi - nally, the state contributes significant fund - ing of healthcare through both general and targeted governmental grants. The provision of health care is the respon - sibility of 21 regions and 290 municipali - ties. They are obliged under the Health and Medical Services Act to offer health and medical care, which means that it is a man - datory task imposed by the state on mu - nicipalities and regions [1]. The law also de - scribes the obligation for the municipalities and regions to cooperate on the care of the elderly both at the overall and individual levels. However, the law gives great freedom to the regions and municipalities to decide how to provide healthcare according to lo - cal and regional conditions and needs. This is called local self-government. Self-gov - ernment is exercised by decision-making assemblies representing the local popula - tion. At the same time, the main objective of the Health and Medical Services Act is clear - healthcare must be equal throughout the country. Each healthcare region decides what kind of healthcare is to be performed and where, for example at which hospitals. Each region also decides on investments in hospitals and other care facilities, as well as investments in medical technology and other equipment. All of Sweden's municipalities and regions are members of the SALAR (The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Re - gions) which is both an employers' organisa - tion and an organisation that represents and advocates for local government in Sweden. It is a politically controlled organisation with a board consisting of elected represen - tatives from municipalities and regions [2]. Various difficulties with the cur- rent Swedish governance model For a long time, the Swedish model for healthcare with the division of responsibili - Sofia Rydgren StaleThe COVID-19 Pandemic Revealed the Need for Increased National Governance of Healthcare in SwedenViolence in Healtcare BACK TO CONTENTS27 ties between the state, region and munici - pality, has struggled with various difficulties. Several governmental investigations have tried to solve the problems by putting for - ward proposals for a more optimal division of responsibilities. But nothing has hap - pened that has fundamentally reformed the division of responsibilities. For healthcare, the situation is problematic in many ways and a large part of these problems can be referred to the healthcare regions being un - able to deliver equal healthcare. Based on the principle of subsidiarity, the majority of the welfare sector's commit - ments rest on local self-government. In this way, citizens are able to more easily influence priorities and strategies and, in the best of worlds, learn from each other's mistakes. The principle of proximity and the principle of learning from each other (institutional learning) are traditionally two strong arguments that in theory support the Swedish regional self-government. But what in theory is a strength, turns out to be a disadvantage in practice in the case of Swedish governance of healthcare. For ex - ample, the length of the waiting list for sur - gery or the availability of primary care is of - ten determined by the prioritisations made by the regional politicians. Regional elec - tions every four years may not be enough as an instrument to shorten the waiting list for hip surgery or to get access to the same doctor at each visit at the primary care. The regions' exchange of experiences, which in Sweden takes place through national clini - cal knowledge management, does not seem to bring Sweden any closer to the goal of the entire population having equal health - care. The healthcare regions face major challeng - es in the coming years. The rapid develop - ment of new advanced treatment methods and drugs in recent decades will not slow down. On the contrary, the demands on ex - pensive investments in medical technology equipment, new effective medicines and ap - propriate premises will continue to increase. In addition, the need to train and recruit staff with the skills to use the new high-tech equipment and to perform new advanced operations and treatments is increasing. An average Swedish region, except for the metropolitan regions, has approximately 260,000 inhabitants. These sparsely popu - lated regions are expected to maintain the same accessibility and quality of care as Stockholm, the capital region with more than 2 million inhabitants. This is very diffi - cult today and will be even more difficult in the future, considering the fact that urban - isation does not seem to diminish. Many regions are simply too small to cope with the heavy investments that are necessary to be able to provide healthcare in a rational, equal and patient-safe manner. The difficulty of recruiting staff with the right skills and getting the staff to stay and be content with their work environment is also an escalating problem and a challenge for the future in all parts of the country. Another key issue for the healthcare of the future concerns the conditions for re - search and innovation. Today's model with 21 regions does not facilitate research and innovation in Sweden. The collaboration between healthcare, universities and the in - dustry needs to be strengthened. In addition, it is not efficient to carry out digital development in 21 different ways. The fact that all Swedish regions have pro - cured different medical record systems does not facilitate the management of health - care. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed inequality in healthcare The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed several of the shortcomings in the current Swedish model of healthcare governance, including insufficient regional emergency stocks, the slow start of testing and weak - nesses in the care for the elderly in elderly homes. After the vaccinations started, the vaccination rate has shown to vary greatly between regions. Structural deficiencies in the care for the elderly According to the principle of liability, the person responsible for activity in normal situations has a corresponding operational responsibility in the event of a crisis. It is a simple principle in theory, but the more people that share the responsibility, the more difficult it will be to make the entire system work well in practice. In Sweden, the responsibility for healthcare and other care of the elderly is divided between the regions and municipalities. In many regions and municipalities, there are also a large number of private care providers. As early as 2017, the governmental inves - tigation \"National quality plan for care for the elderly\" [3] reported several shortcom - ings in how the care was organized for the elderly suffering from multiple diagnoses, reduced mobility and a failing social net - work. It was stated that there was a lack of interaction between inpatient care and pri - mary care as well as between primary care and elderly care, and nobody had overall responsibility. In June 2020, the government decided to appoint a Corona Commission with the task of evaluating the measures taken by the government, the administrative au - thorities, regions and municipalities to limit the spread of COVID-19 [4]. The Corona Commission's conclusions showed that al - most 90 % of the more than 7,500 of those who died in Sweden up to the beginning of December 2020, were 70 years and older, almost half of them lived in nursing homes (see Figure 1). The Commission's overall assessment stated that, in addition to the general spread of infection in society, the greatest impact on the number of infected and deceased due to COVID-19 within Violence in Healtcare BACK TO CONTENTS28 the Swedish elderly, was the well-known structural weaknesses. These weaknesses made the elderly care unprepared and ill- equipped to deal with a pandemic. Differences in vaccination rate Several Swedish government agencies have been responsible for different areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Swedish Medical Products Agency is re - sponsible for making decisions on the ap - proval of vaccines for COVID-19 but it is the Swedish Public Health Agency who is responsible for recommendations regarding which groups of the population should be vaccinated, and in which vaccination phase and also distributing the vaccines to the re - gions. This distribution to the regions was initially based on the proportion of elderly people living in the different regions. As later phases of the vaccinations for younger people started, other factors controlled the distribution. The healthcare services in the 21 regions in Sweden are responsible for carrying out all vaccinations. The COVID-19 vaccinations in the regions should have been conducted in accordance with the Swedish Public Health Agency's recommendations [5]. The regions had, however, different interpreta - tions on who should be vaccinated in which phase. For instance, individuals with a high - er risk of COVID-19 should according to the recommendations have been vaccinated in an earlier phase than their age suggests. However, one of the largest regions in Sweden decided to deviate from this rec - ommendation as they claimed it would be administratively too demanding [6]. After massive criticism, the region backtracked their decision, but this kind of back-and- forth information made public guidance and compliance to vaccinations more dif - ficult. Due to these kinds of alternate priorities, the last and final phase of the vaccinations, Figure 1 .

In ad - dition, the way the vaccinations could be booked also differed between the regions (e.g. booking app, phone, notice by mail). Thus, the vaccination coverage differs across the country (see Figure 2). Swedish healthcare needs reforms As previously mentioned, the problems of inequality in healthcare have existed in Sweden long before the pandemic: long waiting lists for treatment, poor acces - sibility and poor continuity between the doctor and patient. A recently published governmental investigation \"Increased conditions for sustainable investment projects in the healthcare of the future\" states that the pandemic has only clari - fied the problem that the different parts of Swedish healthcare infrastructure are not connected. For example, an ICU bed does not mean the same thing in all hospitals [7]. When an ICU patient needs to be moved in a criti - cal phase, the situation may arise that part of the care included in an ICU bed at one hospital is not included at another hospital. These differences also make it more difficult to borrow staff between hospitals in crisis situations. The hospital buildings also look different, different wards are located dif - ferently in relation to each other, medical equipment is of different brands, has differ - ent capacities and is not compatible. These differences were not created deliberately but unfortunately, they were not acknowledged by the hospitals until the pandemic revealed them. Today, approximately 120,000 patients are on the waiting list for surgery in Sweden. Half of them have waited over 90 days (more than the national \"care guarantee\" al - lows). For many, the waiting time is much longer. In Denmark, this problem does not exist at all, due to governmental control, economic incentives and significantly fewer regions. Danish patients almost always re - ceive care at \"their own hospital\" within 30 days. The Swedish people expect that the health - care of the future will function equally re - gardless of geographical and administrative boundaries. In a recent survey commissioned by the Swedish Medical Association [8], 64 percent of the public respondents answered that instead of the regions, the state should be responsible for healthcare. The Swedes think that today's healthcare system works poorly. With increased state governance, it is possible to get national coordination of the waiting lists and in this way offer pa - tients treatment more quickly in another part of Sweden than in their \"own region\". In the event of extreme situations, such as the pandemic, some of the healthcare staff could also be relocated according to the na- tional needs. The Swedish Medical Association calls on joint tax-financed healthcare with a variety of different kinds of care provid - ers. Private doctors and privately run units can also help to shorten the waiting list of the postponed care. But it must be the state and the state authorities that have overall responsibility for the governance of healthcare. The healthcare regions and their umbrella organisation SALAR have developed almost into a government agen - cy with a lot of power, even though the SALAR should only be an employer and lobby organisation for the municipalities and regions. To increase national governance, The Swed - ish Medical Association has developed a comprehensive 29-point action program in the wake of the pandemic. We believe that improved governmental control will even out the regional differences in healthcare and provide equally good care for the entire population, regardless of where in the coun - try one lives!References: 1. v\u00e5rdinfrastruktur (National interests in health care - strengthened state governance for sustainable care infrastruc - ture ).

Armenian Experience COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown in Armenia started in March 2020. The on - line survey was conducted on social plat - forms among the general population in May-June 2020 to identify stress levels and somatic expressions of mental health dis - orders. The survey indicates moderate and severe stress levels to be 40% and symp - toms of psychosomatic origin to be 20% among the survey population. On Septem - ber 27, 2020, Azerbaijan started a war in Nagorno-Karabagh (Republic of Artsakh). After the signed ceasefire agreement new survey was initiated and the preliminary analyses of the results showed a highly in - creased level of stress and psychosomatic manifestations. The World Association for Social Psychia - try [1] defines the COVID-19 pandemic as \"one of the most significant events since the Second World War\", which affected most countries in the world, regardless of their \"human development index\", which caused great social upheavals, an economic crisis and a host of social, psychological and health problems. One of the consequences of the pandemic was stress among the gen - eral public. Stress has become the content of the life of a modern person. Due to peri - odically recurring infections, wars and other disasters since the beginning of the 21st century, the escalation of the epidemic of COVID-19 infection into a pandemic and the accompanying socio-political upheavals, stress is increasingly becoming destructive in nature, causing serious problems in the personal, social, somatic and psychologi - cal existences of a person [2]. Not only the COVID-19 related changes in social life, such as lockdown and other restrictions were found to be the stress factors for the general public, but also the virus itself found to have an impact on the mental health of the infected. COVID-19 is a rather multi - faceted, multi-local disease, with far from clear dynamics and features; the causative agent of the disease (SARS-CoV-2 Corona - virus) can infect the brain, trigger immune responses, disrupt blood clotting, cause thrombosis of small vessels, further adverse - ly affecting the brain function and mental health of patients [3]. A whole series of works over the past less than a year has been devoted to mental health problems caused by Coronavirus infection [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In a study conducted in China among the popu - lation, more than half of the respondents re - ported moderate to the severe psychological impact. In the same study 16.5% and 28.8%, respectively, reported moderately severe de - pressive and anxiety symptoms [6]. The situation in Armenia was worsened by the Nagorno Karabakh conflict excavation and 44-day war that took lots of lives and had a huge impact on the mental health of Arme -nia and the Nagorno Karabakh population. This study aimed to identify the stress level and somatization level of mental health dis - orders of the Armenia population during the COVID-19 pandemic and Armenian- Azerbaijani war. Taking into account the situation of strict lockdown in the country it was not possible to survey people, thus the online platforms, namely through the Facebook social net - work was used for online survey. The on - line survey platform was designed consist - ing of several blocks: a socio-demographic block, standardized questionnaires to assess the mental state of the population and the level of stress severity. The PSM-25 Psy - chological Stress Scale [10] and question - naires for detection of asthenia, depression, hypochondria, somatization [9,11] were translated, pretested with back-translation. The participation was anonymous, on a voluntary basis. The survey could be inter - rupted at any time. The sample size with a confidence error of 95% and a margin of error of 5% was estimated to be 1,066.2. The first phase of the survey was conducted from May 12 to July 24, 2020. The second phase was initiated in November 2020 and is continued till now ( June 2021) to reach the necessary sample size. The data were processed and analysed by the IBM SPSS Statistics v.23.0 KhurshudyanARMENIA BACK TO CONTENTS31 Covid-19 Pandemic 1076 respondents took place in the survey. Among the survey participants, both men (509 or 47.3%) and women (487 or 45.3%) were approximately equally represented. 79 respondents (7.3%) did not indicate their gender. The age of the respondents varied within a fairly wide range - from 18 to 75 years, with the majority being between 18 and 40 years old (921 partici - pants- 85.7%). The marital status of the participants was calculated to 487 married (45%) and there were 471 unmarried par - ticipants (44%), and in general 588 people were single for the period of the survey (54.7%). The surveyed sample was char - acterized by a high level of education and employment. 779 people had higher edu - cation (72%), 45 people mentioned post - graduate education/scientific degree (4%) (see Graphic 1). 547 participants had per - manent employment (50.9%) and another 160 people (14.9%) introduced themselves as college and university students (see Graphic 2). Thus, 707 people (65.8%) had a permanent and main occupation. According to the PSM-25 Psychological Stress Scale, the respondents were found to have mild, moderate and severe psychological stress: 613 (57.0%), 215 (20.0%) and 210 people (19.6%) respectively (see Graphic 3). Over - all, 40% of the survey population identified to have moderate to severe levels of stress. The scale was ignored by 37 respondents (3.4%). It is interesting to note that the most stress-resistant were students and peo - ple with permanent employment. Together they made up 65.8% (707 people) of the surveyed population. The other factor con - tributing to the severe stress reactions is the presence of chronic disease. Among people with chronic somatic diseases (146 people, 13.6%), symptoms of severe stress were found among 27.4% of the respondents (40 people); in the group of somatically healthy people (929 people, 86.4%), only 18% (168 people) of respondents found symptoms of severe stress (see Graphic 4). Regardless of the severity of stress, the questioned population had symptoms of asthenic (489 people, 45.5%), depressive 72%24%4% Higher Education Student/No Education Sientic Degree Graphic 1 .

In general, the somatization on all three scales was identified among 268 re - spondents (24.9%). In the second phase of the survey, which was conducted after the Armenian- Azerbaijan war 2020, the pre - liminary data analyses showed that moder - ate and severe stress levels increased up to 60%. The data is not finalized, but even pre - liminary analysis shows that war added on COVID-19 related stress level and almost doubled stress level. The extensive data was subjected to statis - tical processing to understand all possible and impossible connections, correlations, dependencies between different types, levels, and severity of stress factors and other parameters, such as demographic and other features of the survey popula - tion. We hypothesised that possible psy - chopathological phenomena may be due to the severity of stress factors, personal - ity characteristics of the respondents, and some socio-demographic parameters. The development of stress occurs under the influence of both external environmen - tal factors and individual psychological and socio-demographic characteristics of the personality. Each individual functions quite specifically (despite a number of general, universal mechanisms) in a stress - ful situation due to personal peculiarities, characteristics of the situation, the severity of the trauma, its duration and intensity, etc. The following significant relationships were identified. To study the role and place of demographic parameters in this study, the T-Student method was used to imple - ment group comparisons and the method of more than two-group comparisons (One-way Anova). Gender characteristics of the response to extraordinary stressful influences in this study showed signifi - cant differences. Statistical analysis of the data identified that men and women show differences in the level of stress and hypo - chondria (t1985.4) = -2.094; p1 = 0.037; t2 (987) = 2.33; p2 = 0.02). Women have a higher level of stress (M = 92.41; SD = 39.175) and a low level of hypochon - dria (M = 3.39; SD = 2.974). The develop - ment of asthenia, depressive and hypochon - driacal manifestations (somatization) was related to a number of socio-demographic factors: education, social activity, disabil - ity, etc. Individuals with higher education (M = 4.9; SD = 3.659) found the lowest rate of depression, and the highest rate was found in people with secondary education (M = 5.87, SD = 3.697) and below (F (4, 1041) = 2, 49; p = 0.042). A similar pat - tern was revealed with respect to hypo - chondria - persons with higher education showed the lowest level of hypochondria (F (4, 1041) = 3.633; p = 0.006). The high level of education of the population con - tributes to an increase in stress resistance to traumatic effects, which contributes to lower rates of depression and hypochon - dria. The socially active group of respon - dents (students, working respondents) was least of all prone to somatic manifestations of mental health disorders. They had the lowest rates of asthenia, depression and hypochondria, while among pensioners, unemployed and unemployed these indi - cators were the highest. Thus, a low level of depression (M = 4.66; SD = 3.601) and hypochondria (M = 3.35; SD = 2.873), as well as . of somatized mental health disorders ARMENIA BACK TO CONTENTS33 Covid-19 Pandemic were detected in individuals with high social activity (F1 (5.1036) = 6.774, p = 0.000...; F2 F3 = 0.000, respectively for depression, hypochondria and asthe - nia). And low rates were found by pen - sioners and unemployed. Correlation that there is a pronounced positive relationship between the severity of stress and clini - cal manifestations of asthenia (r = 0.676 **, p = 0.000...), depression (r = 0.632 **, p = 0.000 ...) and hypochondria (r = 0.387 **, p = 0.000 ...). The important observa - tion that needs to be proved by statistical analysis is that a combination of the stress factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and war consequences could multiply the stress level of the general population. The results of the study indicated that in a \"non-clinical\", conditionally healthy popu - lation individuals are identified to express clinical signs of a neurotic level, both at the symptomatic and syndromic levels. The fre - quency of their detection under conditions of ongoing quarantine (possibly also in oth - er emergencies) will tend to increase, which is confirmed by the patterns of development we have identified. The real and probable possibility of a worsening epidemiological situation, like any other emergency, fraught with an increase in the level of stress, puts mental health problems at the level of na - tional security problems, requiring a state approach to solving these problems with the wide involvement of professional and nongovernmental organizations. Based on our research and taking into ac - count world experience, we consider it nec - essary to organize the following activities: To organize units for the provision of direct and remote psychological, psycho - therapeutic and psychiatric assistance. To organization psychiatric care and psychosocial recovery services at general somatic hospitals and in primary health care. To organize emergency psychological and psychiatric intervention groups, consist -ing of psychiatrists, experts in psychologi - cal interventions, social workers. To the creation of 24/7 psychological as - sistance hotlines. To establishment centres for an online survey of the population to collect infor - mation on the state of mental health and make recommendations on this basis. References 1.

[1] By 2020, three of these epidem - ics have been caused by the novel strains of beta coronaviruses and present like influen - za, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coro - navirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2]. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a coronavirus that caused an outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, in the Hubei Province of China; the disease progressively spread and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organiza - tion in March 2020. [3-6] COVID-19 trans - mission occurs through the contact or virus particles, from an infectious host to the mu - cous membrane of an individual at risk [7-10]. Epidemiological Reporting During Pandemics Epidemiological reporting (ER) is an im - portant tool in public health especially during any community health outbreaks such as epidemics and pandemics. Epide - miological reports are essential instruments for the rapid and accurate dissemination of epidemiological information on cases and disease outbreaks including other commu - nicable diseases of public health importance with emerging and re-emerging infections inclusive [11]. An epidemiological report contains information drawn from surveil - lance of a disease condition; this is because it provides an overview of the epidemiol - ogy of a disease of public health importance [12]. The systematic collection, collation and analysis of data with its dissemination to those who are in a position to take ac - tion is known as surveillance; Surveillance is important in the practice of public health [13, 14, 16]. It is necessary as it provides information about a disease according to person, time and place [17]. Reporting of surveillance is important for the development of strategies that address some specific health conditions [18]. Epidemiological reports aids in real-time planning, provision and evaluation of health care services during pandemics [19]. The COVID-19 pandemic has had many epide - miological reports from different countries since the beginning of the pandemic with the country releasing reports. Each country decides if its agency is authorized to devel - op and to release such reports deciding on the frequency at which the reports are re - leased [20]. There are challenges globally in the capacity for health institutions to pro - duces Epidemiological Reports consistently and accurately [20]. Literature has found that Low- and Meddle- Income countries predominately having the most challenges than higher-income countries [21]. Epi - demiological data are necessary to provide interventional strategies for the coronavirus disease outbreak [22]. Empathy during Pandemics with Focus on Epidemiological Reporting Empathy is an umbrella term that captures the range of responses of an individual to another individual's experience or an indi - vidual's ability to show concern to the feel - ing of others [23]. Undoubtedly, empathy remains critical to the quality Reporting with the Need for Patient Empathy During the COVID-19 Pandemic BACK TO CONTENTS35 Covid-19 Pandemic care, but the well-being of healthcare pro - fessionals cannot be neglected in the pro - cess too [24, 25]. Literature has found that the empathy at - tribute of health professionals becomes tried and sometimes be lacking in pan - demic circumstances [28, 29]. Even though individual choices are legally limited dur - ing epidemics and pandemics; it is also im - portant to ensure that human dignity is not eroded. Empathy and Epidemiological Reporting In COVID-19 The global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in - fection has led to the strengthening of the capacity and organization of public health institutions in rolling out daily statistical data [30]. However, ER doesn't have any empathetic component to assist in the planning of actions to address pandemics; the literature has shown direct or indirect negative effects of epidemiological report - ing and subsequent measures [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Indirect consequences of ER on patient empathy could stem from strict ad - herence to COVID-19 control measures and its negative effect on mental health. For instance, patients might get relatively lim - ited empathy as a result of healthcare pro - fessionals over-reliance on Telemedicine in response to ER guidance or healthcare pro- fessionals fear invasive medical procedures due to misinterpreting ER guidance [35]. ER has been found to have led to the isola - tion of the elderly from their support sys - tems which could have negative outcomes related to physical injuries or mental health conditions such as depression [36, 37]. There is a need for ER to have a component that addresses empathy in its reporting. This component will hopefully address the inclu - sion of empathy in the plans or activities of governments, institutions and healthcare professionals utilize to address health chal - lenges.References 1.

This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities [1]. Hospital-based services (HBS) are a vital component to a health system: they are an important endpoint in a health systems patient referral pathway and play a key role in supporting primary level health services [2]. Globally, HBS are a limited resource and the lower-income countries tend to have greater chal - lenges in HBS resource availability than the high-income countries [3]. There are on average only 113 hospital beds per 100,000 inhabitants in low-income countries less than half the number in other developing countries and around 80% below high-in - come countries [3]. The difficulty for coun - tries to achieve their HBS goals was further compounded on the 11th March 2020 when WHO declared that COVID-19 can be categorized as a pandemic [4]. Impact of COVID-19 on hospital-based services COVID-19 has posed serious challenges to health systems globally HBS being impact- Shiv Joshi Rujvee Patel Lwando MakiThe Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Hospital-Based Health Services BACK TO CONTENTS37 Covid-19 Pandemic ed [3]. Low-income, as well as high-income countries, are struggling to mitigate this outbreak and to efficiently manage and em - ploy health resources [3, 5]. The pandemic resulted in countries needing to alter their HBS with prioritization of services being reviewed; the result of the review was not the same for all countries and we shall look at the impact it had on HBS [6-9]. The number of ICU beds, ventilation devices, hospital admissions, and ICU admissions per day due to COVID-19 is found to be the important predictors of mortality in the USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany [10]. An urgent need to expand hospitals' infrastruc - ture and services and increase the produc - tion of devices used to treat patients with COVID-19 was emphasized [10]. COVID-19 resulted in countries mainly categorizing health services into essen - tial and non-essential health services [5]. Across the five WHO regions, 66% of re - sponding countries had defined essential health services to be maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic through a national policy or document [5]. However, almost 90% of the countries experienced disrup - tion of these services to some extent, with greater disruptions being reported in low- and-middle-income countries as compared to the high-income countries [5]. Fig - ure 1 illustrates that low to low-middle in - come countries had more disruption of ser - vice [5]. It was also found that the Eastern Mediterranean Region was the most affect - ed, followed by the African and the South- East Asia Regions while the services in the countries in the European and the Western Pacific Regions were the least affected [5]. The most frequently disrupted services in - cluded: routine immunization services - outreach services (70%) and facility-based services (61%), non-communicable disease diagnosis and treatment (69%), family plan - ning and contraception (68%), treatment for mental health disorders (61%), antenatal care (56%) and cancer diagnosis and treat - ment (55%) [5].Literature has found that there is a major burden of cancelled elective surgery due to the COVID-19 pandemic; there is a risk that delayed treatment can result in disease progression that can cause the patient sig - nificant disability, poor quality of life and possible death [11]. Stratified by specialty and indication (surgery for cancer versus benign disease The delay in treatment also has a significant impact on HBS as disease progression/complication can impact bud - get expenditures due to longer patient hos - pital stays and frequent use of HBS [12, 13]. Further, the role of political leaders and healthcare officials in ensuring that mini - mum resources are safely provided, includ - ing staff, hospital beds, and ICU is impor - tant [10]. The pandemic is an extraordinary situation that can affect parts of the world differently. The hospitals need to employ context-spe - cific resource allocation strategies in order to cope up with the urgent demand for healthcare services which should essentially lie within the constructs of the core ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non- maleficence and justice. The effect of such strategies can have long term implications in terms of strengthening of the health system. References 1. WHO.

Until June 6th 2021, the incidence of COVID-19 disease in Alba - nia was 4707.4 cases per 100000 inhabit - ants and the mortality was 85.6 deaths per 100000 inhabitants [2]. The first case of Covid 19 was diagnosed on March 8th 2020. The vaccination process started on Janu - ary 11th 2021 and continues at an acceler - ated rate throughout the target population. The vaccines BioNTech, Coronavac-Sinovac, Vaxzevria- Astrazeneca, Covishield-Astrazeneca and Gam-Covid-vac, effects were observed during the vac - cination process in the population receiving the vaccine [2]. The COVID-19 infection in Albania as well as in other countries has had epidemiologi - cal waves, with a peak in early autumn and January - March 2021 [2, 3, 4].

Figure 1.2 shows the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases for the period from week 10 of 2020 to week 22 of 2021. The daily average of new cases for week 22 of 2021 was 10.9 cases/day [2, 5]. The percentage of positivity in week 22 of 2021 was 0.4%. The distribution of cases by age group was as in figure 2. The high - est number of confirmed cases belongs to the age group 55-64 years with 21% of con - firmed cases, followed by the age group 45- 54 years with 17% of confirmed cases. It was noticed that the age group 65-74 years oc - cupied a considerable percentage of 14% [2]. Whereas figure 2.1 is presented the in - cidence according to age groups per 100 000 inhabitants.

Coverage of the target population with the first dose Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an article used to prevent the wearer from coming in contact with hazardous, infectious, chemical, radiological, electri - cal, and physical agents [1]. It is worn to protect health care workers or any other persons from getting infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed the following as PPE for the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19): Medical/surgical masks hereafter referred to as 'medical masks', Filtering facepiece respirators hereafter referred to as 'respirators', Gloves, goggles, face shields and gowns [2]. According to the WHO, masks are clas - sified broadly into two categories: medical and non-medical/fabric masks. The WHO defines a medical mask as a surgical or pro - cedure mask that is flat or pleated, affixed to the head with straps that go around the ears or head, or both [3]. They must block droplets and particles while at the same time they must also be breathable by allowing air to pass. Medical masks are regulated medical devices [3]. For the fabric masks, the WHO has recommended a three-layer composition: an inner layer of hydrophilic material, for ex - ample, cotton; a middle layer of polypropyl - ene spun bond hand-woven fabric material; and an outer layer of a hydrophobic material, for example, synthetic material [4]. Studies have shown that medical masks ef - fectively control respiratory virus transmis - sion in households and health care settings [5-9]. Studies of influenza, influenza-like ill - ness, and human coronaviruses (not includ - ing COVID-19) provide evidence that the use of a medical mask can prevent the spread of infectious droplets from an asymptomatic infected person (source control) to someone else and potential contamination of the envi - ronment by these droplets [5-7]. Therefore, medical masks are vital in the fight against viruses transmitted via respiratory droplets. On 11th March 2020, the WHO charac - terised COVID-19 as a pandemic [10]. Se - vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the strain of coronavirus Medical Masks and their Challenges during the COVID-19 Pandemic Clarence CONTENTS42 Covid-19 Pandemic that causes COVID-19, is transmissible via respiratory droplets, contact or aerosol [3]. The WHO advises using masks as part of a complete package of prevention and con - trol measures to curb the spread of SARS- CoV-2. Even when used correctly, a mask alone does not sufficiently provide adequate protection or source control [3]. Other infection prevention and control (IPC) measures include hand hygiene, the physical distancing of at least one metre, avoidance of touching one's face, respiratory etiquette, adequate ventilation in indoor settings, testing, contact tracing, quaran - tine, isolation and vaccination [3, 11] To - gether, these measures are critical to prevent human-to-human transmission of SARS- CoV-2 and serious illness or death from COVID-19 [3]. According to the WHO, in areas of known or suspected community transmission), uni - versal masking for all persons (staff, patients, visitors, service providers and others) within the health facility is recommended [3]. Like - wise, targeted continuous medical masking, the practice of mask-wearing by all health workers in clinical areas where patients are present, is advised [3]. Health workers pro - viding direct care to COVID-19 patients should wear a medical mask (in addition to other PPE). Where aerosol-generating procedures are performed, health work - ers should wear a respirator continuously throughout the entire shift [3]. The WHO further recommends that persons with any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and caregivers or those sharing living space with people with suspected COVID-19 should also wear a medical mask [3]. The wearing of non-medical masks in places where close gatherings are inevitable, like in work and school environments, as well as, maintain - ing good hand hygiene when handling the mask, is also advised. Those not supposed to wear a mask include children below two years, people with breathing problems, un - conscious, or anyone who cannot remove their mask by themselves [12]. Challenges Access to masks China is the leading manufacturer of masks in the world; it contributes about fifty per cent to global mask production [13]. The COVID-19 outbreak increased the demand for masks and resulted in a shortage in the worldwide supply [14-16]. The WHO esti - mated that 89 million medical masks were needed monthly to meet the global demand, requiring a forty per cent increase in pro - duction of the masks [17]. The shortage of masks caused by rising demand, panic buy - ing, hoarding and misuse put lives at risk from the new coronavirus and other infec - tious diseases [17, 18]. Low-resource coun - tries were the most affected, with healthcare professionals in public service not having masks and procuring them by their own means [13, 16, 17, 19-23]. Quality of masks Inadequate quality control standards for the manufacturing of masks have been reported in Asian [24, 25] and African countries. Various types of cloth masks (i.e. cotton/woven or gauze) are widely uti - lized in various healthcare settings in re - source-poor countries. In countries such as China and Vietnam, where the historical risk from emerging infections is high, the use of cloth masks by health care workers is widespread, despite that they are rarely mentioned in infection control policies and guidelines [21]. Cost of masks Globally, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost of masks has surged [3, 16, 26]. The cost increase occurred in both low and high-income countries with an increase of 319%, 220% and 600% in the United States, Russia and Nigeria, re - spectively [14, 15, 17, 20]. The high-cost impacts access to masks with the low- income countries being more affected [13, 16, 20, 27]. Use of masks The available literature has shown that in - correct usage of masks is substantial, with: 1. fabric mask used in health care set - tings; 2. medical masks used for longer periods than the recommended extended use policy; 3. the single-use mask being reused [23, 28]. This misuse leads to an increased risk of transmission of COVID-19 [14, 29, 30]; and is also associated with: 1. incorrect wearing techniques [23]. 2. the mask being a source of infection [3]; 3. poor comfortability and skin injury [3]. The use of a mask alone is insufficient to prevent COVID-19 infection. The imple - mentation of other social and hygienic be - haviours is also required [3, 9]. The literature has shown that stigma arises when mask- wearing is only for those with the disease or high risk. Therefore, universal masking also decreases stigma against COVID-19 posi - tive patients as all individuals wear a mask [28]. The global health community is still work - ing towards the goal of improved access and affordability of masks to help control the spread of COVID-19 [13, 15-17, 20]. It is an ethical responsibility for healthcare em - ployers to ensure medical masks are avail - able to all healthcare workers, irrespective of gender, age, socioeconomic status, race, religion, tribe, or sexual orientation [22, 31, 32]. The misuse and irrational use of the masks pose a danger to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Improper mask use does not prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the population; rather, it potentiates its spread, as well as, the spread of other disease conditions [28]. Individuals and or - ganizations must be trained and supported to assume responsibility in their use of the appropriate mask in the correct man - ner, as per their country's laws/regulations [28, 32].

Most of the predictions were based on the 2020 experience predictive models. Furthermore, the rate of infections seem to follow a seasonality pattern peaking be - tween June- July and Dec - Jan. Accord - ing to John Hopkins University, the current third wave appear to be at the same levels as the first two ( John Hopkins University, 17 June 2021) as depicted in figure 1 be - low. Various COVID variants that emerge across multiple countries that may impact the surge or COVID-19 indicate a possibil - ity of a 4th wave. A survey study conducted in Canada revealed that more than two-thirds of the participants reported concerns about the potential for a fourth [1]. The study has further shown that participants depicting those vaccines would mitigate the impact of any future surge. Another report in the United Kingdom (UK) illustrates that the rising cases of COVID-19 in Alberta and British Columbia could result in the fourth wave [2]. A recent report shows that Coun - tries like Italy are already experiencing the fourth wave. These few studies indeed depict that the fourth wave is undoubtedly on the near horizon, thus offering South Africa an opportunity to plan and prepare for the 4th wave and put measures in place for mid- December. Nearly half (47%) of the France population had been fully vaccinated as of 31 July 2021, relative to almost 5% (4.8%) in South Africa, as depicted in figure 3 below. France in the early window of the 4th wave, further illustrating a possibility in South Af - rica. Preparedness also entails putting pro - cesses and standards in place, and recently a Bill was approved in France to tackle the fourth wave [3]. Countries could certainly use experiences from others to prepare for what is imminent, and critical learnings could be derived from interventions that did not work in the previous waves. COVID-19 Vaccination Drive Various reports have depicted a surge in COVID-19 cases in some countries as the global demand for vaccines increases. Many countries have also set targets to achieve herd immunity, with some countries per - forming better than others. South Africa accounts for a significant proportion of Af - rican COVID-19 infections and deaths (un - adjusted for population). Figure 2 below de - picts that as of 30 July 2021, South Africa had recorded a total of 2.4 million lives infected by COVID-19 disease, and nearly 72 000 had succumbed to COVID-19. Comparison figures for Morocco are 616 000 lives and about 10 000 deaths, respectively [4]. Figure 2 further depicts that South African is al - ready on the third wave while a country like Morocco is still into the second wave with a fully vaccinated population of 27.4% com - pared to 4.8% in South Africa (see figure 3 below). However, what is also unique about South Africa is the number of tests con - ducted which are relatively high compared Covid-19 Fourth and Subsequent Waves-Readiness and Preparedness Michael Mncedisi Willie Sipho Kabane Figure 1 . South African Covid-19: third wave chart Source: John Hopkins University, 17 June 2021 BACK TO CONTENTS45 Covid-19 Pandemic to other African countries (unadjusted). The recent data indicates that South Africa has achieved lower herd immunity as of 30 July compared with neighbouring countries like Zimbabwe and Botswana. Comparatively speaking, Morocco has acquired higher herd immunity, with nearly thirty percent of its population fully vaccinated. Morocco is also the hardest hit in Africa, with the second- highest number of infections after South Africa (unadjusted). Table 1 below depicts key learnings from Morocco. Types of Vaccines Approved in South Africa and Morocco According to track vaccines, South Africa has six ongoing COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, while in Morocco, there is one clinical trial running [13]. Both countries have four approved vaccines, with the Serum Institute of India - Covishield (Oxford/AstraZen - eca formulation) the only common vaccine in the two countries. The following section depicts a comparison analysis of the types of Vaccines approved in two countries with the highest numbers of COVD-19 cases. The two countries also demonstrate evidence of capacity to manufacture vaccines. Strategies to Prevent the Surge The case studies of South Africa and Mo - rocco depicted in the previous section il - lustrate that despite massive strategies and drive for vaccinations, each country utilis - ing its four types of approved vaccines. Evi - dence presented also shows that even high herd immunity levels in countries such as Morocco are nearly twice that of China at 27.4% vs 15.5%, respectively (figure 3), the numbers continue to rise. Herd immunity Literature and medical experts depict that the purge of the COVID19 epidemic can Figure 2 . COVID-19 Key statistics for South Africa and Morocco as of 30 July 2021 [11] Table 1 . Morocco COVID-19 Vaccine's strategy- [5] Strategy employed Interventions Optimal use of technology\"Any citizen or resident is automatically assigned to the nearest vaccination centre using its digitised identity card number, unlike South Africa where vaccination is carried out in only 18 hospitals and is based on a pre- vaccination registration and appointment system [6, 7].\" Anticipation and preparednessWith anticipations and preparedness of what was reported elsewhere regarding vaccines demand, \"As early as August 2020, Morocco became one of the first countries procure vaccines and placed orders [8].\". In January 2021, the country confirmed orders of 65 million doses of vaccines: British AstraZeneca - 25 million doses and Chinese Sinopharm - 40 million doses. Furthermore, the country announced an agreement with Russia to deliver 8 m doses of the Sputnik vaccine. [9] Mass communication strategy\"In August 2021, the health ministry deployed a large communications campaign to provide information, reassure and encourage people to get vaccinated [10].\" Early identification of vulner- able groups and populations at risk - use health insurance files to identify patients with chronic conditions.\"The country was proactive in early identifying vulner- able groups and population at risks such as the elderly and employed measures to reach these population people and others who live in rural areas, for example, are informed directly at their homes by social workers.\" BACK TO CONTENTS46 Covid-19 Pandemic be achieved with a herd immunity of be - tween 50%-60% through a vaccine [16]. Kleczkowski estimates that 75% of the population will need to be vaccinated to ac - quire a herd immunity level of 67%, assum - ing a vaccine efficacy of 90% [17]. Evidence suggests that herd immunity level needs to be pushed up as high as 86%. Studies have shown varying efficacy levels across vac - cines, and as depicted in the previous il - lustration, a combination of more than one approved vaccine in countries will still face many challenges in demonstrating effec - tiveness with their level of herd immunity. Kleczkowski further warns that even with higher immunity levels in high efficacy vac - cines might not eradicate the pandemic. \"If a vaccine is only 50-70% effective, as the Oxford and Sinovac vaccines appear to be, this is the highest herd immunity level that can be achieved if everybody gets the vaccine. Even with the higher efficacy of the Pfizer and Mod - erna vaccines, vaccinating nearly 90% of the population will be very difficult, as not every - body can or will want to be treated.\" [18] Table 3 below depicts other challenges that many countries likely face with a combina - tion of vaccines with varying efficacy levels. Uncertainties on the emergence of new variants, non-adherence to non-pharma - ceutical interventions principally continue to impact the surge. Containment and Mitigation Strategies There is evidence that the numbers surge exponentially as soon as there is a relaxation on this measure. Stricter standards and poli - cies such as lockdown, non-pharmaceutical efforts are effective in flattening the curve. Ferguson et al. showed the impact of self- isolation in reducing influenza by 10%, and the authors further showed the effective - ness of using a combination of measures such as school and workplace closures, ad - equate border controls, and others to an ef - fectiveness rate high as 70% [20]. Another study by Brauner et al. found that closing all educational institutions, limiting gatherings to 10 people or less, and closing face-to- face businesses each reduced transmission considerably. The additional effect of stay- at-home orders was comparatively small [21]. Figure 4 below in a study conducted by Haung, Geyrhofer, Londei et al. showed small gathering cancellation, closure of education institutions, border restrictions, mass gathering cancellation and increased Table 2 .

(2020) BACK TO CONTENTS48 Healthcare Myanmar is a developing country in South East Asia with a population of 54 mil - lion people representing over 130 ethnic groups. Myanmar's journey to democracy began barely a decade ago, with the mili - tary dictatorship that had been in control since 1962 finally relinquishing power and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi being released from house imprison - ment [1]. On February 1, 2021, at predawn, the Myanmar military and security forces con - ducted an unlawful and unconstitutional military coup. President U Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and several elected ministries and MPs were detained by the military [2]. Despite grow - ing sorrow and fury, calls for anti-coup pro - tests went viral within hours of the coup, including on social media and the internet [3]. Throughout history, doctors operating under dictatorships have committed crimes against humanity with or without their will. In the historic Nuremberg Physicians' Trial, Nazi doctors were imprisoned and executed for war crimes and crimes against human - ity for conducting medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners, as well as euthanasia and other executions on follow - ing orders from the dictator [4]. The Myan - mar doctors also witnessed how Myanmar's military rule fuels poverty, weakens health systems and contributes to poor health outcomes over semi-centennial. Myanmar doctors have firsthand knowledge of the former military regime's devastation of the country's healthcare system and viola - tions of human rights. It is apparent that Myanmar's democratic government, led by the State Counsellor, is attempting to re - organize in the five years she has been in office [5]. As fresh hope from neglect of the health sector to mending of the health system was crushed by the military takeover, Myanmar junior doctors debated what they might do to halt the coup in the best interests of patients. Junior doctors, nurses, and health care professionals led the resis - tance through the Civilian Disobedience Movement (CDM) on February 3, 2021, declaring that they would not accept any instructions from the illegal military dic - tatorship, which has proven that they have no respect for our impoverished patients [6]. Following the Physician Pledge, they provide emergency care to the people through charity clinics and private clinics at no cost, or some major surgical proce - dures at reduced fees with the help of well- wishers, while closing down medicine and nursing universities, hospitals, and clinics under military control [7]. Myanmar CDM junior doctors and health care professionals also engage with general practitioners, charity ambulance providers, and local non-governmental organizations to continue delivering HIV and other chronic illness treatments via teleconsultation, home visits, and charity clinics [8]. Myanmar doctors and patients were largely secure until the bloodiest day since the coup, which triggered regular anti-military protests and demanded the release of elected government officials and legislators. At the end of February, the military and security forces used live and rubber bul - lets, tear gas, and water cannon to disperse protestors around the nation and have killed, including shooting protesters dead in the streets and have laid siege to entire towns, with severe torture [9]. Private clin - ics, charity makeshift clinics, medical staff providing emergency care, and ambulances have been shot at for no apparent cause, with doctors jailed and others leaving their homes to avoid the military dictatorship. The World Medical Association (WMA) condemns the harassment and imprison - ment of doctors in Myanmar on February 24, 2021 [10]. At the end of February, the situation has worsened. If the junior doctors were able to set up a charity base, the military could easily demolish it. The security forces watched the doctor's whereabouts and ac - tions, which resulted in the quick closure of the charity clinics and the doctor's mi - gration from one location to another, de - livering services at deserted medical facili - ties across the country. Junior doctors have set up mobile clinics around the nation to treat the ill and injured during protests, but the main concern is not to get shot when delivering care on the ground. When it came to killing individuals, the military made no distinction between whether the doctors wore badges and uniforms or not. Junior doctors and health care profession - als are putting their lives in danger to pro - Wunna TunHow Myanmar Doctors Taking Care of Patients under Heavy Fire in the Time of COVID-19 and Military CoupMYANMAR BACK TO CONTENTS49 Healthcare vide life-saving treatment to protesters and the people of Myanmar [11]. The WMA and its members are deeply troubled by the military and security forces harassing, ar - resting, kidnapping, and killing health care professionals. At the April WMA Council Meeting in Seoul, the WMA and the National Medi - cal Associations (NMAs) reviewed the situation in Myanmar. WMA published a council resolution in support of Medical Personnel and Citizens of Myanmar at the 217th Council Session in Seoul, April 2021, to immediately cease assaults on health per - sonnel and medical facility and secure their security to offer appropriate health care provisions to everyone [12]. The increase of attacks against doctors continues, and junior doctors are being detained at night or apprehended during the day. The junior doctors could not treat patients openly as previously, move among their places every month, hide, consider the patient first, and treat following the Physi - cian Pledge [13]. There is no assurance that young doctors will be secure because their names have been revealed and they are be - ing watched by the security forces. Before the coup, the State Counselor secured 3.5 million vaccinations from India for the Myanmar people. The junta took control of the majority of the vaccine injections but rejected plans to prioritize vaccines for the elderly, and the doses were used to vacci - nate soldiers. Due to the military's refusal to share details about its immunization pro - gram, Covax, the worldwide vaccine-shar - ing organization, postponed a shipment of 5.5 million doses in March. In Myanmar, where the Myanmar military controls immunization, the third wave of COVID-19 began in June 2021 [14]. The military junta has prohibited commercial suppliers from selling oxygen to the public. Furthermore, the junta has ordered charity oxygen supply groups to stop giving essen - tial oxygen to individuals in need, as well as denying oxygen supplies to private and charity clinics. COVID-19 infections have also made their way into prisons, particu - larly those harbouring anti-coup protestors [15]. The military has rejected COVID-19 patients at military-run medical facilities, leaving scared locals to self-treat at home. When people do travel to the hospital, they have frequently turned away because the facilities are short of oxygen, treatments, and beds. The security forces opened fire on individuals queued up for oxygen cyl - inders for their ailing families, and oxygen was being funnelled to the military hos - pitals [16]. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and oxygen were seized for exclusive military use, and vaccinations provided by India were hoarded for exclusive military use. Doctors had been arrested for provid - ing vaccinations in remote regions, and nu - merous individuals had died at home from COVID-19, resulting in long queues at crematoria. The Myanmar dictatorship has turned coronavirus into a weapon by restricting access to treatment, which amounts to \"weaponizing COVID-19 to destroy its opponents\" [17]. Desperate family mem - bers browse social media groups and en - crypted smartphone applications every day in quest of oxygen supply for their loved ones. The phrases \"urgent,\" \"emergency,\" and \"please assist me\" kept appearing in a never-ending stream of frantic texts. Doc - tors forced to flee to avoid imprisonment have re-established underground networks of clinics and teleconsultation services for COVID-19. Every day, they respond to thousands of inquiries from COVID-19 patients and patient attendants via appli - cations, social media, and video channels to reach the people. They worked diligently all day and night to provide quality care, responding to urgent messages on encrypt - ed smartphone applications or providing video consultations [18]. Many Myanmar physicians, nurses, and their families have died as a result of COVID-19 due to a lack of oxygen in the current third wave, and the number is steadily increasing. Social media looks to be a condolence site, as it is packed with funeral announcements of health professionals and their parents [19]. In addition, doctors in Myanmar who are treating patients infected with the coro - navirus are being detained. Doctors have independently made free house visits to assist people sick with the critical Coro - navirus to preserve the patient's life, de - spite the danger of being imprisoned. The military and security personnel enticed the doctors to a residence by claiming to be critical COVID-19 patients in need of urgent medical treatment and then arrest - ed them upon arrival, while the military stormed the doctor's offices and arrested the doctors [20]. Doctors are revered and safeguarded, even during times of war without being arrested. No country in the world has jailed its physicians for saving the lives of COVID-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are being murdered, injured, or abducted; charity and makeshift clin - ics are being destroyed or damaged, and medical equipment is being taken; as a re - sult, the military has violated the Geneva Conventions willingly and committed a crime against humanity [21]. The junta's attack on Myanmar's healthcare system and healthcare professionals was under - mining the right to health. As there is no meaningful action to stop military junta by the international community but by offer - ing rhetorical responses, there is no more option left for Myanmar, National Unity Government and People of Myanmar de - clared war against the military on 7th Sep- tember 2021 to restore collapsed health care and democracy in Myanmar [22]. More than 200 health professionals have been imprisoned in the eight months since the military coup, and thousands of profes - sionals have had their medical licenses and passports revoked. There is catastrophic af - fliction on medical personals in terms of mental and physical breakdown due to fac - ing dual enemies of Myanmar. In amidst all Myanmar's darkness and gloom, beams of MYANMAR BACK TO CONTENTS50 light and hope may be found in the doc - tors' perseverance and togetherness. How - ever, Myanmar junior doctors and health care workers are continuing to doing their utmost to save patients' lives and others in need how dire and dangerous the situation has become, risking their own lives of being killed, tortured or abducted from human adversaries - merciless military junta and the covid19 infection.

Wunna Tun, MBBS, MD Fellow in Medical Education Myanmar Secretary, JDN, World Medical AssociationHealthcare MYANMAR BACK TO CONTENTS51 Background Determinants of public health are complex and depend on factors such as social infra - structure, political stability, economic devel - opment and most importantly, availability of an appropriate and accessible health ser - vice through well-trained providers. Universal health coverage is realized when everyone has access to quality essential healthcare services with financial risk pro - tection. The primary public health goal of developing countries like Ethiopia is im - proved quality of care, increased service utilization and better health outcomes, and improvement of the health workforce efficiency is important in that regard. This approach, however, is one that Ethiopia has struggled to achieve. In 2019, the universal health service coverage index in the country was still very low at 39% [1]. To achieve universal health coverage, it is essential to ensure the quality as well as the sustainability of the health workforce, through regulation of education and prac - tice mechanisms. In Ethiopia, these regula - tory mechanisms and resources are under stress due to a mismatch between health professional education, public healthcare and speciality field demands, as well as in - creased international mobility by health professionals. The Dilemma Career Preference and Starved Specialty Fields Health workforce education and training is a complex investment, along the intersec - tion of educational systems, labour market policies, and translational public health im - pact. [2, 3] These challenges remain a cru - cial bottleneck in achieving universal health coverage in low and middle-income coun - tries. In Ethiopia, medical training is rather dis - connected from the needs of the health sys -tem and that of the public at large. Efforts are continuously being made to bridge the gap between the supply of well-qualified physicians and the ever-increasing de - mand for their services. One such effort is the \"flood and retain\" strategy, rolled out by the Ministry of Health to strengthen the healthcare system by expanding phy - sician training. The enforcement of this policy has been an attempt to address the health demands of the public by encourag - ing meaningful change in the number of available professionals at all levels [4, 5, 6]. This was done through medical training unit expansion and subsequent large in - put of trainees with currently more than thirty recognized and operating medical schools, including private institutions, in the country. The overwhelming number of physician output that followed the implementa - tion of this strategy, however, was not able to provide a satisfactory interface in line with balanced accommodation between universal health coverage and job creation. Ethiopia's Medical Talent Dilemma: Lessons Learned and The Way Forward Surafel Jenerit Hadush Beza SeleshiHealthcare ETHIOPIA BACK TO CONTENTS52 This in turn has left room for the skewed distribution of skill sets and health profes - sionals with inclination to a specific area of speciality and place of practice, leaving the healthcare demand of the vast majority of the population unmet. A 2015 study [3] done on final year medi - cal students and interns, found that 70.1% of its participants showed intent to practice clinical medicine in an urban setting, with 76% gravitating towards internal medi - cine and surgery. The inclination towards these fields, and the neglect of paediatrics and gynaecology, is at clear odds with the healthcare needs of the population given the country's maternal and neonatal/child mortality status [7]. The study also found income potential (42%) to be a factor that significantly affected students' field and placement choices. In addition to prestige, the intent to work in urban settings is also rooted in the reality that very few students from rural households reach higher educa - tion, causing a further impediment to uni - versal health coverage by skewing the pool of professionals willing to work in rural set - tings [8]. Talent Exodus Ethiopia has a healthcare workforce ra - tio of 0.7/1000 against the WHO ratio of 2.3/1000 which is recommended as the ideal imperative for health coverage and impactful healthcare interventions [4]. Despite the implementation of the \"flood and retain\" strategy to mitigate this, the country still continues to suffer physician shortage through the mass exodus from the country, impeding progress toward the attainment of universal health cov - erage [4]. Reasons for health migration from the Sub-Saharan region in general, and Ethiopia in particular, have been summarized as an absence of adequate professional support and development, inadequate financial incentive, and de - sire for professional prestige and respect that are better fulfilled in other nations [9, 10]. Reports have shown that Ethiopia remains one of the countries with the highest phy - sician emigration in Sub-Saharan Africa, with significant intent shown by medical students to emigrate within 5-10 years of graduation [11]. It must also be noted that, while emigration continues to be the main reason that talent continues to bleed out of the country, physicians leave public service to better-paying jobs in NGOs and the pri - vate sector [12]. A study [11] done on medical students re - ported that 53% of its participants indicated an aspiration to emigrate following gradu - ation, with such an attitude predominantly prevalent among final year students and in - terns. This same pattern of intent was also shown to be more prevalent among students in clinical training than their preclinical counterparts, which stands as an indication of factors in clinical years that significantly affect students' need to emigrate. Compared to other professional areas, the medical profession appears to be the most susceptible to emigration owing to the in - creasing demand for health professionals in the developed world that offer better pay, better living conditions, and a better work - ing environment. Educating medical pro - fessionals is an expensive enterprise for any developing country, and through a conser - vative estimate, it has been shown that close to 30.000 USD is lost for every Ethiopian medical school graduate who emigrates [4, 10, 11, 13]. As it stands, the 'flood' has done more to flood the needs of other nations and has inadvertently negated the very aim it was established to achieve. Strike and the Paradox that Ensued In May 2019, a nationwide strike was ani - mated by medical interns of several teach - ing hospitals protesting against the long hours of work, little pay, substandard work - ing conditions, and limited employment and career advancement opportunities, with a call for leniency in license and de - gree acquisition, and healthcare insurance [14, 15]. Among the demands, the issue of employ - ment was met with an uncalled-for conse - quence as the Ministry of Health lifted its central responsibility of assigning physi - cians to health facilities across the country. The central deployment freeze shifted the mandate of hire to regional and city admin - istration health bureaus, opening doors to corruption and nepotism, and leaving grad - uates with the only option of seeking em - ployment for themselves. This outcome has put the country in a state of paradox: a na - tion whose healthcare needs are unmet, and medical professionals are unemployed. As it remains, there is no estimate of the amount of unemployed general practitioners at this time, and/or an estimate of its impact on the unaddressed healthcare needs of the public [14, 15]. COVID-19 Pandemic and Current Reality As the pandemic continued to wreak havoc in its health systems, the Ethiopian gov - ernment responded to the low healthcare professional-to-population ratio by bring - ing on unemployed practitioners in rapid response and treatment teams through con - tract and volunteering agreements. While such an arrangement came at a great loss for practitioners, it still failed to address the needs of most treatment centres, especially those in peri-urban and rural areas, as phy - sicians left posts due to substandard work - ing conditions and compensations. Unemployed practitioners who did not choose this path now find themselves in a predicament: contemplating exile, or ex - ploring other professional avenues far from their expertise. Healthcare ETHIOPIA BACK TO CONTENTS53 Conclusion and Call to action Needless to say that, neither the healthcare needs of the population nor the needs of the medical students and graduates have been addressed. A starting point for recon - ciliation towards universal health coverage can be the placement of medical graduates to proportionally address the healthcare workforce. As medical education directly impacts public health and the quality of healthcare, it must base its framework on the needs of the health system and the public. Longitudinal analyses are warranted to address healthcare demands with priority set on understanding students' preference, placement choice, attitude towards training and future practice of clinical medicine for evidence-based mitigation efforts. In addi - tion, beyond local training, investments in students and graduates from rural areas, to address the high population concentration and health demand in those areas are called for. Since the existing curricular policy has been employed aggressively toward increasing healthcare professionals through the 'flood', a parallel amount of work on the 'retain' to prevent further hindrance of health care eq - uity, is an imminent necessity. Policy review of regulatory frameworks, management and information systems for health human re - sources are needed to create a system that is able to meet the current and future needs of health professionals, and that of the popula - tion. Statistical updates on the areas of emigra - tion and unemployment are also mandated. Through emigration, in addition to the loss of significant investment of public funds made for medical training, subsequent criti - cal contributions to the improvement of health systems are lost as well. In that re - gard, improvements in retention incentives, employment, professional development and career advancement opportunities, and ad -dressing administrative inefficiencies and corrupt practices in the system are warrant - ed interventions.

Accessed Star Metropolis Clinical Laboratories Beza Seleshi M.D., San Diego State UniversityHealthcare ETHIOPIA BACK TO CONTENTS54 Healthcare Industry The COVID-19 pandemic posed a huge challenge to healthcare systems. The new healthcare demand accelerated the conver - gence of new technologies, medical tech - nology innovation and application across boundaries. A large number of new tech - nologies and products have emerged in the field of clinical engineering, and the appli - cation of related technologies and products have been greatly accelerated. We reviewed the hot topics and the progress of technol - ogy management in the field of clinical engineering. With the guidance of the rel - evant policies issued by relevant ministries and commissions in 2020, the opinions on the important progress in this field in 2020 were collected by the Chinese Soci - ety of Clinical Engineering of the Chinese Medical Association. We collected all kinds of guidelines and norms formulated annu - ally by clinical engineering societies, qual - ity control centres and clinical engineering departments in various provinces and cities. At the same time, we gathered experts' con - sensus and formed the annual ten research progress events report in the field of clini - cal engineering, which may help the medi -cal technology industry and the healthcare organizations to grasp the future develop - ment direction in the field of clinical en - gineering. 1 . Prepares and applies Infection Control Technology Plan for Medical Equipment and Medical Supplies Use Guide for Global Epidemic Prevention The COVID-19 coronavirus is character - ized by rapid transmission, wide infection range and great difficulty in prevention and control. For major public health emergen - cies, clinical engineering, as one of the four pillars of healthcare delivery organizations, working together with physicians and clini - cians, nurses and pharmaceutists, shoulders the shared responsibility. And clinical en - gineering departments of healthcare deliv - ery organizations across the country have worked out various emergency prepared - ness schemes [1]. The Chinese Society of Clinical Engineering of the Chinese Medi - cal Association and its provincial Clinical Engineering Branches gave full play to the advantages of the experts nationwide, and quickly organized a series of online meet - ings to discuss and reach consensus [2]. The topics covered the emergency classification scheme of epidemic prevention materials, emergency management of medical equip - ment and emergency technical standards, etc., which made important contributions to the formulation of standardized pro - cedures and emergency response plans in epidemic prevention and control for public health emergencies. In February 2020, the Clinical Engineering Branch of Shanxi Medical Association is - sued the Guidance for Medical Equipment Cleaning and Disinfection during the Pre - vention and Control Period of COVID -19 in Shanxi Province. The guidance included the safe use of CT, MR, DSA, X-ray ma - chine, ultrasound equipment, ventilator, monitor, infusion pump and defibrillator, as well as the prevention and control plan of cleaning and disinfection for these nine Li BinT op 10 Progress Events in Clinical engineering in China in 2020 Zheng Kun Chu ChengchenCHINA BACK TO CONTENTS55 Healthcare Industry types of equipment. In February, the Clini - cal Engineering Branch of Jilin Medical Association, together with Jilin Medical Imaging Quality Control Center, orga - nized experts in the fields of clinical engi - neering, imaging, metrological testing and standardization, and led the formulation of the Technical Specifications for Mutual Recognition and Sharing of Medical Im - aging Examination for Epidemiological Prevention and Control. In March, Guang - dong Medical Equipment Management and Quality Control Center organized ex - perts to formulate the Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Medical Device Emer - gency Support and Quality Control dur - ing COVID-19 Prevention and Control in Guangdong Province [3]. In April, accord - ing to the requirements of the joint preven - tion mechanism of the three provinces and one city in the Yangtze River Delta Re - gion, the medical equipment quality con - trol centres of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui jointly formulated the Guiding Opinions on the Quality Control of Medi - cal Equipment in the Yangtze River Delta Region during the Prevention and Control of COVID-19[4]. The guidance opinions included suggestions on the configuration of medical equipment in the fever clinic and guidance on the emergency modifi - cation of isolation gown. In September, clinical engineering at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine published the Guidance Manual for the Application of Personal Protec - tive Equipment for Respiratory Infectious Diseases. This book introduces COVID-19 PPE management and use experience of five categories namely face protection, re - spiratory protection, body protection and foot protection, and nearly one hundred kinds of protective materials in total col - lected from all over the world, their identi - fication, classification, and evaluation. The book summarizes and compares relevant PPE standards and principles both at home and abroad, combined with bench test and evaluation puts forward suggestions for PPE selection and use.2 . New Policies on the management of medical supplies accelerated the application and promotion of medical device technology evaluation With the strengthening of national man - agement on the use of medical supplies in hospitals, health technology assessment for hospital medical technology, especially medical supplies and consumables, is being promoted in China. In 2020, the Institute of Hospital Management of the National Health Commission and its clinical en - gineering laboratory conducted a project, which combines evidence-based informa - tion at home and abroad with hospital consumables management experience and reviews from the haemostatic materials clas - sification and selection, specification, use evaluation, supervision and outcome, and formulates the expert consensus for haemo - static materials management. In 2020, the Chinese Society of Clinical Engineering of Chinese Medical Association organized an interdisciplinary expert group, taking antimicrobial sutures as an example, and cooperated with professional health eco - nomics research institutions to carry out the relevant health technology evaluation. By researching from the perspectives of safety, effectiveness, economy and sociality, this project generates a value evaluation report of antimicrobial sutures [5]. It has been issued in many regions of the country and provides an important reference for the management of other kinds of medical consumables. 3 . Clinical engineering's participation and contribution to the region-wide evaluation and demonstration of digital diagnosis and treatment equipment In recent years, some of China's leading academic clinical engineering departments have made great breakthroughs in par - ticipating in the national key research and development projects of digital diagnosis and treatment equipment sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology. The clinical engineering departments of more and more medical institutions, such as Chi - na-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong Uni - versity Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital [6], Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Hospital, and the First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, have presided over or partici - pated in the digital diagnosis and treatment equipment evaluation and demonstration projects to establish a batch of digital diag - nosis and treatment equipment evaluation system for large medical equipment such as radiography, magnetic resonance, ultra - sonic diagnosis and radiotherapy. In 2020, the Institute of Hospital Management of the National Health Commission set up ten clinical engineering research bases na - tionwide, aiming to further promote the research and talent training in the field of clinical engineering in China, to support the development of healthcare and medi - cine, and to enhance the scientific research ability and influence of clinical engineering departments. 4 . Pilot application of medical device unique identification (UDI) technology in-hospital medical device management The International Medical Device Regu - lators Forum (IMDRF) issued the UDI Guidelines in December 2013, marking the beginning of the global implementa - tion of UDI. At the end of 2019, the Na - tional Medical Products Administration in China issued the Notice on the First Batch of Implementation of the Unique Labeling of Medical Devices, and various provinces CHINA BACK TO CONTENTS56 and cities across the country organized several medical institutions to launch the pilot program. UDI, as the electronic ID of medical devices, is the link and bridge connecting the hospital with management departments at all levels and external en - terprises [7]. It is the basis for the full life cycle supply chain management of medi - cal devices within the hospital, and the key role for realizing the standardization and lean management of medical devices in the hospital. 108 hospitals, such as the General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, as the first batch of pilot units, have continuously improved and optimized their medical supplies manage - ment structure within the hospitals, devel - oped and upgraded the information system related to medical supplies, and explored the construction of a UDI-based whole life cycle management system [8]. It realizes the bidirectional traceability management of medical consumables supply and use in the hospital as well as the unification and standardization of basic logistics informa - tion both inside and outside the hospital. 5 . The COVID-19 epidemic accelerated the use of telemedicine technologies The COVID-19 epidemic had accelerated the explosive growth and widespread ap - plication of telemedicine. The telemedicine support has been increased significantly in various countries, including the coverage by more and more health insurance programs. Social acceptance of telemedicine is rapidly spreading as well. The service volume of tele - medicine has increased greatly, the related technologies and industry are also develop - ing rapidly, and the role of clinical engineer - ing in it has been further recognized [9] [10]. On February 7th, 2020, China National Health Commission released a document about promoting the internet medical con - sultation service during epidemic prevention and control and strengthening its manage - ment. Hundreds of hospitals opened their relevant online service accordingly. Over the same period last year, the number of online diagnoses and treatment in all hospitals of China's National Health Commission in - creased by 17 times. The number of medical consultations on some third-party internet service platforms increased by more than 20 times and the number of online prescrip - tions increased by nearly 10 times. 6 . Chinese Society of Clinical Engineering hosts Medical Device Innovation Competition to promote the innovation and application of clinical engineering In response to the call for scientific and technological innovation in China, the Chinese Society of Clinical Engineering of the Chinese Medical Association (CSCE) gave full play to the advantages of clinical engineering to promote the innovation and application of the medical device in China. Since 2019, the Clinical Engineering Soci - ety of Chinese Medical Association has co - operated with Henan Tuoren Medical De - vice Group Co., Ltd to jointly carry out the \"Tuoren Medical Device Technology Inno - vation Competition\" in clinical engineering nationwide for two consecutive years. \"Tuo - ren Medical Device Technology Innovation Award\" was a national science and tech - nology award approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the State Office for Science and Technology Awards in January 2011. From 2019 to 2020, with the strong support of clinical engineering chapters of medical associations and medical institutions in all provinces, the \"TuoRen-Medical Device Science and Technology Innovation\" com - petition had been actively responded and enthusiastically participated by more than 500 clinical engineering staff and clinicians in 25 provinces and autonomous regions. In two years, a total of 345 medical device innovation projects were collected, among which 229 were product research and devel - opment projects and 116 were innovation management projects. After the submit - ted project passed the project evaluation of each province, it would be recommended to participate in the National Tuoren Medical Device Science and Technology Innovation Contest, and the winning project will be selected by national experts finally. In two years, a total of 58 outstanding projects have been selected, respectively winning the first, second and third prizes accordingly in the country. Some of the outstanding projects are undergoing product transformation. Through the construction of the clinical engineering innovation competition plat - form, it further promotes the integration of medical and industrial, as well as the inno - vation and development of medical devices in China. 7 . T en medical AI products entered the Chinese market after being approved by National Medical Products Administration In recent years, the investment in the field of medical artificial intelligence around the world shows a trend of rapid growth, and the industries related to intelligent assisted di - agnosis in China are also rising rapidly [11]. In 2017, China Food and Drug Adminis - tration issued a new version of the Classifi - cation of Medical Devices. If the diagnostic software provides diagnostic suggestions through algorithms, only has auxiliary di - agnostic functions, and does not directly provide diagnostic conclusions, then the application of Class II medical devices shall be declared. If the diagnostic software auto - matically identifies the lesion site through the algorithm and provides clear diagnostic tips, the Class III category of medical de - vices shall be applied. Since the end of 2019, Healthcare Industry CHINA BACK TO CONTENTS57 AI products has been extended from lung nodules to cover heart, brain, endocrine, pathology, ultrasound and other directions, realizing the auxiliary diagnosis and predic - tion of a variety of diseases. From late 2019 the AI healthcare industry went through an intensive clinical trial pro - cess and submitted registration applications. In 2020, there were 10 products from 8 AI medical enterprises, including Keya Medi - cal, LEPU Medical, BioMind, Silicon Intel - ligence, AIRDOC, InferVision, SHUKUN, United Imaging Intelligence and Deepwise, which had been approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China and obtained the Class III type of AI medi - cal certificate. They will become mature products for market use after clinical tri - als, in cardiology, neurology, endocrinology, orthopaedics, thoracic surgery and other disciplines. Among them, the number of cardiology products is the largest. 8 . Rapid application of intelligent management of medical equipment based on Internet of Things A number of Tier Three Grade A hospitals in China have built IOT technology-based data acquisition and management plat - forms for hospital medical equipment. Data of large medical equipment and emergency medical equipment are transferred to the data centre of the hospital. And real-time integration, development and utilization are carried out with the clinical diagnosis and treatment system [12]. Beijing China- Japan Friendship Hospital has integrated the Internet of Things, mobile Internet, 5G private network, face recognition, and \"micro-service\" system integration archi - tecture, and carried out a comprehensive exploration of the haemodialysis diagno - sis and treatment management system. In February 2020, Wuhan Tongji Hospital established a three-level monitoring and treatment system, namely the automatic early warning and rapid response system for patients with critical events, which can monitor patients' vital sign parameters in real-time and conduct a comprehensive evaluation, and provide timely early warn - ings for patients with critical situations. Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital has developed a monitoring system for tem - perature, humidity and power supply in the locations of large medical equipment installed [13]. By collecting the require - ments of the equipment manufacturers for temperature, humidity and auxiliary pow - er supply voltage of all kinds of medical equipment, the AC voltage in the machine room environment is sampled and moni - tored, and the stored data are also retriev - able. By pushing the alarm information to the platform, the cloud platform monitor - ing system based on the Internet of Things technology for the collection, transmission and storage of environmental state data of medical equipment was established. West China Hospital has developed online quality control and early warning platform based on real-time data. By monitoring the output parameters of medical equip - ment in real-time and comparing with the established quality control model, the plat - form can give early warning in real-time if abnormal happens, which helps a lot in enhancing the safety of patients. 9 . COVID-19 is driving the rapid growth of disinfection and logistic robotics technology and their practical application in hospitals in China The application of intelligent robots in hos - pitals has seen explosive growth in recent years. The need for safer and more reliable services in the medical industry is the key to the commercial products of medical service robots. Applications include clini - cal settings such as isolation wards, ICU, operating rooms, fever clinics, etc. The disinfection robot has become the popular product in the fight against COVID-19 in 2020 due to its ability to solve problems such as difficulty in disinfection, manpower shortage and overall cleaning [14]. Driven by the need to combat COVID-19, many technologies and robotics companies have shipped their latest generation of robots across the country. In terms of logistics ro - bots, China's domestic AGV logistics robot industry has seen explosive growth in recent years. The growth rate has been maintained at more than 30% for several years, and the scale of the logistics robot industry is con - stantly expanding. With the outbreak of COVID-19, the logistic robot has become an important measure for hospitals to cope with infection risk and manpower shortage. Clinical engineering departments in many medical institutions across the country have deployed logistic robots in areas such as iso - lation wards and fever clinics to reduce the risk of cross-infection. 10 . Rapid approval and emergency deployment of novel coronavirus assay reagents to enhance nucleic acid test capability COVID-19 is a highly infectious virus disease. Nucleic acid detection is an impor - tant method to identify novel coronavirus infections. Rapid and accurate nucleic acid detection method is of great significance for early detection of infected persons and control of epidemic spread. COVID-19, according to Novel Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Coronavirus Infection, mainly adopts two methods for nucleic acid detection, one is real-time flu - orescence RT-PCR kit detection, the other is virus gene sequencing. Nucleic acid de - tection kits could produce detection results faster, which is more suitable for the cur - rent prevention and control of COVID-19. Nucleic acid detection methods mainly Healthcare Industry CHINA BACK TO CONTENTS58 include PCR, thermostatic amplification, sequencing, CRISPR detection, The second- generation PCR technology (fluorescent PCR) is the mainstream method for virus detection, and it is also the most widely used technology for Novel Coronavirus detection kits approved and marketed in various countries at present. On January 26, 2020, China's National Medical Products Administration approved the first batch of 4 novel coronavirus testing products from 4 enterprises. It includes BGI Novel Coronavirus assay kit, BGI DNBSeq-T7 sequencing system, and two nucleic acid assay kits produced by Shanghai Zhijiang Biotechnology Co., Ltd and Shanghai Jen - uoBiotech Co., Ltd. In 2020, China's State Medical Products Administration ap - proved a total of 54 nucleic acid detection reagents for Novel Coronavirus, including 8 nucleic acid rapid detection products, forming a complete detection technol - ogy system, with a production capacity of 24.018 million copies per day. During the COVID-19 period, China's clinical engi - neering departments purchased various nu - cleic acid testing equipment and reagents in an emergency manner, and expanded the capacity of rapid testing reagents and testing equipment in accordance with the needs of epidemic prevention and control, so as to continuously improve the nucleic acid testing capacity of medical institutions. Summary Based on the consultation of experts from the Chinese Society of Clinical Engineer - ing of the Chinese Medical Association, we sorted out the top Ten Progress Events in the field of clinical engineering. This paper may be helpful to sort out relevant research hot-spots and development trends, helps hospital managers and clinical engineers to grasp the future development direction of clinical engineering in China, and provide support for decision-making analysis of new technology management.References 1.

Chu Chengchen, Master, Sixth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai China E-mail: mazhaoweili@163.comHealthcare Industry CHINA BACK TO CONTENTS59 Person-centered Medicine As with adults, self-care with children and adolescents has received good press in edu - cational science literature and health pro - motion journals. Both consider it as a key factor in a person-centered perspective in health. Typically, these publications see the promotion of self-care at the centre of the education that a functional family should provide to their children to comply with its ambition to develop their well-being. An example of this approach is provided by an article which, under the title \"Self-Care for Youth and Families\" [1] lists several ideas of \"self-care strategies to get started\"; to such extent that it becomes a sort of treatise on knowing how to live, designed for function - al families aiming to develop the self-care of their children and adolescents: indeed, fol - lowing a caveat where the author reminds that self-care is an activity or action that one enjoys and makes him feel good during and after. Here are some of the ideas proposed \"to get started\" in this perspective: Get enough sleep at night. Exercise, make sure it is something you enjoy, such as a walk, yoga, swimming, etc. Meditate for a short time every day. Spend quality time with your family or friends. Read a book. Take a nice relaxing bath. Start a hobby such as crafting, writing, or cooking. Start a journal. Listen to music. Dancing. Practice mindfulness strategies. Have a date night. Take time away from technology. Volunteering. Family game night. Certainly, as the authors underline it in their caveat, these are only suggestions of common sense which cannot be dangerous and are surely the object of a broad consen - sus in the target population: that is, in those who are doing well enough to have only positive behaviours and who are integrated or globalized enough to share the same type of representation of what is positive. But it is all the same surprising for a clinician of the old continent, that this type of article is accepted without giving rise, it seems, to sharp criticisms, at least on the internet which is however not stingy with excessive or even unreasonable comments on all and every subject; i.e. is not disputed either the ideas of general normativity (on which the all concept is based) or the cultural or social biases underlying these ideas, everything happening as if they were the subject of such a consensus that it would appear irrel - evant to discuss them. However, criticisms exist, but, appearing only in clinical publi - cations involving health professionals, their critics are directed exclusively to self-care in children and adolescents.This is particularly the case if we refer to the publications indexed in Medline in the rare cases where they address the topic of Self Care in Children and Adolescents In these publications, they first wonder if self-care in children and adolescents is not above all sign of their neglect: Very repre - sentative of this current is the article entitled \"Should we care about Adolescents Who Care for Themselves? What we have learned and what we need to know about youth in Self-Care\" [2]. In this paper, the authors ar - gue that Self-care would be an indicator of a failure of parental support except in very competent families. In other words, self-care should be seen primarily as a sign of the weak capability of the parents and their lack of ability to use the educational standards to help their children to deal with everything related to care. These results are consistent with Amartya Sen capabilities theory [3] and impose to avoid a diversion of the no - tion of self-care to mask the absence of suit - able professional and non-professional help to the children and adolescents in need. These publications question also the fact that is in certain complex conditions, self- care is mainly directed towards the self- management of care and, that, in that sense, it is, above all, an attempt to reduce the risks linked to poor management of treat - ment, rather than a positive and desirable development. In the situations of children and adolescents with medically or socially complex chronic conditions, supporting self-management should be seen as a prior - ity even if it remains far from the ideal of autonomy to which is referred the model we presented at the beginning of this paper [4]. By examining these two types of limita - tions of the concept of the ideal model of self-care, some authors were thus led to introduce the idea of a self-care distinc - tion between universal self-care and health deviation self-care in children and ado - lescents: in entering in the details of the concept, they show that participants ap - Michel BotbolPromoting Self-Care in Children and Youth: A challenge in itself BACK TO CONTENTS60 Person-centered Medicine pear as competent agents in universal and developmental self-care requisites but need supportive-educative nursing interventions for health-deviation self-care [5]. Surprisingly, the studies on self-care in chil - dren and adolescents leave in the shade a question that is crucial when dealing with adolescents: the role of motivation in self- care. It is well documented that motiva - tion is crucial in the effect of interventions. aiming at behavioural changes, with data suggesting a greater influence of intrinsic motivation (internal motives) over extrinsic motivation (external motives). In children and adolescents, the balance between these two forms of motivation is deeply affected by the alteration of the self/ others balance which is crucial at various developmental stages. Psychological devel - opment can indeed be seen, at least partially, as a continuous journey from dependence to autonomy. It is particularly the case in adolescence in which the adolescent is challenged by the necessity to become autonomous (that is to say to separate from those who supported him during his childhood); with, here, an additional difficulty due to the fact that this burning needs to become autonomous occurs at the very moment in which the stress of the adolescence process increases his needs to be helped by his parents and or the other persons of his environment. It is a paradoxical situation that challenge the ad - olescent's capacity to deal with separation. It is of course crucial because the most vul - nerable Adolescent are those in which this capacity is the weakest and are additionally those who are the most reluctant to accept or ask for help, they would need, particularly regarding mental health. The problem is that they are also those who are the most likely to engage in problematic behaviours and the less likely to be self-care oriented [6]. Adolescence Psychiatry teaches us that in that type of situation (which is frequent in the field of mental health) the most efficient way to get out of this paradoxical situation is to find an interactive way to overcome the relational threat this situation triggers in the adolescent: his/her fear of dependency and his/her feeling of failure dependency induces in him/her. Educational mediations are considered generally as the most effi - cient tool for that stake because it reduces the challenge of the relation by masking it behind the pleasure of doing interesting and gratifying things. Notably, some of the normative proposals we mentioned at the beginning of this brief note can be seen as non-asymmetrical educational mediations. References 1.
