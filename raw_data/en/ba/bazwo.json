I participated in an ayahuasca ceremony and it was one of the most amazing things that I have ever done. Miguel is an excellent Shaman who is very knowledgeable and great at what he does. I plan on attending another ceremony in the future and highly recommend Sacha Runa to anyone and everyone! - katiepY9501AX00Incredible andes retreatSacha Runa was the most incredible place for my first ayahuasca retreat, I can't speak highly enough of it. Julio and Helen were wonderful shamans and facilitators, they truely made the experience. They were so generous with their time and knowledge in and out of the ceremonies. Before the ceremonies started I was really ill and they made me feel supported, cared for and safe! My retreat took place in the mountain centre near La Paz - the location was breathtaking. The ceremonies themselves were such amazing, powerful group experiences. I still think about the incredible chanting and music Julio did! The daily meditations were also such a wonderful part of the process that really brought our group closer and closer together. The Sacha Runa community felt extremely genuine and I felt supported throughout the entire week. I spent a while researching the right centre in Bolivia for me and I'm so glad I came to them. It was an extremely special week for me that I will honestly never forget. I can't recommend them enough! - Shewhorunswild00Transformative ceremony with trusted healersI'm incredibly grateful for the love, devotion and respect that the whole SachaRuna community has for those who seek healing and knowledge. After an extensive research, my friend and I booked a 3 day Shamanic retreat in the Amazon.I was so excited and nervous at the same time, as two females traveling solo we had to be extra careful making travel arrangements. From the beginning the whole team at SachaRuna made us feel safe and confident about the whole experience. The day we flew to Rurrenabaque the weather conditions didn't allow us to land, so our plane had to return to La Paz. Julio (Miguel's apprentice) went above and beyond to hep us during this unexpected change of plans. He helps us find a reliable taxi from the airport to their La Paz sanctuary \"Allkamari\". Miguel with a big smile welcomed us and introduced us to a beautiful meditation. Just like that our adventure started, we walk around the whole santuary, and had the opportunity to connect with the Andes and the majestic sacred mountains that sourround the entire city of La Paz. We were able to fly the next day to the Amazon. We were so excited to finally meet Julio and together we headed to Wizard mountain and continue our journey. The amazon sanctuary it's absolutely beautiful, there is so much peace and quiet that I immediately feel connected with the earth, water - Valvalval9900An Amazing ExperienceEverything was peaceful, starting from the place, close to La Paz and really easy to access. The staff was great, helping for everything. My experience was pretty positive and I felt completely safe and trustful during the whole journey. - 49rasmusj00Life changing Ayahuasca Retreat with team at Sacha Runa.Helen, Miguel & Julio do some fantastic things for humanity and open doors to the spiritual world that cannot be described in words but must be tried in real life, so if you want to take your self-development to a new level, this is the place in Bolivia & Team to go to. Just do it :-) Aho - D4n_Lw00Want to change your life and mind?Amazing experience. Highly recommend. I was nervous beforehand but the shaman Helen made me feel relaxed and prepared prior to the ceremony and i felt safe throughout. My experience was deep and allowed me to deal with past issues. Anyone who has any past traumas or current issues to deal with or would like to have a highly spiritual experience I would recommend attending a ceremony with Sacha Runa. It could change your life! - PazGoing to Sacha Runa for a single night ceremony was a completely life changing experience. We were told that 2 ceremonies were already happening that week and invited to join either. We were however not able to attend either and Miguel was kind enough to organize a whole separate ceremony just for us to attend, which was incredibly kind of him. The place itself is breathtaking, and we got the best food we ate in all 10 days we were in Bolivia. As far as the ceremony though, my friend and I were somewhat nervous at first, but after meeting Miguel for just 5 minutes we knew we were in the right place. The staff is very well prepared and has a lot of experience and made the whole process and integration a life-changing event. I can truly say that the experience was life-changing and I believe a big part of that was the amazing staff and the place itself. - R8654IJemmaj00Life changingSacha Runa found me at a point in my life where I just didn't know where I was going. I literally felt lost & needed some guidance. I asked the universe to help guide me & all I saw was Sacha Runa so I got in touch with Miguel & did a 3 month retreat. The best decision of my life. I spent 2 months in the mountains in La Paz & 5 weeks in the jungle. In the mountains we had 2 ceremonies per week, Ayahuasca & on special occasions (the long dance & pilgrimages) we did San Pedro. We had meditation 3 times a day & other activities. In the jungle we had 2 ceremonies per week with ayahuasca. We were put on a strict diet & couldn't use any chemical products. We had plant medicines 3 times a day. I had 3 different plants because I was in there for 5 weeks & they all work in different ways. The whole 3 month experience taught me so much. How to connect with the divine & how to accept myself & love myself which I truly don't think I had before. Ayahuasca & lots of meditation opened my eyes to what love really feels like & it opened my heart & ignited a light inside of me that's been hidden for such a long time. The ceremonies helped me heal traumas, heal my inner child & clear chakras that were blocked & preventing me from connecting with my higher self. There were some tough challenges in the retreat for me but those challenges are the ones that have helped me when I wanted to run away. Those challenges are the ones that made me realise I'm not a quitter & how much strength I have even when things get really tough & fear creeps in. I had so much support from Miguel & Helen. I would have regular one on ones with them & Miguel likes to check in with you regularly. Miguel always has some honest feedback & really good advice to help you on your journey. He has an amazing energy when your in his presence. If you'd like a life changing experience then you should definitely choose Sacha Runa. The longer the retreat, the better the experience because you'll have more time to work on yourself & heal in a way you haven't before. - Mane L00Two short days but full of adventures. It was super cold at this time of the year, but we survived. LolWe had 2 day retreat/ceremony at La Paz, Bolivia. It was a hiccup in the system when booking but Miguel went the extra mile to serve us. I'm forever grateful to him and the staff for helping us in the short time we were there. I totally recommend this or other events. - nicolehY8929FP00Magic ceremonyAmazing ayahuasca ceremony with my beloved Juan. It was a personal, deep and healing experience. Cham\u00e1n Juan was a great leader during the ceremony. I felt secure since the beginning. Magic travel to my self - lakshmiji10800Deeply healing and powerful experienceWow, my stay at Sacharuna exceeded my hopes by far. I certainly came for healing and integrating some emotional processes according to a recent loss I was experiencing. I had only one time before travelled with Aya and the whole world of plant medicine was very new to me. I am also travelling myself alone as a woman, first time in South America. I have to say Helen, who is working at Sacharuna provided excellent support prior to my travels, reassuring me around worries I had, finding ways to help me feel safe and prepared to come. She got up in the middle of the night to welcome me and did everything possible during my stay to help me with all details (from laundry, over taxi rides and a dentist visit, to arranging that my beanie, which I lost on a pilgrimage to the island of the sun, found its way back to me). She was always available and always willing to help. Thank you Helen! I had the wonderful opportunity to get to know both centers and all shamans currently practicing there- Allkamari in the Andes and Wizard Mountain in the amazonian jungle. I participated in two ceremonies in the Andes and one amazing Sweat Lodge with the Shaman Juan, who really took time to work with me individually. First - outside of ceremony, explaining the meditation techniques to me and meditating with me, then in the 2nd ceremony as it was a small one he worked on me individually and I experienced a major healing which I am so grateful for and was the reason for my visit. It's been an incredible, outstanding and powerful experience. I will be forever grateful to Juan and everyone else who held space: Lula, Helen and Simon and my fellow traveller Madai who also got a lot of support. I continued to a pilgrimage to the island of the sun and got to know the head shaman Miguel. We were walking with San Pedro which was an intense experience for me. All throughout I felt the wise leadership of Miguel and appreciate his willingness to attend to me when needed in his unique straight forward way. Then I travelled on to Rurrenabaque and the center in the Andes for a special dieta and retreat. Immediately when arriving in Rurre, Philip, one of the two Shamans there, picked me up and together with Angela, the 2nd Shaman, we took a boat to the center in the jungle. As soon as I arrived, I could feel tension falling off of me and a peaceful, contemplative quietness taking its place. Wizard mountain is truly a place to retreat and invites an inward focus. The facilities are beautiful. I especially loved the meditation hut by the little stream that runs across the property, where you can sit all day protected from mosquitoes and meditate. Philip and Angela where super caring and helpful. Philip assisted me with everything I needed, whether it was laundry, medicine, a boat trip and a trip to Pampas after the retreat or extending my visa as I ended up staying 3,5 weeks instead of originally only 1,5 weeks. This was due to diving deep into processes there: while being on the diet, drinking special plant medicinal teas throughout the day and travelling with Aya in ceremonies, spending time in this meditative environment invited me to go deeper, which asked for more time. Here too, my process continued, more emotional release, healing, deeper clarity and integration was possible. Philip and Angela were attending to everyone individually in their ceremonies and I had deeply healing experiences. Angela has offered a magnetic healing treatment to me as a gift during the retreat and when I fell sick after the retreat was over, she invited me to her house to treat me for free. Philip took us for jungle walks, explained to us about the plants and wildlife as well as about Ayahuasca and the process of preparing the medicine. I thoroughly enjoy how knowledgeable he is. I now want to say that I believe I have taken a huge step forward in my healing and a deep shift has happened within me in how I go about life. I feel incredibly grateful and given to and want to thank my incredible fellow traveler Adam, who has been a source of inspiration with his own super disciplined, several monthlong retreat and dieta practice, Paul and Alejandro who have been dieting with me. Thank you guys, carry on with the good work. So much more to say! If you can, make yourself the gift of visiting Sacharuna and experience the magic and beauty of the retreat centers, the incredible hospitality and friendship of the staff and visitors there and the wise and caring guidance of the shamans and the plant teachers. With deep gratitude and a bow to the divine light in all of us, that shines even in the darkest times, Nadine - 011luisfernando00SpiritualI was so lucky to do two ceremonies at Sacha Runa (Allkamari - La Paz/Bolivia). It was one of the best spiritual experiences, in addition to the connection power of the place. I recommend Juan and Helen, who carried out the work with love, respect, patience and a lot of effort. - SimonN225800Deep healingI have been at Sacha Runa for the last 2 months of a 3 month retreat. My journey started in the jungle retreat in Rurrenbaue (Ayahuasca ceremonies). Then to Allkamari (Ayahuasca & San Pedro ceremonies, Sun/Moon dance, sweat lodges and Island of the Sun, Sun temple pilgrimage) and now back to the Jungle retreat My motivation for coming to Sacha Runa was to continue healing deeply (which the plant medicines enable me to do and quicker than any other healing modality I have experienced). My time at Sacha Runa has enabled me to do this to a level I have not experienced before. I have had to face many challenges. Some that have literality brought me to my knees. Before coming to Sacha Runa I had attended around 40 Ayahuasca ceremonies with 6-7 different Sharman. During my time at Sacha Runa I have attended 18 ayahuasca ceremonies and 4 San Pedro ceremonies. I have found all these ceremonies to be very respectful towards the medicines and attendees. I have not personally experienced anything during the ceremonies that has given me any reason to feel concerned. While I have experienced immense healing during my time at Sacha Runa, to provide a balanced view, there have been some admin things that I have found frustrating eg: the water (which has now been resolved). Every time I have raised a concern it has been addressed. In regards to the unfortunate accident, when the accident occurred, it was made clear to us that the jungle retreat had finished and we were in our own time. We had 3-4 days before heading to the mountains to do what we wanted to do. I personally, in no way blame the management of Sacha Runs and don't believe anything could of been done to prevent the accident. My heart goes out to her family. The blend of the jungle and mountains is magical. Both environments offer different energy and beauty. If you are looking for deep healing in a supportive environment, I can recommend Sacha Runa. - ryanlupardus00Shamanic Plant DietI've had the honor to participate in ceremonies and life with Miguel for four weeks and Juan for the last three weeks. Their dedication and devotion to the path and their own teachers is astonishing and inspiring. And also the amount of care given to supporting everyone's process in our group. I've felt a part of a family here, a dynamic which emerges out of authenticity and love shared. My own process has been to open up to this community and the plants have helped expand my heart and balance my masculine/feminine natures. I've felt a renewed sense of purpose and strength through this dieting process. It's also been an integration of all the teachings of my life and new realizations of the Divine have flowered. I highly recommend Miguel and Juan as shamans and as friends. Each has their own way of holding ceremony and I'm blessed to have the chance to be with both. They are true path-weavers of ancient shamanic practice for the new earth. Both Allkamari and Wizard Mountain locations have their own unique magic. At Allkamari, the dry high altitude plants pattern the environment with Illumani's presence in the distance. At Wizard Mountain, it's full jungle with tropical plants and fruits thriving along the paths and pure streams to bathe and play in. In the mountains, I felt a higher connection and to the realms above and in the jungle I felt a deeper connection to the animal spirits and more grounded energies in the dieta process. The shamanic work unfolding here at Sacha Runa in Bolivia is beautiful to participate in and will be foundational for the future to come. Highly recommended and so much love. - meganrichards_8300Incredible retreat experienceFrom the moment I arrived at Sacha Runa for the start of a three month retreat and learning program I knew that I had landed in a profoundly special place and community. After two weeks with the program I am feeling an extraordinary sense of gratitude for this opportunity, for the Sacha Runa Community and for the incredible healing and teaching work offered by Miguel. Over the last fortnight I have participated in a series of wachuma and ayahuasca ceremonies at both the Alkamari and Rurrenabaque centers. In each of these ceremonies I have been able to work through deep personal blocks, develop insights and clarity into long standing life patterns and receive deep healing. Both the jungle and Andes retreat centres offer gorgeous environments in which to deep dive into the work and your personal process. In the Andes I would wake each morning to the sunrise over the snow capped mountain peaks and in the jungle have the opportunity each day to swim in the crystal clear rivers, hike tracks around the centre and enjoy the company of the Amazonian wildlife including butterflies , Monkeys and armadillos. If you are looking for an opportunity to participate in beautiful, transformative plant medicine work I thoroughly recommend joining a program or retreat with Sacha Runa.

Apr 2023 Friends I did a Ayahuasca retreat with sacha runa close to La Paz. It could have been a really good experience, despite the bad trip I personally had. But it wasn't. From the beginning both me and my friend felt super unwelcome. It was the first time for us and I feel like it's something you wanna do in a surrounding that you feel comfortable in and get a bit of guidance or at least at the feeling of guidance through the whole experience. But none of that happened. The \"check in\" was barely two sentences showing us our room. Not even telling us where the bathroom was, how to get water, what to bring to the ceremony (water and warm clothes, both kind of essential to know) and one other girl who was staying there doing a retreat for a whole week told us. Then after the ceremony finished we all went to bed, it was the 2am at Night and there was no water again (we both felt super sick, you throw up, all part of the experience, but tap water is not on option in Bolivia and you just feel super helpless). the ceremony was done properly I guess, but again the feeling of unwelcomeness and not caring at all about the people was really strong for me, I felt like i was just seen as 125$ that I paid for this experience. The sharmane told us that the effect would probably last for around 4 hours, the time of the ceremony. For me it was like10 Hours, which apparently is normal,, would have helped to know that as well. There was nothing else than breakfast included as well. No mediation session no yoga or whatsoever and the programme said you should be there by 3pm, so I was expecting something, especially for that amount of money. It would have had the potential to be good and would have only needed a few changes but like that I would definitely not recommend to go.

Feb 2023 Solo I have waited about 1.5 month to write about the retreat, because I wanted to see how the experiences of the retreat integrated into my normal life and can honestly say that my life has changed in so many good ways. I am a different person now. So if you think about doing something for yourself and are brave enough to do some deep work, please do go to Sacha Runa. Miguel and his team made me feel right at home at their beautiful retreat center in the Andes and no point whatsoever did I ever feel unsafe or unsupported.

Jan 2023 Solo I stayed for a 7 day retreat in the Andes and I loved it a lot. I feel like it was the perfect place for my first experience with Ayahuasca. The place is very magical with the view on Mount Illimani and the beautiful surroundings. We were only 4 people joining the retreat in this week and I really loved that we were such a small group, I made some awesome connections and loved the sharing and integration circles. I enjoyed the meditations and also the time together with the other participants. Julio is an amazing chaman, he always made me feel very safe and comfortable, the ceremonies were amazing. I feel like I learned a lot and I would really love to come back one day. Thanks a lot!

Aug 2022 I spent a month with Sacha Runa and had the chance to participate in sessions led by both Helen and Miguel. Both were incredible, but I was especially impressed by Helen's empathy, her devotion to serve, her deep knowledge, her unparalleled connection with the plants, and by how her individualized guidance enabled the participants to have the most profound experiences that by far exceeded everyone's expectations. Thanks to Helen and the whole Sacha Runa community, the time I spent there was facilitating my advancement beyond my wildest imaginations. In one month, I made more progress in terms of personal and professional growth than in years of working with some of the best life and business coaches in Europe and the US. Of course, there will always be a negligible minority of people who will be caught out of their depth because they come ill-prepared, are too scared of facing their issues, or are simply not open-minded enough to accept female shamans. I'm wishing them all the best, but don't let their petty and inaccurate comments get in your way of making a life-changing trip to Sacha Runa. Sending love from Switzerland. A'HO!

Aug 2022 Solo My time at Sacha Runa was one of the most transformational experiences of my life. I volunteered at Allkamari for one month and participated in 3 Ayahuasca ceremonies, 3 Temazcal ceremonies and 1 Wachuma pilgrimage to the Illimani during my time there. I was going through significant life changes during this time, and Sacha Runa was a safe space for healing, personal growth and connection where I could be cared for, learn to better care for myself and be in service to the community as a volunteer. What I love about Sacha Runa is: - How safe and supported I feel there. There is no doubt in my mind that this community and those who lead it (Shamans Miguel, Helen and others) care deeply about people, healing and evolving human consciousness through healing with plant medicine. - The spirit of encouraging participants to grow past their comfort zones. This can feel triggering at times but is where the real healing magic happens!! - The integration of wisdom from multiple indigenous and ancient cultures. I felt a balance between honoring local traditions and ceremonies, and incorporating wisdom from around the world. - The location \u2014 the daily view of the Illimani and our sacred pilgrimage there were some of the highlights of my experience. I have heard the jungle location is also amazing. Both are sacred spaces in nature, and accessible from the nearby cities. Shamans Miguel and Helen are amazing. Miguel founded the retreat centers and brings wisdom from years of experience around the world. He embodies a refreshing, lighthearted energy while attuning to participants' needs in ceremony. Helen is one of my principal role models in life. She embodies a special balance, serving both as a leader holding space and a sacred channel to the Divine, in the Ayahuasca and Temazcal ceremonies and meditations she leads and beyond. Helen is dedicated, showing up every single day, holding space, sharing her intuitive and learned wisdom, inviting participants to grow. Hearing Helen sing in ceremony helped guide me through, like a warm, nurturing hug. Spending each day in her presence during my month stay was a gift. I feel so grateful for my experience at Sacha Runa. I highly recommend it and intend to bring my closest friends and family to ceremony here.

Nov 2022 Solo I felt deceived and cheated! These are the Issues i have with the way my retreat was handled: #1. Booked for la paz , I get to la paz and then told youll have to take the bus to the jungle (2 other ppl there the same) , not mentioning its a 15 hour ride each way. - i wouldnt have signed up for that , but it was too late i was already in Bolivia so i went along with it. #2 i was so looking forward to the \"30 years of experience\" that was in the description that miguel has. Plus all the reviews were raving about miguel. Its very important to take this medicine with someone very experienced. When i got there i found out he was not even going to be there and his assistant helen who has been training for 2 years said she is going to do the ceremonies by her self. Not to be disrespectful , helen is a great person and cares but has only a couple years of experience. She is not a shaman with 30 years experience. I kept hearing others saying miguels ceremonies were way better and personalized. He also has a license to be doing ceremonies. Ill repeat : There was no experienced shaman at a shamanic retreat and i wasnt told until i spent thousands of dollars and arrived after 18 hours plane journey and then the 15 hour bus. I have been doing research and ppl train 20 years and still have much to learn. Me and others came here with trauma, ptsd and heavy issues, administering ayahuasca like that is in my opinion dangerous and wreckless! #3. On trip advisor the 7 day package showed 3 ceremonies for 825$ when i booked it in the end of october. A ceremony every other day. 5 day -2 ceremonies was 5 hundred something $ , when i arrived i was told they have changed it to 2 ceremonies on Tuesdays and fridays. When i asked about it they said we hadnt updated it on tripadvisor yet. So i paid an extra 300$ some dollars and didnt get the third ceremony. I just looked tonight and they have changed the description to two but im assuming Tripadvisor can see when they edited it and what the description was when i booked. #4. The first ceremony was mild (all agreed) and she was tinkering with the medicine mix trying to get it right. My second one was even more mild. #5. Also it felt very impersonal, everyone got the same plant diet, even though were all here for different reason and issues. They are supposed to be tailored to you individual situation. Lastly the roaches were out of control , every night crawling on our beds, bags, everywhere in the ceremonies as well. bottom line i was so bent out of shape i could hardly focus on the reasons why i came down here in the first place. Felt like the definition of commercialized ceremonies. There was no considerarion or regard for the safety, experience or preferences of any of us. It was a blatant take my money and let someone inexperienced do what a professional should have been there to do. All this could have been avoided by miguel just being honest and telling me he would not be there so i could make the decision to continue or not before spending all that money, time and making that much effort. It sounds like others had a great experience , and thats why i booked with them , but i am extremely upset about the whole situation and hope to find a resolution with them soon. #1. Booked for la paz , I get to la paz and then told youll have to take the bus to the jungle (2 other ppl there the same) , not mentioning its a 15 hour ride each way. - i wouldnt have signed up for that , but it was too late i was already in Bolivia so i went along with it. #2 i was so looking forward to the \"30 years of experience\" that was in the description that miguel has. Plus all the reviews were raving about miguel. Its very important to take this medicine with someone very experienced. When i got there i found out he was not even going to be there and his assistant helen who has been training for 2 years said she is going to do the ceremonies by her self. Not to be disrespectful , helen is a great person and cares but has only a couple years of experience. She is not a shaman with 30 years experience. I kept hearing others saying miguels ceremonies were way better and personalized. He also has a license to be doing ceremonies.
