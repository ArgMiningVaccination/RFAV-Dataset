Early concerns that the spike protein formed in the bloodstream would mimic the placenta-binding protein, leading to pregnancy loss or [ infertility](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninashapiro/2021/12/27/the-covid-19-vaccine-does-not-cause-infertility-heres-why-people-think-it-does/?sh=1c4ce3a668f5), were dispelled quickly. Healthcare workers who were pregnant or nursing were also recommended to go forward with the vaccine. Both the Centers for Disease Control [(CDC) ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) and the World Health Organization ( [WHO](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/health/covid-vaccine-pregnancy.html)) provided guidance for pregnant women, but, to date, there have not been any completed clinical trials looking at the outcomes of vaccine efficacy and safety during pregnancy. These [trials](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-commence-global-clinical-trial-evaluate) have begun with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and data should be forthcoming in the months ahead. But as many [experts](https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/19/covid-19-vaccine-guidance-for-lactating-women-is-based-on-faulty-assumptions-experts-say/) have stated, one cannot lump vaccine risks and efficacy in pregnant individuals with those who are lactating. The maternal transmission via the placental bloodflow to the fetus differs from the maternal transmission of ingested breast milk to the infant. In addition, as the fetus is continually changing developmental stages in utero, the time during gestation of transmission of a particular substance can have varying impact. Ingestion of breast milk into the infant's gastrointestinal tract will have different impact and effect than transmission from the placental blood supply to the fetus. The Phase 2/3 vaccine trials in pregnant women will be following pregnant mothers for 7 to 10 months after the trial to better understand the development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for both the mother and the infant after delivery. Children are not yet eligible to receive any of the three available vaccines in the U.S., and likely will not be eligible for some time. But they are still at risk of contracting acute Covid-19 illness. While young children have not been a primary age group for severe illness or death, infants and young children can develop a severe inflammatory illness known as [MIS-C](https://www.cdc.gov/mis-c/) (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children), as a manifestation of post-coronavirus illness. [Children](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-effort-seeks-understand-mis-c-range-sars-cov-2-effects-children) with this syndrome present with high fever, fatigue, rash, myalgias (muscle pain), and occasionally cardiac complications. Many require hospitalization, and some have succumbed to complications secondary to MIS-C. This entity tends to be more common in infants and toddlers, who will be the last age groups to obtain approval to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. While this season has not been focused on influenza cases, it has been well documented that lactating mothers who receive the flu vaccine can transmit protective flu [antibodies via breast milk ](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/maternal-or-infant-illnesses/influenza.html)to their newborn or infant. This provides some protection from influenza illness to infants under age 6 months, who are too young to receive a flu vaccine. Studies are currently being carried out to assess whether this would be the case for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast fed babies. A recently released white paper presents a very small [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.23.21252328v1) looking at whether the breast milk of lactating mothers will contain protective Covid-19 antibodies after the mother receives a Covid-19 vaccination course. A group based at the Providence Portland Medical Center in Oregon enrolled six lactating women who received the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccination regimen between December 2020 and January 2021. Each subject completed the two-dose vaccine course, with a 21- or 28-day interval between the first and second vaccine. Breast milk samples were obtained prior to the first vaccine dose, as well as at 11 additional time points, with the final sample collected at 14 days after the second vaccine dose. The group found that by seven days after the first vaccine dose, breast milk samples demonstrated substantial [IgG and IgA](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.23.21252328v1.full-text) immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2. Breast milk antibody levels declined somewhat in the weeks just prior to the second vaccine dose, but rose sharply and remained elevated after the second vaccine dose was received. None of the women in the study had a history of prior Covid-19 infection. The important distinction in antibody levels in vaccinated versus previously infected lactating women is that those with prior infection demonstrated significant IgA antibodies, while immunized women's breast milk contains predominantly elevated IgG antibodies. IgA antibodies are most widely seen in respiratory infected mucous membranes, and are commonly seen after respiratory illness. Immunoglobulin G, or IgG , is a more common blood-borne antibody, which provides systemic immunity, and is seen more readily after intramuscular injection as opposed to respiratory infection. While this study is extremely small, and the data on duration of antibodies in breast milk remains preliminary, it provides promising news that breast-fed infants of vaccinated mothers will receive a degree of protection at a time when no Covid-19 vaccine is available for this age group.
