Kelley is incredibly passionate about helping those of all ages and from all walks of life regain strength, health and wellness in a natural and holistic way- with a laugh or two in between. She has also always been passionate about helping those with chronic, autoimmune or psychological conditions find health and wellness once again. THERAPEUTIC STYLE Homeopathy is a form of complementary medicine which takes into consideration the mental, emotional as well as physical symptoms of the individual. Acupuncture is an ancient medical practice which takes into account the theories of traditional Chinese medicine, anatomy and physiology of a patient along with any potential imbalances in the patient's qi, blood, yin and yang. Both Homeopathy and Acupuncture aim at addressing the root cause of disease by using an individualized therapeutic approach, homeopathic remedies, specific acupuncture points, dietary and lifestyle changes. Homeopathic remedies (when used alone) do not interfere with other medications, are safe for children to use and can even be used during pregnancy. I believe in using homeopathic medicine in combination with a more functional medicine approach and bio-puncture. The functional medicine approach makes use of various supplements, minerals and amino acids in order to restore balance to the body by correcting various deficiencies, hormonal imbalances and inflammatory responses. Bio-puncture is a form of practice which involves injecting homeopathic remedies into various trigger points as a means of reducing pain, inflammation and stiffness in muscles and joints. When injected locally, bio-puncture can also be used to promote lymph drainage. Bio-puncture may also be be used systemically as a means of treating fatigue, and boosting the immune system naturally.Acupuncture is an ancient medical practice based on the theories and principles of Traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncture treatment involves the selection of acupoints which aim to restore balance, reduce pain and improve overall health and well-being. Each treatment is individualized and can include moxibustion, tui na or cupping. Family is incredibly important to me, which is why my treatment approach is in depth but also relaxed, friendly and family oriented. I love meeting new people and providing them and their bodies with the means to overcome their obstacles and grow in health, wellness and happiness.
