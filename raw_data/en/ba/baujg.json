Thankfully, this season feels different. After slogging through months of stressful decision-making and weighing seemingly incalculable risks and benefits, parents of young children are closer to the opportunity of having all their kids vaccinated against the virus. Although the news of more vaccine availability feels like a finish line, we still have a few laps to go, as the U.S. Food & Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 6 months to 4 years has been postponed at least another two months. So as we wait for the news of vaccine approval for our youngest Americans, let's leverage what we have learned about the virus. Until COVID-19 vaccines are available for young children, based on my 10 plus years as a pediatrician, here are some ways I believe we can keep our kids safe. Vaccines During Pregnancy Provide Protection To protect infants from COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends pregnant people get vaccinated. Pregnancy is a high-risk condition. Throughout the pandemic, research has consistently demonstrated a higher risk to maternal and infant health in pregnant people infected with COVID-19. Taking every precaution to avoid getting infected, including vaccination, is strongly encouraged by a consensus of U.S. experts. Credible and continually growing research has demonstrated vaccine efficacy and safety for those expecting, and vaccination lowers the risk of COVID-19 complications during and after pregnancy. Getting vaccinated during pregnancy also jumpstarts infant protection from the virus, as studies show a pregnant person passes durable antibodies to their infant through the placenta. These antibodies offer newborn protection against COVID-19 infection for months after birth. Of note, the durability of antibodies passed to infants after maternal COVID-19 infection is significantly lower than those passed after vaccination, making vaccination the better choice than risking infection. One practical way we have seen this durable protection passed from pregnant parent to infant is through infant hospitalization rates. During the recent delta and omicron surges, there were fewer infants hospitalized due to COVID-19 if their parent was vaccinated during pregnancy [[1]](#footnote_1). It is clear that getting vaccinated during pregnancy is a win-win for parents and infants alike. Talk to your OB-GYN about the best timing for COVID-19 vaccination before and during your pregnancy. Adults Should Cocoon Young Children Cocooning is a protective strategy to help limit contagious illnesses in susceptible children. The goal of cocooning is to vaccinate the adults caring for susceptible children against serious illness, creating a cocoon of protection around the kids. By keeping infection and illness rates low in the close-contact adult population, the risk of infection to susceptible children becomes lower. This strategy has been used against various diseases, such as pertussis and influenza. The COVID-19 virus is most easily spread within the home of an infected person, as attack rate studies show that vaccinated adults spread the infection less effectively to vulnerable people in their households, even during the most recent omicron surge [[2]](#footnote_2) . In turn, it stands to reason that a cocooning strategy may be a valuable tool. Completion of the COVID-19 vaccination series by all teachers and daycare providers at child care centers, preschools, parents-day-out programs and other places that young children gather \u2014in addition to older siblings over the age of 5 years\u2014should create a cocoon of protection until our youngest children have the opportunity to be vaccinated. Immune-Supporting Behaviors Help the Whole Family While you have unvaccinated children in your home, encourage immune-supporting behaviors for every member of your family. These immune boosters aren't fancy or expensive, but can provide invaluable support to the organ system in charge of fighting infections. I recommend these immune-supporting habits to my patient families: - Prioritize restorative sleep. Restful sleep is necessary for the immune system to do its best work. Infants need 12 to 15 hours of total sleep per day, and toddlers need 11 to 14 total hours. Elementary-aged kids need nine to 11 hours of nightly sleep, while teens need eight to 10 hours. Meanwhile, adults should get at least seven hours per night. If sleep is difficult or restless, reach out to your child's pediatrician for advice. - Eat well. Good nutrition provides the building blocks for infection-fighting cells. Specifically, research supports [vitamin C,](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-vitamin-c-supplements/) [vitamin D](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/vitamin-d-guide/)and [zinc](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-zinc-supplements/)as immune system helpers. If you feel your toddler or older child is not eating a broad variety of nutrients from whole foods, adding an [inexpensive multivitamin](https://www.forbes.com/health/family/best-multivitamins-for-kids/)may be an easy way to fill in the gaps. - Daily movement. Exercise is a secret weapon for strong immunity. Exercise releases anti-inflammatory agents, stimulates hormones that prime immune-fighting cells and reduces damaging stress. I encourage young children and their parents to get sweaty every day as part of an immune-boosting plan. Be Ready to Take Advantage of Lower Transmission Rates First a surge, then a lull. We've followed this rhythmic infection pattern from the beginning of the pandemic. Although I expect more variants and surges, we now have the ability to identify community levels that are lower risk to our families. I'm encouraging my families to be prepared to take advantage of times when local infection levels start to drop. Use local county dashboards or national databases to watch your community trends. Personally, I defer to an expert consensus that suggests when community positivity rates are lower than 5% and infection rates are lower than 10 cases per 100,000, , resuming entertainment, extra-curricular activities and social gatherings is considered lower risk [[3]](#footnote_3). Taking advantage of these months of the year will provide the respite of connection and normalcy that everyone is craving. Play Outside Throughout the pandemic, science has consistently shown us that being outdoors and in well-ventilated areas is a lower-risk activity for families. But from my perspective, being outdoors is more than just a safer space to gather and play; being in nature has the power to re-fuel the mind and spirit in many important ways. Whether it's a hike in the woods or a walk on a suburban sidewalk, being outside\u2014in all kinds of weather\u2014helps our brains and bodies connect with soothing natural rhythms. Being in nature has been shown to decrease stress, improve our interpersonal connections and may heal the damage caused by social isolation. Toss on your shoes, grab your stroller and get out of the house. Try to get outside every day, even if just for a few minutes. Find a new path or a new park. Move and listen to a new podcast or audiobook. Look to the outdoors as a place of refuge and rejuvenation. And while your kids find joy in dirt, piles of leaves and playground equipment, take a moment to breathe. Prioritize Your Mental Health In more than 10 years as a pediatrician, I have never seen the levels of anxiety and stress that I see in today's parents. The chronic stress of the pandemic has been all-consuming, and it's taking a toll on our mental health in more ways than we know\u2014our mental capacity, connection to others, family bonds, financial and professional gain and much more. My concern is the association between parental mental stress and interactions with their child. We know the mental wellness of a parent is critical to the connection, leadership and love that a parent offers a child. If we don't take serious account of our mental status, we risk missing a valuable connection with our children. If you find yourself being more angry, anxious, fitful or languishing, reach out for help. Community and national resources are available to you. Alternatively, talk to your child's pediatrician or personal physician for more advice.

There are other mitigation strategies that are very effective when used properly and often, according to experts. - Load up on rapid tests. Properly used [home tests](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-home-covid-tests/)are a fast way to detect COVID-19 in your home and begin proper isolation strategies. The more quickly an infected family member is identified, the sooner isolation strategies can begin, limiting in-home spread. - Ventilation. When the outdoor temperature allows, simply opening a few windows is an effective way to exchange indoor air and limit airborne spread. When you are gathering indoors with others, crack a window\u2014a free and effective tool to reduce risk. - Air quality and purification. When outdoor conditions don't allow, consider upgrading furnace filters to improve air quality, or place inexpensive or homemade air purifiers in areas where kids play. - Well-fitting, high-filtration masks keep the wearer safe. [High-quality masks](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-face-masks-for-covid/)are increasingly available in kid sizes. If cloth masks are the only kind of mask your young child will wear, try adding a filter or disposable surgical mask layer. Read. Play. Love. Young kids need safe homes, simple toys and unconditional love in order to grow and thrive. They don't need playdates, baby gymnasium memberships or parents-day-out to succeed as adults. (Really!) If social activities feel unsafe to you while your child is unvaccinated, take a deep breath. It's okay to limit those activities. If your child has not had access to group care, or you have limited social situations, it's expected that young children may have more anxiety around new people or places. As you introduce your young children to new situations, approach with confidence and patience. Kids are amazingly resilient and have the capacity to learn and develop skills at a rapid pace. Meanwhile, keep reading basic books and talking to your little one. Share meals together. Provide simple household items to stimulate imaginative play. Re-visit childproofing often as your child gains the ability to climb and explore. And don't forget that eye contact is magic\u2014put the phone down for a minute. These are simple things and micro-moments that will keep development and social skills right on track. Until all our patients have the opportunity for protection from COVID-19 through the vaccine, pediatricians everywhere will continue to fight for our littlest patients. We will do our best to translate science to our communities, encourage data-driven mitigation measures in places where children learn and play and vaccinate as many children and adults as we are able. We stand with you. We see you. And we will get through the next phase, together. \"Dear Pediatrician\" is for informational purposes only and should not substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.
