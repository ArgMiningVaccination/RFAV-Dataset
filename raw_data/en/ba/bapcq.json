Oregano adds flavor to savory dishes. It may also have health benefits due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. Possible medical uses range from diabetes to cramps. It may also help reduce the risk of cancer. Oregano is a herb from the mint, or Lamiaceae family. People have used it for thousands of years to add flavor to dishes and to treat health conditions. It features in the Mediterranean diet. The Greeks and Romans [associated oregano](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232240488_Oregano_Overview_of_the_Literature_on_Health_Benefits) with joy and happiness. The name comes from the Greek words \"oros,\" meaning mountain, and \"ganos,\" meaning joy. There are different types of oregano. The most common type is Oregano vulgare, also known as Spanish thyme and wild marjoram. People use oregano in the diet as supplements and as an aromatic oil. The [antioxidants](/articles/301506.php) around the Mediterranean region have used oregano for centuries in [herbal medicine](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232240488_Oregano_Overview_of_the_Literature_on_Health_Benefits) to treat many ailments, including: - skins sores - aching muscles [asthma](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/asthma/) - cramping [diarrhea](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158634.php) [indigestion](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163484.php) - colds - to boost overall health Scientists need to do more research to confirm the benefits of using oregano, but there is some evidence that it could help: - fight bacteria - relieve [inflammation](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248423.php) - regulate blood sugar and lipids - fight [cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/cancer-oncology/) Oregano and other herbs provide antioxidants. Dietary antioxidants help the body eliminate free radicals, which are toxic substances that result from natural processes and environmental stresses. A buildup of free radicals can trigger oxidative [stress](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/145855.php). Oxidative stress can lead to cell damage that may result in various diseases, including cancer and [diabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/). Learn more [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506.php) about antioxidants. Antibacterial properties The main components of oregano essential oil are carvacrol and thymol. These may have antimicrobial properties. In a 2019 laboratory [study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/fpd.2018.2594?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&journalCode=fpd), carvacrol and thymol prevented various strains of Staphyloccus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria from developing in meat and dairy products, suggesting that it could help control bacterial growth in foods. Amid growing concerns about diseases becoming resistant to [antibiotics](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/10278.php), [researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6182053/) The oil showed \"significant antibacterial activity\" against 11 such microbes. This suggests that substances in oregano could play a role in fighting diseases that no longer respond to antibiotics. While these tests indicate that compounds in oregano may have antibacterial properties, it does not mean that eating oregano will prevent infections. [Vitamin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878.php) C is an antioxidant that plays a key role in the immune system. Which foods contain vitamin C? Find out [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325067.php). Anti-inflammatory properties According to one literature [overview](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232240488_Oregano_Overview_of_the_Literature_on_Health_Benefits), the oils and constituents of oregano oil, such as thymol and rosmarinic acid, appear to have anti-inflammatory properties. In animal studies, oregano extract has reduced inflammation that could lead to: - autoimmune [arthritis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7621.php) - allergic asthma [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/rheumatoid-arthritis/) It is worth noting that the studies used concentrated extracts of oregano. This is not the same as humans eating oregano in the diet. Rosemary is another herb that may have anti-inflammatory properties.

Scientists have found [evidence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232240488_Oregano_Overview_of_the_Literature_on_Health_Benefits) that extracts may help prevent DNA damage in cells due to oxidative stress, radiation, and mitogens, a type of protein that can cause unwanted cell division. Researchers have also found evidence that carvacrol and thymol may prevent [melanoma](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154322.php) cells from growing and [skin cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154322.php) from spreading. While eating oregano by itself is unlikely to prevent cancer, a varied, plant-based diet that is rich in antioxidants may help prevent cell changes that can lead to cancer. In 2013, lab [studies](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0068808) suggested that Origanum majorana could help slow or stop the progression of metastatic [breast cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37136.php). How can diet affect the risk of cancer? Find out [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325998.php). Diabetes Compounds in oregano may help manage [type 2 diabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/type2diabetes.php). Authors of a 2016 rodent [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5242351/) - improve [insulin resistance](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/305567.php) - regulate the expression of genes that affect fat and [carbohydrate](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161547.php)metabolism - restore damaged liver and kidney tissues The authors noted that some people already use oregano leaves and oil to manage high blood sugar levels. [Type 1 diabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/type1diabetes.php) is an autoimmune disease. Experts do not know what causes it, but oxidative stress [may play a role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5059829/) In 2015, [researchers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/methanolic-extract-of-origanum-vulgare-ameliorates-type-1-diabetes-through-antioxidant-antiinflammatory-and-antiapoptotic-activity/0B722406E59FAE75536142525377E5C1) found that an extract of oregano improved type 1 diabetes in mice. They suggested this could be due to oregano's antioxidant properties, its effect on the immune system, and its ability to prevent cell death. Which other herbs and spices may help with diabetes? Find out [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317051.php). Depression In 2018, [scientists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842484/) [depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933.php) due to chronic unpredictable stress. After 14 days, stress-related behavior improved in rats that received the oregano treatment. The study authors concluded that oregano might relieve stress-related behavior.

However, it is unlikely to cause harm in most people as long as people do not consume too much oregano oil and ensure that any topical applications use a diluted form of the oil.
