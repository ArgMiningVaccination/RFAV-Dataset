The forum was organized in recognition of both the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 that Indigenous Peoples in Canada (First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis) and internationally have experienced, as well as the multitude of countermeasures to the pandemic that they have enacted. CIHR-funded research teams conducting Indigenous health research focused on COVID-19 were invited to present at the forum, to share what they have learned throughout the pandemic. This event builds on CIHR's commitment to knowledge mobilization and recognizes the important role of knowledge mobilization in [Indigenous Health Research](50340.html). The goal of the forum was to create an opportunity for CIHR-funded research teams conducting Indigenous Health Research about COVID-19 to share their research design, methodologies, and/or findings (to tell their stories) and build relationships and community amongst research teams and other forum participants through discussion, connections, ceremony, and teachings in a supportive virtual environment. Due to travel restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the forum was held as a free virtual event, which took place via Zoom, over three days. Each day had a unique theme that was designated based on the presenters' content: - October 26, 1:00-4:00pm EDT: Indigenous wellness amidst the COVID-19 pandemic - October 27, 1:00-4:00pm EDT: Opioid use, harm reduction, COVID-19, & Indigenous communities - October 28, 1:00-4:00pm EDT: COVID-19 and Indigenous health: Modeling, digital health, public health, hospital use, countermeasures On the third day, a special international session was organized in partnership with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, the Health Research Council of New Zealand, and the CIHR-IIPH: - October 28, 6:00-8:00pm EDT: Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19 in Australia, Canada and New Zealand Over 140 people registered for the forum, including researchers and knowledge users, such as policy or decision-makers, health-care providers, Indigenous community members, and international partners. The anticipated outcomes of the forum were: - An informal network of CIHR-funded research teams who are conducting Indigenous health research about COVID-19. - A COVID-19 and Indigenous Peoples digital knowledge bundle: A collection of resources that have been produced by the CIHR-funded research teams, or shared at the forum, related to Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19. - A summary report of the virtual knowledge mobilization forum.

Following the welcome and opening prayer by Owe cio whew Mabel Horton, and opening remarks by the CIHR-IIPH Scientific Director and the CIHR Vice President-Research Programs, we heard presentations and group discussions from representatives of four CIHR-funded research teams. In the first presentation, Joan Riggs presented \"Our journey to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental and physical health of Indigenous people\". Joan spoke about the teams' project which aims to characterize the needs of Indigenous Peoples in terms of mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical health. The project also sought to identify socio-cultural factors influencing health, how Indigenous Peoples navigate healthcare services during the pandemic, as well as barriers to accessing healthcare services. Next, we heard from Dr. Renee Linklater and Dr. Samantha Wells, on \"The First Nations Wellness Initiative During COVID: Challenges, Mitigating Strategies and Accomplishments\". Drs. Linklater and Wells shared the challenges and accomplishments from a collaborative model for developing community-driven, evidence-informed, and community-based wellness strategies addressing mental health and substance use in First Nations Communities. Dr. Nancy Young presented \"Connecting Indigenous wisdom and digital strategies to promote wellness among Indigenous children\". She shared the approaches the team took to shift their project after the pandemic hit to continue to promote wellness among Indigenous children and youth. Lastly, Chris Bendevis and Dr. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Laperri\u00e8re presented a video about \"Niikaniganaw (All My Relations) II - the COVID-19 Rapid Response: Indigenous approaches to synthesizing knowledge for culturally-safe and stigma free mental health care for under-served Indigenous communities in Ottawa-Gatineau\" which was followed by a group discussion about incorporating ceremony into virtual research. Dr. Earl Nowgesic provided closing remarks for the day and Owe cio whew Mabel Horton provided a closing prayer. Throughout the day, we heard many similarities between all presenters. There is a lack of support for community-based organizations within the research realm and many of these organizations and communities are having to overcome these challenges on their own. We learned that the pandemic has halted programs and support services for youth and community members and how researchers and community members are working together to identify solutions in a culturally safe way. The importance of maintaining and creating ongoing relationships during the pandemic was identified by all presenters. We heard how ceremony, talking circles and knowledge sharing events are being adapted to virtual spaces so that communities can continue to work towards culturally safe mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical health for Indigenous Peoples. - Agenda Start Time Agenda Item Session Title / Details Speaker 1:00 EDT 10 min Welcome & Opening Prayer Owe cio whew Mabel Horton will open the forum in a good way Owe cio whew Mabel Horton 1:10 EDT 5 min Opening Remarks from CIHR-IIPH Opening remarks from CIHR-IIPH Scientific Director CIHR-IIPH Scientific Director 1:15 EDT 5 min Remarks from CIHR Remarks from Dr. Tammy Clifford, CIHR Vice President-Research Programs Dr. Tammy Clifford 1:20 EDT 5 min Introduction to Graphic Recording Remarks from Erica Bota, Fuselight Creative Graphic Recorder Erica Bota 1:25pm EDT 15 min Oral Presentations & Discussion Our journey to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental and physical health of Indigenous people Joan Riggs 15 min The First Nations Wellness Initiative During COVID: Challenges, Mitigating Strategies and Accomplishments Dr. Renee Linklater & Dr. Samantha Wells 15 min Connecting Indigenous wisdom and digital strategies to promote wellness among Indigenous children Dr. Nancy Young 20 min Questions & Group Discussion Moderator, Dr. Earl Nowgesic 2:30 EDT 20 min Break 2:50 EDT 50 min Video and Group Discussion Video: Niikaniganaw (All My Relations) II - the COVID-19 Rapid Response: Indigenous approaches to synthesizing knowledge for culturally-safe and stigma free mental health care for under-served Indigenous communities in Ottawa-Gatineau Discussion: Virtual ceremony and research Chris Bendevis & Dr. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Laperri\u00e8re Moderator, Dr. Earl Nowgesic 3:40 EDT 10 min Closing Remarks Closing comments from the moderator Dr. Earl Nowgesic 3:50 EDT 10 min Closing Prayer Owe cio whew Mabel Horton will close day one in a good way Owe cio whew Mabel Horton End 4:00 EDT Day 2: Opioid use, harm reduction, COVID-19, & Indigenous communities October 27, 2021. 1:00-4:15pm EDT [](../images/iiph_km-forum-day-2-en.jpg) Long description Day 2: Opioid Use, Harm Reduction, COVID-19, and Indigenous Communities - Opioid Use, Harm Reduction, COVID-19, and Indigenous Communities - Listen to our senses - Turning inwards - Paying attention to the sky - Nature is healing; Let it heal & teach you - Beauty in simplicity - Take care of the Earth & each other - The Earth is changing - Letting go of the past - The Beaver is the architect of life; knows when to work and build its house - The Deer watches over every other clan - The Wolf gives us the gift of releasing our ego; we're the only species that have one - A Butterfly is like love - Each being has its own message - Even a blade of grass - Take care of our rivers - Living in harmony - Our hearts are in our people - From broad dissemination & uptake of research - Knowledge translation frameworks - Opioid use among First Nations in Ontario - 2 reports - How are opioids being prescribed?

Owe cio whew Mabel Horton offered an opening prayer and Dr. Earl Nowgesic provided opening remarks. The first session \"To all my relations, Indigenous Cosmology\", with Wisdom Keeper Mary Wilson spoke about the importance of our connection with the land and nature and how the pandemic has helped us remember this connection. She spoke about the responsibility to bring back stories and culture, and how she looks forward to seeing Indigenous Peoples continue to embrace this way of thinking. Following Wisdom Keeper Mary's session, we heard presentations and group discussions from representatives of four CIHR-funded research teams. Bernadette deGonzague and Dr. Tara Gomes presented \"Understanding Opioid Use among First Nations People in Ontario\". Their project aimed to better understand the health crisis of opioid use, the current characteristics, and trends, as well as the pathways of healthcare use and treatment outcomes among First Nations in Ontario. Next, Caterina Kendrick and Savannah Swann discussed \"Processing process: An environmental scan of adaptations to harm reduction services during COVID-19\". Caterina and Savannah spoke about how Communities, Alliances and Networks (CAAN) and the Dr. Peter AIDS Foundation have partnered to conduct an environmental scan of adaptations to harm reduction services and programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to identify culturally wise practices and how community organizations have adapted throughout the pandemic. Jocelyn Paul, Dr. Sarah Larney, Camille Zolopa, Dr. Dennis Wendt, and Dr. Emiliana Bomfirm then presented on \"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth substance use among Indigenous Communities\". Their project aimed to understand the impact of the pandemic on substance use risk and resilience among Indigenous youth through a knowledge synthesis, which included a rapid review, interviews and Talking Circles with Indigenous communities and providers. Lastly, we heard a panel presentation by Dr. Brittany Barker, Dr. Karen Urbanoski, Shawn Wood, and Heather Spence, \"A mixed methods study to evaluate the impact of prescribed safer supply to address the dual public health crises of COVID-19 and overdose: Experiences of Indigenous people who use substances in British Columbia\". They spoke about the partnership between people with lived/living experience and the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) in which they conducted a province-wide mixed methods study to gather information from people who use substances on their experiences with the program. Dr. Earl Nowgesic provided closing comments and Owe cio whew Mabel Horton provided a closing prayer and invited Wisdom Keeper Mary Wilson to help close day two with a song on the drum. During day two, we heard about the worrying trends and impacts of opioid use among First Nations living in Ontario and a mixed methods evaluation of risk mitigation measures to address the dual public health crises of COVID-19 and overdose in BC. The teams showed us how they are adapting their research of Indigenous harm reduction to better align with the COVID-19 pandemic through culturally wise practices. We learned that many Indigenous youth have feelings of exacerbated anxiety and depression and other mental health challenges related to social distancing and lack of cultural activities. However, conversations with Indigenous youth showed that they are creative and resilient on how they can safely connect and/or participate in cultural events. - Agenda Start Time Agenda Item Session Title / Details Speaker 1:00 EDT 10 min Welcome & Opening Prayer Owe cio whew Mabel Horton will open day two in a good way Owe cio whew Mabel Horton 1:10 EDT 5 min Opening remarks Opening remarks from Dr. Earl Nowgesic, CIHR-IIPH Associate Scientific Director Dr. Earl Nowgesic 1:15 EDT 40 min Session with Wisdom Keeper Mary Wilson To all my relations, Indigenous cosmology Wisdom Keeper Mary Wilson 1:55 EDT 10 min Break 2:05 EDT 15 min Oral Presentations & Discussion Understanding Opioid Use among First Nations People in Ontario Bernadette deGonzague & Dr. Tara Gomes 15 min Processing process: An environmental scan of adaptations to harm reduction services during COVID-19 Caterina Kendrick & Savannah Swann 15 min The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth substance use among Indigenous Communities Jocelyn Paul, Dr. Sarah Larney, Camille Zolopa, Dr. Dennis Wendt, & Dr. Emiliana Bomfim 15 min Questions & Group Discussion Moderator, Dr. Earl Nowgesic 3:05 EDT 10 min Break 3:15 EDT 40 min Panel Presentation A mixed methods study to evaluate the impact of prescribed safer supply to address the dual public health crises of COVID-19 and overdose: Experiences of Indigenous people who use substances in British Columbia Dr. Brittany Barker, Dr. Karen Urbanoski, Shawn Wood, & Heather Spence 3:55 EDT 10 min Closing Remarks Closing comments from the moderator Dr. Earl Nowgesic 4:05 EDT 10 min Closing Prayer Owe cio whew Mabel Horton will close day two in a good way Owe cio whew Mabel Horton End 4:15 EDT Day 3: COVID-19 and Indigenous health: Modeling, digital health, public health, hospital use, countermeasures October 28, 2021. 1:00-4:00pm EDT [](../images/iiph_km-forum-day-3-en.jpg) Long description Day 3: Modeling, Digital Health, Public Health, Hospital Use, Countermeasures - Modeling, Digital Health, Public Health, Hospital Use, Countermeasures - Urban Indigenous people - Comprehensive health status & health care utilization database - Document unmet health service needs - Track emergency room admissions - E.g., Rates of vaccination are lagging - COVID data - Collect data & have a useful database - Using social networks - Coupons - Enhanced chain referral sampling - Peer recruitment - Indigenous storytelling - Transparency - Accountability - Accurate and timely - How do Indigenous people define high-quality virtual primary care - Increased safety - Virtual care - Equity - In emergency care during COVID-19 - Role of ceremony - Who is not coming in and why not? - Ethical accountability - Creates a sense of safety - Healing & reconciliation - Supports power balancing - First Nations may have had less access to services that provide care outside the hospital setting - Many First Nations health services were redeployed to COVID-19 response during the first wave - This may explain why there was no observed decrease in hospitalizations among First Nations members - We need to use the data to have a genuine & real-time positive impact for Urban Indigenous communities - We all want high quality data - It requires meaningful relationship building with community partners - Communities are extremely capable - First Nations leaders require access to their own data (Below orange blob) To support evidence-based decisions - First Nations people face disproportionate impacts of COVID - Meaningful collaboration - First Nations data sovereignty and pandemic planning innovation in Manitoba - Web-based modeling - Culturally respectful protocols - Continuity Relationships Trust Access Convenience - The pandemic in an isolated area can be catastrophic - Countermeasures to COVID-19 can have significant impacts on social determinants of health - Social media becomes a window into innovative responses at the community level - The pandemic exacerbates existing difficulties for people living with health inequities - Community-based approaches - Facebook & other media - Community asset mobilization mapping CIHR-IIPH Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19 Virtual Knowledge Mobilization Forum October 2021 - Live Graphic Recording Erica Bota Summary Day three focused on understanding COVID-19 and Indigenous health in relation to modeling, digital health, public health, hospital use, and countermeasures. Once again Owe cio whew Mabel Horton opened the day in a good way by offering an opening prayer, and Dr. Earl Nowgesic offered opening comments. Following the welcome and opening remarks, Cheryllee Bourgeois, Stephanie McConkey, and Dr. Michael Rotondi conducted a presentation and roundtable about the Our Health Counts Toronto project's study linking their database to the COVID-19 data holdings at ICES (formally known as the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences), noting that incidence rates of COVID-19 amongst Indigenous people in Toronto were similar to those of the general population but that vaccination rates lagged behind the local and provincial rates, and highlighting the importance of these data for decision-makers. Dr. Wanda Phillips-Beck, Dr. Adriana Mudryj, and Stuart Campbell described their project to use existing partnerships to develop a web-based disease modelling platform to accurately predict COVID-19 spread in First Nations communities and discussed the importance of tools like this in supporting First Nations leaders and organizations to contribute to timely pandemic responses, mobilize infrastructure, and exercise data sovereignty. Dr. Pamela Roach's presentation focused on reflections about the challenges and successes of virtual primary care and research for Indigenous Peoples in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting that continuity, relationships, trust, access, and convenience emerged as key aspects to high quality virtual primary care for Indigenous Peoples. Dr. Christopher Fletcher, Glenda Sandy, and Dr. Julie Lauzi\u00e8re described their project's process and results of documenting community asset mobilization as evidenced in social media, noting that these examples of asset mobilization contributed to low incidence rates of COVID-19 in First Nations and Inuit communities in Quebec in the first wave of COVID-19. Dr. Patrick McLane and Lea Bill described their project to identify how pandemic-driven impacts on healthcare utilization may have aggravated existing vulnerabilities or inequities in access to emergency care, finding that visits to the emergency department by First Nations members declined in the first year of the pandemic, but that the number of high acuity visits did not, speculating that this may be related to many First Nations members regularly delaying visits to the hospital until they are very sick due to limited access to health services and racism. The presenters emphasized the criticality of incorporating ceremony and cultural practices throughout their project. Dr. Earl Nowgesic provided closing comments and Owe cio whew Mabel Horton provided a closing prayer. Several of the day three presentations discussed the critical importance of Indigenous data sovereignty during COVID-19. They stressed that accurate, timely, high quality, and locally relevant data and innovative tools must be available to First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis leaders to support evidence-based decision-making and fund infrastructure, capacity, and capability. Further to this, it was emphasized that First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis communities are self-determining and more than capable of making their own decisions and managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Presenters stressed that the gifts and wellness in Indigenous communities must be recognized. Presenters also shared that the pandemic has influenced health care for Indigenous Peoples, including shifting trends in emergency department use and increased use of virtual primary health care. Finally, it was clear throughout all the presentations that Elders, culture, ceremonies and respectful relationships play a crucial role in research initiatives and can promote reconciliation and healing. - Agenda Start Time Agenda Item Session Title / Details Speaker 1:00 EDT 10 min Welcome & Opening Prayer Owe cio whew Mabel Horton will open day three in a good way Owe cio whew Mabel Horton 1:10 EDT 5 min Opening remarks Opening remarks from Dr. Earl Nowgesic, CIHR-IIPH Associate Scientific Director Dr. Earl Nowgesic 1:15 EDT 45 min Roundtable Indigenous Health Counts: Estimating rates of COVID-19 testing, diagnosis and vaccine uptake among the urban Indigenous community living in Toronto Cheryllee Bourgeois, Stephanie McConkey, & Dr. Michael Rotondi 2:00 EDT 20 min Break 2:20 EDT 15 min Oral Presentations & Discussion First Nation data sovereignty and pandemic planning innovation in Manitoba Dr. Wanda Phillips-Beck, Dr. Adriana Mudryj, & Stuart Campbell 15 min Virtual Relationships in virtual worlds: enhancing Indigenous primary care in response to COVID-19 Dr. Pamela Roach, Dr. Stephanie Montesanti, Dr. Rita Henderson, Dr. Cheryl Barnabe, Dr. Lynden Crowshoe, & Dr. Esther Tailfeathers 15 min How Indigenous communities in Quebec responded to COVID-19: A synthesis of community-level asset mobilization during the first wave of the pandemic Dr. Christopher Fletcher, Glenda Sandy, & Dr. Julie Lauzi\u00e8re 15 min Equity in Emergency Department Utilization in Alberta for Priority Populations during the COVID-19 Pandemic Dr. Patrick McLane & Lea Bill 15 min Questions & Group Discussion Moderator, Dr. Earl Nowgesic 3:35 EDT 10 min Forum Summary Recap of the forum and invitation to attend the international session Moderator, Dr. Earl Nowgesic 3:45 EDT 5 min Remarks from CIHR-IIPH Remarks from Dr. Earl Nowgesic Dr. Earl Nowgesic 3:50 EDT 10 min Closing Prayer Owe cio whew Mabel Horton will close the session in a good way Owe cio whew Mabel Horton End 4:00 EDT Special International Session: Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19 in Australia, Canada and New Zealand CANADA October 28, 6-8 pm EDT [](../images/iiph_km-forum-day-3-special-en.jpg) Long description Special International Session: Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19 in Australia, Canada and New Zealand Australia - 2020 - Indigenous communities led the way in planning responding and managing the pandemic - 2021 - High case number of COVID-19 infection rates and death - Vaccine hesitancy - More vaccinations are needed within Indigenous communities - Mistrust of Historical mainstream services & government - Connecting and Sticking together - Resiliency - When communities have control, they recover better - Leadership Cultural responsiveness Communication Equity - Self-determination Self-governance Community control - We know what our communities need Canada - Sharing local success stories - Our ancestors are waiting to help us - Waniska Time to wake up Indigenous knowledge - Many services that we depend on closed. - More Indigenous data owned by Indigenous people - People turned to Indigenous solutions - Treat the virus with respect & be mindful - Language - Coming back to Indigenous medicines - Land - Indigenous ways of knowing and doing New Zealand - We have learned not to wait - Government out of the way - We need to lead - Mori health equity central to our health policy - Trust is required - Equity lens - Indigenous voices - The impending disaster behind a COVID success story - Almost suppressed... except Delta - Became a pandemic of unvaccinated Mori - COVID-19 vaccine - Mori responded & achieved some of the country's highest vaccination rates - Informed decisions - The science says prioritize health equity for New Zealand Indigenous communities - But that didn't happen - The government ignored the science - Boots on the ground that are trusted CIHR-IIPH Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19 Virtual Knowledge Mobilization Forum October 2021 - Live Graphic Recording Erica Bota Summary In addition to the main forum session on day three, a special international session took place. This session was planned in partnership between the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Health Research Council of New Zealand, and focused on Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19 in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Following the welcome by Owe cio whew Mabel Horton and opening remarks by Dr. Earl Nowgesic, representatives from each of the three countries gave context-setting presentations about Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19 in their country. Dr. Cath Chamberlain presented first, discussing the impact of COVID-19 on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia in 2020 and 2021, the important role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership in COVID-19 prevention and management, and outlined a project to develop a culturally-responsive trauma-informed public health emergency framework for First Nations communities during COVID-19. Next, Andrew Sporle spoke about the role of science in managing New Zealand's COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting inequities for Mori people because available science was not universally acted upon, and showcasing the strong Mori community responses to COVID-19. Margaret K\u00eesik\u00e2w Piy\u00eas\u00ees then discussed connections between COVID-19 and colonialism, and highlighted the importance of revitalizing Indigenous ways of knowing and being regarding medicine, viruses, healing, and wellness. Following a break, the three presenters took part in a panel discussion, moderated by Dr. Earl Nowgesic, which touched on various themes on Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19, ranging from community involvement in the COVID-19 response, to traditional Indigenous medicines and knowledge, to the role of the arts in Indigenous resilience and sharing stories. Following the panel discussion, Professor Yvonne Cadet-James summarized the special international session and gave closing remarks, after which Wisdom Keeper Mary Wilson gave a prayer and closed the virtual knowledge mobilization forum on Indigenous Peoples and COVID-19 in a good way. All of the speakers were clear that Indigenous communities and organizations play crucial leadership roles in responding to COVID-19 in all three countries. The speakers also highlighted that the pandemic has had physical, social, mental, emotional, and spiritual health impacts for Indigenous Peoples, and that many Indigenous Peoples experienced inequities during COVID-19. The speakers emphasized that there is a need for leadership and strategies for dealing with the pandemic in the three countries. Relatedly, it was clear that Indigenous communities and organizations stepped up and made informed decisions to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, and that space should be made for Indigenous leadership to do this work, as they know what their communities need. Margaret K\u00eesik\u00e2w Piy\u00eas\u00ees' presentation in particular emphasized the importance of traditional medicines, the land, medicine, and healers in dealing with COVID-19 and other diseases. Ultimately, the speakers highlighted that Indigenous solutions and leadership are crucial for dealing with the ongoing pandemic. - Agenda Start Time Agenda Item Session Title / Details Speaker 6:00pm EDT 5 min Welcome & Opening Prayer Owe cio whew Mabel Horton will open the international session in a good way with prayer and welcome to participants Owe cio whew Mabel Horton 6:05pm EDT 5 min Opening remarks Opening remarks from Dr. Earl Nowgesic, CIHR-IIPH Associate Scientific Director Dr. Earl Nowgesic 6:10pm EDT 45 min Context-Setting Presentation from each Country Speakers to provide an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on Indigenous Peoples in their country, along with insights/experience from their specific research project or community context AUS: Dr. Cath Chamberlain NZ: Mr. Andrew Sporle CAN: K\u00eesik\u00e2w Piy\u00eas\u00ees 6:55pm EDT 10 min Break 7:05pm EDT 40 min Panel Discussion Moderated Q&A session AUS: Dr. Cath Chamberlain & Dr. Simon Graham Mr. Andrew Sporle CAN: Ms. Margaret K\u00eesik\u00e2w Piy\u00eas\u00ees 7:45pm EDT 10 min Closing Remarks Closing Remarks Professor Yvonne Cadet-James 7:55pm EDT 5 min Closing Prayer Wisdom Keeper Mary Wilson will close our session in a good way Wisdom Keeper Mary Wilson End 8:00pm EDT - Date modified: - "}
