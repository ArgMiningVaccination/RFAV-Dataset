The site chos en for this development lay at the heart of the campus of the Illinois Veteran's Home in Quincy in Adams County, Illinois. Perkins Eastman's planning for the campus was inspired by the rich history of the campus overlaid with a robust site and functional program analysis. The programming was informed by clear leader-ship vision and also interviews with the staff that are directly involved in the care for our veterans and the operation of the campus. The design of this Center of Excellence took shape over th e last several months and helped deepen and extend the Master Planning effort completed earlier. The infrastructural foundations for this vision needed a team of engineers and design professionals that brought a deep knowledge of both the operating campus and its current and future needs. Per- kins Eastman entrusted this campus -wide assessment of civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire -protection and technology infrastructure to a team of experts with a vision to creating a Campus of the Fu ture. Apart from the engineers above, the team also included landscape archi- tects, dietary and food service consultants, geotechnical and environmental consultants, historic preservationists, specification and cost consultants. The team was expected to help create 'Bridging Documents' that would be handed to a team of De-sign-Builders ('D -B') chosen by the State's selection committee to complete the design and construc- tion activities in a phased manner over a period of four to five years. Bridging Document s can be generally defined as a set of architectural and engineering drawings and narratives, of sufficient clarity to enable the Design -Builder teams to assess scope, develop design, assign costs, and arrive at plans for execution. To enable a smooth process of execution, it was crucial for a Bridging Process to obtain input from the many partner State and Federal agencies involved in the project's success. While the Illinois De-partment of Veterans' Affairs ('IDVA') is the primary Using Agency that help ed guide the overall pro- gram and design direction with the CDB's management guidance, input on requirements and ac-ceptance of design direction was also obtained from the following agencies: The Capital Development Board of the State of Illinois ('CDB'), w hich provides overall man- agement of the project and guidance on minimum design and construction standards. It pro-vides periodic multi -disciplinary reviews at drawing document milestones and also helps ad- minister the Art in Architecture program for the proj ect. The CDB also oversees the sustainable goals for the project established as meeting the min- imum SILVER standard of the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED program (Leadership in En- ergy and Environmental Design). The design team's efforts have targeted t he achievement of a LEED GOLD level or higher with special attention paid to factors that enhance the indoor environmental, air, and water quality. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ('USDVA'), which helps establish minimum stand- ards that support a pa rtial reimbursement of project costs. It also establishes recommended guidelines and best practices for Small House design. CDB 040- 010-115 Executive Summary - Page 2 11/11/2019 The Illinois Department of Public Health ('IDPH') Division of Long Term Care, whose staff will be inspecting and approving the Long -Term -Care ('LTC') building project for licensure in the State as a Skilled Nursing Facility. Illinois Department of Public Health's Division of Environmental Health ('IDPH Env. Health') which oversees the Plumbing and Water Quality Program, and which sets the standards for plumbing water distribution and the plumbing and environmental health issues impacting the design of the central and distributed cooking and serving kitchens. The Illinois Department of Innovation and Technology ('DOIT'), which sets the s tandards and approves the design direction for Technology, which generally includes Communication, Au-dio-Visual, Security, Nurse -Call and Wander Management plans. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources ('IDNR') and its State Historic Preservation Of- fice ('SHPO'), which guide the response to the historic campus context including campus character and overall building scale, exterior form and materiality. The Quincy Fire Department ('FPD'), which requires approval of the Fire Prevention strategy including access and emergency response. In each case above, the project planning and design has been taken through a preliminary approval phase. Subsequent design development and approval of plans for construction shall be the respon- sibility of the Design -Builder ('D-B'). Campus resilience has remained an important design driver at all levels of infrastructure and build-ing design. This resilience is gained from using renewable and or redundant sources of energy, re-dundant access and connectivity to utilities, back -up plans for mechanical heating and ventilation capacity for emergency preparedness and a the use of a minimal maintenance super -insulated build- ing envelope that helps mitigate unpredictable or extreme weather events. Campus -wide and building specific, Perkins Eastman had embraced the opportunity to create a plat- form for a comprehensive and coordinated campus design effort that would support the creation of a Center of Excellence for the care of our veterans. The Mission Statement of the Illinois Vet erans' Home Quincy \"The Illinois Veterans' Home in Quincy is responsible for providing economical and quality Long Term Care for veterans and their spouses which includes domiciliary care, intermediate care, and skilled care. These services are provided by a multi -disciplinary group of health care professionals as well as an array of supportive staff. These services are directed to provide multiple physical services as well as restorative services to maintain maximum functioning capacity.\" The underlying pu rpose of the Bridging Documents are to support the Mission Statement of the Illi- nois Veterans Home in Quincy . Transforming the campus through excellence in design The following principles reflect the key design goals for the design team. The following goals were establis hed for the project and guided all design decision making: Creating a center of excellence for our veterans, where resident care will be enhanced great- ly in a new supportive environment. Promoting resident focused design , with emphasis on a home -like envir onment, amenities to build a sense of community, enhanced culinary experience, and life -long learning. Celebrating history , by creating the heart of the campus through cohesive site planning and landscape enhancement. CDB 040- 010-115 Executive Summary - Page 3 11/11/2019 Supporting the future of the campus through comprehensive infrastructure upgrade and smart technology. Basing the design on staffing & operational efficiencies gained through a deep engagement with leadership and staff across all divisions. Providing the timeless architectural design that is inspired by the surrounding historic con- texts, materiality, and scale between mature trees and historic characteristics on campus. High -performance design with a focus on wellness of the residents Integrating sustainability into every step of the design and decision making process is a primary driv- er in this transformation. Not only do the high -performance design goals aim to reduce the campus - wide energy use, but they also draw attention to the central focus on creating a healthy and comfort-able environm ent for residents and staff. The followings are key considerations as the Design Builders are brought in to realize the visions set out by the design team and the Using Agency. Expanding the focus on wellness by creating healthy environment and promote active life- style through design and infrastructure. Access to Nature, Daylight, and biophilic principlesemployed to promote healthy living Balancing the Social, Environmental, and Economic factors Planning for campus resilience : Using renewable and or r edundant sources of energy, redun- dant access and connectivity to utilities, back -up plans for mechanical heating and ventila- tion capacity for emergency preparedness. Life-cycle analysis and durability of materials and system choices to assist the Using Age ncy to make informed decisions Third Party Verification through LEED as well as commissioning not only confirms that the se- lected design strategies have been actually employed in the final construction, but alsodemonstrates the State's and VA's commitment to the environments. Further sustainable design strategies are provided in detail under Architectural, Mechanical, and Electrical Narrative section s.

They shall author design development, construction document, and permitting plan sets, along with specifications. The Design Bu ilder shall be responsible for cost estimating, bidding, construction management, construction, [FFE and its installation], tabulation, and post -construction warrantee work as prescribed and required in their scope of work contract. Bridging documents wi ll provide the Design Builder team with information and the platform required to complete the Work which consisting of: 1.

Central Utility Plant and New Electrical Infrastructure 4. Minor renovations of selected existing buildings Illinois Veterans' Home Quincy / CDB 040 -010-115 NV5.COM | 6 3.0 OPR INTRODUCTION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The intent of the Owner Program Requirements (OPR) is to accurately and ef fectively communicate User Agency project vision; their expectations, goals , and requirements . The OPR should be to distributed to all Design Builder personnel and to all those subcontracted. The Design Builder must review OPR contents with the maximum quantity of individuals possible. Whether it be senior project managers and superintendents or on-site laborers and off-site sub - contractor administra tors, the more personnel that understand goals and requirements the greater the successe s and less likely there will be incongruences. Once fully developed the OPR becomes an important User Agency tool for judging Design Builder performance . The 'Bridging' OPR contains detailed, descriptive information gathered the months of efforts lead by 'Bridging Architect' Perkins Eastman - Chicago . The OPR contains narratives to communicate the concepts and intent baked into bridging designs , all of which convey User Agency requirements . The OPR communicate s 'big picture' design intent as well as the nuance of why specific design choices are specified in bridging documents. The OPR is perhaps one of the most under -utilized, least understood tools in the industry? Its purpose is similar to that of Building Inf ormation Modeling 's (BIM) job to ensure building systems work seamlessly to accomplish their intended purpose. What would happen if a ventilation duct was installed in the same space as a domestic hot water piping should be? What happens when a 2 hour rate d firewall is installed when a 4 hour rated firewall was designed to meet local code? The OPR is the tool that helps to ensure 'everyone' is on the same page. Whether it be the professional engineers or team responsible for the buildings' final cleaning , everything is connected in some way. The OPR should evolve team unification resource for the Design Builder designers and User Agency durin g design development . It gives teams a comprehensive unified understand ing of aesthetic s, purpose, intent, security, and performance expectations. The OPR gives Design Builder teams the User Agency requirement for how they want staff, occupant s, and visitor s to experience the campus and buildings . The OPR is an invaluable tool for Design Builders to better understand relationships between engineering, architecture, interior design, and scheduling among others. The OPR helps guide Design Builders on the design, installation, and operation of energy, waste, water, lighting, outdoor air, and sewage conveyance s ystems among others including their myriad of complexities . It serves as a project -wide design and construction guideline and communication tool to describe in detail how the final product should provide a healthy, comfortable, safe, and clean indoor environment where mea ls are served and residents are cared for. It is the OPR that gives the Illinois Veterans' Home Quincy / CDB 040 -010-115 NV5.COM | 7 Design Builder critical information about User Agency's requirement to create high -performing , durable, low -maintenance , sustainable buildings that instill a sense of well -being to all those who work, live, and visit them. Design Builder , each Design Builder team , and each individual associated with the project's design, construction, operations, and maintenance must become familiar with the bridging OPR and Bridging Architect Project Manual Volume 01: Architectural Narrative , no matter their respective position or discipline. It is the obligation of every Design Builder team member to fully comprehend the intensi ons, time , resources, and efforts invested in to the Bridging Design Documents that preceded the inclusion of the Design Builder. In its final form the OPR will be the go -to reference for the Design Builder designers and constructors; the User Agency and their building operation managers, campus operation managers and their departments. Even to those such as the director of campus security, central plant managers, landscape maintenance managers, and campus facility administrators in and outside project sco pe. 3.1 BASIS OF DESIGN (BOD ) The BOD is an associated document also serving as a project -wide communication tool . The BOD is used in conjunction with the OPR . The OPR lays out User Agency expectations , requirements, and goals in narrative form. The BOD lays out and communicates User Agency expectations , requirements, and goals in high -level technical terms. The BOD provides technical data, performance metrics, functionality and operation criteria for the gamut of engineering (MEP -HVAC -Civil-Structural -Infrast ructure) , control systems , building automation systems, building envelope, way -finding , information technologies, security, commercial kitchen, laundry, medical equipment, residential appliances, dwellings, renewable energy, domestic hot water, process water, ventilation and water purification, life safety, fire protection, specialized equipment (elevators , disability and infirmed transport , back -up electrical generation, disaster preparedness , public announcement, media ) and others . The BOD provides technical details to serve as a platform for author ing final specifications , installation procedures, schedule phasing, cost estimating, and alternative compliance substitution. 3.2 DESIGN BUILDER BOD A UTHORING The Design Builder is r equired to utilize this document to launch the author ing and development of a comprehensive Agency User BOD , to meet requir ements and intent stated within and outlined in commissioning specifications. A finalized BOD is a required component of LEED v4 BD+C NC prerequisite 'Fundamental Commissioning and Verification, as is the OPR. The BOD is an essential part of the Commissioning Plan and associated commissioning activities that ensure s designed systems , their intended performance and functionality metrics are in accordance with , and align with those installed in the project . The BOD supports the Fundamental and Enhanced Commissioning Illinois Veterans' Home Quincy / CDB 040 -010-115 NV5.COM | 8 Plans' implementation ensuring designed and installed systems function and operate as intended upon completion of ini tial occupancy and 10 months post -occupancy . A Bridging BOD has not been provided and is not included in Bridging Document scope. 3.3 DESIGN BUILDER BRIDGING OPR - BRIDGING PROJECT MANUAL This document represents the 'bridging' OPR . The Design Builder is req uired to integrate the contents within along with the contents of all bridging documents. The Bridging Architect 's Project Manual Volume 01: Architectural Narrative will provide outlined topics and design elements to continue OPR development. Agency User/O wner Program Requirement continued development and initial authoring of the BOD must coincide the commencement of design development and continue as needed throughout the construction document phase . 3.4 DESIGN BUILDER EARLY OPR CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT It is strongly encouraged to prioritize an early as possible review of this document. This document is intended to serve the Design Builder in an early launch of OPR continued development as there are many benefits . The Design Builder may wish to use more developed OPR language to include in sub-contractor and vendor contracts? An early start supports quicker understanding of Agency User goals, needs, and requirements . I may prove helpful in synchronizing with Bridging Architect's Bridging Docum ents . With early OPR development Design Builder teams will be better equipped to start design development activities sooner in context of the project's myriad of comple xities? 3.5 OPR EVOLUTION The Design Builder should compel and/or require i ndividuals across disciplines to provide written and/or verbal feedback and comments prior to or no later that 5 working days of the OPR review meeting so they may contribu te to OPR development quickly . The Design Build er shall encourage and seek out comments, questions, concerns, input, and sugge stions from every individual no matter their role , no matter their duties. As part of the Integrative Process, cross -disciplinary contributions are strongly encouraged, proven invaluable to improving project outcome. OPR and BOD evolution coincides design development and is a requisite for achieving LEED credit IPc1: Integrative Process, Commissioning Plan development , and User Agency sustainabilit y goals . Illinois Veterans' Home Quincy / CDB 040 -010-115 NV5.COM | 9 3.6 OPR - A DECISIVE TOOL When the Design Builder and Design Builder team s contribute to the OPR, they become more intimate , more rapidly with required criteria and strategies expected by the User Agency . As team members further their comprehension of the OPR and Bridging Documents, the higher the likelihood teams will be more efficient and more productive. Combined with Integrative Process strategies a deep understanding of the OPR and BOD raises profitability while reducing conflic t and risk. It is for these and many reasons that the OPR and BOD are required for the third -party commissioning and verification. 3.7 NV5 OPR - BOD - CX OVE RSIGHT NV5 shall facilitate the entire third -party fundamental and enhanced commissioning and verification process . This includes the ongoing evolution and development of the Owner Program Requirements and Basis of Design . The Design Builder is required to include the NV5 Commissioning Authority (CxA) in all applicable design revi ews during the Design Development and Construction Document authoring phases. The Design Builder is required to seek out the CxA's expert ise and guidance to support decision making related to systems scheduled to be commissioned. The NV5 CxA reports to and performs tasks on behalf of the User Agency to ensure the established qualitative and quantitative design parameters align with and function as intended during real-life installed conditions . Installed real -life performance prior to occupancy and 10 month s post -occupancy is considered the primary qualitative measureme nt to project systems successful functionality. A central benchmark indicator to the success of the project and User agency satisfaction. 3.8 NV5 SUSTAINABILITY - LEED CERTIFICATIO N OVERSIGHT NV5 shall be overseeing and supporting the Design Builder teams to ensure the User Agency's and Bridging Architect's designs , strategies , and requirements are met to achieve the goals for sustainability , resiliency, and LEED Gold certification . 3.9 DESIGN BUILDER OPR - BOD TEAM UPDATE REQUIREMENTS OPR evolution initiate s and maintain s a constructive, integrative, collaborative dialog not only between the Design Builder design and construction team s, but also the User Agency . The Design Builder is required to evolve the OPR and BOD coinciding design development . The Design Builder shall communicate changes and updates to the OPR and/ or BOD through digital and/or hard copy document distribution avenues, discuss during weekly projec t update meetings or other means . The Design Builder must ensure updates to the OPR and BOD are efficiently communicated to personnel as applicable. Illinois Veterans' Home Quincy / CDB 040 -010-115 NV5.COM | 10 3.10 INTE GRATIVE PROCESS Embracing and implementing integrative process strategies as early as possible cann ot be over emphasized. As part of the integrative process and achieving criteria and requirements found in LEED credit IPc1: Integrative Process the Design Builder must consider techniques that include facilitating in -person, multi -discipline, lengthy charrette meetings . If the Design Builder does not already have an experienced integrative process facilitator consider adding an Integrative Process Facilitator to the team. Face -to-face lengthy, collaborative focused, multidisciplinary charrette workshops s erve as the backbone to the integrative process. The Design Builder should consider contracting a facilitator and organizing an initial charrette workshop 'before' embarking on design development. If this initial charrette is not held before design develo pment, the effectiveness and beneficial outcomes decrease rapidly. The outcome of embracing the integrative process has been proven to yield an array of benefits that include Design Builder team strong unification , reducing personal conflict, markedly improved collaboration s, rapid decision making, streamlining design , construction, construction management, project a dministration , and exceeding sustainability goal s with no to low cost increases. Additional benefits include reduced risk, cost, waste, and effort. Please see the following integrative process guidance and benefit documents : Integrative Process (IP) ANSI Consensus National Standard LEED BD+C: New Construction LEED v4 Integrative process AIA Integrated Project Delivery Illinois Veterans' Home Quincy / CDB 040 -010-115 NV5.COM | 11 4.0 PROJECT HISTORY The latter half of 2018 saw the completion of a Masterplan for the Illinois Veterans' Home in Quincy. The plan broadly defines the needs of the campus at a programmatic and infrastructural level to support a phased expansion and modernization. With the completed Masterplan the State of Illinois's Capital Development Board ('CDB') commissioned Perkins Eastman Architects to develo p schematic design and create \"Bridging Documents,\" to launch the Design -Build phase to occur over a four to five year period . In December 2018, Perkins Eastman commenced the wo rk as the 'Bridging Architect' . One of the first objectives was to perform an in-depth, detailed set of analyses with an investigation and analysis of the site and followed by a broad set of programming exercises to define the needs of the 'User Agency' , campus users, and operations and maintenance personnel to identify challenges and begin to develop preliminary strategies to meet the needs for the campus, the new and existing buildings that are considered as part of the W ork. The P roject s' bridging phase consist ed of extensive integrative process meetings and charrettes, program ming analyses, existing condition evaluations and production of refined design plan sets, system specifications. Bridging documents will be used to select and qualify a Design Build er team . 5.0 CAMPUS REPOSITIONING The project is a first major step in transforming the campus towards the vision put forth in Quincy Illinois Veterans' Home Masterplan. There are 47 buildings residing on the approximately 220 acre campus . The Work consists of the New Long Term Care - Infirmary, New Domiciliary Building, New Utility T unnels and Ground Level Pedestrian T horoughfares to link buildings , and new electrical infrastructure . Renovations will be made to the c entral u tility plant and other selected buildings . Site development includ es necessary utilities to support the new and existing buildings' , their entry plaza(s), hardscape, landscape, parking, and site security. The new buildings, renovations , and site improvements follow the intent of the masterplan which is to unify and enhance the entire campus experience. The vision is to create a robust, aesthetically pleasing environment to support and grow the physical and mental health, well - being of occupants, and staff. The landscape of indigenous, native plantings, distinguished contemporary , yet fitting architectural style family and friends of the residents will be apt to visit frequently and spend more time with their loved ones. The new buildings and site elements have been designed to embody the vision of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Illinois Capital Development Board have for the future expansion of the Quincy Veterans' Home and facilities like it. The buildings have been thoughtfully designed incorporating the opinions, preferences, and desires of occupants, Illinois Veterans' Home Quincy / CDB 040 -010-115 NV5.COM | 12 personnel, and facilities operations and maintenance staff. not extravagant, with simple design gestures utilizing basic elements providing light filled spaces. Spaces shall include a comm on palette of interior, exterior and site materials and details that are used in a manner appropriate to the site and each building. 6.0 MISSION - VALUES HONOR ING ECONOMICS, HUMAN BEINGS, AND TH E NATURAL WORLD The State of Illinois and Department of Veterans Affairs shared core values is to honor citizens and veterans to the greatest extent possible. This project stands a testament to those values by creating state -of-the-art facilities to honor the physical and mental health, well -being, and prosperity of th ose who have served the nation. This project intends to set a new benchmark for similar facilities in the state and around the country. Illinois and the VA are committed to providing facilities that embrace the adoption of a paradigm shift. A shift from the unsustainable 'bottom line' culture to a sustainable 'Triple Bottom Line' culture. Rather than a primary focus on dollars , as a culture we must shift to wards creating balance between economic, human, and environmental prosperity. The shift to the 'tri ple bottom line' is astonishingly simple, based on proven practices employed for centuries. 7.0 BRIDGING ARCHITECT - BRIDGING DOCUMENTS The Design Builder must refer to the Bridging Architect's Volumes 01 - 03 to continue further develop and refine this docum ent so it may evolve towards completion.

In Quincy, the campus is bound along N. 12th Street to the east, N. 5th Street to the west, Locust Street to the south, and the BNSF railway to the north. The projects include the construction of a new 210 -unit Long Term Care facility, a new 80 -unit Domi- ciliary, and renovations to various structures on the campus. The project building footprints are lo-cated at the heart of the campus. The infrastructure and utility upgrades, however, extend past this immediate area of impact and extend to other areas of the campus. Bridging Document design intent, phasing and context The project Bridging Documents will be comprised of Bridging Team drawings and project manuals , which will be included in the Request for Proposal (RFP) from the CDB. The project manual is assembled in the form of design narratives that are used to describe the de-sign intent for the project. The intent has been established after the programming ph ase and after meetings with the various regulatory agencies and Authorities Having Jurisdiction ('AHJ's). Due to the extent of regulatory input into the design development, it is required that the design intent expressed in the narrative for each discipli ne is adhered to in the development of the design. An ex- ample would be the move to develop the design using the VA's support for Small House models of care and operation and related limits on the number of resident rooms per household and neighbor-hood. Another example would be the careful correlation between the phasing adopted by the CDB and the IDVA and the mechanical narrative outlining the continuity of campus -wide heating and cool- ing operations. Project outline specifications are assembled in the Project Manual Volumes 1, 2 and 3 as to help guide expectations and generate minimum standards for quality, in conjunction with required code and regulations. The Bridging team has viewed and analyzed existing conditions on campus and utilized knowledge gained through leadership meetings, staff interviews, Federal and State regulatory agency pre - reviews and considered long -term durability, maintenance and life -cycle performance and cost anal- ysis when establishing the Bridging Documents. These deliberations, i n consultation with the Using Agency and the Capital Development Board, have informed the design. These drawings have been coordinated as best possible with the architectural work and engineering disciplines as appropriate for this limited stage of design. These documents are not to be considered representative of the only solution for the Design - Build work, nor are they to be considered fully complete or accurate, and representative of what is needed to design and construct the project; it is fully the re sponsibility of the Design -Build team to provide all engineering design and construction phase services to meet the codes and standards stated, all ap-plicable codes and standards for design and construction in Illinois. Further, they shall meet all re-quire ments to allow the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs (IDVA) to make federal reimburse- ment submissions to the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs (USDVA) The Bridging Documents architectural and engineering teams will remain available for general con-sultation as approved or authorized by the CDB, but all design and design related decisions shall be the responsibility of the Design -Build team. Certain minimal items or strategies deemed critical to campus or agency operations are listed under the No Deviations List. Certain other items required for consistency of Agency operations are includ- CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 4 11/11/2019 ed in a Sole -Source list. The D -B shall refer to this list for scope and requirement that cannot be de- viated from. Any deviation from this list could result in negative impacts to the D -B's evaluations, un- less otherwise supported with sound and logical reasoning, cost impacts in meeting the listed item(s) and alternative suggestions that will meet or exceed the stated design intent. Deviations will only be accepted after CDB -IDVA review. All construction activity and site disturbance should follow the minimum standards set by the Illinois EPA for the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan ('SWPPP'). However, as this remains an actively used and operated campus housing our veterans during the construction phase, all construction ac- tivity on campus shall be well planned, scheduled and coordinated carefully. Access to campus and emergency services and utilities need to be operational through the process of constru ction, and co- ordinated with the campus leadership and CDB project manager. Site context and campus planning The Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy, founded in 1886, has gone through numerous transformations throughout its history. The modernization over the years has resulted in a collection of buildings with a myriad of sidewalks and roads without clear wayfinding strategies and a lack of cohesion on cam-pus. As the bridging and leadership team creating a vision for the new Long Term Care and Domicili-ary, it is critical to understand its inherent impact on this beautiful historic campus. The following planning principles have guided the design for the overall site and its buildings: Enhance the a sense of community Add cohesiveness to the campus Enable clarity in wayfinding Create a sense of place Establish a hierarchy of space within campus Celebrate history Transform the image of the campus Reinforce the positive historic context within the campus Site development includes work associated with infra structure demolition, utility replacement and improvement, landscape/hardscape, parking, and existing monument relocation to support the pro-jects. Creating and enhancing connectivity In addition to enhancement of the sitescapes and new buildings, one of the important features of the new campus development is to provide seamless connectivity for both pedestrians and services behind the scenes. - Pedestrian Connection Currently, buildings are spread out within the large campus, making it difficult for the resi-dents to travel between the buildings, especially during inclement weather. An example is the Multi -Therapy building, which is meant to serve all the residents on campus for the fitness, therapies, exams, and aquatic facility. However, since Kent Infir mary with the direct link to the Multi -Therapy building has been vacated, the use of the Multi -Therapy has declined sig- nificantly. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 5 11/11/2019 In addition, the Using Agency would like to ensure that the residents of the Fifer Infirmary al- so can equally enjoy the new amenities in the LTC building and Multi-Therapy without being exposed to inclement weather. To address these concerns, the north elevator in the new LTC building is allotted to bring res-idents from the first floor main Town Center to the lower level, where an indoor corridor is provided to permit the residents to travel from LTC to Multi -Therapy, and to the lower level of the Fifer Infirmary. The Multi -Therapy building will receive an elevator tower addition to allow the residents from both the LTC and the Fifer Infirmary to access the Multi -Therapy level through internal connection. An outdoor covered walkway is also added to connect independent residents/staff to travel between the Domiciliary to the Town Center amenities in the LTC building. The covered walk- way is intended to be open and integrated with the surrounding with series of colonnades, without becoming a physical barrier. - Outdoor Covered Walkway Design The covered walkway is provided for the convenience and safety of the residents to promote active pedestrian connectivity while being better protected from the weather. The walkway is designed to be open and integrated with the surroundings in the form of a light colonnade without becoming a large or imposing visual barrier. Details for the colonnade in a narrative format are included in the drawings in Volume - 3. - Service Connections A network of service corridors will be provided from the LTC lower level to Nielson, Multi - Therapy, Fifer, as well as to connect the two neighborhoods wi thin the LTC. The middle level of the Nielson is proposed to be renovated to include the main loading and trash collection for the LTC. The new LTC lower level service corridor will extend to the middle level Nielson to allow for goods and services to b e transported to the new LTC. The lower level LTC service corridor will connect between two neighborhoods to allow sup-port/services to travel behind the scenes through service elevators to each neighborhood. The service corridor will be further expanded to serve the Fifer Infirmary, therefore eliminat- ing the need for food and service transport by truck, but rather through the internal service corridor. Art-in-Architecture Program This project qualifies for funding through the Illinois Art -in-Architecture Program and one -half of one percent of the project budget has been set aside for the commission of purchase of site-specific art-work. The bridging design team has identified potential types and locations for artwork in the furni- ture plans in the Bridging Documents. Additional locations or further refinement may be required depending upon the final decisions of the Dept. of Veterans' Affairs staff. The Design -Builder team will coordinate the installation of this artwork. Throughout the project, the Design -Builder team shall participate by CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 6 11/11/2019 Attending Using Agency Steering Committee meetings to determine the appropriate locations and media of artwork. Attending all Fine Arts Review Committee meetings as set forth in statute. Providing CDB necessary documents, drawings, renderings, specifications, product data, etc. to assist the artist in the design and installation of the artwork. Attending meetings with CDB, artist, and us er to coordinate work. Reviewing artwork renderings, drawings, specifications, shop drawings and any other docu- mentation required for the project. Coordinating the provision for the design and supporting aspects related to artwork installa- tion, which may include foundation, structural support, and illumination. Providing on -site observation and report field conditions as necessary to coordinate the art- work process. Providing the protection of artwork that is installed prior to substantial completion. Participating in the substantial completion inspection of the artwork. Smart Technology The new buildings will be integrated with state -of-the-art technology following industry current best practices. The strategies were developed by the team of design c onsultants in working sessions in conjunction with Illinois Department of Innovation and Technology (DOIT) and reflect strategies in- cluding, but not limited to, IT, AV, Security, Wander Management, and Nurse Call. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 7 11/11/2019 Long Term Care Building (LTC) Design P rinciples The main design principles for the Long Term Care building are to create a state -of-the-art communi- ty and a healthy home for Veterans. According to the VA Small House (SH) Model Design Guide, (Rev. March 2019), the Small House Model will promote culture change and a transformation need-ed for the residents' health and well -being. The new building is considered an \"essential facility\" per the VA Design Guide, and therefore shall be I-2, Type IA construction type (IBC 2018) and shall be designed wi th Risk Category IV requirements. Siting of the Long Term Care (LTC) building Based on the masterplan, the new Long Term Care building will be located across from the existing Fifer Infirmary building, and adjacent to the Multi -Therapy building to create a community of the Long Term Care and services within the vicinity. The existing Kent Infirmary, currently sitting vacant, and the Elmore Infirmary, Truck Maintenance, Vehicle Garage buildings will be demolished to provide the lot for the Long Term Care. To align with the overarching goal of creating a cohesive campus within the historical context, the LTC building planning considered all sides of adjacent buildings and site to provide a building that is integrated with the scale and the materiality. The overall configuration of the LTC has been derived from the simple adjacency concept diagram developed during the programming phase to be situated within the campus without taking up too much site and crowding the campus. The public facing side of the campus quad embrace the center of the campus with the arc. Each of the household wings spread out facing the Fifer side to provide a quiet residential feeling, with enriched resident garden between the households. The scale of the building also contributed the stepping of the building. The southern neighborhood buildings stands 4 -story tall next to the Old Stone Building while the northern neighborhood steps down to 3 -story to blend in better with surrounding low rise buildings to the north. The main drop off of the LTC is planned across from the Fifer to create a combined Long Term Care community. The residential buildings with the households are placed closer to the Fifer to promote the residential community characters with private gardens and away f rom the campus quad. These characteristics are architecturally reflected with the punched windows for the residential units and large glasses for the more public functions, such as the dining and living room. The public Town Center on the first floor as well as the residential neighborhood amenities are locat-ed in respect to the campus quad to foster the inviting community characters. The placement is to activate the historic core of the campus by providing active spaces, such as a pub/caf\u00e9 with outdoor dining and classes that can be spilled out to the outdoor patio when the weather is accommodating. The architecture also creates the open, inviting, and more public characters, with the use of the large expanse of glass, and monumental materials such as li me stone and terrazzo. The use of the wood - like trellis sits above the first floor community center CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 8 11/11/2019 Household Based on the VA's Small House Model Design Guide (Rev. March 2019), the new Long Term Care has been designed with the concept of the Small House (SM) Model. During the programming phase, the team discussed many different small house scenarios ranging from 10 -bed to 20 -bed per House. Based on the VA's guideline, staffing model, and operational efficiency, the final household size was determined to be 15-unit per house, with a neighborhood comprising of two households. Per IDPH, each Household will be defined as a nursing unit. The ultimate goal for the design team is to promote the intimate residential environment without being institutional in character. - Private Resident Room Private resident bedrooms and bathrooms provide the basic building blocks for the house- hold. The various room configurations, details, and staff interactions with residents are re-viewed and reflected in the layout. The design adheres to the VA Space Planning Criteria (PG - 18-9 Chapter 106), which recommends minimum 230 sf for the resident room, 85 sf for res-ident bathroom, and 8 sf for resident closet. During programming phase, it was discussed that a mock -up of the typi cal resident room shall be provided to finalize the details. The following items have been discussed in great details with the IDVA and Using Agency for the needs/requirements within the resident rooms. Any deviations shall be presented and approved by the Using Agency. The general room layout includes a resident bed, a lounge chair, a nightstand with drawers with a lamp that's fastened to the nightstand, a TV, a built -in desk, and a built -in full height wardrobe. A custom built pass -thru casework for sanitizer/sharps disposal shall be integrat- ed by the entry foyer. Concealed lift track: It is desired to have lift track in each room. The main purpose of the lift track is to transport the resident from the bed to the toilet, or to the shower chair. Li ft can be stored with charging station in the bathroom to maintain residential room environment and charged when not in use. The detail to integrate the lift track with the barn door track is strongly recommended to minimize the institutional appearance. Picture/light shelf is provided to supplement the ambient light source above the bed without the harsh light setting. The shelf is also designed to allow for the pictures/frames to be dis- played for personalization of the room. Circadian lighting design ca n support improved sleep -wake cycles for those who may be suf- fering from dementia -induced anxieties that typically occur around sundown. The facility is required to have durable flooring options (minimum 20 year material life). The required head wall equipment for each resident bed will include oxygen, suction, and air. Details and further design to be completed to create a hidden yet convenient wall location above the nightstand with residential character. Per Small House Design Guide, it is im-portant to avoid an institutional character, such as the pre -fabricated medical headwall units. Entry coat closet with the bottom shelf will be provided next to the pass -thru casework. Pass -thru housekeeping closet has been incorporated into the entry foyer for t he staffs to supply the housekeeping materials without entering into the resident rooms. The pass through closet will include a work surface that can be pulled out to hold a laptop or clipboard for staff use. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 9 11/11/2019 For dementia units, lockable cabinets will be p rovided to secure the grooming items, linens, and other supplies. Electric wheelchair charging: An outlet is provided by the entry foyer for electric wheel chair to be charged, without bringing it into the sleeping area. TV will be mounted on the wall to improve clearances. Large operable windows with exterior sunshades are provided for views, light, and to avoid the glare within the unit. Per PG -18-13 VA Barrier Free Design Standards (rev. 11/1/18), all resident units will incor- porate 5' -6\" turning radius for accessibility. - Resident Bathroom Bathroom shall be located across from the side of the bed to allow for the direct view to the bathroom, and to align the lift track to transition from the bed to the toilet. A barn door is provided for the ease of op eration and to save the floor clearance. A detail to integrate the overhead barn door track with the lift track from the sleeping area into the bathroom minimizes the institutional feel. Swing -down grab bar at water closets allow for flexibility for assisted transfer of the residents by staff, per the VA Barrier Free Design Standards. Floor mounted toilet is preferred for its residential character. Heating unit with integrated light shall be provided to supplement the heat after the shower. Night light to be provided in order to avoid fall risk at night. Built in shower seat is not permitted. Shower wheelchairs will be provided instead. Ceramic floor tiles are preferred due to durability. The vanity shall have countertop space as well as drawers for personal items. - Bariatric Unit For each household, one bariatric unit across from the nurse station will be provided. D -B team to follow VA Barrier Free Design Standards to provide the appropriate bariatric re- quirements, including 6' turning radius and 4' door c learance. - Semi -Private Resident Suite Each household is provided with two adjacent private units that can be converted into a suite for couples or friends. When not used as a couple's room, the two units will be used as two separate private units. Two ro oms will have inter -connecting door in the demising wall. The D - B team shall ensure that the fire rating and the sound transmission between the two units to be maintained when used as two private units. All other design features for the private rooms to be provided for the semi -private units. - Household Commons Household common areas, including living room, den, dining, and kitchen, serve as active social spaces that allow the residents to come together in an intimate residential setting, as they would in their own homes. The various scaled spaces can be easily accessible by resi- dents to encourage participation in various activities. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 10 11/11/2019 Residents prefer high ceilings with large windows that provide views and outdoor connection. Sunshades or overhangs are p rovided to minimize the glare and heat gain. Kitchen/Dining: The kitchen and dining area serves as a heart of the Home. Culinary experi-ence is one of the most important aspect of the resident life. The overall household layout is derived from sharing a p antry where the food is directly transported from the nearby service elevator, without carting the food cart through the resident space. The shared central pantry with kitchen for both households also allows for sharing staff during meal times. The open kitchen layout enables the staff to be actively engaged with the residents through-out dining experience from the food prep and meal serving to dish washing. Care was given to create a residential setting for the open kitchen. Hidden induction warmers on t he counter will allow for food warming without being seen. The VA guideline requires that each house will provide the ability to cook within each house. As a result, a type 1 hood is provided above the cooktop for cooking within the household kitchen, allowing for made to order meals in the house. A nourishment station is provided adjacent to the kitchen to provide refreshments and snacks throughout the day. A refrigerator and microwave can be easily accessible for per-sonal food preparation. Overlooki ng the courtyard gardens, dining space provides different seating arrangement, 4 - top tables, a farm table, and kitchen island seats to encourage different social interaction in different gathering sizes. A fireplace with soft seating by the dining space pr ovides a warm and intimate residential setting. The environment is to provide a comfortable and active common area for the residents. Living Room: The living room is centrally located within the household and provides a differ- ent view out of the building than the dining and den spaces. The living room shall provide comfortable seating and furniture for activities. A higher ceiling in the living room extends out across the corridor to the feature wall, breaking down the appearance of length of the adja-cent corridor. Large windows with shading are provided for views and daylight. While the din- ing room provides more active space, the living room offers a different social gathering op-portunity. A terrace off the living room provides a place for residents to b e able to sit and enjoy the out- doors. Den: A den is provided with a glass door and a side lite to allow for borrowed daylight into the corridor. It shall have privacy blinds or shades for any private consultation or family member to stay over. Seating Al coves: Various alcoves are distributed throughout the House to allow for residents to take a break between transitions. Spa: The current residents use tubs often. Avoid using the tubs with internal reservoirs. Pro-vide lift track for the tub. A training toi let is also provided within the spa area. The overall spa should offer a warm hospitality environment for relaxation, and avoid any institutional details. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 11 11/11/2019 - Support and Staff Area Support spaces are treated as back -of-house space. It is recommended to minimize views to support doors and into staff and support spaces from adjacent common areas. Supply is decentralized in closets to minimize the staffs' travel distance. Several design features are included to eliminate or hide med carts from the corridor, includ- ing med cabinet within each room or med cart alcove along corridor. Nurse Station: The nurse station is placed at the bend of the House in order to secure direct line of sight to each of the resident unit doors, per IDPH requirement. Based on the discus- sion with USDVA, it was strongly recommended to reduce the size of the nurse station as a touch down station, with details to fit within the overall residential environment. From a Small House Model standpoint, nursing staff are encouraged to be engaged with residents throughout the House and throughout the day, rather than sitting at a nurse station. It is still important to accommodate the operational needs of the nurse station. A medical record room and a charting room are located next to the nu rse station for ease of access. In addi- tion, all required panels per the IDPH and VA's requirements shall be confirmed and provided with visible proximity in the alcove adjacent to the nurse station. An additional panel location may be required by the Di ning Room to easily visible for the staffs while being hidden from residents' views. Med room is provided with a lockable casework and small lockable refrigerator. Trash will be collected within the household and immediately brought to the basement ser-vice area. Trash holding rooms are provided under each neighborhood. A central linen cart will be brought up to each neighborhood into a central linen room. The linen will be distributed throughout the houses into the satellite linen closets and pass - through closets within resident rooms. Nurse Lounge: A nurse lounge/breakroom is provided for each neighborhood with lockers and seating areas. A staff toilet is provided within the staff lounge. Neighborhood Amenity The concept of neighborhood is created for more than two households to foster a feeling of commu- nity at a neighborhood scale within the Long Term Care building. The neighborhood generally pro-vides a place for socialization outside of the Household environment, through programs and activi-ties. There is additional benefit from shared efficiencies of staffing and space use by combining two houses' needs For the new Long Term Care, a total of seven neighborhoods are provided, with each neighborhood consisting of two Households. Typically, two neighborhoods are provided on each floor (floors one through three). The fourth floor is unique and consists of a single neighborhood to the south. The following amenity spaces have closely been evaluated with the Using Agency; Elevator/Elevator Lobby: Th e elevator lobby in the upper floors will offer a sense of arrival within each neighborhood with its own wayfinding queues from different interior finishes and artwork. The view of the campus quad immediately greets the residents/visitors from the el-evato r lobby through the adjacent lounge/3 -season porch with full height windows. On the CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 12 11/11/2019 opposite side of the lobby, entry doors into each Household are provided with the buzzer for secure access. Lounge / 3 -Season Porch: This destination serves as an additi onal gathering area that over- looks the campus within each neighborhood. This lounge is placed adjacent to the multi - purpose area for additional pre -function purpose. Multi -Purpose Room: The multi -purpose room can be used for larger gatherings and resident activities for each neighborhood. It is located adjacent to the restorative therapy space with a folding partition wall which provides flexibility to expand when a larger gathering space is needed. Restorative Therapy Space: Restorative therapy and some occupational therapy will be per-formed in neighborhood setting on the same floor. This reduces the need for staffs to transport residents to the multi -therapy building for all treatments. Adequate storage for equipment shall be provided. Therapy staff will rotate between the neighborhoods to provide resident therapies. Barber/Beauty: A barber/beauty room is conveniently provided at each neighborhood for the residents. The Using Agency required this room in addition to the household spa. This reduc- es scheduling conflicts between bathing and hair care appointments. Resident Laundry: The resident laundry room is provided for personal laundry by the resi-dents' families and for light linens by staff. Central Nursing Office: Centrally located between two neighborhoods, the office space pro- vides staffs to be able to reach each neighborhoods easily. Based on the feedback from the Director of Nursing, the staffs will be shared between two floors, with the following offices per each floor. Shared Staffs for 3 - 4th floors 4 FL- 1 Neighborhood (30 Residents 1 Private Office for Nurse Supervisor 1 Private Office for Social Worker 3FL - 2 Neighborhoods (60 Residents) 1 Private Office for 2 Social Workers to Share (i.e. 2 desks & 2 filing cabinets) 1 Private Office for MDS 1 private office for supervisor Shared Staffs for 1st -2nd floors 2FL- 2 Neighborhoods (60 Residents) 1 Private Office for 2 Social Workers to Share (i.e. 2 desks & 2 filing cabinets) 1 Private Office for MDS 1 private office for supervisor 1FL - 2 Neighborhoods (60 Residents) The following offices will be located as a part of the administrative suite. 1 Private Office for Director of Nursing for the entire LTC 1 Private Office for Assistant Director of Nursing for the entire LTC 1st Floor Supe rvisor * Refer to Town Center description for all other offices in the administrative suite. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 13 11/11/2019 Connecting corridor between neighborhoods: The connecting corridor is provided for conven- ience mostly for the staff to travel between neighborhoods. The connec ting corridor is de- signed to be primarily glazed to create a feeling of transparency through the building, while accommodating bird friendly frits or glazing. First Floor Town Center The first floor Community Space is designed to be inviting for visitors and serves also as a central hub for the residents on the campus. Spaces along the main gallery overlook out onto the central campus quad, promoting a sense of community. Ample south-westerly glazing allows daylight into and through the spaces and into the gallery. A continuous trellis above the first floor town center provides a comfortable outdoor space for resident gatherings, protected from weather and glare, while providing a pleasing pedestrian scale. Based on findings during the Programming Phase , a large gathering space in the Long Term Care building is not needed. Larger, campus wide events will continue to be held in the existing Lippincott Hall building. Main Entry and First Impression: The drive and the porte cochere /drop off area is pulle d away from the front door to limit the car travel into the entry courtyard. This helps to preserve the privacy of the resident units facing the entry courtyard. The covered pedestrian walkway from the porte cochere will guide visitors to the main entry ve stibule, offering a hospitality procession through a beautifully landscaped garden. The entrance into the lobby has a high ceiling which immediately provides a clear view through the space, outwards to the main campus quad beyond. A library/business center with a fire place will provide comfortable lounge seating, a caf\u00e9 with pleasing aromas, a curving main gallery connecting to variety of amenity spaces, all contribute to an important first impression experience. Partnering with the Art -in-Architecture pro gram, the main entry, gallery, and amenity spaces will be enriched with unique art and monuments. The reception area will be staffed during the campus operational hours. After hours, the ad- min/nursing staff will have the access to allow entry into the bui lding. Caf\u00e9/Pub: The caf\u00e9 opens up to the entry lobby, greeting the residents and visitors with a casual, hospitality environment with grab and go food and beverage station. The location of the caf\u00e9 adjacent to the main entry will enhance the first impres sion and activate the main lobby area. The pub adjacent to the caf\u00e9 provides another active culinary destination for res-idents, visitors, and staff. The pantry between the caf\u00e9 and pub allows the serving staff to be shared between different times and servi ces. Main Gallery: The main gallery connects different amenities as well as two elevators banks to the Long Term Care neighborhoods from the first floor and upper floors. As a main corridor of the main amenity floor, the main gallery serves as more than a corridor, but also a transi- ent space to invite, socialize, discover, and entertain, displayed with clear wayfinding. Theater: The Theater allows for small movie screenings or small guest lecture events. The flat floor with the lounge seating allows for flexible seating arrangement for any occasion. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 14 11/11/2019 Classroom: A classroom is provided to promote lifelong learning environment for residents and staff. This flexible space, divisible into two smaller spaces, allows different classes or ac-tivities to take place a t the same time. The space will be available for use with outside groups to foster partnerships with the greater Quincy community. Barber/Beauty: This central barber beauty area serves as a destination for the campus. The service will be provided by an o utside vendor to serve LTC residents on the first floor and campus residents from outside the LTC. Potential partnership opportunities with a local cos-metology school were discussed during programming phase. Administrative Suite: Placed off the main galler y, the administrative suite will serve the resi- dents and visitors within close proximity. The preliminary list of offices will include ; Infection Control/Domiciliary Supervisor, Infection Control/In -service/Employee Health Supervisor, Psych Nurse, In -Service Coordinator, Staffing Coordinator, EHR/MDS Coordinator, in addition to the three offices to serve the nursing floors listed in the Neighborhood Amenity Central Of-fice Section above (Director of Nursing, Assistant Director of Nursing, and 1st floor Supe rvi- sor). A workroom shall be provided with a printer/fax machine, water cooler, and refrigerator. The Using Agency may advise on the final layout of the space as they refine the staffing plan and the needs for the building. Chapel: The Chapel serves as a sacred space for worship services and gatherings, for a ca-pacity of 15 people. Separate storage spaces for multiple denominations are provided. Im-mediate outdoor access with separate landscape garden is provided by the chapel. Overall lighting shall be soft and dimmable for controllability. Potential considerations for the water- fall or fountain with trickling water can create tranquil and peaceful environment. Chapel seating with a kneeler shall be provided. Larger services will take place in the ex isting chapel on the campus or in the Lippincott Hall building. Infrastructure for the televised services shall be accommodated. Walker/wheelchair storage off dining and main area along main gallery to be provided. Basement Service Providing m aintenance a nd back -of-house services in a discrete manner is key to the successful op- eration of the LTC and campus. Durable finish materials are to be used, especially with corner guards and wall/door protections, to withstand damage from the carts and service equipm ent. Main Kitchen: The main existing kitchen in Nielson Building will be decommissioned and a new Main Kitchen will be provided in the basement of the LTC to serve the residents of the entire campus. Long term food storage will remain in Nielson Building. Refer to the kitchen narrative for the detail. Main Laundry: Central laundry is sized to serve the entire campus. Main pharmacy: Accessible only by staff with security clearance, the main pharmacy will pro-vide medicine for the Long Term Care residents. Refer to the Security Control narrative for further access control information. Central storages will include building, housekeeping, grounds keeping, and resident storage per IDPH and VA's requirement. Staff support/amenities will take place in Nielson Building. Service/receiving will take place from Nielson Building to LTC building through an under- ground tunnel. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 15 11/11/2019 Trash/recycling will be brought down from the each neighborhood into the trash holding area in the lower level, before being transported to the Nie lson for the main trash holding area for the trash pick -up. Mechanical, electrical, and fire protection spaces will be provided. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 16 11/11/2019 Domiciliary Design Principles and VA Requirement Current Domiciliary residents occupy the Anderson Barracks and Sommerville Domiciliary. Upon completion of the masterplan in 2018, it was identified to renovate both Fletcher Infirmary and Markword Infirmary into each 40 unit Domiciliary buildings on campus. However, both existing build- ings presented their own challenges with th e existing structure, including ramps within the corridor, low floor to floor ceiling, and that they are not connected in terms of services and resident circula- tions. During the Functional Programming exercise, an alternate direction has been evaluated to demolish both buildings and build the new 80 -unit Domiciliary that will be connected to the Nielson. After studying opportunities and challenges along with the cost and schedule implications, the Using Agency authorized the Bridging Team to pursue a new Domiciliary that is connected to the Nielson building in lieu of renovations of two existing structures. Some of the opportunities of the new Domiciliary are identified as below; Unit sizes and layout can be right sized and customized for the needs of the campus. Floor to floor height can be adjusted to allow for the comfortable ceiling height. All amenities can be connected to the Nielson building for the direct support and services. The phasing and logistics can be simpler and provide opportunities to f ast track the resident occupancy of the building, as the current Fletcher building currently sits empty and can be demolished without disturbing any current operation. The Domiciliary will be close to the new Long Term Care building and the central quad of the campus. Licensing is not required. (IBC R -2 occupancy) Smoke partition is provided for defend in place High sustainable goals including Net-Zero and passive house design can be employed to en-sure the optimal performance of the building as well as to promote wellness of the residents and staff. Net Zero Building S trategies In order to achieve the Net -Zero goals for the Domiciliary, the combination of the following strategies can be further studied and employed. Super insulated continuous thermal envelope with limited thermal bridging, including contin- uous insulation below grade Air tight wall assembly High efficient lighting High efficient glazing Onsite renewable solar P/V High efficient mechanical LED lighting tied with daylight controls Individu alized shading strategies per each facade CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 17 11/11/2019 Limiting window to wall ratio Water efficient plumbing fixture to reduce the boiler size Energy recovery system Site Planning The new Domiciliary sits along sloping grades amongst mature trees and rolling hills on the north- west portion of the campus quad. The planning of 80 unit in the 3 -story to respect the surrounding context creates a lengthy building with long corridor. In order to reduce overall building length, the planning took advantage of the sloping site and placed a northern wing in the lower level with the full daylight. This design allowed for resident walk out patios for the lower level as an additional amenity. The design further created four different residential massing with the clear breaks. These breaks between the massing provide fully day -lit lounges and gathering spaces for the residents, while breaking down the scale of the building and resident corridor. The community center is provided in the place of the existing link between Fletcher and t he Nielson building. This allows for direct staff access and service from the Nielson Building to the new Domicil- iary. It is also pulled away from the main residential building to allow for higher ceiling space for the main dining. The Resident Survey During schematic design phase, a meeting was held at Anderson building with residents of the cur- rent Domiciliary to understand their expectations and needs. The followings are the key take away from the survey results. The need for individual storage space. The need to have space in their room for their own furniture and no built -ins. The desire to have a designated space for reading, visiting, and/or games such as cards or board games. Residents expressed the desire to have laundry facilities on every fl oor. The need for more counter space/closet space in the units. These comments have been integrated into the design of the units and amenity spaces. Resident Units The new Domiciliary will provide a combination of studios and one bedrooms with private ba throoms and small kitchenettes. Based on the resident survey, the majority of the residents strongly prefer to dine in the main dining room with other residents rather than to have a full kitchen in the unit. The compact kitchenette in each unit provides the following: microwave/refrigerator combo, single bowl sink, and countertop for light snack preparation. Resident bathrooms are preferred to be accessed from the bedroom. The lower level units will be accommodated with private resident walk out patios. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 18 11/11/2019 Resident Floor The overall planning of the resident floors was developed to provide intermittent breaks between the corridors to reduce the perceived length of the corridor. At each break, bench seating by a window niche and a den area is provided to of fer small gathering space for each wing. Large windows allow for daylight and views across the space. A resident laundry room is located next to the den for resi-dents' convenience. At the end of each corridor, an outdoor terrace space with solar shading s creening is provided. An alternate option will be to enclose this outdoor terrace to be become 3 -season terrace. Separate clean and soil linen rooms for each wing, a housekeeping storage, and a resident trash room with trash chute are provided for each f loor. Community Center and Amenities - First Floor Community Center A main axis is created to connect the residential building with the Nielson building. The main entry for the new Domiciliary is closely located at the existing location of main entry for the Fletcher building, minimizing the road work around that area and maintaining a relationship with the existing parking lot. The first impression of the main resident lobby is a resident liv-ing room with soft seating and a fire place, which rises up to the third floor. A high volume space will allow for the ample daylight to penetrate, with strategically located sunscreen to avoid glare issues. A main admin office suite is located next to the main entrance, creating a visual connection to the entry and the living room. The admin area accommodates two private offices for a nursing staff and an exam room. Also, an additional seating area is provided for touch down flex office space, or can serve as a conference table. A classroom is located on the other side of the living room to accommodate small classes and activities. A corner sliding wall allows for the classroom to be open for any flexible use as an extension of the main lobby space. A fitness room is conveniently located close to the main elevator l obby. Basic fitness equip- ment and tools are provided, with the treadmills, elliptical and bicycle machines, and full mir- rored wall and weight area. A therapy garden is designed to have direct outdoor access from the fitness room. Overlooking a beautiful la wn and mature trees, the main dining area provides a destination for the Domiciliary residents. It is a space where many social gatherings and activities can take place, beyond dining. The culinary layout allows for cafeteria style serving during the meal time. An additional residential kitchen is provided for resident's use, allowing for dining options. The pantry is located adjacent to the Nielson Building for efficient meal delivery and service. A condiment station and snack area will be available for re sidents between the meal times. The dining room provides various seating arrangements and a fire place with lounge seating, activating the space. A covered walkway provides a protected connection from the dining room to the Long Term Care building. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 19 11/11/2019 - Third Floor Lounge A den space is provided on the top floor as a destination and social gathering space. An ad- jacent outdoor terrace is provided off the den to promote additional visual and outdoor con-nection to the campus. Building Service/Storages In add ition to the resident units, lower level provides the main building support and storage needs, including bicycle and resident storage. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 20 11/11/2019 Renovations Nielson Dining (Major Renovation) Currently, Nielson Dining building functions as a main dining hall with the main kitchen to serve the entire campus. As the main kitchen and dining will be decommissioned from the Nielson and relo- cated to the new LTC, the Nielson building will be renovated to serve as the main service load-ing/receiving and main storage area, as well as to provide a new hub for the staff lounge and ameni-ty space. A new staff parking is configured adjacent to the Nielson for convenience. Therapy Building (Minor Renovation) The Multi -Therapy building will receive a minor renovation to provide a front entry and a new eleva- tor/stair tower to be accessible from the road. The new elevator and stair will also connect to the lower level corridor to be created between the new Long Term Care building, to allow for the resi-dents from the LTC and the Fifer to allow for the indoor access to the Therapy building, ADA/IAC access to the therapy building must be maintained throughout construction. Fifer Skilled Nursing (Minor Renovation) The Fifer building will receive a minor renovation to connect to the M ulti-Therapy building as well as to new Long Term Care through indoor corridor, accessible from the Lower Level. Care must be given to ensure the full operation of the building as well as utility infrastructure throughout the construc-tion. Andrews Infirma ry (Minor Renovation) Upon demolition of the Schapers Hospital, the connector between the Andrew and Schapers Hospital will need to receive the minor renovation to close off the connector. Care must be given to ensure the full operation of the building as well as utility infrastructure throughout the construction. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 21 11/11/2019 Sustainability and Healthy Environment Design Approaches to Sustainability and Healthy Living As an institution that is built on the State's and Veterans Affairs' (VA) resources, we owe it t o the pub- lic and veterans that we create responsible and healthy environments which represent the commit- ment to sustainability for both the State of Illinois and VA. From the masterplan phase, it was clearly identified by the IDVA and CDB that this new de velopment shall promote the state -of-the-art environment that will lead the charge for other states and VA cam- puses to follow. This admirable goal can be realized when every entity on this project has the early buy-in and follow through the clear set of pa ths. As a result, the following sustainable strategies with opportunities and challenges have been closely reviewed with the Using Agency, which ultimately guided the current bridging design approaches. LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ) As a basic measure of the sustainability goals set out by the state and the VA, the projects will pur- sue LEED V. 4 Gold or higher Certification (the minimum LEED V.4 Silver Certification is required). The LEED checklist document multiple points in the MAYBE category that could be used as alternate strategies to achieve the desired results. WELL Strategies (International WELL Building Institute TM) While LEED has gained significant momentum in the building industry with its focus on more broad aspects of sustainability such as energy efficiency and sustainable sites, the WELL Building Standard has been created to specifically address human -centered design and operational strategies for the health, happiness, and quality of life for people. In addition to improving the physical environment, WELL is de signed to empower positive human behaviors; the way we eat, sleep, exercise, and feel. The WELL Building Standard is based on the seven concepts - Air, Water, Nourishment, Light, Fit-ness, Comfort, and Mind. The projects currently are not actively pursuing the certification. However, continued discussions on the design and operational enhancement to provide a healthier environment for the residents and staff as well as transformation of the campus image should be encouraged throughout the Design Build proc ess. The following WELL strategies have been identified for priority considerations as they relate to the healthy environment and water qualify for the campus. A12. Air Filtration : \"A12.1 / 1 Points Implement Particle Filtration\" A14. Microbe and Mold Control : \"A14.2 / 1 Points Manage Condensation and Mold\" W01. Fundamental Water Quality : ALL POINTS W02. Water Contaminants : ALL POINTS W03. Legionella Control : \"W03. 1 Implement Legionella Management Plan\" For further information, please refer to Owner Project Requirement (OPR). CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 22 11/11/2019 Biophilic Design Concept Biophilic design applies the concept of biophilia (the human love for life and life -like properties) to architecture, helping us understand how and why design affects our brains, bodies, and emotions. Throughout the design process, elements of biophilia have been incorporated into the design, includ-ing connection with the surrounding nature and light. The following are general concept of biophilia that can be further implemented. Exploration an d Discovery Natural Materials Movement and Unpredictability Light Connection to Nature Connection to Others Spatial Experiences Variety and Difference Passive House Design Passive House design principles consist of design strategies to attain a quantifiable and rigorous level of energy efficiency based on the regional and climate context. By providing a high performance building envelope, the principles minimize the energy load for the building, enabling reduced me-chanical units, creating comfortable indoor envir onment for the residents, and offering the best path to Net Zero buildings. In addition, a thermally tight building envelope will assist with resiliency and emergency preparedness. Despite an increased air change requirements for the Long Term Care and Dom iciliary, the Passive House design principles will benefit the overall energy use through the following strategies. Employs continuous insulation throughout its entire envelope without any thermal bridging. The building envelope is extremely airtight, pr eventing infiltration of outside air and loss of conditioned air. Employs high -performance windows (double or triple -paned windows depending on climate and building type) and doors - solar gain is managed to exploit the sun's energy for heating purposes i n the heating season and to minimize overheating during the cooling season. Uses some form of balanced heat - and moisture -recovery ventilation. Uses a minimal space conditioning system. Bird Friendly Design As the campus is situated within a beautiful natural surroundings, it is more important to be mindful to reduce the risk of bird injury and mortality from collisions into the new building fa\u00e7ade. Follow in- dustry's best practices and guidance for the bird friendly design, including USGBC's LEED V.4 Pilot Program: Bird collision deterrence Additional Sustainability Criteria The bridging team has considered additional following sustainable design strategies. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 23 11/11/2019 AIA 2030 challenge encourages the EUI (Energy Use Intensity) level to be 80% reduction compared to the baseline (based on the year 2020). Based on the preliminary analysis of the EUI's for both building, the EUI targets for LTC to be 80% reduction and the Domiciliary to be 100% reduction/net zero. International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2018 provides the higher set of energy goals as a baseline. Daylight simulations and energy modeling identify any increased energy load, heat gain, and glare issues, which have been integrated as a part of the exterior shading strategies. (See be-low) According to Resilient Design Institute, \" Resilience is the capacity to adapt to changing con- ditions and to maintain or regain functionality and vitality in the face of stress or disturb-ance. It is the capacity to bounce back after a disturbance or interruption.\" Resilient Design is important aspect of the design more than ever, especially with the frailer populations on campus. The campus has the resilient strategies and protocols in place, and the design is to support the resilient design with generator and p assive house design strategies. Additional back -up power for the Generator capacity and fuel tank capacity also contribute to the resili- ency for the campus. Based on the preliminary analysis of the energy loads for both Long Term Care and Domicili-ary buil ding, it was determined to pursue Net Zero energy for Domiciliary, with reduced EUI based on the passive house strategies and renewable energy source (photovoltaic). Initial life cycle cost analysis has been evaluated when selecting preliminary HVAC syst ems for the new buildings and renovation of the existing building. Design- Build team shall provide life cycle cost analysis to assist with the final system selection for the Using Agency. CDB has engaged a third party Commissioning Agent to be involved in the project from the early design to carry the sustainable strategies and systems performance commissioning throughout the project. The Commissioning Agent has provided the Owner's Project Re- quirement and Basis of Design document. They will further prov ide the third party commis- sioning scope of services on behalf of the Owner. (Ramu to confirm the scope). Solar Shading and its impact in Thermal Comfort and Energy Savings In the design of the Domiciliary and Long Term Care buildings, it is important t o account for solar protection on the exterior of the buildings while retaining views. In order to reduce heat gains and glare disturbance, exterior solar shading should be included as part of the building envelope, protect-ing the interior spaces during th e hot seasons of the year. By providing shading, heat stress will be reduced and mechanical cooling loads will be significantly lower. At the same time, the shading de-vices will reduce direct glare potential inside the building, minimizing the discomfort a nd disturbance generated by direct solar radiation impacting a person's visual field. Proper fa\u00e7ade and shading de-sign can provide many benefits for the project. With careful design and analysis, the fa\u00e7ade shading can reduce operating costs, first costs, reduce energy use, and improve occupant satisfaction within the building. Reduced Glare and Improved Visual Comfort Though bright light during the day is conducive to good health, uneven levels of brightness in the visual field can cause visual fatigue and discomfort. Glare, or excessive brightness, is caused by light scattering within the eye (intraocular scattering), thereby creating a \"veil\" of CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 24 11/11/2019 luminance that reduces the luminance contrast as received by the retina. In buildings, the biggest source of glare comes from sunlight directly hitting the eye or reflective surfaces. Older adult populations are especially sensitive to glare because the light will scatter more in aging eyes to see less detail and glare can obscure objects in the room. Excess glar e can create stress and reduce productivity of occupants. Shading limits the amount of surfaces that direct solar radiation can hit, therefore reducing potential issues with glare and avoiding the occupant stress and dissatisfaction that may be associated with glare. Without appropriate external shading, occupants are likely to draw the blinds at most or all times, negating the benefits of daylight. Reduced Building Cooling Needs and Energy Usage Solar radiation affects internal surface and air temperature s, which puts additional loads on the mechanical system causing more energy to be used to maintain internal comfort. Exter-nal shading blocks solar radiation from entering the building, therefore reducing the build- ing's cooling loads and energy consumption needs. Appropriate daylighting can also reduce building energy use. Lighting loads can account for as much as 20% of a building's energy consumption. Daylighting in combination with lighting systems that include daylight dimming systems can provide subst antial savings in energy. Improved Thermal Comfort Transmitted solar radiation can cause discomfort if it falls directly on an occupant. A person sitting near a window in direct solar radiation can experience heat gain equivalent to 20 de-gree Fahrenheit r ise in mean radiant temperature. By blocking direct radiation, occupant comfort can be improved. Integrated Design and Durability Fins and louvers shall be of materials that are easily cleanable and maintained, with durable and warranted finishes. The s hading elements shall be engineered to resist wind and snow loads and fasteners for attachment to be indicated on shop drawings. In addition, exposed ledges shall be designed or treated to minimize dirt collection over time - Shading Design Strategies Ther e are two metrics used to measure the impact of daylight autonomy and glare potential in a space, and those metrics are SDA (Spatial Daylight Autonomy) and ASE (Annual Solar Exposure). Spatial Daylight Autonomy is a metric describing annual sufficiency of ambient daylight levels in interior environments. It is defined as the percentage of an analysis that meets a minimum daylight illuminance level for a specified fraction of the operating hours per year. Per LEED standards in order for a space to be conside red completely daylight au- tonomous, 75% of the occupied area should meet or exceed 300 lux (28 Foot -candles) for at least 50% of occupied hours. On the other hand, ASE is a metric that describes the potential for visual discomfort in interior work environm ents. It is defined as the percentage of an analysis area that exceeds a specified direct sunlight illuminance level more than a specified number of occupied hours per year. Per LEED standards, a maximum of 10% of the occupied area should be exposed to more than 1000 lux (93 Foot -candles) of direct sunlight for more than 250 hours per year. The shading strategies were implemented to both buildings in the following sections. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 25 11/11/2019 - Long Terms Care Building Shading Strategies An initial daylight analysis without an y shading was run for the Long Term Care Building and for the Domiciliary building, in order to stablish a baseline. Each room and each fa\u00e7ade has a different solar incidence, and therefore requires a specific treatment in order to mitigate glare and maxim ize daylight autonomy. Multiple residential rooms and common areas, facing different orientations, were analyzed for both Daylight Autonomy and Glare Potential. Even though all of the rooms in the Long Term Care Building were above the 75% SDA threshold, some of the spaces presented elevated ASE levels, reaching levels of up to 45% which could represent unwanted heat gains and glare disturbance. Once the baseline for each building fa\u00e7ade was stablished, a combination of multiple depths for horizontal and v er- tical shading devices were tested with the purpose of dropping ASE values below the 10% threshold, while keeping SDA levels above 75%. For the Long Terms Care building, the most critical areas are the rooms on the south wing facing South, with ASE levels of 30%, and the rooms on the north wing facing Southwest, with ASE levels of 44%. For the south facing fa-cades located in the south wing of the building, a 18'' deep vertical and horizontal louvers at-tached to the window mullions and 47% Visible Light Tra nsmittance windows were intro- duced in order to mitigate glare and drop ASE levels. By applying these strategies, ASE dropped from 30% to 10%, while SDA dropped from 100% to 83%. For the Southwest facing units, located in the north wing of the building, 18' ' deep horizontal and vertical louvers were attached to the window frame, and 38% Visible Light Transmittance windows were intro-duced in order to mitigate glare and drop ASE levels. Added to that, 12'' interior light shelves should be used in order to prov ide shading to the room and reflect diffuse daylight to the ceil- ing of the room. By applying these strategies, ASE dropped from 30% to 10%, while SDA dropped from 44% to 15%. The common areas of the building are other critical spaces in terms of solar protection due to the high amount of glass and southern and western orientation. Similar to what happens in the residential portions of the project, the common areas have an outstanding perfor-mance in terms of daylight autonomy (SDA), but the Glare levels (ASE) are considerably high, and therefore solar protection strategies should be implemented in order to reduce unwant- ed heat gains and overlit spaces. Storefronts at ground level are protected by deep overhangs that provide shading to the inte-rior spaces and at the same time allow for outdoor areas of respite and gathering to occur. On the other hand, glazing with a considerably low Visible Light Transmittance (31%) allow for light to enter these spaces, without the disturbance generated by direct solar ex posure. By adopting this, ASE levels at the ground floor go from 70% to 23%, while SDA stays stable at 100%. Finally, the curtain walls located above ground level are designed with serrated fa\u00e7ade to po-sition the glazing away from the direct western expo sure. The use of a micro perforated screen applied to the south and west facing glazing will protect the interior space from direct solar exposure, while clear glass can be maintained on the other side of the serrated glass to allow for the unfiltered vi ews of the campus. Various LTC Building Performance Values for each of the residential unit facades has been tested, with the results in the table below. The highlighted scenarios per each fa\u00e7ade, em-ploying the exterior shade along with the Visual Ligh t Transmittance (VLT) factor for the glaz- ing has resulted in the optimal indoor environment. These strategies have been integrated into the final exterior building design.

The only fa\u00e7ade of the building that represents a challenging condition in terms of sol ar heat gains and glare potential is the Southwest fa\u00e7ade. If no shad- ing strategies are applied to this face of the building, ASE levels will be close to 33%, which is considerable high for a residential room. In order to reduce the overlit areas of the re sidential CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 27 11/11/2019 units, one horizontal 18'' exterior louver and one vertical 18'' exterior louver should be at- tached to the window frame. Added to that, an interior 12'' light shelf should be used to re-flect diffuse light inside the room. Finally, a 47% Visible L ight Transmittance window should be used in order to mitigate glare disturbance. The other face of the building that will require shading strategies is the southeast fa\u00e7ade. Even though the baseline without shading per-forms relatively well, by adding a 12' ' deep vertical and horizontal shading louver will reduce ASE Glare levels to 10%. The rest of the facades will not require any kind of shading or light shelves strategies. Finally, in the common areas, the terracotta baguettes have a considera-ble contribu tion in terms of reducing glare disturbance. While the lobby, without any protec- tion at all, has a dramatically poor performance, with ASE levels close to 74%, at the moment of inserting baguettes 12'' spaced from each other, glare will drop to 0%. The following table indicates the Domiciliary Performance Value, as in LTC simulations. The highlighted shading strategies have been integrated in the final Domiciliary fenestration de- sign.

Even the most acute level of care in a Long Term Care facility must not feel sterile or hospital - like; it is the resident's home, not a place he or sh e has gone for a short stay before returning home. The key theme is \"feeling\". Rooms should feel residential, with the style and quality of a hotel and the comforting details of a home. The design must incorporate a variety of spaces that support vary-ing levels of contact, such as large -scale spaces for holidays or special events, and small cozy spac- es for family gatherings and quiet times. Common overarching goals include providing: A safe, comfortable environment that is supportive of the resident's need to maintain inde- pendence Design that seamlessly incorporates the necessary support devices (such as grab bars and handrails) in an unobtrusive manner An interior environment that avoids the institutional stigma associated with traditional medi-cal and hospital settings A design that addresses the six characteristics of aging that have the largest impact on both veterans and older adults' relationship to their environment: loss of balance; cognitive loss of strength; visual impairment; hearin g impairment; and increased sensitivity to cold, drafts, and direct sunlight A variety of types and sizes of spaces supporting veteran individual needs, lifestyles, and personalities Although there are many different types of living and care environments for our veterans, there are some key factors to keep in mind for all interior spaces designed to meet the needs of our veterans of all ages and abilities: Install evenly distributed non -glare lighting with appropriate footcandle(fc) levels specific to tasks by area. (Refer to the lighting design guidelines below). Provide contrast between the horizontal and vertical planes to provide better visual discrimi- nation that will improve the sense of balance. For example, a corridor whose floor and wall finishes were a similar color and value was perceived by the residents of one facility as a \"muddy river\". Be sensitive to acoustics when designing and selecting finishes; choose those that reduce background noise for improved hearing at social gatherings. Flush transitions from one flooring material to another are vital. Plan for slab recesses to re-duce trip hazards. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 29 11/11/2019 Avoid sharp corners or edges in millwork, wood trim, furniture, hardware, and other interior elements. Choose flooring products that have patterns without high contrast and with colors close in value. Otherwise there is the potential for vertigo and falls. Select textiles and wallcoverings with easily recognizable patterns that will not be perceived as objects, faces, or animals. Specify colors tha t are not so dark that they are perceived as black or so subtle that they ap- pear dreary to the aging eye. Choose floor finishes that are not slippery or have a high -gloss appearance. Install carpets with fiber construction and moisture -barrier backing systems appropriate for the aging population with incontinence. Limit use of mirrors on walls to create the illusion of pace, as this can cause confusion and disorientation. D-B to provide cleaning and maintenance instructions on all specified and installed finishes. D-B to coordinate instructional maintenance training with support staff for specialty finishes. Choose materials that are durable, easy to clean, and with 20 year life cycle. Lighting Design The following points are essential to the design of a successful lighting system for any veterans' space: Even distribution of light levels on the floor surface so as not to create visual barriers of dark and light spots Non-glare light sources Appropriate light levels for the aging eye - footcandle levels 15-20 percent higher than for younger adults Consistent light levels from one area to the next to accommodate the slower adjustment of the older eye to high contrast Provision of transition areas to give the eye time to adjust to spaces with different lev els of light The \"ANSI/IES RP-28-16 Revised Lighting and the Visual Environment for Seniors and the Low Vision Population\" also can provide a good resource to determine the recommended light levels for differ- ent spaces and the height of the light measured. Design -Builder is recommended to review and take the stringent approach for the lighting design by comparing the ANSI/IES RP -28-16 and the best practice considerations for different areas described below. - Commons Dining areas should have light levels as high as 50 fc so the residents will be able to clearly see the color of the food. One of the better light sources is indirect because it minimizes glare and shadows. Accessory lighting in lounge spaces should be considered supplemental to general lig ht lev- els of a minimum of 35 fc. There should be general illumination of approximately 30 fc with directed task -lighting over the table or floor lamps at the proper height next to seating in library spaces. CDB 040- 010-115 Architectural Narrative - Page 30 11/11/2019 Barber and beauty salons should have indirect li ghting with some decorative sconces. Light- ing on both sides of the mirror creates the most even light for viewing the face. Special atten- tion should also be given to the color of the lamps, so as to provide the most flattering quality of light. Physical t herapy spaces also use indirect lighting. Many residents undergo therapy in these spaces and will spend their time laying on mats looking up. - Corridors Code -stated footcandle requirements are minimum goals. Successful fc levels of corridors in Long Term Care facilities are typically ranging from 30 -45 fc (as defined by positive resident feedback). Variation in light source is a key design element to help visually shorten the length of corri- dors. The integration of lighting with architectural features cr eates visual cueing to support wayfinding and areas of interest along the resident's trip down a corridor. To accomplish de-sirable light levels, two recessed LED downlights should be spaced six feet on center. Decorative sconces placed at unit entries not only serve as wayfinding elements, but also provide supplemental lighting for residents to find their keys, read the room number, and lo- cate the keyhole.

The major building structures consist of the replacement of Markword and Fletcher Halls with the construction of a new domiciliary, as well as a new four -story long -term care facility. New utility tunnels and above ground pedestrian link structures will al so be constructed to link buildings. 2.2 NEW DOMICILIARY STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION A. The new three story domiciliary with basement will be cast -in-place con crete with primarily brick masonry facade. The building will have floor -to-floors ranging from 12' -0\" to 13' -4\". The single -story dining (with clerestory) and amenity portions will utilize steel frame construction with long span joists. The exterior wall s ystem consists of a masonry veneer with CMU for the backup system. Steel shelf angles attached to co ncrete spandrel beams will be provided to support the masonry at each floor line. The new residential building construction type shall be R-2, Type IIA and will be designed per Risk Category IV. 1. Main Wind Force Resisting System: The overall lateral stabi lity of the three story with basement domiciliary will be provided by concrete shear walls. The diaphragm will consist of a cast -in-place concrete slab. The lateral stability of the dining and amenity portions will be provided by a combination of braced an d moment frames.CDB 040 -010-115 Section #### ## - Page 2 11/11/2019 2. Typical Elevated Floor Framing System: The typical floor will be a two -way slab system of approximately 12\" thickness with minimum 16\" square columns spaced no further than 30' on center. The typical concrete spandrel beams will be max imum 30\" deep where required to support masonry. The roof structure will be sloped a minimum 1/4in per foot for drainage. 3. Basement: The building basement for mechanical space and utility tunnel system connection will be constructed from cast -in-place conc rete walls with pilasters for the building columns above. The concrete walls will be supported on grade beams between caisson caps. 4. Foundation System: Caissons will be required for the residential portions of the building with 3' diameter shafts on averag e, extending at least 35' below grade to stiff sand where they terminate in a bell. Bedrock is first realized at 45'. The single -story s teel frame dining and amenity area is to be supported on shallow foundations bearing at frost depth. Slab-on-grade will typically be 5\" thick concrete reinforced with welded wire fabric (W6xW6 -W2.9xW2.9) on crushed stone fill having adequate soil prepared in accordance with the geotechnical recommendations, applicable ASTM standards and IDOT specifications. 2.3 NEW LONG -TERM CARE FACILITY STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION A. The new four -story ( total) long term care facility will be a cast -in-place concrete structure with primarily brick masonry facade. The building will have 12' -8\" floor -to-floors typical. Based on the residenti al programming requirements but with flexibility for future renovat ion, the building will be constructed of cast -in-place concrete columns, walls, and slabs. The exterior wall system consists primarily of a masonry veneer with CMU for the backup system. S teel shelf angles attached to concrete spandrel beams will be provi ded to support the masonry at each floor line. The new building is considered an \"essential facility\" per the VA Design Guide, and therefore shall be I -2, Type IA construction type and sha ll be designed with Risk Category IV requirements. 1. Main Wind Force Resisting System: The overall lateral stability of the building will be provided by concrete shear walls. The diaphragm will consist of a cast -in-place concrete slab. Building movement jo ints are provided between the main 'wings' to allow for better lateral performance. 2. Typical Elevated Floor Framing System: The typical flo or will be a two -way slab system of approximately 12\" thickness with minimum 16\" square columns spaced no further t han 30' on center.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY 2.1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. The site improvements consist of the renovation and construction of senior residence facilities and associated site development work for those new facilities. T he major building structures consist of the replacement of Ma rkword and Fletcher Halls with the construction of a new domiciliary, as well as a new four -story long -term care facility. New utility tunnels and above ground pedestrian link structures will als o be constructed to link buildings. Site development includes necessary grading, drainage, utilities, entry plaza(s), hardscape/landscape, parking, and roadway improvements to support the new buildings 2.2 SITE DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES A. The guiding site develop ment objective shall be to develop a unified campus with improved conditions and functionality for the residents, staff, community, and the surrounding environment. B. The grading design of the campus shall provide a usable, well drained site. The o verall gra ding design shall ensure positive drainage away from all structures and shall direct stormwater into the stormwater sewer system. The grading design shall ensure that there is no ponding or standing water in swales, grassed areas, landscaped beds , or paved areas. The grading design for all pedestrian walks and plazas shall provide minimized slopes to provide accessible access with minimal use of steps or ramps while still maintaining adequate drainage. C. New development impacts the na tural hydrology of a site , both through soil compaction and the addition of impervious surfaces where pervious surfaces existed previously. Stormwater design will address runoff rate and volume to minimize erosion concerns and discharge to natural CDB 040 -010-115 Section #### ## - Page 2 11/11/2019 drainage paths and the municipal stormwater system, as well as runoff quality to minimize downstream sedimentation, contamination, and flooding. D. Demolition and removal of existing sanitary service as we ll as new service shall be designed to ensure continuous services throughout constructi on of new facilities. It will also address longstanding maintenance issues through sewer rodding and televising to improve campus wide service. E. The design shall facilitate pedestrian access throughout and around the site in a continuous network. There shal l be a clear separation between pedestrians and vehicular traffic. Crosswalks shall be provided and clearly delineated whereve r walks cross vehicle lanes. All pedestrian walkways that connect Facility building entrances to Accessible parking spaces/transit stops/public sidewalks shall meet the requirements of ADA. All pedestrian drop -off and loading areas shall meet the requireme nts of ADA. F. Public and staff vehicular access throughout the site will be through the main loop road around the campus with minor roadways to leading to the various buildings. The grading design for all public drives and parking areas shal l result in minimized slopes to ensure ease with proper drainage. Truck loading areas and docks shall be graded to allow for a level truck to ease in loading/unloading. Lawn and landscaped areas shall not have grades greater that 25% to allow for ease in m aintenance. Routes for fire truck access will be designed provide vehicle access to within 300 feet on new buildings with a Bus-40 (Firetruck). 2.3 SITE DEVELOPMENT A. EARTHWORK 1. Site grading is designed to promote the flow of stormwater runoff to the proposed underground storm sewer system with the use of ditches and swales. There is approximately 48' of elevation change between the northeast corner and the high point at the Old Stone Building and 68 'of elevation change from the Old Stone Building to the stream on the sou th side of the property. The change in elevation will require some mass grading of materials onsite to accommodate the construction of new buildings. Slopes and grades will be designed to provide gentle slopes and grades where possible. Retaining walls wil l be utilized as required. B. STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN 1. Soil erosion and sediment control will be designed to meet the requirement s of the Illinois Urban Manual. A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan will be required before construction begins. Best Management Practices will be incorp orated within the earthwork design to the extent practical. 2. All construction activity and site distu rbance should follow the minimum standards set by the Illinois EPA for the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan ('SWPPP'). However, as this remains an act ively used and operated campus housing our veterans during the construction phase, all construction ac tivity on campus shall be well planned, scheduled and coordinated carefully. Access to CDB 040 -010-115 Section #### ## - Page 3 11/11/2019 campus and emergency services and utilities need to be operational through the process of construction, and coordinated with the campus leadership and CDB project manage r 2.4 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT A. The stormwater management system is designed to meet the considerations from the Quincy Storm Water Detention Requirements. The system will convey stormwater from the new buildings and surrounding site improvements through a detenti on system using Best Mana gement Practices for water quality measures. Per the Quincy Storm Water Detention Requirements, the stormwater leaving the site will have the same intensity as the undeveloped site for the 10 -yr 24 -hr and 100 -yr 24 -hr storm events. Detailed designer shall verify design storms correlate to 95th percentile storm required for LEED credits as defined in specification SECTION 018113.14 - SUSTAINABLE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS - LEED\u00ae v4 - v4.1 BD+C for Building Design and Construction\" New Cons truction (NC) B. The site generally drains in four directions. The north portion drains towards the northern creek, the west portion drains to the City of Quincy storm sewers, the south portion drains to lake Illinois, and the east portion drains towards th e 12th street combined s ewer. Grate inlets and curb inlets will be used to catch stormwater runoff from vegetated and paved areas, respectively. A series of pipe networks will be used to convey the stormwater to storm trap detention basins (if required) an d to existing or propose d outlets. C. For the north section, detention will be provided by a storm trap detention basin located underneath the proposed section of parking lot. The west section will drain into a series of bio swales located in the center strip of the proposed parkin g lot to achieve a portion of the required detention. The overflow for the bioswales will drain into a storm trap located underneath the north portion of the parking lot to provide the additional detention required. The south portion detention requirements will be met by the existing Lake Illinois. The re -developments in the east portion will reduce the amount of detention required to a minimal amount. No additional detention is proposed for the south and east portions. D. Runoff was cal culated using the SCS runoff equation in Autodesk Storm and Sanitary Analysis 2018. A Curve Number of 61 was used for the pervious areas and 98 was used for all the impervious areas. Weighted curve numbers were used for each sub - catchment. The model also i ncluded the existing a nd proposed pipe networks to determine flow rates to the detention basins and outlets using the kinematic -wave method. E. For each drainage area the total volume was calculated under three site conditions, including the proposed condit ions, the existing conditions, and the undeveloped conditions. The difference in runoff volume between the proposed conditions and the lesser of either the existing conditions or the undeveloped conditions is assumed to be the required detention volume. Th e detention volume for the four drainage areas is outlined below: CDB 040 -010-115 Section #### ## - Page 4 11/11/2019 Drainage Area Required Detention Volume (ac -ft) North 3.03 West 1.36 South 0.77 East 0.64 2.5 UTILITIES A.

The reports appended to the Bridging Documents are intended to help generate a high -level overview of the nature of the site and conditions within. Numerous Recogni zed Environmental Conditions (RECs) were documented as part of the Phase I ESA and will need to be addressed for handling, assessment and remediation as part of construction following all applicable laws and codes. The number of soil borings and soil samp les collected as part of the geotechnical analysis and the Phase II ESA were the determined to give the widest possible investigation over the Campus and they were conducted in areas where construction was determined to be taking place, based upon informat ion provided by the design teams assembling the Bridging Documents. The geotechnical and environmental analysis are intended to help the potential DB teams in their initial assessments. However, as the DB team are granted flexibility in site routing of ut ilities and location of buildings, they are expected to conduct their own investigations under the final decided footprints and utility layouts if they are different from the locations investigated in the geotechnical investigation and the Phase II ESA. Mi nimum requirements are established in the CDB's Design and Construction manual, current edition. The Design -Builder's (DB's) further investigations are expected to be guided by plan design, areas and depths of impact on site for both site -civil, landsca pe, building, utility, demolition and other related activity like construction material staging, construction traffic activity and such that are needed for a full and complete execution of the project. Both geotechnical and environmental sampling were con ducted in areas accessible at the time of the investigation. Additional geotechnical and environmental sampling should be conducted by the DB teams, as necessary, under the footprints of buildings after demolition activity is complete to further character ize and evaluate the subsurface material present at the Campus. These samplings would include, but not be limited to, geotechnical and environmental sampling. Additionally, soil gas sampling should be conducted as part of any additional environmental investigation in areas which would be under any proposed building foundations. It would be the responsibility of the DB teams to prepare any and all reports needed to document these additional investigations and submit them to the State CDB. Special note on buried unmapped, underground utilities: While the campus has access to some level of mapped underground utilities, it is expected that these are not comprehensive and accurate enough for construction activity. Special care needs to be exercised in arran ging for a utility locating and mapping exercise prior to construction activity and associated environmental requirements. Soil handling and disposal and/or reuse shall be conducted in accordance with all appropriate Illinois Environmental Protection Agen cy (IEPA) standards and regulations. Careful records shall be maintained of all activity and submitted to the State CDB in paper and electronic formats at the end of the process, and prior to billing. Progress of paperwork is expected to be documented pri or to 50% milestone billings for such environmental activity.

See the below link to a graphic assisting with 'What Counts as a Product'. https://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/Does%20this%20Item%20Count%20as%20a%20Product.pdf A. A \"product\" or a \"permanently installed building product\" is defined by its function in the project. A product includes the physical components and services needed to serve the intended function. If there are similar products within a specification, each contributes as a separate product. Examples: a) Products that arrive at the project site ready for installation are all separa te products: Metal studs, Wallboard, Concrete masonry units (CMU) b) For wallboard, the gypsum, binder, and backing are all required for the product to function, so each ingredient - Does NOT count as a separate product. 1. Products that arrive as an ingredient or component used in a site -assembled product: 2. Concrete admixtures are considered separate products because each component (admixture, aggregate, and cement) serves a different function; each component is therefore a separate product . 3. Similar products fro m the same manufacturer with distinct formulations versus similar products from the same manufacturer with aesthetic variations or reconfigurations: a) Paints of different gloss levels are separate products because each paint type is specified to serve a dif ferent function, such as water resistance. b) Different colors of the same paint are not separate products because they serve the same function c) Carpets of different pile heights are separate products because they are used for different kinds of foot traffic d) The same carpet in a different color is not a separate product 4. Desk chairs and side chairs in the same product line are separate products because they serve different functions. 5. Two side chairs d iffering only in aesthetic aspects, such as the presence of arms, are not different products. 5.3 Determining Product Cost ( https://www.usgbc.org/guide/bdc ) See MR Overview. A. Product and materials cost : (LEED v4.1 Option 2 : Multi -Attribute Optimization) 1. Includes : All taxes and expenses to deliver the material to the project site incurred by the Design Builder. 2. Excludes : Costs for labor and equipment required for installation after the material is delivered to the s ite. B. Total materials cost of a project, use either: 1. Actual materials cost or 2. Default materials cost a) Actual Materials Cost : This is the cost of all materials being used on the project site, excluding labor but including delivery and taxes. b) Default Material s Cost: The alternative way to determine the total materials cost is to calculate 45% of total construction costs. CDB 040 -010-115 Section 018113 - Page 28 11/7/2019 c) Default materials cost can replace the actual cost for most materials and products. d) If the project team is including optional products and ma terials, such as furniture and MEP items, add the actual value of those items to the default value for all other products and materials C. Location Valuation Factor 1. Several credits in the Materials and Resource section include a location valuation factor (Reg ional Sourcing), which adds value to locally produced products and materials. The intent is to incentivize the purchase of products that support the local economy. 2. Products and materials that are extracted, manufactured, and purchased within 100 miles of the project are valued at 200% of their cost. a) Qualifying for the location valuation factor (Regional Sourcing): meet two conditions within 100 mile radius - Direct geographical point -to-point Distance - Not Travel via Road, Waterway, Train Distance b) All extraction c) Manufacture d) Purchase (including distr ibution): The Point of Purchase is considered the location of the purchase transaction. For online or other transactions that do not occur in person, the point of purchase is considered the location of product distribution. D. Salvaged and reused materials lo cation valuation : 1. Reused Materials: The source location of extraction or harvest is the location of the materials before their removal to the project site. 2. For material taken from another building, the source location is the building. 3. For items purchased from a building materials salvage store or recycling facility, the source location is the store or facility. In this case, it is not necessary to track material to the original building. E. Determining Material Contributions of an Assembly : Some sustainabilit y criteria apply to the entire product, as is the case for product certifications and programs. However, some criteria apply to only a portion of the product. The portion of the product that contributes by weight to credit requirements could be either: 1. Percentage of a homogeneous material 2. Percentage of qualifying components that are mechanically or permanently fastened together. 3. Homogeneous Examples: Composite flooring, ceiling tiles, and rubber wall base. 4. Assembly Examples (parts mechanically or permanent ly fastened together): Office chairs, Furniture, demountable partition walls, premade window assemblies, and doors. 5. Calculate the value that contributes toward credit compliance as the percentage, by weight, of the material or component that meets the crit eria, multiplied by the total product cost. a) Product value ($) = Total product cost ($) x (%) product component by weight x (%) meeting sustainable criteria CDB 040 -010-115 Section 018113 - Page 29 11/7/2019 5.4 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN COST AND ACTION PLAN(S) SUBMITTALS A.

The contracts are administered by the User Agency 's Project Manager . On this project, the authority to modify the contract in any way is strictly limited to the authority of the User Agency 's Project Manager . B. Whole Building Commissioning is a process that relies upon frequent and direct communications, as well as collaboration between al l parties to the construction process. By its nature, a high level of communication and cooperation between the Commissioning Agent and all other parties ( Bridging Architect s, Engineers, Sub Design Builder s, Vendors, third party testing agencies, etc.) is essential to the success of the Commissioning effort. C. With these fundamental practices in mind, the commissioning process described herein has been developed to recognize that, in the execution of the Commissioning Process, the Commissioning Agent must develop effective methods to communicate with every member of the construction team involved in delivering commissioned systems while simultaneously respecting the exclusive contract authority of the Contracting Officer and Resident Engineer. Thus, the p rocedures outlined in this specification must be executed within the following limitations: 1. No communications (verbal or written) from the Commissioning Agent shall be deemed to constitute direction that modifies the terms of any contract. 2. Commissioning Is sues identified by the Commissioning Agent will be delivered to the User Agency and copied to the designated Commissioning Representatives for the Design Builder and sub Design Builder s on the Commissioning Team for information only in order to expedite th e communication process. These issues must be understood as the professional opinion of the Commissioning Agent and as suggestions for resolution. 3. In the event that any Commissioning Issues and suggested resolutions are deemed by the User Agency to requ ire either an official interpretation of the construction documents or require a modification of the contract documents, the User Agency Project Manager will issue an official directive to this effect. 4. All parties to the Commissioning Process shall be indi vidually responsible for alerting the User agency Project Manager of any issues that they deem to constitute a potential contract change prior to acting on these issues. 5. Authority for resolution or modification of design and construction issues rests sole ly with the User agency Project Manager , with appropriate technical guidance from the Bridging Architect /Engineer and/or Commissioning Agent. 1.4 RELATED DOCUMENTS A. Drawings and general provisions of the Contract, including General and Supplementary Conditions and other Division 01 Specification Sections, apply to this Section. B. User Agency 's Project Requirements (OPR) and Basis of Design (BOD) documentation prepared by User Agency and Bridging Architect contains requirements that apply to this Section. 1.5 SUMMARY A. This Section includes general requirements that apply to implementation of commissioning without regard to systems, subsystems, and equipment being commissioned. 1.6 ACRONYMS List of Acronyms Acronym Meaning A/E Bridging Architect / Engineer Design Team AHJ Authority Having Jurisdiction ASHRAE Association Society for Heating Air Condition and Refrigeration Engineers BAS Building Automation System BOD Basis of Design BSC Building Systems Commissioning CDB 040-010-115 Section 019113 - Page 3 11/7/2019 List of Acronyms Acronym Meaning CCTV Closed Circuit Television CD Construction Documents CMMS Computerized Maintenance Management System COBie Construction Operations Building Information Exchange CPC Construction Phase Commissioning Cx Commissioning CxA Commissioning Agent CxM Commissioning Manager CxR Commissioning Representative DPC Design Phase Commissioning FPT Functional Performance Test GBI-GG Green Building Initiative - Green Globes HVAC Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design NEBB National Environmental Balancing Bureau O&M Operations & Maintenance OPR User Agency 's Project Requirements PFC Pre-Functional Checklist SD Schematic Design SO Site Observation TAB Test Adjust and Balance USGBC United States Green Building Council 1.7 DEFINITIONS Bridging Architect : Includes Bridging Architect identified in the Contract for Construction between the USER AGENCY and Design Builder , plus consultant/design professionals responsible for design of fire suppression, plumbing, HVAC, controls for HVAC systems, electrical, communications, electronic safety and security, as well as other related systems.

USER AGENCY : Includes the USER AGENCY , or other authorized representative of the User Agency . User Agency 's Project Requirements (OPR): A written document that details the project requirements and the expectations of how the building and its sys tems will be used and operated. These include project goals, measurable performance criteria, cost considerations, benchmarks, success criteria, and supporting information. Precision: The ability of an instrument to produce repeatable readings of the same quantity under the same conditions. The precision of an instrument refers to its ability to produce a tightly grouped set of values around the mean value of the measured quantity. Pre-Design Phase Commissioning: Commissioning tasks performed prior to the c ommencement of design activities that includes project programming and the development of the commissioning process for the project Pre-Functional Checklist (PFC): Pre-functional Checklist: a list of items provided by the Commissioning Agent to the Design Builder that require inspection and elementary component tests conducted to verify proper installation of equipment. Pre -functional Checklists are primarily static inspections and procedures to prepare the equipment or system for initial operation (e.g., b elt tension, oil levels OK, labels affixed, gages in place, sensors calibrated, etc.). However, some Pre -functional Checklist items entail simple testing of the function of a component, a piece of equipment or system (such as measuring the voltage imbalan ce on a three -phase pump motor of a chiller system). The term \"System Readiness\" refers to before functional testing. Pre - CDB 040-010-115 Section 019113 - Page 6 11/7/2019 functional Checklists augment and are combined with the manufacturer's start -up checklist and the Design Builder 's Quality Control c hecklists. Pre-Functional Test (PFT): An inspection or test that is done before functional testing. PFT's include installation verification and system and component start up tests. Procedure or Protocol: A defined approach that outlines the execution of a sequence of work or operations. Procedures are used to produce repeatable and defined results. Range: The upper and lower limits of an instrument's ability to measure the value of a quantity for which the instrument is calibrated. Resolution: This word has two meanings in the Cx Process. The first refers to the smallest change in a measured variable that an instrument can detect. The second refers to the implementation of actions that correct a tested or observed deficiency. Site Observation Visit: On-site inspections and observations made by the Commissioning Agent for the purpose of verifying component, equipment, and system installation, to observe Design Builder testing, equipment start -up procedures, or other purposes. Site Observation Reports (SO R): Reports of site inspections and observations made by the Commissioning Agent. Observation reports are intended to provide early indication of an installation issue which will need correction or analysis. Special System Inspections: Inspections required by a local code authority prior to occupancy and are not normally a part of the commissioning process. Static Tests: Tests or inspections that validate a specified static condition such as pressure testing. Static tests may be specification or code initiated. Start Up Tests: Tests that validate the component or system is ready for automatic operation in accordance with the manufactures requirements. System: A system is defined as the entire complex which must be coordinated to work together during normal opera tion to produce results for which the complex is designed. For example, air conditioning supply air is only one component of an entire system which provides comfort conditions for a building. Other related components are return air, exhaust air, steam supp ly, chilled water supply, refrigerant supply, hot water supply, controls and electrical service, etc. Another example of a complex which involves several components of different disciplines is a boiler installation. Efficient and acceptable boiler operatio n depends upon the coordination and proper operation of the fuel supply, combustion air, controls, steam, feed water supply, condensate return and other related components. Systems Functional Performance Test: a test, or tests, of the dynamic function and operation of equipment and systems using manual (direct observation) or monitoring methods. Systems Functional Performance Testing is the dynamic testing of systems (rather than just components) under full operation (e.g., the chiller pump is tested intera ctively with the chiller functions to see if the pump ramps up and down to maintain the differential pressure setpoint). Systems are tested under various modes, such as during low cooling or heating loads, high loads, component failures, unoccupied, varyi ng outside air temperatures, fire alarm, power failure, etc. The systems are run through all the control system's sequences of operation and components are verified to be responding as the sequences state. Traditional air or water test and balancing (TAB) is not functional testing, in the commissioning sense of the word. TAB's primary work is setting up the system flows and pressures as specified, while functional testing is verifying that which has already been set up. The Commissioning Agent develops th e Systems Functional Test Procedures in a sequential written form, coordinates, directs and documents the actual testing. Systems Functional Testing is performed by the Design Builder . Systems Functional Performance Tests are performed after Pre -function al Checklists, startups, and control systems are complete and functional, and TAB functions are complete. Systems Manual: A system -focused composite document that includes all information required for the User Agency s operators to operate the systems. Test Procedure: A written protocol that defines methods, personnel, and expectations for tests conducted on components, equip ment, assemblies, systems, and interfaces among systems. Testing: The use of specialized and calibrated instruments to measure parameters such as: temperature, pressure, vapor flow, air flow, fluid flow, rotational speed, electrical characteristics, veloci ty, and other data in order to determine performance, operation, or function. CDB 040-010-115 Section 019113 - Page 7 11/7/2019 Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing (TAB): A systematic process or service applied to heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and other environmental systems to ac hieve and document air and hydronic flow rates. The standards and procedures for providing these services are referred to as \"Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing\" and are described in the Procedural Standards for the Testing, Adjusting and Balancing of Envir onmental Systems, published by NEBB or AABC. Thermal Scans: Thermographic pictures taken with an Infrared Thermographic Camera. Thermographic pictures show the relative temperatures of objects and surfaces and are used to identify leaks, thermal bridging, thermal intrusion, electrical overload conditions, moisture containment, and insulation failure. Training Plan: A written document that details, in outline form the expectations of the operator training. Training agendas should include instruction on how t o obtain service, operate, startup, and shutdown; and maintain all systems and components of the project. Trending: Monitoring over a period of time with the building automation system. Unresolved Commissioning Issue: Any Commissioning Issue that, at the time that the Final Report or the Amended Final Report is issued that has not been either resolved by the construction team or accepted by the User Agency . Validation: See Verification Verification: The process by w hich specific documents, components, equipment, assemblies, systems, and interfaces among systems are confirmed to comply with the criteria described in the User Agency 's Project Requirements. Warranty Period : Warranty period for entire project, including equipment components. Warranty begins at Substantial Completion and extends for at least one year, unless specifically noted otherwise in the Contract Documents and accepted submittals. Warranty Phase Commissioning: Commissioning efforts executed after a project has been completed and accepted by the User Agency . Warranty Phase Commissioning includes follow -up on verification of system performance, measurement and verification tasks and assistance in identifying warranty issues and enforcing warranty provi sions of the construction contract. Warranty Visit: A commissioning meeting and site review where all outstanding warranty issues and deferred testing is reviewed and discussed. Whole Building Commissioning: Commissioning of building systems such as Buildi ng Envelope, HVAC, Electrical, Special Electrical (Fire Alarm, Security & Communications), Plumbing and Fire Protection as described in this specification. 1.8 SYSTEMS TO BE COMMIS SIONED A.

If any of the loop operational tests are deemed not acceptable by the CxA or A/E additional tuning shall occur and the testing repeated until they are satisfactory to both the CxA and A/E. 5. Provide positive and negative \"bump\" tests demonstrating loop stability by raising and lowering loop set points. A general sequence of events is as follows: a. Trend logs and the graphical plots are setup. b. The system is allowed to operate in steady state fo r 5 minutes prior to the start of the test. c. Provide a setpoint change to initiate a step increase \"bump\". d. Allow the system time to respond and settle within the defined tolerance for 5 minutes. (The duration time starts when the control no longer cycles o ut of the defined tolerance). e. Provide a setpoint change to initiate a step decrease \"bump\". f. Allow the system time to respond and settle within the defined tolerance for 5 minutes. (The duration time starts when the control no longer cycles out of the defin ed tolerance). g. Repeat steps c through f one additional time. h. Plot graph and save excel data for transfer to the CxA and A/E. i. The following plot is an example of the graph layout that will be required. K. Additional Loop Tuning Documentation 1. Provide the following documentation after loop tuning has been completed. 2. Loop tuning documentation and constants for each loop of the building systems. The documentation shall be submitted in outline or table separated by system, control type (e.g. heating valve temperature control); proportional, integral and derivative constants, interval (and bias if used) for each loop. The following table is a sample that can be used as a template for submission.

Sensor Calibration Document a. Provide a sensor calibration table listing the referencing the location of procedures to following in the O&M manuals, and the frequency at which calibration should be performed for all sensors, separated by system, subsystem, and type. The calibration requiremen ts shall be submitted both in the O&M manuals and separately in a standalone document containing all sensors for inclusion in the commissioning documentation. The following table is a sample that can be used as a template for submission. AIR HANDLING UNIT AHU-1 (Example) Sensor Calibration Frequency O&M Calibration Procedure Reference Discharge air temperature Once a year Volume I Section D.3.aa Discharge static pressure Every 6 months Volume II Section A.1.c 3.4 FUNCTIONAL PERFORMAN CE TESTING AND BUILDING ENVELO PE TESTING A. This paragraph applies to commissioning Systems Functional Performance Testing of equipment and systems for all referenced specification Divisions. B. Objectives and Scope: The objective of functional performance testing is to demonstrate that each system is operating according to the documented design intent and Contract Documents. Successful Completion of Functional Testing is a Prerequisite to Substantial Completion. Additionally, during the testing process, areas of deficie nt performance are identified and corrected, improving the operation and functioning of the systems. In general, each system shall be operated through all modes of operation where there is a specified system response. The Design Builder shall verify each s equence in the sequences of operation. C. Development of Functional Performance Test Procedures: Before Systems Functional Performance Test procedures are written, the Design Builder shall submit all requested documentation and a current list of change orde rs affecting equipment or systems, including an updated points list, program code, control sequences and parameters. Using the testing parameters and requirements found in the Contract Documents and approved submittals and shop drawings, the Commissioning Agent will develop specific systems functional test procedures and forms to verify and document proper operation of each piece of equipment and system to be commissioned. The Design Builder shall assist the Commissioning Agent in developing the Systems Fun ctional Performance Test procedures as requested by the Commissioning Agent i.e. by answering questions about equipment, operation, sequences, etc. Prior to execution, the Commissioning Agent will provide a copy of the Systems Functional Performance Test procedures to the USER AGENCY , the Bridging Architect /Engineer, and the Design Builder , who shall review the tests for feasibility, safety, equipment and warranty protection. D. Purpose of Test Procedures: The purpose of each specific Systems Functional Perf ormance Test is to verify and document compliance with the stated criteria of acceptance given on the test form. Representative test formats and examples are found in the Commissioning Plan for this project. (The Commissioning Plan is issued as a separate document and is available for review.) E. Test Methods: Systems Functional Performance Testing shall be achieved by manual testing (i.e. persons manipulate the equipment and observe performance) and/or by monitoring the performance and analyzing the results using the control system's trend log capabilities or by stand -alone data loggers. The Commissioning Agent shall determine which method is most appropriate for tests that do not have a method specified. 1. Simulated Conditions: Simulating conditions (not by an overwritten value) shall be allowed as determined by the CxA, though timing the testing to experience actual conditions is encouraged wherever practical. 2. Overwritten Values: Overwriting sensor values to simulate a condition, such as overwriting the outside air temperature reading in a control system to be something other than it really is, shall be allowed as determined by the Commissioning Agent, but shall be used with caution and avoided when possible. Such testing methods often can only test a part o f a system, as the CDB 040-010-115 Section 019113 - Page 20 11/7/2019 interactions and responses of other systems will be erroneous or not applicable. Simulating a condition is preferable. e.g., for the above case, by heating the outside air sensor with a hair blower rather than overwriting the value or by altering the appropriate setpoint to see the desired response. Before simulating conditions or overwriting values, sensors, transducers and devices shall have been calibrated. 3. Simulated Signals: Using a signal generator which creates a simulated signal t o test and calibrate transducers and DDC constants is generally recommended over using the sensor to act as the signal generator via simulated conditions or overwritten values. 4. Altering Setpoints: Rather than overwriting sensor values, and when simulating conditions is difficult, altering setpoints to test a sequence is acceptable. For example, to see the Air Conditioning compressor lockout initiate at an outside air temperature below 12 C (54 F), when the outside air temperature is above 12 C (54 F), temp orarily change the lockout setpoint to be 2 C (4 F) above the current outside air temperature. 5. Indirect Indicators: Relying on indirect indicators for responses or performance shall be allowed only after visually and directly verifying and documenting, ov er the range of the tested parameters, that the indirect readings through the control system represent actual conditions and responses. Much of this verification shall be completed during system readiness testing. 6. Setup: Each function and test shall be performed under conditions that simulate actual conditions as close as is practically possible. The Design Builder shall provide all necessary materials, system modifications, etc. to produce the necessary flows, pre ssures, temperatures, etc. necessary to execute the test according to the specified conditions. At completion of the test, the Design Builder shall return all affected building equipment and systems, due to these temporary modifications, to their pre -test condition. 7. Sampling: No sampling is allowed in completing Pre-functional Checklists . Sampling may be allowed for functional test procedures execution if noted in the Cx Plan . The CxA shall determine the sampling rate however the Design Builder should e xpect to test at 100% . If at any point, frequent failures are occurring and testing is becoming more troubleshooting than verification, the CxA may stop the testing and require the Design Builder to perform and document a checkout of the remaining units, prior to continuing with functionally testing the remaining units. Costs associated with testing expanded samples and/or all equipment or systems of the specified type are the responsibility of the Design Builder . 8. Cost of Expanded Sample Testing: The c osts including CxA labor and expenses for expanded sample System Functional Performance Test shall be solely the responsibility of the Design Builder . Any required expanded sample testing by the Design Builder shall not be considered a justified reason fo r a claim of delay or for a time extension by the Design Builder . 9. Coordination and Scheduling: The Design Builder shall provide sufficient notice to the CxA and User Agency regarding the completion schedule for the Pre-functional Checklists and startup of all equipment and systems. The CxA shall schedule functional tests through the Design Builder and User Agency . The CxA shall direct, witness and document the functional tes ting of equipment and systems. The Design Builder shall execute the tests. 10. Testing Pre -Requisites: In general, functional testing shall be conducted after system readiness testing and startup has been satisfactorily completed. The control system shall be sufficiently tested and approved by the Commissioning Agent and the User Agency before it is used for TAB or to verify performance of other components or systems. The air balancing and water balancing shall be completed and debugged before functional testi ng of air -related or water -related equipment or systems. The Design Builder shall provide the following documentation prior to scheduling functional testing activities . a. Equipment static test reports using the cover page provided at the end of this specific ation. b. Equipment startup reports using the cover page provided at the end of this specification. c. Point -to-Point checkout documentation d. Sensor / Input calibration verification record using the form provided at the end of this specification. e. Actuator / Outpu t calibration verification record using the form provided at the end of this specification. f. A sensor calibration table listing the referencing the location of procedures to following in the O&M manuals, and the frequency at which calibration should be perf ormed for all sensors, separated by system, subsystem, and type. The calibration requirements shall be submitted both in the O&M manuals and separately in a standalone document containing all sensors for inclusion in the commissioning documentation. The fo llowing table is a sample that can be used as a template for submission.

Documentation : The Commissioning Agent will direct, witness, and document the results of all Systems Functional Performance Tests using the specific procedural forms developed by the Commissioning Agent for that purpose. Prior to testing, the Commissioning Agent will provide these forms to the USER AGENCY and the Design Builder for review and approval. The Design Builder shall include the filled out forms with the O&M manual data. B. Non-Conformance: The Commissioning Agent will record the results of the Systems Function al Performance Tests on the procedure or test form. All items of non -conformance issues will be noted and reported to the USER AGENCY on Commissioning Field Reports and/or the Commissioning Master Issues Log. 1. Corrections of minor items of non -compliance id entified may be made during the tests at the discretion of the Commissioning Agent. In such cases, the item of non -compliance and resolution shall be documented on the Systems Functional Test Procedure form. 2. Every effort shall be made to expedite the syste ms functional performance testing process and minimize unnecessary delays, while not compromising the integrity of the procedures. However, the Commissioning Agent will not be pressured into overlooking non -compliant work or loosening acceptance criteria t o satisfy scheduling or cost issues, unless there is an overriding reason to do so by direction from the USER AGENCY . 3. As the systems functional performance tests progress and an item of non -compliance is identified, the Commissioning Agent shall discuss th e issue with the Design Builder and the USER AGENCY . 4. When there is no dispute on an item of non -compliance, and the Design Builder accepts responsibility to correct it: a. The Commissioning Agent will document the item of non -compliance and the Design Builder 's response and/or intentions. The Systems Functional Performance Test then continues or proceeds to another test or sequence. After the day's work is complete, the Com missioning Agent will submit a Commissioning Field Report to the USER AGENCY . The Commissioning Agent will also note items of non -compliance and the Design Builder 's response in the Master Commissioning Issues Log. The Design Builder shall correct the item of non -compliance and report completion to the USER AGENCY and the Commissioning Agent. b. The need for retesting will be determined by the Commissioning Agent. If retesting is required, the Commissioning Agent and the Design Builder shall reschedule the test and the test shall be repeated. 5. If there is a dispute about item of non -compliance, regarding whether it is an item of non - compliance, or who is responsible: a. The item of non -compliance shall be documented on the test form with the Design Builder 's response. The item of non -compliance with the Design Builder 's response shall CDB 040-010-115 Section 019113 - Page 22 11/7/2019 also be reported on a Commissioning Field Report and on the Master Commissioning Issue s Log. b. Resolutions shall be made at the lowest management level possible. Other parties are brought into the discussions as needed. Final interpretive and acceptance authority is with the USER AGENCY . c. The Commissioning Agent will document the resolution pr ocess. d. Once the interpretation and resolution have been decided, the Design Builder shall correct the item of non -compliance, report it to the Commissioning Agent. The requirement for retesting will be determined by the Commissioning Agent. If retesting i s required, the Commissioning Agent and the Design Builder shall reschedule the test. Retesting shall be repeated until satisfactory performance is achieved. C. Cost of Retesting: The cost to retest any portion of a Functional Performance Test or to validat e deficiency resolution of issues shall be solely the responsibility of the Design Builder including the costs for the Commissioning Agent time and expenses . Any required retesting by the Design Builder shall not be considered a justified reason for a cla im of delay or for a time extension by the Design Builder . D. Failure Due to Manufacturer Defect: If 10%, or three, whichever is greater, of identical pieces (size alone does not constitute a difference) of equipment fail to perform to the Contract Documents (mechanically or substantively) due to manufacturing defect, not allowing it to meet its submitted performance spec, all identical units may be considered unacceptable by the User Agency . In such case, the Design Builder shall provide the USER AGENCY with the following: 1. Within one week of notification from the USER AGENCY , the Design Builder or manufacturer's representative shall examine all other identical units making a record of the findings. The findings shall be provided to the User Agency within two weeks of the original notice. 2. Within two weeks of the original notification, the Design Builder or manufacturer shall provide a signed and dated, written explanation of the problem, cause of failures, etc. and all proposed solutions which shall include ful l equipment submittals. The proposed solutions shall not significantly exceed the specification requirements of the original installation. 3. The USER AGENCY shall determine whether a replacement of all identical units or a repair is acceptable. 4. Two examples of the proposed solution shall be installed by the Design Builder and the USER AGENCY shall be allowed to test the installations for up to one week, upon which the USER AGENCY will decide whether to accept the solution. 5. Upon acceptance, the Design Builder and/or manufacturer shall replace or repair all identical items, at their expense and extend the warranty accordingly, if the original equipment warranty had begun. The replacement/repair work shall proceed with reasonable speed beginning within one week f rom when parts can be obtained. 6.

These t ests shall be conducted in the same manner as the seasonal tests as soon as possible. 2. Seasonal Functional Performance Testing: Deferred Seasonal Systems Functional Performance Tests are those that must be deferred until weather conditions are closer to t he systems design parameters. The Commissioning Agent will review systems parameters and recommend which Systems Functional Performance Tests should be deferred until weather conditions more closely match systems parameters. The Design Builder shall revi ew and comment on the proposed schedule for Deferred Seasonal Testing. The USER AGENCY will review and approve the schedule for Deferred Seasonal Testing.
