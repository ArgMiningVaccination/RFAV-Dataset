Whether going out for a run or meeting a friend at an outdoor restaurant, you felt the benefits of being outdoors. Soothing breezes and a glowing sunset naturally make you feel good. Well, the coronavirus couldn't stop springtime \u2014 don't let it stop you from enjoying nature. Even a walk around the block can nourish your senses when you're mindful. The sight of budding flowers, a parade of clouds and the sound of birds singing can calm your spirit and bring back balance, at least for the moment. Do what you can to stay connected to nature in whatever way you can. It's a beautiful path to greater wellness. People have long been interested in the healing power of nature. Perhaps most famously, Henry David Thoreau spent two years secluded in the woods of Massachusetts while writing Walden, his classic meditation on life and nature. Even in 1845, Thoreau sensed that the forest, or any other outdoor setting, can quiet the mind and improve your health. More than a century and a half later, there is plenty of science on the healing power of nature to back him up. Ecopsychology \u2014 which explores the relationship between human beings and the natural world\u2014is a growing field, and studies show that spending time in nature can reduce stress, improve overall feelings of well-being and happiness, raise your energy level and even increase your capacity for caring. Nature's Health Benefits It Boosts Your Mood Stepping outdoors into the warmth of a sunny day is a great way to bring a smile to your face, and there's a reason for that. Sunlight provides you with nourishing, energizing vitamin D, which has been shown to boost mood, calm the nervous system and improve issues such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Beyond this, vitamin D also promotes calcium absorption in the body, and getting the proper amount of it can minimize the risk of hypertension, cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. It Keeps You in the Present Unplugging from daily life and getting outdoors allows you to focus on the now. At its essence, connecting with nature encourages you to be in the present moment, to quiet your mind and take in the sights, sounds and smells that surround you, and that you may not have noticed in a while. A basic form of meditation, bringing your attention to the present (rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future) can minimize stress and anxiety. It Energizes You While you may think a double espresso is the key to getting over an afternoon slump, research suggests that a walk in the woods is a better bet. A series of studies published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology revealed that people who were exposed to nature for as little as 20 minutes a day experienced elevated energy levels and better overall mood than those who were not. It Makes You Kinder A study by the University of Rochester found that when exposed to nature, people tend to feel more generous, more connected to their community and more socially conscious. Even simply looking at photos of nature reinforced feelings of connection with other living things, which in turn reminded people of basic values like generosity and caring. It Strengthens Your Spirituality There can be a deeply spiritual side to connecting with nature, helping provide us with a stronger sense of self. We may be part of a universe larger than we can imagine, but that doesn't mean we can't find comfort in the vast environment around us. Reconnect by doing something as simple as walking barefoot over a mossy forest floor or dipping your toes in the ocean. How to Get Your Daily Dose of Nature Making the conscious decision to introduce more nature into your life is the first step in reaping its healing powers. Spend time planting in your garden, or simply relaxing in your backyard. Try leaving your phone, tablet, or book inside and really focus on the smells, sounds, sights and textures surrounding you instead\u2014the fragrance of your rose garden, the feel of the wind on your face, the chirping of the birds. When it's time to get back to business as usual, remember that even life management can often be done outside; pay some bills from your patio, for example. Try, too, to get outdoors when you exercise\u2014do your morning yoga routine in a park, or walk the nature trail instead of hitting the treadmill. Nourish your body and your soul by dining outside during your office lunch hour or family dinner time. When you can't spend as much time outdoors as you'd like, bring a touch of the outdoors inside. Add indoor plants to your home or office space, or even a desktop water fountain. Hearing the sound of running water can have a calming effect, and studies have shown that having indoor plants can reduce headaches and fatigue. Related "}
