The term rajayakshma has been used interchangeably with tuberculosis. It is potentially fatal wasting disease that \"consumes\" the body. This chapter describes etio-pathogenesis, signs and symptoms and principles of management. Groups of signs viz. a group of three signs, six signs and eleven signs are enlisted to designate variety of srotasa (systems) involved with increasing severity of disease. The complications and prognosis are elaborated to categorize the disease as one of the dreadful diseases. Treatment with modern antitubercular medicines reduces mortality in patients with tuberculosis (cure rate 11.42% and the death rate 40.9%) but when combined with Ayurvedic treatment there was significant improvement (cure rate 41.3% and the death rate 3.8%). Keywords: Rajayakshma, kshaya, shosha, tuberculosis, vyadhikshamatva, dhatukshaya, immunity, depletion of tissues, wasting diseases. Introduction Rajayakshma has been identified since Vedic period (2400 BC). Yakshma,the word, first appeared in the vedas (Rigveda and Atharvaveda), but a detailed description was missing. In the Ayurvedic treatises, or the Samhitas (1000 BC to 500 AD), a detailed description of rajayakshma can be found. An account of its definition, etiology, pathogenesis, general features, management, and the prognosis is found in [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita), Sushruta Samhita, and Ashtanga Hridaya in [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita). Four etiological factors are described, sahasa (over exertion or working beyond one's capacity), samdharana (suppression of natural urges), kshaya (depletion of tissue element) and vishamashana (irregular diet). The chapters viz. [Sosha Nidana](/index.php?title=Sosha_Nidana&action=edit&redlink=1), [Rajayakshma Chikitsa] and [Kshatakshina Chikitsa](/index.php?title=Kshatakshina_Chikitsa) deal with similar clinical presentation of disease and principles of management. Dhatukshaya is common feature in all. Advancement of dhatukshaya in sosha reaches a stage when immuno-suppression with resulting opportunistic infection occurs and is called rajayakshma. In kshatakshina or urakshata there is chest injury due to direct or indirect trauma along with dhatukshaya. [Brimhana](/index.php?title=Brimhana) of [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu) (nourishment) is the principle line of management. Thus upsarga(additional contact or exposure to) may be considered as Sannikrishta Nidana (recent cause) of rajayakshma. Sushruta was aware of this fact, and he has described its contagious nature by saying that skin diseases, fever, rajayakshma and conjunctivitis are infectious diseases which spread from one man to another man. Symptomatology of rajayakshma has been described in three different categories viz. trirupa, shadrupa and ekadashrupa. It seems that trirupa denotes the description of early tuberculosis when the disease is of mild nature whereas shadrupa is the clinical manifestation of the moderately advanced disease. Shadrupa is the cardinal symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis which are found in the majority of the patients. Ekadashrupa or eleven-fold manifestation may appear in the far advanced stage of tuberculosis or in those patients whose vyadhikshamatva (immunity) is hina (low). The clinical presentation of disease includes groups of signs with their specific pathogenesis. The increasing number of signs denote severity of disease and spread of disease over body organs. As far as the treatment is concerned, mild samshodhana therapy is indicated in excess aggravation of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha). However drastic purification leading to emaciation is strictly contraindicated especially [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana) (purgation) therapy. Samshamana (pacification) therapy includes treatment of symptoms and treatment of emaciation to increase the declining [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu) (tissues) of the body by using various types of meat and wines. Meat having high protein content helps in rebuilding body tissues whereas wine acts as a tonic and appetizer, it also helps open the blocked channels thereby providing proper nutrition to all the tissues of the body. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) (rejuvenatives) have a significant role in enhancing immunity and thereby preventing infectious diseases. The formulations described in [Rajayakshma Chikitsa] enhance immunity as well as an adjuvant therapies to anti-tubercular treatments in current practices. This chapter underscores the importance of judicious combination of modern drug treatment of infectious diseases with Ayurvedic treatment to achieve better results.[1] Sanskrit text, Transliteration and expound the chapter \"Rajayakshma Chikitsa\"(Management of Wasting Diseases). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2] History of disease | |||| | |||| | |||| (Moon)'s passionate cohabiting (with Rohini, one of his 28 celestial wives) - was narrated by the Gods to the sages. Because of his excessive sexual indulgence with Rohini, Chandrama soon started neglecting his own health, becoming emaciated due to depletion of his bodily unctuousness (essence or vitality). Besides, his inordinate attention to just one wife in comparison to the others resulted in his not being able to satisfy the desires of his remaining wives - all of whom were the daughters of Daksha Prajapati (Lord of Progeny). This ill-treatment to his daughters made Daksha furious, and his anger came out of his mouth in the form of breath that took a physical form (Yakshma). The now lusterless, afflicted Moon sought clemency from the great Daksha, accompanied by the Gods and Sages. Daksha Prajapati , now realizing Chandrama's pure state of mind (and therefore, admitting his folly), became cordial to him got him treated by the Ashwin, the celestial physicians. The Ashwins having enhanced his [ojas](/index.php?title=Ojas) (vital essence), Chandrama additionally acquired a great purity of mind. [3-10] Synonyms of disease and history of (disease suffering) - these terms are synonymous, and indicate misery. Because it afflicted Chandrama, the king of stars, originally, it is called rajayakshma, or the king of diseases. This disease, having been treated by the Ashwin in the celestial world, has come down to the world of mortals (i.e., human beings). Here, it afflicts human beings after being triggered by a four-fold causative factor [11-12] Four important causative capacity, suppression of natural urges, depletion of tissue elements and irregular dietary habits are the etiological factors of rajayakshma. [13] 1. Sahasaja rajayakshma (due to over exertion beyond capacity) | |||| | |||| beyond capacity, a person indulges in excess battle, reading, weight-lifting, walking, jumping, swimming etc. or falls down - or gets injured -or exerts himself in any action that is beyond his strength or tolerance, leads to chest injury and , vitiates [vata dosha](/index.php?title=Vata_dosha). This These vitiated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha), along with [vayu](/index.php?title=Vayu), spread in all direction within body (pradhavati) and cause eleven symptoms, with each symptom directly corresponding to the particular part of the body. If the deranged [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) enters the head, it causes headache; if the throat, then irritation in throat, cough, hoarseness of voice and anorexia; if the chest, then pain in the sides of the chest; if the anus, then diarrhea; if in the joints, then fever, yawning and pain in the chest. Injury to the chest and coughing cause the patient to spit out phlegm along with blood. In this case, the patient suffers from unbearable pain in his chest due to pulmonic damage. These eleven symptoms are manifested in the patients suffering from yakshma caused by overexertion. [14-19] 2. Vegasandharanaja rajayakshma (due to suppression of natural or disgust or fear one suppresses the impelling urge to pass flatus, urine and/or feces, [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), due to the obstruction of such urges, propels [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) and [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) upwards, obliquely and downwards within the body, causing the disorders having symptoms of all three [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha) such as coryza, cough, hoarseness of voice, anorexia, pain in flank, headache, fever, pain in shoulders, bodyache, frequent vomiting and diarrhea. These are the eleven symptoms of rajayakshma caused due to suppression of urges. [20-23] 3. Kshayaja rajayakshma (due to depletion of tissues) | eagerness, fever, terror, anger, grief, excessive indulgence in sexual intercourse, and fasting leads to depletion of [shukra](/index.php?title=Shukra) and [ojas](/index.php?title=Ojas). This, in turn, due to loss of unctuousness, provokes [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) which further aggravates the other two [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha) and causes eleven symptoms such as\u2014coryza, fever, cough, bodyache, headache, dyspnea, diarrhea, anorexia, pain in flanks, feeble voice and feeling of warmth in shoulders. These eleven symptoms indicate the advent of the great disease rajayakshma due to wasting. [24-27] 4. Vishamashanaja rajayakshma (due to irregular dietary habits) | intake of dietary articles, or irregular dietary habits lead to vitiation of [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha), causing severe amavisha disorders. These vitiated [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha) obstruct the channels of blood etc. leading to weaning away of [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu) and causing the 11 symptoms of rajayakshma caused due to irregular dietary habit: - Due to vitiated [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha): coryza, excessive salivation, cough, vomiting and anorexia, - Due to vitiated [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta): fever, distress in shoulder and haemoptysis, and - Due to vitiated [vata](/index.php?title=Vata): pain in flanks, headache and hoarseness of voice.[28-31] signs | coryza, debility, nitpicking (or an inclination to find faults where there is no reason to), morbid appearances on the body; feeling of disgust, loss of strength and flesh (inspite of consuming adequate food), craving for women, wine and meat, desire to be always covered by something (feeling of cold), imagined feeling of one's food being infested with insects, flies, hair,, rapid growth of hairs and fingernails, imagined feeling of being attacked by birds, wasps, and animals, seeing dreams of climbing heaps of hair, bones, and ashes, and dreaming of dried or withered ponds, mountains, and forests- these are to be known as premonitory symptoms of rajayakshma of various types.[33-38] Pathogenesis and clinical features [] |||| | |||| | | |||| | describe the pathogenesis, clinical features and management in brief. Normally, the [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu) of the body get metabolised (being acted upon) by their own ushmas or dhatvagnis (transforming enzymes in the tissue elements). From these [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu), (nutrient tissue elements), the other [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu) ( next [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu) to it that which receive nourishment) gets nourished through their respective srotas (channels of circulation). (For example, a poshaka [rasa dhatu](/index.php?title=Rasa_dhatu) would nourish the [rakta dhatu](/index.php?title=Rakta_dhatu) ). Once, however, there is any obstruction to srotas or if there is diminution of stable tissue elements like [rakta](/index.php?title=Rakta) or if there is diminution of [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu)-ushmas or dhatvagnis then rajayakshma is manifested. In such a case, whatever food is digested in the gastrointestinal tract by jatharagni is mostly reduced to waste products and very little of it contributes to the formation of [ojas](/index.php?title=Ojas) (nourishment). The patient is depleted of all tissue elements and strength. The patient's stool should be preserved and it is the only source of strength left with him. Because of the obstruction to the srotas, [rasa dhatu](/index.php?title=Rasa_dhatu) becomes vidagdha (improperly metabolized) in its own location (heart) and this vitiated [rasa](/index.php?title=Rasa) comes out through the upper passages in different forms by way of coughing. Subsequently, six or eleven symptoms (or forms of diseases) are manifested, and their aggregation is the syndrome called rajayakshma. Cough, distress in shoulder, change of voice, fever, pain in flanks, headache, vomiting of [rakta](/index.php?title=Rakta) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha), dyspnea, diarrhea and anorexia are the eleven symptoms of rajayakshma ; or they are also six viz., cough, fever, pain in flanks, hoarseness of voice diarrhea and anorexia. With eleven, six or even three of the symptoms, a patient is incurable if he is losing [mamsa](/index.php?title=Mamsa) (flesh tissues) and strength, but he is curable if he is behaving otherwise in spite of showing all the symptoms. [39-47] Signs of pratishyaya | the root of the nasal passage cause nasal catarrh in the patients whose head is afflicted with [vayu](/index.php?title=Vayu). This results in severe pratishyaya (coryza) affecting entire body of the patient, This leads to emaciation of the body; its signs and symptoms are headache, heaviness in the head, loss of smell, fever, cough, increase of mucous secretion, change of voice, anorexia fatigue and asthenia of the senses and then rajayakshma manifests. [48-50] (when afflicted with rajayakshma) contain slimy, thick, putrid, greenish or white-yellowish matter along with [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha). [51] of rajayakshma include a feeling of warmth (or burning sensation) in the shoulders and flanks, burning sensation in hands, and feet, and raised temperature all over the body.[52] Swarabheda (hoarseness of voice) and characteristics as per [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) or [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) or blood or by, strain of coughing or by coryza. The voice becomes husky, feeble and unstable if caused by [vata](/index.php?title=Vata); if by [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta), there will be burning of the palate and throat and the patient will refrain from talking; and if due to [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha), the voice is low, choked and is marked with a wheezing sound; owing to the obstruction to the flow of blood, the voice becomes low and comes out with difficulty; the throat becomes injured by the strain of exorbitant coughing and in case of coryza, the characterstics of the voice resemble the condition in [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) afflictions. The rajayakshma patient is afflicted with pain in the sides of the chest (flanks) which is inconsistent and manifests during constriction and expansion of chest during breathing, with headache, burning and heaviness.[53-56] Rakta patients' indulgence in irregular diet causes expectoration of blood. The [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) too, having been vitiated, is expectorated from the throat. [57] Causes of depletion of tissues obstruction in the circulation, the blood does not nourish the flesh tissues and other body elements. The blood staying in the stomach, getting agitated owing to incremented quantity, passes to the throat. Due to the obstruction of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) in the chest, there occurs dyspnea and the agni, being impaired by the morbid humors, causes the patient to pass loose and slimy stools.[57-59] Cause of anorexia dislike for food is caused by morbidity of one or all the three [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha) in the tongue or heart or by repugnant perceptions. By knowing the astringent, bitter or sweet taste in the mouth, anorexia is to be diagnosed as caused due to dominance of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) or [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) respectively. Anorexia due to morbid perceptions is psychosomatic, caused due to visually observing disturbing or morbid visuals. [60-61] Cause of or vomiting is caused by anorexia, bouts of coughing, and the precipitation of morbid [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) and as a result of fear; it occurs as a complication of other diseases additionally. [62] Management of rajayakshma | are caused due to vitiated three [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha) and hence the physician should treat the patient after examining the degree of intensity of the morbid [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) and the vigor of the patient. The physician should carefully observe the status (of patient) - by the symptoms such as coryza, headache, cough, dyspnea, asthenia of the voice and pain in flanks. [63-64] Various dietary articles in treatment | [] |||| | |||| | |||| bath, cooked barley and barley gruel, meat juices of quail, partridge, chicken and vartaka quail prepared with salt, acid, pungent, sultry and unctuous articles should be given. The patient should imbibe the juice of goat-meat prepared with long pepper, barley, horse gram, dry ginger, pomegranate or emblic myrobalan and unctuous articles. By taking this, the hexad of coryza and other disorders vanishes. The patient should be treated with a suitable diet of soups made up of radish or horse gram or out of staple food composed of barley, wheat or shali rice. A potion made up of the clear supernatant part of varuni wine or water, prepared with pentaradix, or with coriander and dry ginger or with feather-foil, or with the tetrad of herbs called parnini is advised. Articles of diet may additionally be consumed with these decoctions.[65-70] [Swedana](/index.php?title=Swedana) (sudation) | |||| the flanks, the chest and the head regions should be made to sweat by a commixed type of lump sudation prepared using krushara (a type of gruel), utkarika (hot poultice), ebony gram, horse gram, barley and milk pudding; or the head should be effused genially with warm decoction prepared using the leaves of heart leaved sida, guduchi and liquorice; or the steam kettle sudation prepared with the decoctions of the heads of goat and fish or with [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) pacifying decoctions should be utilized for sweating the throat, head and sides of the chest. The flesh of aquatic and wet land animals, the decoction of pentaradix or sour conjee with unctuous articles may be utilized in steam kettle sudation. The poultices well prepared with cork swallow wort, heart of dil seeds, leaved sida, liquorice, saccharine flag cooked meat, white yam, radish, the flesh of aquatic and wet land creatures and commixed with all the four kinds of unctuous articles should be applied to persons suffering from pain applied to persons suffering from pain in the head, side of the chest and shoulder region.[71-76] Alepana and sandalwood with ghee make an effective curative for pain in the head, sides of the chest and shoulder regions. [77] | |||| | and blue water-lily; gum , guggulu, deodar, sandalwood, fragrant poon and ghee; - climbing heart leaved sida, white yam, drumstick and hog's weed; - climbing asparagus, milky yam, ginger grass, liquorice and ghee: these four groups of drugs, described one in each half verse for preparation of application are propitious in conditions of pain in the head, side of the chest and the shoulder region arising from bi- [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)discordance. [78-80] Beneficial procedures of purification with medicated oils, and enemata are very useful options to help ease pain. In conditions of pain in the head, flanks and shoulder region, the vitiated blood should be depleted by betokens of the horn, bottle gourd, application of leeches or venesection.[81-82] External applications | cuscus grass and sandal wood with ghee is salutary; or the application of scitch grass, liquorice, Indian madder and fragrant poon soaked in ghee; or the application composed of tubers of white lotus chaste tree, red lotus, fragrant poon, blue water lily, rushnut and milky yam with ghee. Inunction with the compound sandal oil or ghee processed for hundred times and affusion with milk or liquorice water are recommended. Effusion with cold rainwater or the sandalwood group should be given. Thus the pacification treatment has been described.. [83-86] Indications of [shodhana](/index.php?title=Shodhana) aggravated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha), mild therapeutic emesis and purgation therapies after proper [snehana](/index.php?title=Snehana) (oleation) and [swedana](/index.php?title=Swedana) (sudation) which do not cause emaciation can be administered. The emaciated man (consumptive) may suffer death even on loosening of stools. Then what can be said if a strong dose of purification is given in rajayakshma patient beyond his tolerance?[87-88] Various formulations for [nasya](/index.php?title=Nasya) (nasal system is well purified, the following tested recipes should be utilized for the remedy of cough, dyspnea, loss of voice and pain in the head, sides of the chest and shoulder region: - Ghee admixed with heart-leaved sida and tick-trefoil group of drugs or with white yam or with liquorice and salted, makes good nasal medication for the amelioration of voice. - Ghee admixed with the tubers of white lotus, liquorice long pepper, Indian nightshade, heart leaved sida and milk is an excellent nasal medication for the amendment of the voice.

Similarly, goat's milk along with the meat-juice of jungala animals and chick pea, green gram and math gram, prepared in the form of soup, may additionally be utilized as wholesome diet.[114-116] Treatment of burning sensation described earlier (in [Jwara Chikitsa](/index.php?title=Jwara_Chikitsa)) are employed with ghee for the treatment of fever and burning sensations in the cases of patients suffering from rajayakshma. [117] Treatment of productive cough/excessive expectoration and vomiting | expectoration of phlegm in a strong patient and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) dominant condition, he should be treated with emesis by a draught of milk mixed with emetic nut or with liquorice decoction mixed with emetic nut, or gruel prepared with emetic drugs and mixed with ghee. And after proper emesis, light diet along with digestive stimulants should be given in meals. The person who is taking the diet consisting of barley and wheat, honey wine, sidhu wine, medicated wine and the spit roasted meat of animals of arid habitat will subdue his [kapha dosha](/index.php?title=Kapha_dosha). When there is excessive formation of phlegm, the [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) expels this phlegm out of the body. This type of excessive phlegm expectoration should be treated with unctuous and hot medications. This line of treatment for excess expectoration is also recommended for vomiting. A diet consisting of food and beverages that are hridya ( liked by mind), alleviate [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) and light to digest are advised. [118-122] Treatment of diarrhea | |||| | |||| | |||| | |||| | the impairement of agni, diarrhea accompanied with mucus occurs in patients of rajayakshma.

The meats of elephant, rhinoceros and horse well-seasoned with spices should be given in the denomination of buffalo-flesh, for promoting the flesh of the patient. The flesh of birds and animals that have grown plump on flesh diet is an excellent flesh-enhancing food. because of its quick action, hot potency and light to digest nature. [149-155] Administration of meats in disguised form (or without telling the patient) | the patient is not used to consume meats and that are not relished, it may cause harm to patient. Then considering the benefit towards patient's health and making him suitable to eat, meat should be given trickily in other disguised forms (or under dissimulated designations without telling the patient). If the patient comes to know that meat is being given to him, then he would not eat the meat or if eaten, would vomit it. (Hence, in these patients, the recipe should not be shared with patients). [156-157] Best animal meats in rajayakshma | peacock, partridge, chicken, swan, hog, camel, ass, bull, and buffalo are best to enhance flesh tissues in the patient. A wise physician should take meticulous note of the eight groups of creatures, described in the chapter on 'eats and drinks', and then cull the opportune flesh for the patient. [158-159] Types of meats for alleviation of specific [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) tearer group of creatures , wet land and aquatic animals and wading birds should be given in large measures as food to one suffering from the [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) dominance in rajayakshma. The flesh of peckers, gallinaceous birds and jangala beasts and birds should be given to those consumptives who are predominantly affected with [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) and [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta).

The rajayakshma patient shall take prasanna, varuni or sidhu wine or simple medicated wines as per suitability after taking a meat-diet. Wine owing to its qualities of quickly acting, hot potency, cleansing effect, and subtle action, churns up obstructions in the orifices of the body channels and soon dilates them. As a result of this re-establishment of the liberation of circulation in the vessels, all the seven body- elements get nourished, and the wasting due to rajayakshma soon gets cured. [163-167] Various ghee formulations |||| , with the meat-juice of carnivorous animals may be administered with honey to the rajayakshma patient or the ghee prepared in ten times the quantity of milk may be given to the patient. The medicated ghee prepared in the decoction of dashamula, milk and meat-juice with the paste of drugs of the madhura (sweet) group is an excellent remedy for rajayakshma. The medicated ghee prepared with the paste of long pepper, roots of long pepper, chaba pepper, white flowered leadwort, dry ginger, barley, alkali and milk is a cleanser of body channels. The medicated ghee prepared in the decoction of Indian ground sel, heart-leaved sida, small caltrop, tick trefoil, fog weed and milk along with the paste of cork swallow wort and long pepper, is curative of rajayakshma . These medicated ghees may be taken with gruel or licked with honey or eaten commixed with the food in the suitable dose. Thus has been described the dietetic regimen for the rajayakshma.[167-172] External treatments | |||| | being proper therapeutic massage, should be given a tub- bath with unctuous liquid, milk and water in order to mitigate the constriction of the channels and to enhance vigor and plumpness. After tub-bath, the patient should be made to sit at his ease and once again be treated with a gentle massage lightly with hands utilizing mishraka sneha( mixed forms of sneha), and then with a massage mixed with powder and unctuous matter as described below.

Then the patient should take a bath in water in which have been boiled vitality-enhancing herbs, the paste of white mustard and the paste of fragrant substances, cooling the water to the degree of temperature found congenial in the particular season. [173-179] Lifestyle treatments |||| | |||| [] | |||| | [] should then adorn himself with perfumes, flower garlands, habiliments and ornaments, touch auspicious articles, worship the gods, the Brahmins and the Vaidya. He should eat suitable food and drink with favorite color, taste, feel and odor, prepared by agreeable persons and leading to comfort. Those grains, which are a year old, are to be utilized in the preparation of food for the patients of rajayakshma. Those which are light to digest , which have not lost their nutritive quality and which are dainty, fragrant and virilific, are the most wholesome. The rajayakshma patients, in order to amend their vigor and flesh must utilize those articles that are prescribed as wholesome in the treatment of kshata-kshina(chapter 11). It is a recourse to inunction (applying oil), massage, congenial and untorn garments, effusions, baths immersion baths, internal and external cleansing which are congruous to the prevailing season, enemata, milk ghee, meat-foods cooked rice commixed with meat juices, suitable wines, delectable perfumes, optical discernment of friends, comely things and adolescent women, the congenial sound of musical compositions and the musical instruments , cheering and comforting words, constant accommodation to preceptors and elders, practice of brahmacharya, charity, austerity, worship of the gods, truth, rectitudinous, conduct, auspicious rites, nonviolence and deference to the physician and Brahmins, that one gets liberate from rajayakshma , the king of disease. The patient desirous of regaining his health should perform the same spiritual therapies enjoined by the vedas as those by the performance of which this king of diseases was subdued in the first instance. [179-189] Summary - symptoms band syndromes of designations and symptoms have been described in brief and methods of treatment extensively. Explanations of the designation of rajayakshma, incurable, curable, and formidable conditions: these have been addressed in this chapter on the ' Therapeutics of rajayakshma '. [190-191] Tattva Vimarsha (Fundamental Principles) - Over-exertion beyond one's capacity, suppression of natural urges, depletion of tissue elements and irregular dietary habits are the etiological factors of rajayakshma. - The symptoms are manifested where the vitiated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)are lodged and interact with the [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu). - One shall know his own capacity or tolerance before starting any kind of activity. Otherwise the activities done beyond one's capacity leads to depletion of [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu), vitiation of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)and rajayakshma. - One shall not suppress the natural urge to prevent vitiation of [vata dosha](/index.php?title=Vata_dosha)and rajayakshma. - The samprapti (pathogenesis) of rajayakshma includes obstruction in channels and depletion of [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu). - Normally, the [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu)of the body get metabolized (being acted upon) by their own ushmas or dhatvagnis (transforming enzymes in the tissue elements). From these [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu), (nutrient tissue elements), the other [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu)(next [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu)to it that which receive nourishment) gets nourished through their respective srotas (channels of circulation). (For example, a poshaka [rasa dhatu](/index.php?title=Rasa_dhatu)would nourish the [rakta dhatu](/index.php?title=Rakta_dhatu)). - Rajayakshma is manifested if there is any obstruction to a srotas or if there is diminution of stable tissue elements like [rakta](/index.php?title=Rakta)or if there is diminution of [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu)-ushmas or dhatvagnis then. - In coryza, sudation, inunctions, medicated smoke application, effusion, bath are the modes of treatment. - Nasal errhines, medicated smokes, post prandial unctuous potions, inunctions with medicated oils, enemata and blood letting are indicated to release pain in head and shoulder region. - In cases of excessively aggravated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha), mild therapeutic emesis and purgation therapies after proper [snehana](/index.php?title=Snehana)(oleation) and [swedana](/index.php?title=Swedana)(sudation) which do not cause emaciation can be administered. - The signs like diarrhea, anorexia manifest due to impairment of the agni. Treatment shall be planned to improve functioning of agni, stopping diarrhea and promoting taste in mouth. - The nourishment therapies with ghee, linctus, milk processed with the herbs having properties of sweet, bitter taste and cold potency are used in treatment of rajayakshma. - Meat and madhvika (wine prepared from honey) are considered the best diet in rajayakshma. - The disease does not persist long in one who is well disciplined and with good mental strength (control over mind), who daily drinks varuni wine, regularly follows external cleansing of the body (maintains cleanliness) and who does not suppress the natural urges. - Lifestyle treatments intended to enhance mental strength and comfort for patient are administered in rajayakshma. Vidhi Vimarsha (Applied Inferences ) General pathogenesis Pathogenesis Sahasaja rajayakshma /urakshata: - Laksha mixture 10 to 20 grams frequently with vasavaleha - Amritaprasha 10 to 20 grams after meals with milk - Vishamashanaja : - Swarna vasanta 250 to 500 mg between two meals with milk - Drakshasava 10 to 20 ml after meals with water - Vegarodhaja: - Chaturbhuja kalpa 125 to 250 mg before meals with milk and chyavana prasha - Chaturmukha rasa 60 to 120 mg after brahmi prasha - Kshayaja rajayakshma : - Laksmivilasa rasa 250 to 500 mg between two meals with milk - Vanga mixture 500 to 1000mg between two meals with milk Cautions for purification treatments [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma)( therapeutic purification) treatments are indicated only in strong patients with excess aggravation of [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha) in rajayakshma. In a patient with low strength, purification is not done. If at all, it needs to be done due to excess [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha), then mild purification is prescribed after taking every care of strength of the patient. Role of [rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) in enhancing the immunity [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) drugs have got an important role in the management of rajayakshma. Mandagni (at the level of jatharagni and dhatvagni both) and srotovarodha play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) drugs act at various levels to promote nutrition. Some of them work at the level of [rasa](/index.php?title=Rasa) (enriching nutrient plasma) while others work at the level of agni (improve digestion and metabolism). Some other work at the level of srotas by promoting the competence of microcirculatory channels in the body leading to better bio-availability of nutrients to the tissues and improved tissue perfusion.[2] Hence, [rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) acting at all three levels may prove beneficial in the management of rajayakshma. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) drugs also improve the status of [ojas](/index.php?title=Ojas) in the body by their immunomodulatory action. Thus these drugs are used as an adjuvant to anti-tubercular drugs and they enhance efficacy of treatment at various levels. Details about [rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) drugs have already been described in first chapter of [Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana). Nidana parivarjana (removal of the causes) is yet another aspect of treatment. Research on [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) treatment in tuberculosis patients As we look back to the history of tuberculosis treatment, the immune-boost up was the main treatment. Ayurvedic treatment of tuberculosis was initiated in 1933 by the establishment of Patipukur TB Hospital, Kolkata. Later on, a full-fledged research unit was commissioned with exclusive budget. Treatment guidelines were adopted on Ayurvedic principles for therapeutic management which was a unique effort of its kind in pre-independence India. This regimen was discontinued from 1st November 1947 on the introduction of synthetic ATDs. Drugs containing mercury, gold, calcium was prepared at the in-house pharmacy and was administered to the patients with fresh juice of herbs cultivated in the hospital garden. Formulations like vasantamalati, kanchanabhra rasa, (Adatoda vasica) etc. on the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis using Ayurvedic medicine for over a period of 13 years is of immense value.[1] Research outcome relevant for public health from the Indian systems of medicine on tuberculosis at The Patipukur TB Hospital: Modern TB-drugs were administered to about 2766 patients and the cure rate turned out to be 11.42% and the death rate 40.9%. When a group of patients on modern anti-TB drugs received supplementary Ayurvedic drugs, the cure rate was 41.3% and the death rate was 3.8%. Studies have also been conducted to assess the role of Ayurvedic treatment in resistant cases. [1] Related Chapter Further reading - Shailaja C.
