Alternative medicine in Ghana is an important system of medical practice with legislation currently pending for promulgation. Objectives: To support this embryonic industry for potential role into our primary healthcare and public health system, there is a need for robust health care policy in the area of standardization coupled with strong political willpower and research in Ghana. The aim of this case study is to reflect the role of complementary alternative medicine in primary healthcare in Ghana. Methods: The study incorporates a mixed method engaged in integrated data analysis to investigate the challenges of practitioners of complementary alternative medicines as primary healthcare givers. Additionally, it evaluates the pull factors that drive consumers to complementary alternative remedies from the perspectives of the practitioners and finally, to evaluate the opinions of practitioners on consumers' push factors from mainstream medicine using Ghana as a case model. Scholars International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice The practice of traditional and alternative medicine in Ghana cannot be underestimated as many people have embraced the services of practitioners partly due to the minimum side effects involved. Practitioners of alternative medicines have also helped in educating the public on preventative issues and ultimately curative as well. However, a section of the public has raised concerns concerning activities of some practitioners, level of medical training, titles they use, the quality of schools run by some practitioners and the kinds of certificates they issue to trainees. As a practitioner, a staunch advocate of naturopathic medicine and a law student, I am now particular about policies and the legal framework for this industry to help streamline the sector to save the many vulnerable patients and ultimately complement conventional healthcare. This is because no industry is supreme. I believe this would also help to do away with the quack or unqualified practitioners in the system. This paper seeks to address these issues. The author will, as a Student of Law, seek to research into these areas by discussing relevant judicial decisions in other Common Law jurisdictions. This is because, to the best of my knowledge, no case relating to alternative medicine has been adjudicated in our courts in Ghana. Original Research Article Naturopathy Medicine is a new system of Medical practice gaining popularity in Ghana. Naturopathy uses science to bridge the gap between Conventional Medicine and Traditional Medicine through the Four Learning Areas of Science, which includes all the Basic and Medical Sciences like Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology as well as Pharmacology, Pathology, Medicine, Pharmacognosy, etc. This notwithstanding, the practice of Naturopathic Medicine has many challenges in Ghana as a new emerging medical practice. This paper investigates the challenges in the practice of Naturopathy and other alternative medicines in Ghana. Twenty (20) Naturopathic Medical Students were asked to write three challenges they faced in their Naturopathy and other alternative medicines during a class lecture on Naturopathy. In their result, the predominant issues raised by the students were regulatory issues in Ghana and limited Universities or training institutions to teach Naturopathic students. Other pressing challenges were insufficient government support to push alternative remedies, efficacy of natural products coupled with manufacturing compliance, cost of usage of natural products by patients, unhealthy challenges with medical fraternity and uniformity in Naturopathic association. In conclusion, practitioners of naturopathic medicines faced many challenges in Ghana and there is the need for the regulatory body, The Traditional and Alternative Medicine of the Ministry of Health to help raised the standards in the practice of Naturopathy Medicine. This can be achieved with government support to have the new Traditional and Alternative Medicine bill pending passed. Scholars International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice Tort is a very interesting aspect of civil law that seeks to provide remedy for injuries and non-pecuniary losses people experience as a result of the actions or omissions of others. In my study of Tort, I realized that it has so much to do with what goes on in the health sector, especially with regards to hospital-patient relations. It would seem however that its major concern is with the conventional medical sector. For instance, the case of Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee (1957) is the locus classicus when it comes to principles of tortious liability and medical practitioners. In that case, the court enunciated a yardstick (which came to be known as the-Bolam Test) that should be used to ascertain whether or not a hospital/medical practitioner had been negligent in the delivery of his duty to a patient. One wonders however, if the-Bolam test\" applies or would apply to alternative medicine practice? If not, what is an appropriate standard for measuring tortious liability among practitioners of alternative medicine? Cases of negligence in the context of alternative medicine are very rare in our law reports and there has not been any such case reported in Ghana to the best of my knowledge. Also, the Patients Rights of the Ghana Health Service (GHS) Charter interestingly asserted that: \"The patient is entitled to know of alternative treatment(s) and other healthcare providers within the Service if these may contribute to improved outcomes\". This means that alternative treatment is vital in the healthcare sector if it will improve on the quality of life (QOL) of the patient in Ghana. It is therefore vital to know of the court decision on prescribers of alternative medicines if the treatment goes sour. Also being a law student and practitioner of Naturopathy and Holistic Medicine, The Carlill V Carbolic Smoke Ball (1892) in Law of Contract case became my favorite partly because it falls under the umbrella of false claims and the company in question was a homeopathic company. It further signifies the many advertisements and claims made by practitioners of herbal, homeopathy and alternative medicine. Many of the practitioners in Ghana could be held liable if patients understand this principle and take them on for many of their false claims. In a nutshell, studying law has broadened my scope in the Medical field especially in the practice of Naturopathy and Holistic Medicine and I keep asking myself this simple question: How much of alternative and traditional medicine practitioners would survive if the legal principles were rigorously applied in Ghana? Recently, the Alternative Medical Association of Ghana (AMAG) with its core mandate to promote acceptable standards of practice in alternative medicine was launched and inaugurated. At the launched of the association, the Chairman for the occasion; Honorable Member of Parliament for Kade Constituency: Hon. Kwabena Ohemeng Tinyase, drew executive members' attention a song 'Heaven knows where we are going'. Himself; been a beneficiary of alternative medicine pledge to be an ambassador for the association. The song; originally composed by Osibisa with the original titled \" Woyaya \" literally means we are going. The song; I believed he sung as a figurative language to bring to the attention of the association the challenges ahead. The original version of the song goes like: \" we are going, Heavens knows where we are going. We know we will. It goes on to say that \" we will get there. Heavens knows how we will get there. We know we will. I t will be hard we know. And the road will be muddy and rough. But we will get there. We will know we're there. \" This figurative language from the honorable member of Ghana's Parliament provided the basis for this review paper on the legal framework of alternative medicine in Ghana and other countries for comparative analysis. At the launched, the association also called on parliamentarians to relook at the alternative medicine bill at the floor of the house. This paper aims to look at the various legislations governing alternative medicine worldwide and what needs to be done in alternative medicine in Ghana by the association. The paper will further make recommendations on the draft bill if the need arises in Ghana's parliament. Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2009 European Journal of Integrative Medicine Scholars International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice Interestingly, while some hospitals and clinics are now putting out banners for integrative medicine and offering herbal medicines, naturopathy, acupuncture, massage, nutrition, and other treatments, they are doing so without being taught about them in medical schools as part of an integrative model for medicine. In the book, Criminal Law in Ghana by P. K Twumasi, P. 585, he tackles practising medicine without authority: It reads: \"A person commits an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding C1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or both if he willfully and falsely takes or uses any name, title, addition or description evidently implying a qualification to practice medicine or dentistry, or without being registered under N.R.C.D. 91: (a) practises or professes to practise or publishes his name as practising medicine or dentistry or b) receives any payment for practising medicine or dentistry. This offence is created under section 48(1) of the Medical and Dental Decree (N.R.C.D. 91), and is a wholesale reproduction of section 20 of the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Ordinance, Cap. 69 of the Gold Coast. Mens rea is an essential element of the offence and therefore where a person accused honestly believed that he was entitled to use or assume any name or title, etc., he does not commit an offence under the decree: Commissioner of Police v. Wonkyi [13] 2 W.A.L.R. 196[16]\". In view of this, where integrative medicine is also being promoted, there is the need to assess the legal implications. The question for discussion and research is whether cross-system medical practice is permitted by law in Ghana? There is an increasing usage of herbal remedies worldwide. To adequately manage safety issues associated with herbal medicines, the future physician must possess good knowledge of them. Medical students of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year classes, totaling 284 completed a questionnaire in a cross-sectional study which assessed their knowledge and attitude towards herbal medicines. Data was analyzed using SPSS 18 and GraphPad 5.01. The respondents had good attitude (3.365 \u00b1 1.069/5 67.9%) but poor knowledge (4.697 \u00b1 3.509/16.5, or 28.5%). Advancing years of study had a significant effect on the students' overall knowledge of herbal medicine (p = 0.01). Majority of the students, 54.7% ever used herbal product with 77.5% of the users getting positive outcome of the treatment. The best known and used herb was the Neem plant (Azadirachta indica) used by most students to treat malaria. Although with limited knowledge, the medical students showed a high level of personal use and good attitude towards herbal medicines. Introduction of herbal medicine course in their medical curriculum should increase their knowledge and attitude so they could in the future adequately manage patients who used or intend to use herbal products together with the orthodox medicines.
