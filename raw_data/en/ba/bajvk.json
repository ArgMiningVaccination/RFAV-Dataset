She had seen the EVENING STAR article about you and would like to work for you or the Council or both. She has to have a job that pays, but she is also interested in working for a cause outfit. I gave her the Council's phone no. and address and suggested she call Mr. Forbes. She is interested in doing a small amoun t of volunteer work that would lead up to a full-time job with pay. She was once a secretary to Eisenhower. She is Southern. She talks a lot. Her office phone is: OX -6-9481. I said that you were not in the office at presen~, but that I would give you her message, and when you got a chance, you might call her today or tomorrow. K June 25, 1963 Dr. Szilard: Hi: Enclosed is a \"surprise\" from Dean Albert and a nice thought from Mr. Murrow. I have answered these two briefly explaining -\u00b7 that you have gone to Geneva and that I have sent you copies of their letters to you, and that you will probably be writing them soon. Anything further I can do, just let me know. Any other mail, such as a letter from Loring Mandel, that were just saging hello, I acknowledged briefly and records of all letters are being kept here. A manuscript from a Ferris Alger has arrived, dealing with aviation problems. It is in the form of a letter to Dr. Polykarp Kusch. I have written Dr. Alger noting its arrival and will keep it until you get back or send it back to him as you wish. Tris Coffin brought by a typed five page summary of facts from his article. I believe that I should type this so a copy can be kept here in the office, in case yours gets lost, and then send you the original. I may or may not get it in with this batch to-day. Anyway, it will be in tomorrow's batch to you. IN TODAY's: The Salvation Army,as I told you, has my name and number and will contact me re wardrobe trunks. I did not get a clearance from you as to: if I should buy one if it looks good or if I should buy more than one, and if so, how many? Rm. 740 at the I checked aut/i~e Hotel Monday morning and I now have everything at the Council except the typewriter and therein lies part of a long sad tale which I shall try to keep brief since I know you are a very busy man. In brief, the typewriter will be exchanged for a new model, and the Council will pay for it. In fAct, the Council will take over the contract from me. We have a substantial applicable rental accrued for a new machine and the Council office needs iriri~~ another machine. So I relinquish any claims on the machine. Lois Gardner feels that this is the best procedure, and I feel it is the really honest one. I have the guest's receipt for room 740 and the Council will receive one. I also have another receipt found in the box for 740, but it may be for 745. I will check have these out and any pertaining to you I will send you IF you want them. It is late, so I won't retype this, but the main things are down here, and I will write you tomorrow. Have a good relaxed time, both of you, and don't worry about anything here. Already I miss you, Dr. Szilard, Lois isn't as pretty for me as you are. Sincerely, ~ ~~~J Kay, v P.S. Mr. Dick Barnet does not now have the time to translate the Russian article that FOREIGN AFFAIRS sent you. He will, however, try to think of someone to do it. Is that alright with you YES NO Shall Ikeep it until you return -::?-:-:Y=-::S-- N_O ___ _ and then see what can be done E ---June 26, 1963 Dr. Szilard: I am enclosing two items which will need your signature. After this, shall I send these items or rather items of this nature on to Miss Cherin or send them to you, or hold them here? The one from Haskin & Sells arrived Special Delivery from Noreen Mann and perhaps it could wait until you get back, but I would like your special instructions on this. Please let me know what you do with these two enclosures so that I can keep my records straight. S-~4ApS ere ensto.&ee f.e;r yewJ: c e wni i T\"'ff, K 6/27/63 Dr. Szilard: A package from Bard's Surgical Supplies arrived for Mrs. Szilard. It contains samples of a catherization pack and somethin~ called Detergicide. I opened it to make sure there was nothing in it to be refrigerated. It is in your hotel room. There was a message for your wife that a Dr. Favour was in town and leaving for Denver. This message was left late yesterday afternoon and did not have a phone number to call back. The operators supposedly know - according to the front desk -that you are away, but I have requested that they ask the person to leave their number so that I could call them and explain that you are not in town. I hope this meets with your approval . Since there is no mail to forward tow you to-day, I thought that I would send the enclosed i tern and if you -ould mark it and send it back, I will order the items marked. If not, I will await your instructions. I have made a note of what I am sending you so that I can re-order it if you lose this one. I'm working so hard my feet hurt.rl I'm doing an inventory on all printed matter in the office. You can imagine what it is like: I suspect I will be happy to get back to the hotel ..... UM, even tho' I work hard there TOO. Take care and have a good Jluly 1, 1963 Dear Dr. Szilard: Well, Good morning! First: Will you tell your wife that I began to worry about her watch so I wrote a letter, certified mail, return receipt requested to the President of the Timex Corporation and inquired further about the watch. Then on Saturday, a return receipt arrived from a person at the Timex Corporation. The ~eturn receipt was not made out in my hand, so that it must have been on e that y.our wife sent. I just want to reassure 1'rs. Szilard that she had not been forgotten and that something is happening regarding her watch. 1,. _/ CvLL I\" [\u00a3 <;t-(.. {,.

J-{ L...; ....<:. t c.-<..-._,__ Kay Shannon PS The first and second secretaries of the Soviet Embassy came by the Council's office last Friday to get the Council's views on our memberships attitude re disarmament. Lois Gardner spoke with them and seemed to handle the situation very well. A Hill friend of mine tells me this is the function of 1st and 2nd secretaries here in town and it is rather run of the mill business. But, I thought you would like to know. While they were here, I cornered the 1st secretary and he will send me a copy of INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS which I can't seem to track down anywhere. KS Dear Dr. Szilard: Just one short glorious note to enclose the following and to let you know that it has been a very nice Independence Day in the Capitol of our nation. The public fireworks were stupendous -and costly - and also ours were great. We have our own private fireworks along the canal each year and it is lovely. Anyway, I hope you had a nice 4th, though of course it ism't a particular holiday (more than any other day) in Switzerland. I bet Mrs. Szilard has an even more gorgeous tan by now and that your nose has begun to peel. All goes as well as possible here. When you don't hear from me, you know there is no mail\u00ad except for one thing, which is enclosed . It ap~rs to be a deposit slip on a German bank. Am I too far off? Nevertheless, it wassent special delivery from Noreen Mann and I just picked it up at the Hotel to-day. It did arrive the evening of the 3rd, and as I was not around town yesterday, I only found it this morning. I hope it doesn't cause you any incon\u00ad venience. This evening, we are going camping , and I will not be back in twwn until Sunday, at which time I will go immediately to the Hotel and will then send youf,any mail that seems to be important. I hope trere isn't any as I do not want to keep you waiting. I am enclosing two more items which may interest you. Of course, I have the original of Dr. Webb's letter here, and also the original of the bank statement. I hope that you aremaking magnificent progress on the European lab! ~~ij~ Kay Shlnnon !tt,C-l 0, 1-V~e-, ..

Please thank Mrs. Szilard for the card, it looks gorgeous there. Raphael will like the red and white bus in the picture very much!

Gaede, a copy of which is enclosed,and I have acknowledged receipt of his letter to you. I enclose the NIH weekly calendar of events for your wife.

Argh. What an irking situation. But, thank you for the kind comments in your letter to Mr. Barnet. As soon as I have recovered from this blow to my own standards, I shall try to do something very remarkable for you so that you can go back to partially trusting me again In the meantime, there is nof mail of note to-day. A second bank statement has arrived for Mrs. Szilard and a paper titled, The Mass Proauction of Knowledge from Paul Zilsel of Western Reserve has arrived for you. The paper is short, observant, witty and \"wordy\". It will be here for you. '\\ { ~ ;~~~~ I await Mr. Barnet's call. If he doesn't call me, perhaps I should call ~ him in a week or two?

We have taken a rather spacious, very pleasant apartment (at a much lower rent) on Capitol Hill. This will not in any way interfere with any decision that you may make.about moving out of your hotel room though.

Perhaps soon you might let me know about when you think you will be back; various peopee ask me and I don't mind not having a definite date, but I would like to get an idea of whether it would be in one month or two. \\~en this direct mail campaign is on its feet, I am going to need a vacation. I need one NOW. But it would be most convenient for me ~~ to take 8 days at the end of August, when my doctor goes also. At y9ur convenience, then.

John Edsall send a dolphi~ post card from Greece on July 7 saying that he would be back in Boston on July 8th.

This weekend was like early Fall. Now let's see about your ,mail: Dr. Szilard: Noreen Mann sent along 2 items from Chicago. One, a letter from the instructor of Biomathematics at the Univ. of No. Carolina requesting members of the Biophysical Society to send him problems to go into a Freshman text for College Physics. A sample problem and a sheet for your own problem were enclosed also. It will be here for you. The second item was a note from Mrs. Mann which says: \"Dear Dr. Szilard: C.B.C. called this noon (from Toronto) and I referred them to your address at the Hotel Dupont Plaza.

The Shannons though are still recovering from their son, Raphael's, latest escapade, which was: on this past Saturday, on visiting our new apartment we learned that our young son had discovered the fuse box before we did, and had taken out all the fuses. He had also attempted to short the circuit by placing a penny in one of the fuses. It must have jolted him somewhat because he has not gone near it since. The fuse box is now padlocked, but, alas, Raphael is not. (He has no burns and appears to be all right).

There had been a long holiday before that though. After that came amounts in daily of $600 one day, $80 the nex t.

Mrs. Szilard, you must have som~nfluence up there, because the United States Time Corporation has,to-day1 sent you one gold, Timex dress watch. Unfortunately, I cannot remember whether this is exactly like the one you sent back or if it is more like the one you described as having sent them in the first place. Tomorrow, I will bring my Polaroid camera into the office and take a pictuEe of it and send it to you. The watch has only Roman numerals on it, and it is roun~ but qj\u00b7 not completely so. I tell you what, if this watch is not the one you want, why don't we do this ... I will give~hellee, my oldest daughter, my watch, which she likes, for her birthday, and then I will buy your watch, or rather the one that has just arrived. That way we will all be ha~py. I will have a watch that I really like, Dr. Szilard will like it better and Shellee will have a watch that she likes. You will be affluent enough to purchase the sort of watch that you want. What a fantastic intrigue: We shall call it the Great Watch Caper. Seriously, I hope that they have sent you the right watch this time, and it will be here for you. . I . Mrs. Szilard, ybu have also received .in the mail to-day a notice from HEW requesting that you send in a little card which states that you wish to continue the NIH Calendat of Events. I have checkedyour address on the return card, it is correct (for the Hotel Dupont Plaza) and I have returned the card so that_you will continue to receive this item. Also, the Associated Traffic Clpbs Insurance Corporation of Seaford, Delaware, has sent you (salutation is to:' \"Members of the University of Georgetown Faculty) a brochure describing an insurance plan. I will keep it here for you. Your magazines have been arriving regularly For Dr. Szilard: As far as the morning mail goes to-day, you have received one item: announcing the Sakonnet World Federalist meeting on Aug. 16-18, 1963. It does not say where the meeting is to bE\\held, or at least, where Sakonnet is. It is a typed list, but handwritten on it is a request that you attend. The signature is not legible. The return address is the same as on the envelope which yesterday arrived with the Democratie Mondiale. I shall acknowledge. If you wish to write the address is: Hayward Cottage, Little Compton, R.I., U.S.A. You have also received a letter this afternoon, from Ira & Edita Morris, authors, requesting that you endor~se their efforts for Hiroshima House, which has jsst received tax-exempt status from the government, though it has been in operation for sometime. They are trying to raise $150,000 for continuance of this house in Japan to provide various comfort facilities for the victims there. They would like to use your name on their sponsoring committee.

(I believe he is a photographer) July 17, 1963 3:45 pm Hans Namuth/nf HOLIDAY just called me. Tris Coffin had told him to get in touch with me to find out when you will be back. I said I did not know for sure, but I thought it would be about 6 weeks. (This, -L Lois Gardner has said1 sometime ago, that it might be). Mr. Namuth was a little disturbed by this. He was very polite but he acts like he wante to get this story settled once and for all. He wants to see you. If you are not back for six weeks, this would push his deadline somewhat. Could you tell me when you will be back and when you could see him? I will call him and let him know. Or, you could write him and arrange it. His address is 157 West 54th Street, N. Y. 19, N.Y. His phone no. is Circle 7-3592, but I will keep that in my little book for future information. PLEASE do let me know what you tell him. Also, Mr. Namuth says there is a very remote possibility that he may go to Europe later this summer and he might arrange to see you there. But, this is only a remote chance. \u00b7 Tris Coffin has been in and out of the office talking with Lois Gardner, and of c~rse is very polite, but I can't get any more out of him. I don't have any idea Df this means anything at all, but it occurred to me that perhaps I should tell you. K 4:05 pm -Tris~ Coffin just called. He said he wanted to write you so I gave him your address. I believe he said that HOLIDAY wants to do a fu~page picture of you. Anyway, the photographer will discuss it with you as soon as you let either he or I know whet your plans are. 4:06 Mr. Barnett called and I will send him the manuscript to-day. (sic) July 22, 1963 Dear Dr. & Mrs. Szilard: Good morning! I encloge the NIH Calendar of Events for you, Mrs. Szilard, and, unless there is something this afternoon, then, that is all for to-day.

Bob Moskin, Senior Editor from LOOK, has sent you the enclosed letter and quotes. They are excellent quotes by the way. There is to be a NASA symposium on theoretical biology in November in Buffalo, N.Y. to which you have been invited. A Dr. F. Freemont-Smith of the American Institute of Biological Sciences is handling the arrangements for this meeting. An earlier date of Sept. 17 -19 was planned, but this has been changed until November. The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, Box 219 in Aspen, Colo. will hold an Alumni Week, Sept. 22 -27, ane it will cost $365 for you and your wife. The invitation is here with your other mail. Cyrus Eaton's assistant has sent a mimeographed form letter with enclosure to ''Dear Friend of Pugwash\" which discusses an editorial about a PARADE article stressing Mr. Eaton's role of peacemaker re Russia and U.S. And a Lou Meseai who is with HO~IDAY called to say that it would prol:nbly be better to have their\"man in Paris, Arthur Newman, meet you over there for the pic~uree. He wants me to call him later this week to let him know when you are returnin g. Now, perhaps I an confusin g you. I really don't want you to come back right away. I believe you are having a good time, but my reason for asking so often was merely to get m idea of when you will be back so I don't have to flounder around when someone asks me, or worse, so I won't have tom~ up a date which they will quote me on. Anyway, have a good creative time. Best, HOTEL DUPONT PLAZA DUPONT CIRCLE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE N. W., WASHINGTON 6, D.C. HUdson 3-6000 July 23, 1963 Dear Dr. and Hrs.

It is hoped that by that time Bronowsd will aso be here, as will Lennox ad Cohn; and Dulbecco has indicated his willingness to return from Glasgow so that all may be together, at least for a brief periodo It would be splendid if Szilard and Benzer could be here for SJch an occasion, and if Bronowski is not yet here permanently , that he too could arrange the time to be hereo \"This is merely to elicit a response to this suggestion from those who will not be in residence at that time.

Things Geneva, 24 July 1963 Dear Kay, I have the following request . I have forgotten some of my pills, either one or two bottles . They are dark yellow bottles, which might be either on top of my bedside table along with other medicaments or in a d~awer . Each bottle contains 100 tablets of Thiosulfil Forte 0.5 gm. I would like you to send me one bottle as an air package and one bottle by surface mail c/o Dr Martin Kaplan, World Health Organization, Palais des Nations , Geneva, Switzerland . On second thoughts , since I need two oottles, and I am not sure that I really have two bottles left in my room, you might find it simpler -and it would suit me equally welly if you bought two such bottles from Tschiffely Brothers , 1218 Connecticut Avenue (practically your nextdoor neighbour). We have a charge account there and my wife, whose professiona l name is Dr Gertrud Weiss, regularly orders one bottle from them every month. On the strength of this, you might be able to talk them into giving you two bottles without a prescription, explaining that you are my secretary and that I am abroad and cannot get this brand in Switzerland and that you cannot find the bottles which are left at home. I propose to rely on your powers of persuasion but if the worst comes to the worst you might have to ask a MD to write out a prescription for me. Concerning your vacation, I would suggest that you make up your mind and take whatever you want and just let me know. My own plans for return are unaertain: I might be back in August or else I might not be back before the middle of October . Please forward to me all cheques to my Geneva address (c/o Dr Martin Kaplan) . As far as letters are concerned , keep on forwarding photocopies of everything that seems important to you. With kind regards, Mrs Kay Shannon Council for a Livable World Room 301 1346 Connecticut Avnnue, N.W. Washington 6, D.C. Sincerely, July 25, 1963 Dear Dr. and Mrs. Szilard; Good morning! Some medical magazines are here for Mrs. Szilard and, for Dr. Szilard there are the following items: A Letter from NAncy Silver who is the chairman of the SANE group at Douglass College in New Jersey who wants you to speak sometime in the spring of 1964. There is an overwhelming fan letter from Miss Teresa Sanchez Cuevas, in Buenos Aires. She translated the Argentinian DOLPHINS. She thinks you're great. Joe Polowsky of the \"Americans for San Francisco-Elbe River Day\" group sent you their first annual report and wants to know if you will lend him $50 as he hasn't been working for 2 months. The most interesting item of all is: A Conference on the '~lobal Impacts of Applied Microbiology\" . This arrived in a package from Noreen Mann and the final program was out of its envelope so I had noway of identifying who sent it. But, there also was enclosed a note from someone in Stockholm, and I believe the signature is Aine Engstrom. The note reads as follows: \"Dear Prof. Szilard: By separate mail you will receive information about the Congress on \"Global Impact of Microbiology. \" Also, do you want me to order an air driven injection pistol? In such a case I could bring that with me to Dubrovnik. 'With my very best regards to Mrs. Szilard and yourself. \"Sincerely yours, (Aine or Arne)Engstrom\" I believe that I read the writing correctly. His address is Inst. for Medicinsk Fysi~ Karolinska Institutet, Stockaolm 60. The Booklet he describes is about ll pages thick. I have struggled with my sense of thrift and have decided to enclose a copy. You may want to attend this meeting. Your friend has circled an item on page 6. Letter 2 for this day p-f~ ~ July 31, 1963 / Dear Dr. and Mrs. Szilard: You have this aftertoon, Dr. Szi 17 received ~ the following from Noreen Mann: An official invitation to the Centennial Celebration of the National Academy of Sciences on October 21 thru 24 in Washington, D.C. There is a card which should be returned saying that you do or do not plan to attend the sessions and with whom you will attend. Perhaps you should return it, though it does say it isn't absolutely necessary. I will return it for you if I hear from you. Also, from the Academy, precisely from its ~ational Research Council: a letter and further notice of the IGY Symposium to be held at UCLA August 12 thru 16th. When I earlier wrote the people in California for another copy of the program of the Symposium for my files ( I had sent you the original) they kindly sent me one and appended a note saying that they\\' hope you will be able to attend. Enclosed is a new version of their General Scheme and Special Events. Also enclosed is something that looks like bank statements. I have the originals here. I have just sent your pills and they should arrive in 2 to 3 days so sayeth the postman. I hope they get through customs all right. If they come back, I'll just hop on a plane and deliver them in person ... That's all for now, Best to you oth, ~CLff Kay s) Dear Dr.and Mrs. Szilnrd: July 31, 1963 Mrs. Szilard: on the other side of this page is a rough sketch, gratis Liz Beer at the Council office, of the watch I am holding for you. I triad to get a good shot of the watch, but the camera is not built for very close shots and far away ones were no good. I hope the sketch clears up the matter a little. I am trying to remember to wind the watch every day so it won't need repair before you return. Dr. Szilard: enclosed is the only check that has come into the office since you left: the Salk Institute check which I mentioned in an earlier letter. Also, re your letter of the 24th. (It was so good to hear from yout Even if it did have to beamout such mundane things as pills) I went right over to Tschiffelys and they very kindly gave me two bottles of tablets (100 each bottle) of Thiosulfil Forte 0.5 gm. add they also very kindly packed it for me and I an sending it to-~, both bottles air mail, as it costs very little more to send both air mail instead of sending one by air and bne by sea( to paraphrase an old saying). I shall go to New York for 3 days vacation on August 19th1 ~d I shall take the remaining four days sometime in September when a new John Osborn play is to open in Philadel rhia. MY husband and I have compromised: we will camp out on the way to Philadelphia! Anyway, thank you for giving me an idea, even thoughit is uncertain, of what the immediate future holds. Best to both of you. You should receive those pills through Dr. Kaplan in 4 to 5 da,ys at the most . ~{_f K-;f s~. \u00b7 Oh! We have completed the move1 into our new \"pad\" and all is ship shape, so, my own moving problems are now over, and I can take on yours when you give the word.

I shall send this on to you as soon as I get a chance to retype it. rs~~- - K ,(;/ I~ , ' / ~ f August 1, 1963 Dear Mrs. Szilard: I have just received your letter and I hope that I can arrange correctly for the forwarding of your mail in the future so that you won't have to be worried about it. Too many years of working with lawyers, I fear, has caused me to be a) thrifty and b) protective of mail. I guess I hAven't wanted to send you the bills, as I would have no copy of them. Anyway, you are absolutely right in that you requested me to send all first class mail and I have not been sending your bills. I guess I wouldn't want anyone to send me my bills while I am away. ~(~ l Enclosed are the following: Under your Mail (item 2) ~ t ~ A sealed third class letter from the American Public )L4 Health Association, Inc.

The ones that are not sealed, I will keep here for you. I O.K.? I have been almost regularly, except an occasional Saturday, collecting the mail at least once a day from the Hotel. You are right about their losing mail, or rather their ability to do so. No one seems to know what is going on at the desk -at least they don't tell each other. The postage problem does not really worry me. Old habits are hard to shed, but I generally feel that forwarding your mail is the least the Council can do. I havet here also your hotel bills, which I will keep here unless you request them. Please see page two of this letter for information re: item 1. DETERGICIDE. I have work to do here, but will go to the Hotel after lunch. -2- 100 Now, regarding the DETERGICIDE. There were Z\u00a2 little packets sent and I am sending you 50 of these. I am enclosing also half of the rust inhibitors that arrived with the package and the rest I have wrapped in Saran Wrap and put in a little plastic container in your apartment with the remaining 50 packets of DETERGICIDE . I am sending you all this in the box that they specifically came in and the directions are on the outside of the box, as you will see. Also, a letter did not com e with the package and none has arrived here (at the Hotel, rather) as yet. I am sending the Bardex Pack and of course I did not open it, so that unless it is opened in eustoms; it should still be sterile. I am enelosing a copy of Harold Stassen's Univ. of Mich address for your husband. All comments are Mr. Stassen's. I have refrained from editorializing. Among the numerous jobs in the office, I have been writing away, trying to lure people into exchanging publications with the Council. We have been rather successful. One of the items which arrived may be of interest to you both. It is a booklet put out by the Canadian Institute of International Affairs and is titled, THE WORLD's POPULATION by W.D. Borrie. Perhaps we could get another copy if you wish. What especially, would you like me to do with Burrells' clippings? I am keeping the ,...o~ne~1that j:..ois has see here ;or you k ..

As I mentioned, we have succeeded in completing our move to the new apartment (while our cat had 5 kittens en route) (they are fantastically adorable and we shall keep them all-until I start tripping over them).

Cambridge 39, Mass. August 9, 1963 , \"It appean that, ,while many influential voices are being raised to express doubts about the desirability of the Test-Ban a~reement ( e.g., Senator Jackson1s article in the N.Y. Times Magazine section, August 4), its proponents are not maiing themselves heard in nearly the same degree. Although the President's speech had a large impact, and although the prognosis for ratification remains excellent, informeq Wash.i.ngton opinion feefs t.hat it is essential for a continuous stream of statements from influential and rekpected i~dividuals, esp~cially scientists and scholars, to be transmitted to Senators and, especially, to appear in newspapers and news journals throug~out tbeJcountry betweep now and the day of the Senate. vote. There is a real danger-that, opr of a feeli~g of complacency on the part of its proponents ~oncerning the prospects for ratificaFion, the ne~spapers will\u00b7 contain ~nly of the Treatyi le,ding to the imprfssion that. the scholarly community is opposed, or at best lukewarm, to the tre~ty an~ ~hereby placing it~ ,W~ t}}at per~aps you. Dr. Szila.td, are not receiving all news from t1 u.s. I assume that you gpt thp intprnational edition of the NY TIMES. Perhaps, ..., I assume wrong. The Aug. 4th edition containing Jackson's speech was not kept at my house, but I will try to get you a copy and send it, unless I hear otherwise. I have also assumed that Lois, Drs. Doering and Feld and your other friends have been keeping you informed re developements here. And, also that you have been receiving the various US newspapers you want. When I read of Phillip Graham's death, it occurred to me that he may have bPen a friend of yours and you would want to send condolences. But again, I have assumed that his and Senator Kefauver's death were broadcast in Europe and that if you knew them, you handled the matter as you wished. Re the test ban: all I can say is that Lois seems to want you back here, an d of course, I do too, but it seems to me that you could (and, really, probably should) make a statement Jjust as easily in Geneva as anywhere ~else. Maybe there is more significance to it if you make a statement in Washington, but August .iL a vacation month and most people are not in home port. The rest of the mail for you, Dr. Szilard is relatively unimportant: A (sort of crank) letter from somebody in Pittsburgh who wants info re the Council.

It was not difficult to fill in most of the words that were cut off. I think that this is an extremely perceptive article. It seems to point up much more clearly than many the actual w~king administrative problems that ratification will be up against. I like this kind of journalism and I wish that we had more of it. The Council has just sent out another mailing and I enclose these articles for your information. You probably have already seen the text of the test ban and the communique, but I thought that you would enjoy reading our WASHINGTON BULLETIN and the McGovern speech, which pretty much covers our thinking on the test ban. I hope that you will continue your interest in the Council's work as I really feel that we need the support of articulate and youthful persons such as yourself. I would gladly send you more Council documents to distribute among your friends whom you think would be interested in our work. Best of luck to you, Sincerely yap Kay M. Shannon ,. ' .

THE DAilY llLINI Page Thirteen News analysis Test treaty sets Senate precedent By GARY PORTER Daily Dlini Staff Writer The nuclear test-ban treaty now being debated in the Senate is the first ever signed by this nation in the hazardous area of nuclear armament , and, for better or worse, a precedent has been set which has changed the once exclt!sive control of the Foreign Relations Commit\u00ad tee-over the initial stage of the ratification process. Even though the full Armed Services committee, as well as the Atomic Energy Committee, was in\u00ad vited by the Foreign Relations Committee to participate in the questioning of witnesses, the Pre\u00ad paredness Subcommittee of that committee went ahead with an ex\u00ad tensive series of secret hearings de\u00ad voted exclusively to the treaty. Th1s maneuver has had the appar\u00ad ent effect of sharply dividing the consideration of the treaty into two parts: military and political. This divsion is, I believe, un\u00ad necessary and unfortunate. For while it is h'lle that the com\u00ad ' pete nee and emphasis of the two panels are different, it is also true that they overlap and that the military questions involved are closely intertwined with, and in\u00ad clude, political questions. The hear\u00ad ings could have proceeded more smoothly and with less confusion had the method .prescribed by the Foreign Relations Committee been followed and the complexities in\u00ad volved thrashed out in a single group. * * But instead, the Subcommittee on Preparedness on several occa\u00ad sions called witnesses in closed ses\u00a3:on shortly before they ap\u00ad peared in open session before the other three committees. And Sen\u00ad ator Goldwater of the Subcommit- 1 tee called for a delay in final judgment of the treaty until it could make public its damaging evidence. This implication was clearly that the military thinkers of the Senate were able to drag from their witnesses new informa\u00ad tion which indicated dangers to our skeptical Senator Dirksen. The orthodox Republican p o s i t i on, given the active support of former President Eisenhower, was just short of \"loyal opp<>sition.\" With\u00ad out any commitment against the tr~aty, both EiSenhower and Dirk\u00ad sen refused to admit that it was a creditable step until the hearings were almost concluded. Some of the points raised earlier by Dirk\u00ad sen may have seemed-like caviling, but it is understandable from the Republican perspective that the party in power, with tremendous forces of persuasion at its disposal, should be denied any unnecessary push from the opposition. Service! EVERETT M. DIRKSEN DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER Only four words ~d efficien\u00ad cy of the Post Office Depart\u00ad ment were needed to get a letter half-way across the DQtion from Massachusetts to the University of Dlinois. Late in praising test ban treaty security. But the long awaited interim report of that Subcommit\u00ad tee introduced no new facts; it simply rei t e r a t e d well-known doubts, fears and interpretations. That the Subcommittee's . find\u00ad ings were not based on any new evidence is indicated by the dis\u00ad senting view of Senator Leverett Saltonstall, t h e Subcommittee's ranking Republican. Saltonstall pointed out that it was not on the technical facts that he departed from the report, but its \"unduly pessimistic\" and \"overly adverse\" conclusions. The actual text of the report's concluding statement reveals a curious assumption. It asserts that the treaty will result in \"serious and perhaps formidable military and technical disadvantages.\" and then goes on to doubt that \"com\u00ad parable disadvantages will accrue to . the grames of the U.S.S.R.\" The sug\u00ad gestion here seems to be that any technical limitation on a weapons program is per se a military dis\u00ad advantage. This assumption glosses over a vital distinction between \"technical\" and \"military\" consid\u00ad erations and raises questions as to the wisdom of the Preparedness Subcommittee's judging the mean\u00ad ing of the treaty in isolation from other committees. * * To suggest that the s\"keptics may have better channeled their criti\u00ad cisms through the Foreign Rela\u00ad tions Committee hearings is notto condemn the kind of questions raised by Senator Jackson, who pressed the administration for, and got, a firm commitment to a serie~ of safeguards involving our own ability to test and to monitor Soviet tests. Indeed there was room for an uncommitted posture not only on the part of genuinely skeptical senators, but of the politically Thirteen-year-old Wayne Nich\u00b7 olson mailed a letter July 5 in Ipswich, Mass., addressed sim\u00b7 ply to \"The University of Dli\u00b7 nois.\" No address, no city, no state, just \"The University of Dlinois.\" Monday, July 8, it was deliv\u00ad ered, and by the end of the day a reply was lreaded back, ad\u00b7 dressed complete even to the zip code 09138 which the youth had included in his return ad\u00b7 dress! His reason for writing? He's interested in astronomy, bad read a reference to the Univer\u00ad sity's big new radio telescope near Danvllle, and wanted more information. SHEINWOLD ON BRIDGElr Disregard Book Rule to Make Slam Contract By ALFRED SHEINWOLD August 14, 1963 Dear Dr. and Mrs. Szilard: Good morning! I am enclosing for Mrs. Szilard a document from the Printing Office, which I don't believe is first class mail, but as it doesn't say, I send it along to you. For Dr. Szilard: A bill from Group Health Association requesting payment of $79.00 owed on your account. I called Group Health and spoke to their bookkeeper. She informs me that something will have to be paid on the account by September 1. So, if you would send them a check for the $79.00 or for one month -$1~75 -that would do it. I explained to her that I had not been sending you your bills as I expected you back before this and that just recently I had sent you the group Health bills, and that you would of course pay this bill. I tried to get her to put it off until you return, but I have no luck at all with a certain type of female and she is one of these, so it looks as if you should send a check to group Health as soon as \u00b7~ou can. And Mr. Havas of Gondolat , sends you a letter which I enclose. Original is here with August 16 Dear Dr. & Mrs. Szilard: Good morning to you! It's really a grab bag this morning for Dr. Szilard: All the enclosed are from Noreen Mann: A bill from the Cosmos Club for $4.74 A bill from the National Academy of Sciences for dues.

If, as your situation develops, you find, as we earnestly hop~ you do, that the months of March or April might be preferable to the earlier time please let me know. However, if a later date will be impossible for you perhaps we can work out a time between mid-February and mid-March.

Lois has left for Chicago, and I must say that I have learned a tremendous amojnt during heri stay here. To put it mildly, we have been very busy and until the direct mail material is printed, which is in the works now, and mailed out, it will continue to be very busy. I am keeping a close eye on your mail, though, and the only thing that might get messy is my typing, which I hAve been doing on the run, so I hope you have and will excuse the shape of these notes I have been sending to you. I mention all this so that you will know, in Dubrovnik when the various members of the Board ask you about your need for a full or a part-time secretary, what the office need is. My first choice is, of course, to be your full-time secretary, if that is your desire. Many things need to be done in the office, but I think that a discussion along those lines should wait until you return. I hope you are both well and that you have a good Pugwash. PS By this time you should have received Lee Novick's cable to you. She called again Friday to say that she was going to send it to you c/o Dr. Kaplan and that if you attended the Dimensions in Peace conference, and spoke, your speech time would be changed.

Miss Payne has suggested that we print this and I believe I heard Col. Crosby say that he did not think it was as much up to par as previous ones by McGovern. You might want to offer your opinion on it. 2 copies of te~itKil an article in Sept. WAR/PEACE, by the Senator. This I believe is an excellent article and I think follows along with the kind of thinking you stressed would be needed to implement a successfuljbest ban in your letter to the editors. Perhaps, we should distribute this, and Col. Crosby seems to think so. I am checking copyright etc. now. You might consider this and let me know upon your return. I enclose a copy and have one here. I hope Ravello is relaxing. Best, ~n! September 19, 1963 Dear Dr. Szilard: I enclose for you: Outline of Program of the National Academy of Sciences, I will have another copy here when you return.

This is a form letter to members of the Physics Section of the National Academy re: Assistance Needed by the Committee on Science and Public Policy in Preparation of Statement on Federal Support of Basic Research. I shall hold the letter here for you. (That letter and the following one came from Noreen Mann) Also, (from Mrs. Mann) you received a letter from Peter R. Hershfield, written in Hungarian, I believe. Shall I send this on to you? Mr. Hershfield is in Minnesota. The letter w1ll be here for you. James S. Leslie, University Chaplain of Ohio Wesleyan University, in Ohio, would like to know if you will address an audience cr about 1500 students and faculty for 40 minutes on a visit to that University. It would be~ one day affair, they would pay your transportation, entertainment (?) and would \"offer you an honorarium of $200\". I would say hold out for some really good entertainment, but I suspect that what they have in store for you are coffees and teas. Enclosed, you will have already found a letter from Mr. Piore at IBM and his copy of a letter from Dr. Long, all discussing the idea of a prize which you had discussed sometime back. And last, and probably least, a letter from Richard I. Briggs which requests your help in filling out a questionnaire, for an\"educational project.\" The questionnaire is titled, Approach to Living, and it asks all sorts of questions, some very pertinent, about what you are and what you believe in. The most remarkable question in it from a subjective viewpoint like mine anyway, is: \"Do you think that if more people believed as you do the world would be a better place to liw:' in? Yes ....
