COVID-19 is highly transmissible and can be spread by people who do not know they have the disease. [Community mitigation activities](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html) are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of a new virus with pandemic potential. As communities work to reduce the spread of COVID-19, they are also addressing the economic, social, and secondary health consequences of the disease. [Factors to consider for determining mitigation strategies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html) include the level of community transmission, number and type of outbreaks in specific settings or with vulnerable populations, severity of the disease, the impact of community transmission on healthcare capacity, public health capacity, community characteristics such as the size if a community and level of engagement and support, and the epidemiology in surround jurisdictions. While some strategies are distinct others are unified. While as a strategy, test, trace, isolate and quarantine are generally integrated, we have included these separately in the risk mitigation strategies below to provide clear evidence and examples of each component.
