Issues covered in my Report 2 This report records the results of my audit of these summarised accounts, and the overall findings from the audits of the underlying health organisations byauditors appointed by the Audit Commission for England and Wales(paragraphs 2.1 to 2.21). The separate NHS summarised accounts for Wales and Scotland, including auditors' reports, are laid before the Welsh Assemblyand the Scottish Parliament respectively. 3 I also report on the key developments in accounting and internal control (paragraphs 3.1 to 3.28) , the overall financial performance of health authorities, Primary Care Trusts and NHS Trusts (paragraphs 4.1 to 4.21) , progress in countering fraud (paragraphs 5.1 to 5.23) , and on the financial costs facing the NHS for clinical negligence claims together with the latestaccounting developments (paragraphs 6.1 to 6.17) . Main findings and conclusions 4 On the basis of my assessment of the work of the appointed auditors, and my audit at the Department of Health, I have given unqualified opinions on all ofthe 2000-2001 summarised accounts (paragraphs 1.1 to 1.6) . Findings of the Appointed Auditors 5 For the seventh consecutive year, the appointed auditors gave unqualified \"true and fair\" audit opinions on the accounts of all individual NHS Trusts andhealth authorities (paragraphs 2.5 to 2.14) . They also gave unqualified audit opinions on all of the fifteen special health authorities, the Dental PracticeBoard and the separate charitable funds held on trust within the NHS.NHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-20016 Appointed auditors were also required to express an opinion on the regularity of the activities of health authorities, Primary Care Trusts and special healthauthorities. Their audit opinions therefore included a statement as to whether\"in all material respects, the expenditure and income have been applied to thepurposes intended by Parliament and the financial transactions conform to theauthorities which govern them\". In all but two cases, they also gave unqualifiedregularity opinions (paragraphs 2.10 to 2.14) . Developments in accounting and internal control 7 Changes in the structure of the NHS summarised accounts for 2000-2001 : Primary Care Trusts are to become the lead NHS organisations in assessing need,planning and securing all health services and improving health. For 2000-2001,the first year of their operation, there were 40 Primary Care Trusts, and thisincreased to 164 in 2001-2002. The main impact on my audit of the 2000-2001NHS summarised accounts is the inclusion of an additional summarised accountfor Primary Care Trusts prepared by the Department for my audit. 8 Further restructuring is planned in line with The NHS Plan published in July 2000. With effect from 1 April 2002, the existing 95 health authorities willbe merged and subsequently replaced, subject to legislation, by 28 strategichealth authorities. These new authorities are intended to lead the developmentof the local health service on the basis of local accountability agreements. 9 The closure of existing health authorities and, again subject to legislation, the establishment of the new strategic health authorities will be significant to myaudit of the summarised accounts and to the work of the appointed auditors ofthe underlying accounts for the 2001-2002 financial year (paragraphs 3.2 to 3.5) . 10 Introduction of the Resource Accounting Manual: In 1999-2000 the Department of Health, in line with all other central government organisations,adopted a new method of accounting for its activities. This results in theproduction of annual \"resource accounts\" on an accruals basis, and replacesthe Department's previously cash-based accounts. 11 In producing Resource Accounts, the Department applies the concepts set out in Treasury's Resource Accounting Manual, which interprets UK generallyaccepted accounting practice for the public sector. Health authorities,Primary Care Trusts, and certain special health authorities fall within thedepartmental boundary for resource accounting purposes and are consolidatedwithin the Department's accounts. To ensure consistency, Treasury has nowdirected that such organisations should prepare their own accounts inaccordance with the Manual from 2000-2001. This approach has also beenreflected in the relevant summarised accounts, where health authorities andspecial health authorities have restated 1999-2000 balances to reflect thechange in accounting basis (paragraphs 3.6 to 3.9) . 12 Extending the remit of the Financial Reporting Advisory Board: The Board advises Treasury on the development of resource accounting for thecentral government sector. Thus the accounting policies of health authorities,Primary Care Trusts and certain special health authorities are determined by therecommendations of the Board as incorporated within Treasury's ResourceAccounting Manual. With effect from January 2002, the remit of the Board hasbeen extended to oversee NHS Trust accounting (paragraphs 3.16 to 3.17) . 13 The development of corporate governance and statements on the systems of internal financial control: This is the fourth year for which all NHS organisations have been required to prepare statements on the systems ofinternal financial control. In response to my comments in my report on the R2NHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-20011998-99 summarised accounts, these statements have now been enhanced to comment on the effectiveness , rather than merely the adequacy, of the financial control systems. 14 The Accountable Officers of 20 NHS Trusts, 7 health authorities, and 22 Primary Care Trusts identified weaknesses in their systems for some or all ofthe financial year and highlighted them in their statements on internal financialcontrol. These additional disclosures indicate that not all of the requiredpolicies and procedures were in place for the whole of the 2000-2001 financialyear. The Department of Health has informed me that remedial action is beingtaken in these cases. 15 Statements have been included within the summarised accounts of health authorities, NHS Trusts, Primary Care Trusts and most special health authoritiesfor the first time this year. The Accounting Officer of the Department of Health,drawing on the statements from his Accountable Officers on the underlyingindividual accounts, drew attention in six summarised accounts to weaknessesin systems or failures to meet all minimum control standards reported by theunderlying organisations (paragraphs 3.18 to 3.28) Financial performance of the NHS 16 Financial Duties: All health authorities and Primary Care Trusts met the statutory duty to remain within their cash limits in 2000-2001. All but one health authority,which was preparing for a merger, met the departmental requirement to achievefinancial balance in resource terms (paragraphs 4.7 to 4.9). 17 The Department considers that no NHS Trust failed its statutory break-even duty in 2000-2001. Nineteen NHS Trusts received an extension to the originalperiod for recovering their cumulative deficits (paragraphs 4.11 to 4.14). 18 NHS Trusts are also subject to two departmental financial duties: !For the capital cost absorption rate duty, the average return for 2000-2001 was 6.2 per cent, against the target of 6 per cent. Eighteen NHS Trusts failedthis duty (paragraphs 4.15 to 4.17) ; !Overall, NHS Trusts were \u00a39 million within their external financing limit of \u00a3224 million; seven NHS Trusts breached their individual limits by morethan \u00a310,000 (paragraphs 4.18 to 4.19) . Fraud 19 The NHS Counter-Fraud Service, formerly the Directorate of Counter Fraud services, is responsible for all work to prevent, detect and measure fraud andcorruption within the NHS. It has continued to develop a Risk MeasurementProject to measure fraud and \"incorrectness\" across the main NHS services. 20 By the end of February 2002, the Service had completed five full measurement exercises covering potential patient fraud and two baselinemeasurement exercises:NHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 R321 The published results of this work show that measured fraud in the areas of pharmaceutical and dental patient fraud has fallen from \u00a3157.3 million to\u00a399 million between the first full measurement exercise and the follow-upexercises. In addition, a further \u00a313.25 million suspected fraud and\u00a380.6 million at risk have been identified by subsequent exercises. The resultsof the pharmaceutical contractor and fraud in General Medical Servicesexercises have yet to be finalised (paragraphs 5.7 to 5.12). 22 As at March 2001, 484 cases of suspected fraud with an estimated value of \u00a318.3 million had been reported to the Service. Since then, they have receivedreports on an additional 445 cases, with an estimated value of \u00a317 million(paragraph 5.14). 23 In my view, the overall levels are not significant enough to affect my opinions on the accounts and I have therefore given unqualified opinions (paragraph 5.23). Clinical negligence 24 Total provisions: provisions for the probable cost of clinical negligence within the NHS amounted to \u00a34.4 billion at 31 March 2001, an increase of\u00a30.5 billion since 31 March 2000. A key cause of this increase was the resultof legal developments, which increased awards to fund the costs of future careand therefore required a reassessment of the level of provisions required(paragraphs 6.3 to 6.7). 25 Public Accounts Committee: The Public Accounts Committee considered my report, Handling Clinical Negligence Claims in England (HC 403, 2000-2001), in October 2001. The Department of Health will issue a White Paper in 2002which will describe its proposals in respect of the reform of clinical negligence(paragraphs 6.15 to 6.16) .

Theseparate NHS summarised accounts for Scotland andWales, including auditors' reports, are laid before theScottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly respectively. 1.2 Most of the funding for the health service is provided by the Department of Health. This funding is reported, on acash basis, in the Appropriation Account for Class II,Vote 1 (hospital, community health, family health andrelated services, England) and, on an accruals basis, inthe Resource Accounts for the Department of Health.Both of these accounts are also subject to my audit. Thisis the final year of the appropriation accounts, due to theintroduction of resource accounting and budgeting. 1.3 The NHS summarised accounts presented here record the financial affairs of authorities; and !the Dental Practice Board to whom these funds are made available. 1.4 The Audit Commission appoints the external auditors to these organisations. These appointed auditors providean audit opinion on the annual accounts of each body,and the Department of Health summarises theseaccounts for my audit.

Myexamination of the 2000-2001 accounts includedassessing the reliability of the information contained inthe audited accounts by: !reviewing the work of the auditors appointed by theAudit Commission; !scrutinising their reports and findings; and !ensuring that acceptable quality control policies andprocedures over the appointed auditors' workexisted and operated effectively. 1.6 On the basis of my assessment of the work of the appointed auditors, and my audit at the Department ofHealth, I am able to give unqualified opinions on all ofthe summarised accounts for 2000-2001. 1.7 I also examine the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which NHS organisations have usedtheir resources, under section 6 of the National AuditAct 1983. The results of such value for moneyexaminations are published in separate reports made tothe House of Commons under section 9 of that Act. 1.8 My recent reports on issues affecting the NHS in England are: !Department of Direct in England (HC 505, 2001-2002). !The Management of Surplus Property by Trusts in theNHS in England (HC 687, 2001-2002).1.9 In addition, my reports on issues cutting across government departments are also of relevance to theDepartment of Health and the NHS. Recent relevantreports (H C234, 2001-2002); use of RegulatoryImpact Assessments (HC329, 2001-2002); !Managing the relationship to in PFI projects (HC 375, 2001-2002);and !Joining up to improve public services (HC 383,2001-2002). 1.10 In Part 2 of this report, I describe in more detail the findings of the appointed auditors. The remaining partsof my report address current issues concerning financialcontrol and accounting within the NHS, namely: !Part 3: Developments in accounting andinternal control; of of the appointed auditors R7 part twoIntroduction 2.1 This part of my report summarises: !the overall findings of the appointed auditors on the accounts of NHS organisations (paragraphs 2.2 to2.14); and !findings which led to Section 19 referrals to theSecretary of State and Section 8 reports in the publicinterest (paragraphs 2.15 to 2.21). Audit of the 2000-2001 underlying accounts - work of the appointedauditors The two-part audit opinion 2.2 Auditors of the 99 health authorities, 356 NHS Trusts, 40 Primary Care Trusts, 431 funds held on trust,15 special health authorities and the Dental PracticeBoard are required to issue an opinion as to whether theaccounts for each individual organisation reflect a trueand fair view of its state of affairs as at 31 March 2001and of its income and expenditure for the year. 2.3 Auditors of health authorities, special health authorities, Primary Care Trusts and the Dental Practice Board arealso required to provide a separate assertion about theregularity of the transactions shown in the accounts(see paragraph 2.10 below). 2.4 I examine each of these requirements in paragraphs 2.5 to 2.13. 'True and Fair' view 2.5 For the seventh consecutive year, the appointed auditors gave unqualified opinions that the accounts of allindividual NHS Trusts, health authorities and specialhealth authorities reflected a true and fair view of theirstate of affairs as at 31 March 2001 and of their incomeand expenditure for the year. They also gave unqualifiedopinions on the accounts of individual Primary CareTrusts in 2000-2001, their first year of operation. As a result, I was also able to give unqualified opinions onthe summarised accounts for NHS Trusts, healthauthorities, Primary Care Trusts, special healthauthorities and the Dental Practice Board. 2.6 Part 4 of my report provides analysis of the financial performance of health authorities, NHS Trusts andPrimary Care Trusts, and the Department of Health'scentral financial performance management activities. Funds held on trust 2.7 NHS Trusts, Primary Care Trusts, health authorities, special health authorities and special trustees have thepower to accept, hold and administer any property ontrust and are required to prepare separate accounts forthese funds. The summarised account for 2000-2001shows total funds at 31 March 2001 of some \u00a31.7 billion. 2.8 The appointed auditors gave unqualified audit opinions on each of the funds held on trust accounts in 2000-2001.This represents an improvement on 1999-2000 when twoaccounts received qualified opinions on the grounds oflimitation of scope as a result of concerns over systemsdesigned to ensure the completeness of income. 2.9 Following my examination of the account, I have also been able to give an unqualified audit opinion that thesummarised account for the NHS funds held on trustpresents fairly the state of affairs of the funds at31 March 2001 and their incoming resources andapplication of resources. Regularity opinion 2.10 Health authorities, Primary Care Trusts and selected special health authorities are within the boundary forthe Department of Health's Resource Accounts as theyreceive the majority of their funding directly from theDepartment. NHS Trusts and the remaining specialhealth authorities are outside the boundary as theyreceive their main funding either indirectly or fromexternal sources, for example from fees and charges.R8part twoNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 2.11 For all special health authorities, and the other accounts included within the Resource Accounts, auditors arerequired to give a separate \"regularity\" opinion onwhether, in their view, \"in all material respects, theexpenditure and income have been applied to thepurposes intended by Parliament and the financialtransactions conform to the authorities which governthem\". Appointed auditors were able to provideunqualified regularity opinions on all but two of theunderlying accounts. 2.12 The auditors of the Prescription Pricing Authority and the Dental Practice Board qualified their opinions on thepharmaceutical services and general dental servicesfinancial statements. These statements are not separatelypublished, but are incorporated into the summarisedaccounts of the health authorities. 2.13 The auditors qualified their opinions : !On the Prescription Pricing Authority: because of the impact of the NHS Counter Fraud Services'calculation of the estimated shortfall of incomecaused by patients fraudulently evading prescriptioncharges and by unintentional evasion; the Dental Practice Board: because of the Board'sprobity unit's estimate of the level of inappropriateexpenditure, almost half of which was in respect ofirregular claims by patients and dentists. 2.14 Despite these qualifications, I have not qualified my overall opinion on the health authorities' or PrimaryCare Trusts' summarised accounts and discuss thisfurther in part five of my report. Reports and referrals 2.15 Section 19 of the Audit Commission Act 1998 requires an appointed auditor to refer matters to theSecretary of State if they have reason to believe that anNHS organisation has made a decision which involves,or may involve, unlawful expenditure. As thisarrangement is used to give early warning of potentialproblems, which may not then materialise, these reportsare addressed to the Secretary of State and arenot published.2.16 Since my report on the summarised accounts for 1999-2000 (HC 119, 2000-2001), appointed auditorshave referred three such matters to the Secretary of State. 2.17 I reported last year that the auditor of Newcastle and North Tyneside Health Authority qualified his opiniondue to expenditure incurred on the provision of nursingcare in residential homes. The auditor has now issued areferral to the Secretary of State under section 19,concluding that arrangements with three private andvoluntary sector bodies to purchase nursing care inresidential homes did not comply with applicablestatutory authorities. However, the auditor has alsonoted that the expenditure incurred was capable ofbeing within the powers of the Authority and theAuthority has agreed, in discussion with the auditor, toput revised arrangements in place. 2.18 The auditor of the Dental Practice Board also reported his qualification of the General Dental Services account(see paragraph 2.12) in a section 19 referral to theSecretary of State. 2.19 The auditor of Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham Health Authority issued a section 19 referral regarding apayment in lieu of notice of termination of employment,and concluded that the Authority had made decisionsthat led to unlawful expenditure of some \u00a346,000. Thisexpenditure, to the extent that it is not recovered,constitutes a loss to the Authority. 2.20 As a result, the Department of Health has asked Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham Health Authority to seek legaladvice on the possibility of undertaking recovery. 2.21 Section 8 of the Act requires appointed auditors to consider whether, in the public interest, they shouldreport on any matter coming to their notice. Since myreport last year, no such reports have been issued onthose NHS organisations which comprise thesummarised accounts in England.Part 1 R9 part threePart 3 Introduction 3.1 This part of my report examines: !Changes in the structure of the NHS summarised accounts for 2000-2001 (3.2 to 3.5) !Developments in accounting: !introduction of the Resource Accounting Manual (3.6 to 3.9) !late funding and deferred i ncome (3.10 to 3.11); and !Charities SORP 2000 (3.12 to 3.15); !Extending the remit of the Financial Reporting Advisory Board (3.16 to 3.17); !Statements on internal financial control and the development of corporate governance(3.18 to 3.28). Changes in the structure of the NHS summarised accounts for2000-2001 3.2 Section 2 of The Health Act 1999 created Primary Care Trusts. Their role is to become the lead NHS organisationsin assessing need, planning and securing all healthservices and improving health. For 2000-2001, the firstyear of their operation, there were 40 Primary Care Trusts,and this increased to 164 in 2001-2002. 3.3 The main impact of restructuring on my audit of the 2000-2001 NHS summarised accounts is the inclusionof a separate additional summarised account for PrimaryCare Trusts which has been prepared by the Departmentfor my audit. 3.4 Further significant restructuring is planned in line with the proposals published by the Government in theNHS Plan in July 2000. With effect from 1st April 2002,the existing 95 health authorities will be merged andsubsequently, subject to legislation, replaced by 28 strategic health authorities. These new strategichealth authorities are intended to lead the strategicdevelopment of the local health service and contributeto the management of the performance of Primary CareTrusts and NHS Trusts on the basis of localaccountability agreements. This change in role will alsoresult in a change in the funding mechanisms, whereby: !the Department of Health will allocate mostNHS revenue funding directly to Primary Care Truststo ensure that the provision of services is matched tothe needs of local people; !the Department of Health will allocate capitalfunding, to maintain the estate, directly toNHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts using nationallydetermined criteria; and !strategic health authorities will manage theallocation of other capital funding to Primary CareTrusts and NHS Trusts. This will be used to fundstrategic change, rather than ongoing maintenance. 3.5 The closure of existing health authorities and the establishment of the new strategic health authorities willbe significant to my audit of the summarised accountsand to the work of the appointed auditors of theunderlying accounts for the 2001-2002 financial year. Developments in accounting Introduction of the Resource Accounting Manual 3.6 In 1999-2000 the Department of Health, in line with all other central government organisations, adopted a newmethod of accounting for its activities. This results in theproduction of annual \"resource accounts\" on an accrualsbasis, and replaces Department's previously cash-based accounts. For 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, theDepartment published accruals-based resource account. NHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS Developments in accounting and internal controlR10 part threeNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 3.7 In producing resource accounts, the Department applies the concepts set out in Treasury's Resource AccountingManual, which interprets UK generally acceptedaccounting practice for the public sector.Health authorities, Primary Care Trusts, and certainspecial health authorities fall within the departmentalboundary for resource accounting purposes and areconsolidated within the Department's accounts. Toensure consistency, Treasury has now directed that suchorganisations should prepare their own accounts inaccordance with the Manual from 2000-2001. Thisapproach has also been reflected in the relevantsummarised accounts. 3.8 The impacts on the relevant accounts from this year include: !An operating cost statement replaces the Incomeand Expenditure Account. Parliamentary funding isnot shown as income, but is credited straight to theGeneral Fund reserve. The operating cost statementtherefore only shows transactions directly relating tothe operating activities of the organisation; !NHS organisations cannot anticipate parliamentaryfunding. This means that they cannot account foramounts specifically allocated for the year, but onlyfor the cash received; and !Other resultant changes have affected thepresentation of the cashflow statement, statement ofrecognised gains and losses, and a number of notesto the accounts. 3.9 Health authorities and special health authorities have restated 1999-2000 balances to reflect the change inaccounting basis. The changes to the way thedepartmental funding is accounted for have affected thenet worth of health authorities, who have written out\u00a3876 million of debtors from the prior period relating tofunding for drugs costs and other funding mechanisms.This is shown as a prior period adjustment in thesummarised account for health authorities. Late funding and deferred income 3.10 During the final quarter of 2000-2001, NHS Trusts received some \u00a3200 million additional funding fromhealth authorities and directly from the Department ofHealth. They arranged for some of this funding to beapplied to defined schemes relating to the 2001-2002financial year. 3.11 The Department recognises that the provision of funding late in a financial year could have an adverse impact onan organisation's ability to plan and control its budgetand services in the most effective way, and it aims tominimise such late funding in future years by increasingthe proportion of health authority allocations issued inthe first half of the year. This will give more time forhealth authorities to plan spending and will reduce the need for NHS Trusts to treat income received asdeferred income. Charities SORP 3.12 The Charities Commission issued a new Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) for charities in late2000, updating previous guidance on financialreporting for charities. NHS organisations have appliedthis accounting guidance to the reporting of theircharitable funds held on trust for 2000-2001. 3.13 The Department has provided guidance on the SORP for NHS charities in the Manual for Accounts, whichdictates how trustees should account for their activities. 3.14 A significant impact of the SORP affects the recognition of liabilities. In particular, a charity is now required torecognise a liability when it has committed itself tomaking a transfer of value to a third party. Future costscannot be charged to future years' income. The impactof this requirement on individual funds has varied, withsome funds finding that their reserves have been greatlyreduced. This reduction does not necessarily imply thatthe fund is having financial difficulties, but can indicatethat trustees have undertaken to support projects thatmay require funds from future charitable donations. TheCase Study below shows how the introduction of theSORP has had a significant impact on onecharity's reserves. 3.15 The summarised account for funds held on trust shows that outgoing resources have increased by 25 per centsince 1999-2000, whilst incoming resources haveremained broadly constant. This disparity is due to thechange in accounting for commitments in line with theSORP, which has seen grants payable increase by\u00a375 million from \u00a3219 million in 1999-2000 to\u00a3294 million in 2000-2001.CASE STUDY The implementation of the SORP has reduced charity reserves West Midland Air Ambulance NHS Trust This Trust's sole activity is to fund the West Midland air ambulance. It is contractually committed to fund theambulance for ten years. Under the requirements of the SORP,the contractual obligations for future costs have to berecognised in the 2000-2001 accounts. As a result, the Trust'sfunds have fallen from \u00a34,790,000 at 31 March 2000 to\u00a3194,000 at 31 March 2001. The effect of the SORP is particularly evident in this Trust because it is a single purpose charity, and so practically all ofits reserves are committed to this one activity for which a longterm contract is in place.R11 part threeNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 Extending the remit of the Financial Reporting Advisory Board 3.16 The Financial Reporting Advisory Board to Treasury (FRAB) was set up in April 1996 to advise Treasury onthe development of resource accounting for the centralgovernment sector. Because health authorities,Primary Care Trusts and certain special healthauthorities were defined as being within theDepartment's resource accounting boundary, thiseffectively meant that their accounting policies weredetermined by the recommendations of the FRAB asincorporated within Treasury's Resource AccountingManual. However, the Department remained fullyresponsible for setting the accounting policies for theNHS organisations which were classified as beingoutside the resource accounting boundary, most notablythe NHS Trusts. 3.17 In my report on the 1998-99 summarised accounts, I raised concerns about the inconsistencies in accountingpractice which could arise from exemption ofNHS Trusts from the requirements of resourceaccounting. I am pleased to note that the remit of FRABhas been extended to oversee NHS Trust accountingwith effect from January 2002. The extended role forFRAB will help to harmonise accounting policies acrossthe public sector and will facilitate the futuredevelopment of Whole of Government Accounts. The development of corporate governance and statements on thesystems of internal financial control 3.18 Within both the public and private sectors, there has been a growing focus on corporate governance issues.The NHS has been one of the parts of the public sectorwhich has responded quickly to good practice initiativesand is looking to further develop its corporategovernance initiatives. 3.19 Since 1997-98, and ahead of targets set by Treasury, the Department of Health has required all NHSorganisations to produce a separate statement on theirsystems of internal financial control as part of theirannual accounts. From 2000-2001, and in response tomy comments in my report on the 1998-99 summarisedaccounts, these statements have been enhanced tocomment on the effectiveness , rather than merely the adequacy, of the financial control systems. 3.20 The statements prepared by NHS organisations refer to a set of minimum financial control standards specified bythe Department in the following areas (Figure 2) :3.21 Appointed auditors are required to comment in their opinions on the underlying accounts if they believe thatthe statement is not consistent with their ownknowledge of the relevant NHS organisation. In 2000-2001, the appointed auditors did not qualify theiropinions on any NHS organisation's statement oninternal financial control. However, the AccountableOfficers of 20 NHS Trusts, 7 health authorities, and22 Primary Care Trusts identified weaknesses in theirsystems for some or all of the financial year andhighlighted them in their statements on internalfinancial control. The majority of organisations reportingweaknesses were Primary Care Trusts which were intheir first year of operation. The most commonlyoccurring issues are shown at Figure 3 . 3.22 These additional disclosures indicate that not all of the required policies and procedures were in place for thewhole of the 2000-2001 financial year. The Departmentadvises me that it raises the issues arising from theStatements on Internal Financial Control with theorganisations concerned to ensure that action is taken toaddress any identified shortcomings.2Categories of minimum financial control standards !The control environment; !Identification and evaluation of risks !Information communication; !Control processes; and !Monitoring and Source: Department of Health Issues in NHS organisations' Statements on Internal Financial Control3 !Procedure notes were not in place for all fundamentalfinancial systems; !The Audit Committee did not review and monitor internalfinancial control and the implementation of agreed controlimprovements; and !The systems in place did not produce wholly reliablefinancial information and proper accounting records. Source: Analysis of results of the appointed auditors' workR12 part threeNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 Introduction of statements on internal financial control on the NHS summarised accounts 3.23 Although statements on internal financial control have been included in the underlying accounts since 1997-1998, statements have been included with thesummarised accounts for the first time this year.Statements have been prepared for the summarisedaccounts of health authorities, NHS Trusts, Primary CareTrusts and most special health authorities. 3.24 The Accounting Officer of the Department of Health, drawing on the statements from his accountable officerson the underlying individual accounts, drew attention insix of the summarised accounts to weaknesses insystems or failures to meet all minimum controlstandards reported by the underlying organisations.Based on the work of the appointed auditors on theunderlying accounts, and my own examination, I canalso confirm that the various statements in respect ofthese summarised accounts are consistent with my ownknowledge of the relevant NHS organisations. 3.25 There is no departmental or Charities Commission requirement for the NHS charitable funds held on trust toinclude Statements on Internal Financial Control withtheir annual accounts. The summarised account for fundsheld on trust therefore excluded an equivalent statement.Introduction of statements on internal control 3.26 Treasury issued additional guidance on corporate governance in December 2000, requiring all publicsector organisations to expand the statements to coverthe whole system of internal control, incorporating suchareas as operational and policy making systems. For2001-2002 and 2002-2003, organisations should reporton the progress being made towards achieving the2003-2004 target of having all significant risksaddressed by the statement. 3.27 In parallel, the NHS development of corporate governance this year has resulted in the originalminimum control standards being updated and nowincluding three sets of core controls assurance standardsfor 2001-2002 onwards. These are: governance; financialmanagement; and risk management. The new financialmanagement standard replaces the minimum financialcontrol standards referred to in paragraph 3.21. 3.28 The overall aim of the NHS approach remains to establish mechanisms to prioritise and manageidentified risks, and to enable information on bothclinical and non-clinical incidents and complaints to bereliably recorded, reported and analysed to determinethe underlying causes.Part 1 R13 part fourPart 4Financial Performance of the NHS Introduction 4.1 The Department monitors the performance of health organisations across a wide range of activities, for examplethe star ratings for acute NHS Trusts, first published inSeptember 2001. The Department also closely monitorsthe financial performance of the NHS and this part of myreport focuses on the performance of NHS organisationsagainst their financial duties, which are: For health authorities and Primary Care Trusts !A statutory duty to remain within their cash limits; and !A new financial duty to achieve financial balance in resource terms each year; For NHS Trusts !breaking even taking one financial year with another. This is the prime financial duty for NHS Trusts; !absorbing the cost of capital at a rate ofsix per cent; and !meeting the external financing limit set by theDepartment of Health. Overall NHS Expenditure and Assets 4.2 During 2000-2001, health authorities spent \u00a340.9 billion (1999-2000: \u00a339.3 billion),commissioning primary and secondary healthcare.Primary healthcare refers to family health servicesprovided by family doctors, dentists, pharmacists,optometrists and ophthalmic practitioners. Secondaryhealthcare refers to the care provided in hospitals.4.3 In addition, forty Primary Care Trusts were established in 2000-2001 to commission primary and secondaryhealthcare, and they reported total spending of\u00a32.3 billion. During 2001-2002, the number increasedto 164, and is expected to increase by at least afurther 139 in 2002-2003. In line with The NHS Plan , Primary Care Trusts will eventually replace healthauthorities as the lead NHS organisations in assessingneed, planning and securing all health services andimproving health. Part 3 of my report provides furtherdetails of the restructuring of the NHS. 4.4 There were also 356 NHS Trusts in 2000-2001, with total expenditure of \u00a330.8 billion (1999-2000: \u00a328.6 billion)delivering secondary healthcare for the NHS. Theyreceived their main funding from health authorities andPrimary Care Trusts, but also smaller amounts directlyfrom the Department as well as non-NHS sources. 4.5 In addition, the Department provided funding of \u00a30.9 billion to the 16 special health authorities,including amounts to the NHS Litigation Authority tocover payments under the Existing Liabilities Scheme forclinical negligence. Part 6 of my report provides furtherdetails of NHS management arrangements for clinicalnegligence liabilities. 4.6 The NHS delivered these services with a net asset base of \u00a317 billion (Figure 4) .NHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 Asset base for the NHS \u00a3 billion March 2001 March 2000 Fixed Assets 24.2 24.0Current Assets 5.8 4.9Total Liabilities (13.0) Source: NHS Accounts 2000-2001 for health authorities, Primary Care Trusts, NHS Trusts, special health authorities and the Dental Practice BoardR14 part fourNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 Financial duties (a) Health Authorities and Primary Care Trusts 4.7 Health authorities and Primary Care Trusts have a statutory duty to remain within their cash limits and adepartmental requirement to achieve financial balancein resource terms each year. They are also required toapply the Better Payment Practice Code, which has atarget of paying 95 per cent of undisputed invoiceswithin 30 days of receipt of the goods/service or invoice,whichever is the later. 4.8 In 2000-2001, all Primary Care Trusts and health authorities remained within their cash limits, and all butone health authority achieved financial balance. Theone exception, Bexley and Greenwich Health Authority,recorded a small overspend of \u00a30.9 million (0.3 per centof its expenditure limit) in the period leading up to amerger with a neighbouring authority. 4.9 In 2000-2001, 22 per cent of health authorities paid the target level of invoices within 30 days (1999-2000:13 per cent). The average payment rate was 86 per cent(1999-2000: 84 per cent). (b) NHS Trusts 4.10 NHS Trusts have three key financial duties, which are explained in the following paragraphs: !To break even taking one financial year with another; !To absorb the cost of capital at a rate of six per cent;and !To meet the external financing limit set by theDepartment of Health. Breaking even 4.11 NHS Trusts have a statutory duty to break even, taking one year with another. The legislation does not identifyhow this should be measured, and therefore theDepartment established a method, in consultation withthe NHS Trusts and their auditors, for measuringwhether the NHS Trusts were achieving the duty. Thismethod, which is described in Figure 5 , took effect on 1 April 1997. In previous periods there were significantdifferences in financial reporting within the NHS, whichmade comparison of NHS Trusts difficult, and only sincethe 1997-98 financial year has there been the necessarystability in the accounting regime to allow appropriateassessment against the break-even duty.4.12 Based on this definition, no NHS Trust has failed its break-even duty as at 31 March 2001. Figure 6 shows how this corresponds to the financial position of theNHS Trusts. 4.13 As part of the Department's analysis of financial performance, it identifies those having significantfinancial difficulties. The number has varied over time(Figure 7) but there were 33 at the end of 2000-2001. These NHS Trusts were required to prepare an agreedrecovery plan with the appropriate Regional Office ofthe Department, who will monitor closely the financialprogress of that NHS Trust.The Department has agreed a method for measuring break even !Where an NHS Trust reports a cumulative deficit, the duty is met if this deficit is recovered within the following twofinancial years. !Exceptionally, extensions of up to a total of four years aregiven to NHS Trusts, for example where recovery over twoyears would have unacceptable service consequences, anda recovery plan has been agreed with the Department. !The Department determines break-even to be achieved ifan NHS Trust has a cumulative deficit no greater than 0.5 per cent of turnover.5 Analysis of NHS Trusts' financial position showing that no NHS Trust has failed its break-even duty NOTE 1 10 NHS Trusts within the initial period to achieve break- even have been granted extensions to this period to allowfor expected impediments to achieving break-even withinthree years.6 Number of NHS Trusts with a cumulativedeficit in their balance sheet at 31 March 2001 116 Number of NHS Trusts reporting a cumulative deficit since 1 April 1997 90 Number of NHS Trusts with a cumulative deficit since 1 April 1997 in excess of0.5 % of income 47 Of these trusts, at 31 March 2001: Number still within year 1 or 2 331 since incurring a deficit, who therefore have a further 1 or 2years to achieve break-even Number within year 3 or 4 who 5 were dissolved on 31 March 2001 Number within year 3 or 4 who 9 have been granted an extensionto their recovery period beyond31 March 2001 Total 47R15 part fourNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 4.14 The Department indicates in the Foreword to the NHS Summarised Accounts that the improvement in theunderlying position is indicative of the NHS benefitingfrom the Government's spending plans. Capital cost absorption rate duty 4.15 In line with Treasury requirements across all departments, the Department requires NHSorganisations to absorb the cost of their capital at a rateof six per cent of average relevant net assets. Thisrepresents a return on the capital employed and fundingis set at a level designed to incorporate this charge. 4.16 The average return across NHS Trusts for 2000-01 was 6.2 per cent. The Department allows some tolerance,and considers that only NHS Trusts which have achievedless than 5.5 per cent have failed this duty. On this basis,18 NHS Trusts were deemed to have failed the dutybecause they achieved a return of less than 5.5 per centreturn (1999-2000: 10 NHS Trusts). 4.17 NHS Trusts can fail their capital cost absorption rate duty because of unexpected but necessary purchases orrevaluations of assets. Of the 18 NHS Trusts, 11 failed toachieve this duty for this reason in 2000-2001. External financing limit 4.18 The Department also sets an external financing limit for each NHS Trust as a way of controlling capitalexpenditure across the NHS. It represents the differencebetween what an NHS Trust is authorised to spend oncapital items in a year and what it can generate throughother resources. An NHS Trust's internally generatedresources include: income is receivedfrom the health authority); !cash proceeds from the disposal of assets; and !any surplus for the year that remains after thepayment of Public Dividend Capital dividends.4.19 In 2000-2001, NHS Trusts overall were \u00a39 million within the limit of \u00a3224 million at a national level. TheDepartment allows some tolerance and considers thatonly Trusts which overshoot their external financinglimit by more than \u00a310,000 have failed this duty. On thisbasis, seven NHS Trusts, 1.9 per cent, exceeded theirindividual limits, an improvement on 1999-2000 (eightNHS Trusts, 2.1 per cent). Only one NHS Trust exceededits limit by more than \u00a3100,000 in 2000-2001 (1999-2000: three). Better Payment Practice Code 4.20 Twenty five per cent of NHS Trusts paid the target level of invoices within 30 days (1999-2000: 19 per cent),while 49 per cent achieved at least 90 per centcompliance (1999-2000: 45 per cent). The averagepayment rate was 84 per cent (1999-2000: 83 per cent). 4.21 Of the 345 NHS Trusts with comparable data for the two years, 142 (41 per cent) reported a poorerperformance in 2000-2001 than the previous year,although in most cases the performance was onlymarginally poorer. This performance should be seenwithin the context of the NHS paying some 14 millioninvoices to external creditors.The number of NHS Trusts with significant financial difficulties at 31 March 2001 is lower than in any of the three preceding years 2000-2001 1999-2000 1998-1999 1997-1998 Numbers of NHS Trusts regarded by 33 76 53 78the Department as having significant financial difficulties7R16 part 5.1 This part of my report summarises: !Background to countering fraud in the NHS (paragraphs 5.2 to 5.6 ). !Progress made by the NHS Counter Fraud Service, on the published commitments, includingestimation of the cost of fraud and incorrectness inthe NHS and achievements in countering fraud(paragraphs 5.7 to 5.18 ). !Other anti fraud work ( paragraphs 5.19 to 5.20 ). !The impact of fraud on the audit opinions on accounts of the NHS in Wales and Scotland(paragraphs 5.21 to 5.22 ). !The impact of fraud on opinion on the summarised accounts ( paragraph 5.23 ). Background to countering fraud in the NHS 5.2 In December 1998, the Department of Health published its fraud strategy, Countering fraud in the NHS . It established the NHS Counter Fraud Service (formerly theDirectorate of Counter Fraud Services) with a CentralUnit within the Department. It has overall responsibilityfor all work to prevent, detect and measure fraud andcorruption within the NHS with particular priority forcountering fraud in family health services. 5.3 The NHS Counter Fraud Service has an annual budget of \u00a35.4 million and employs some 115 staff. In addition,health organisations employ a further 400 local counterfraud specialists.5.4 The fraud strategy gave three published commitments: !to achieve a 50% reduction in the level of prescription charge evasion by the end of 2002-2003. The Department has to date achieved areduction of some 41% which is a major steptowards achieving this commitment by the end of2002-2003 (paragraph 5.10); !to prevent \u00a39 million in contractor fraud and to recover \u00a36 million by the end of 2001-2002. TheNHS Counter Fraud Service is not in a position toreport progress against the prevention target beforeApril 2002. The \u00a36 million recovery target has beenexceeded (Figure 10 and paragraph 5.17); and !to reduce fraud to an absolute minimum within ten years. The NHS Counter Fraud Service isundertaking a variety of activities, described in thisreport, to seek to achieve this target (paragraphs5.19 and 5.20). 5.5 In July 1999, the Public Accounts Committee raised a number of concerns on the efforts made to combat fraudin the NHS. The principal concerns were that: !the NHS lacked an overall estimate of the level of fraud it faced; !the level of detected fraud at \u00a32.6 million was very low, compared to the stock of fraud in the system ofover \u00a3150 million; and !there were some two million more people registered with GPs in England than the resident populationand that this may to some extent be the result offraudulent claims by GPs. 5.6 In my report on the NHS summarised accounts for 1998-99 (HC356, 1999-2000) I examined workundertaken by the Department of Health to prevent,detect and measure fraud in the NHS. In my report onthe NHS summarised accounts for 1999-2000, Ireviewed the progress made and, this year, I considerthe further achievements made against the Department'spublished commitments and work to address theconcerns of the Public Accounts Committee.Progress made by the NHS Counter Fraud Service on the publishedcommitments Establishing an overall estimate of the cost offraud and incorrectness in the NHS 5.7 In order to focus anti-fraud work on key risk areas and to measure achievements in countering fraud, the NHSCounter Fraud Service recognised the need to establisha baseline figure for fraud. To do so, they developed aRisk Measurement Project to accurately measure fraudacross all main NHS services by 31 March 2000. Current position 5.8 Figure 8 summarises the progress made on each of the separate measurement exercises within the Project:5.9 This is the first time that such a broad based fraud loss measurement exercise has been attempted and theNHS Counter Fraud Service has encountered problemswith the availability of suitable NHS data and has had todevelop its methodology as it has progressed. Baselinemeasurement exercises estimate the percentage ofclaims that may or may not involve fraud. They are notas accurate as the monetary estimates of fraud andincorrectness to be derived from the subsequent fullmeasurement exercises. The outcomes of these baselinemeasurement exercises will help to inform how toproceed in full measurement exercises. 5.10 At the time of my last report, the NHS Counter Fraud Service had completed two estimates for the costof Pharmaceutical Patient Fraud. These indicated thatthe annual cost to the NHS of patients in Englandfraudulently evading the prescription charge had fallenfrom \u00a3117 million at November 1998 to \u00a369 millionat July 1999. The reduction of \u00a348 million, some 41%,is a major step towards achieving the Department'sfirst published commitment of a 50% reduction by2002-2003.

Source: NHS Counter Fraud Service5.11 By the end of February 2002, the NHS Counter Fraud Service had completed five full measurement exercisescovering each area of potential patient fraud and twobaseline measurement exercises covering dentalcontractor fraud and optical contractor fraud. A fullmeasurement exercise covering pharmaceuticalcontractor fraud and a baseline measurement exercisecovering fraud in General Medical Services are alsonearing completion. 5.12 In respect of dental patient fraud, the NHS Counter Fraud Service has reported a measured reduction in losses from\u00a340.3 million in 1999-2000 to \u00a330 million in 2000-2001.This is a reduction of \u00a310.3 million, some 25%. Suspected frauds reported to NHS Counter Fraud Services 5.13 Suspected frauds reported to the NHS Counter Fraud Service have been uncovered by a variety ofmethods, including: !The Fraud and Corruption Reporting Line initiative; !The work of the local counter fraud specialists; !Its own proactive counter fraud exercises; and !Liaison with health organisations' auditors. 5.14 At the time of my last report, 484 cases of suspected fraud, with an estimated value of \u00a318.3 million hadbeen reported to the NHS Counter Fraud Service. Sincethen, an additional 445 cases, with an estimated valueof \u00a317 million have been reported to the Service. 5.15 The ways in which fraud can be perpetrated against the NHS are numerous. I list a selection of some of the mostrecent examples of completed cases that the Directoratehas dealt with (Figure 9) : R19 part fiveNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 Some recent fraud cases !A senior partner of a dispensing general medical practice submitted false invoices and fabricated drugs invoicesfrom fictitious pharmaceutical companies. He pleadedguilty to 49 out of 50 charges of false accounting andobtaining money by deception, with another 1,018 furtherfalse accounting offences taken into consideration.

She was chargedwith 10 counts of obtaining a pecuniary advantage, one offalse accounting, one of theft of drugs from the employerand possession of Class C drugs. A further 159 offencesinvolving dishonesty were taken into account. She pleadedguilty to some of the charges. Dismissed following aninternal disciplinary hearing, she was also sentenced to15 months imprisonment. The total value of alleged fraudwas \u00a389,000 and the Trust is considering pursuing civilrecovery for losses and removal of her nursing registration. !A businessman, owning and running a number of opticaloutlets, employed optometrists on a locum basis, payingthem by the session. The Health Authority fraud specialistnoted high levels of claims and found 1,551 false opticalclaims being presented for payment. The businessman wascharged with 29 offences of false accounting with a further849 offences taken into consideration. He pleaded guiltyto the 29 offences, amounting to some \u00a330,000. Hereceived a 12 months custodial sentence, withcompensation of \u00a330,000 to be paid to the HealthAuthority. A confiscation hearing is to be held for thebalance of \u00a375,000. !An NHS Trust manager authorised timesheets in respect offour relatives who did not work for the Trust.

The penalty charges are fivetimes the value of the prescription plus the charge whichshould have been paid, up to a maximum of \u00a3100.18,361 of these penalty charges had been applied inrespect of evasion of charges in Pharmaceutical Servicesby 31 December 2001, with a total value of \u00a3886,000. Other anti-fraud work 5.19 The Department's counter-fraud strategy focused on seven generic areas: influencing the development of ananti-fraud culture; deterrence, prevention, detection,investigation, applying appropriate sanctions, andseeking redress. A key part of the strategy wasdeveloping the Operational Service, which works as apart of the NHS Counter Fraud Service in implementingthe strategy at a local level and providing advice toindividual NHS organisations.5.20 The work of the NHS Counter Fraud Service represents further movement towards achievement of thepublished commitment to reduce fraud in the NHS to anabsolute minimum by 2008. Some recent achievementsare described below: !Development of additional counter-fraud charters with the Royal College of Nursing, the Association ofBritish Dispensing Opticians and withrepresentatives of Patient Groups - a total of morethan 400,000 NHS staff and professionals are nowcovered by such charter agreements; !Clarification of rules and regulations for primary care contractors, including rules relating to claimsfor recalled dental attendance, and domiciliaryoptical visits and sight test optical services inFebruary 2001; new rules regarding conflicts ofinterest and transparency were introduced in theHealth and Social Care Act 2001; !Introducing additional checks, including point of treatment checks in General Dental Services inNovember 2000 and point of service checks inGeneral Optical Services in February 2001; !In the last three years, almost 400 professionally trained and accredited counter fraud specialists havebeen put in place across the NHS; !580 fraud awareness presentations have been delivered to key NHS staff; !This work has resulted in measured improvements of up to 40% in the numbers of staff understanding theimportance of tackling fraud and their roles andresponsibilities in this respect; !There have been 91 successful prosecutions and 143 successful civil legal and disciplinary cases; and !The NHS Counter Fraud Service has reported a 99% successful prosecution rate - having only lost one case.

Source: NHS Counter Fraud ServiceR21 part fiveNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 5.22 In the same way, the regularity opinions on the 2000-2001 summarised accounts for the health boardsand NHS Trusts in Scotland have been qualified by theAuditor General for Scotland. A limitation was placedon the scope of the opinion due to the absence ofa comprehensive framework of post-paymentverification covering both patient charges andpayments to general medical, dental, ophthalmic andpharmaceutical contractors. Impact of fraud on my opinions on the summarised accounts 5.23 I considered the impact of the estimated cost of fraud and incorrectness identified by the Service in thecontext of my audit opinions on the summarisedaccounts. In my view, although large, the estimated costof fraud and incorrectness (\u00a3112 million, and\u00a380.6 million \"at risk\") is not significant to affectmy opinions on the NHS summarised accounts, whichaccount for over \u00a340 billion. I have therefore givenunqualified opinions the fiveNHS sixIntroduction 6.1 This part of my report: !Analyses the total potential clinical negligence liabilities for the NHS, drawing together thebalances recorded in the different organisationsacross the NHS (paragraphs 6.3 to 6.7); !Explains the role of the NHS Litigation Authority andindicates how the administration and accounting forclinical negligence is being transferred to theAuthority (paragraphs 6.8 to 6.14); and !Reports developments since my report\"Handling Clinical Negligence Cases in England\"(paragraphs 6.15 to 6.16). Background 6.2 Clinical negligence is the term given to a breach of a duty of care by health care practitioners in theperformance of their duties. Meeting the liabilities forclinical negligence continues to be a major challengefacing the NHS and represents a significant drain onresources away from patient care. Liabilities and charges for clinical negligence 6.3 In total, the NHS Summarised Accounts show that provisions for the likely cost of clinical negligenceamounted to \u00a34.4 billion at 31 March 2001, an increaseof \u00a30.5 billion since 31 March 2000. 6.4 Figure 11 shows that the provisions have continued to grow but that the rate of growth is steadily decreasing.These provisions have been calculated in accordancewith Financial Reporting Standard 12, and so reflect theprobability of outcome for each individual case. Theyinclude actuarially determined estimates for cases thathave probably occurred but have yet to be reported tothe appropriate authorities. All amounts are discountedby applying the Treasury standard discount factor for thepublic sector of six per cent, thereby reflecting the netpresent value of the potential costs.6.5 The NHS Litigation Authority reported an increase in new claims, from 2,411 in 1999-2000, to 4,115 in2000-2001 for the Clinical Negligence Scheme forTrusts. During the year, the Authority closed 1,547 cases(1999-2000: 866). In addition, changes in provisionsarise because of revisions of the assumptions applied bythe actuaries in calculating estimates. 6.6 Legal developments were a key cause of the size of the increase in provisions observed in 2000-2001.Two significant cases, Wells v Wells and Heil v Rankinhave each increased the value of awards, and this hasresulted in the Lord Chancellor adjusting the discountrate used in calculating the costs of future care,education and loss of earnings.Total provisions for clinical negligence within the NHS continue to addition to the provisions for likely costs, NHS organisations have disclosed other possible, butunlikely, costs of clinical negligence. These contingentliabilities, if they crystallised, would add an additional\u00a34 billion, at today's prices, to the NHS liabilities, anincrease of \u00a31.1 billion since 31 March 2000. However,the provision of \u00a34.4 billion, shown in Figure 11 above, includes all liabilities, as at the balance sheet date,which the NHS expected to pay. Accounting developments 6.8 Each NHS Trust is a separate legal entity and is therefore legally responsible for claims brought against it. TheDepartment's aim is to streamline the claims processand to provide central co-ordination for clinicalnegligence claim handling. 6.9 The NHS Litigation Authority 1provides a central focal point for clinical negligence within the NHS, with theaim of ensuring consistency in handling claims. As a firstphase of streamlining the management of clinicalnegligence claims, since 1 April 2000, theNHS Litigation Authority has assumed responsibility forthe administration of all negligence cases whichoccurred prior to 1 April 1995 (funded by theDepartment under the Existing Liabilities Scheme). 6.10 The NHS Litigation Authority now also accounts for all transactions and balances relating to this scheme, withthe relevant NHS Trusts and health authorities reporting,in the notes to their accounts, the liabilities held by theAuthority on their behalf. As a result, the NHS LitigationAuthority accounts now show the total provisions for theNHS relating to incidents arising prior to April 1995. 6.11 For incidents that have occurred since 1 April 1995, the NHS Litigation Authority has been operating a risk pool,called the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST).Under this scheme, members pay annual contributions tothe NHS Litigation Authority, who administer and settleclaims on behalf of the NHS Trust. The contributions arebased on the Authority's risk assessment of the individualmember, taking account of the claims history and the fieldin which the NHS Trust operates. 6.12 The NHS Litigation Authority aims to collect enough from contributions to cover the anticipated payments forthe financial year. In 2000-2001, the first year ofsignificant payments under the scheme, approximately\u00a3157 million was paid to claimants, partly byNHS Trusts and the remainder by the NHS LitigationAuthority. Contribution income recorded by theNHS Litigation Authority, since the scheme wasestablished, totalled \u00a3119 million.6.13 To further streamline claims handling, from 1 April 2002, the operation of the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trustswill change. In particular, all alleged incidents of clinicalnegligence will be administered and accounted for by theNHS Litigation Authority. Thus, NHS Trusts, healthauthorities and Primary Care Trusts will remove from theiraccounts all provisions as at 31 March 2002, and theNHS Litigation Authority will include an appropriateprovision for the cases transferred. 6.14 Once this transfer is complete, the NHS Litigation Authority will administer and account for all clinicalnegligence liabilities. Individual NHS Trusts, healthauthorities and Primary Care Trusts will continue toreport their respective positions in notes to theiraccounts and will continue to pay contributions into theScheme. Furthermore, this administrative arrangementwill not affect these organisations' duty of care or thelegal liability for cases arising. Public Accounts Committee 6.15 The Public Accounts Committee considered my report, Handling Clinical Negligence Claims in England(HC 403, 2000-2001), on 17 October 2001. As Irecorded in my report on the summarised accounts for1999-2000, the Department and the NHS LitigationAuthority have been developing initiatives to streamlinethe claims process and these initiatives had alreadybrought about improvements in the handling of claims.With regard to areas for further improvement, the keyrecommendations arising from my investigation were: !Dealing with outstanding claims: an action plan should be drawn up with quantified targets andperformance measures to address claims that havebeen open for more than five years; !Patients' access to remedies: alternative ways of satisfactorily resolving small and medium sizedclaims should be investigated by the various partiesinvolved; and !Managing patients' claims: quantified measures of performance should be developed for the solicitorswhom the NHS Litigation Authority instruct or fundand these measures should be incorporated intoselection procedures, contracts and monitoring. 6.16 The Department intends to issue a White Paper in the early summer which will describe its proposals inrespect of the reform of clinical negligence. Otherinitiatives taken include: !The consolidation of management of all claims bytransferring responsibility to the NHS LitigationAuthority (paragraphs 6.8 to 6.14 above refer); 1 The NHS Litigation Authority is a Special Health Authority, set up under the NHS Act 1977 to adminster clinical negligence and other pooled risk schemes for the NHS.R25 part sixNHS SUMMARISED ACCOUNTS 2000-2001 !\"Building a Safer NHS for Patients\", which sets out the Government's plans for promoting patient safetyfollowing the publication of the reportAn Organisation with a Memory and the commitment to implement it in the NHS Plan; !Establishment of The National Patient Safety Agencyin July 2001, which is implementing and operatingthe new national system for learning from error andadverse events; !The issue of additional guidance by theNHS Litigation Authority, strengthening advice onproviding apologies and explanations whentreatment produces adverse results; and !Reforming the NHS complaints procedure,following a national evaluation of existing practices. 6.17 I am planning a follow-up study to look at clinical governance in hospitals, and intend to review theimplementation of these measures, including the impactthey are having in NHS Trusts.
