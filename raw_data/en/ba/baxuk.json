Can I take [ayurvedic medicine](/ayurvedic-medicine/) along with modern medicine? This is the most common question asked by many people. If we take ayurvedic and allopathic medicine together, then what will be drug interactions and adverse effects? What should you do if you have to take both types of medicines together? In my opinion, taking ayurvedic medicine along with allopathic medicine is not recommendable. Not because they can interact, but because they work in different ways. Ayurvedic practitioners prescribe ayurvedic medicines based on [Tridosha](/vata-pitta-kapha-tridosha/) Theory. Your allopathic medicines can affect dosha in your body in a different way. Because allopathic doctor prescribes medicine according to disease, not for the patient. But in [ayurveda](/what-is-ayurveda/), we recommend medicines as per the dominance of a specific dosha. For example, most pain killers used in modern medicine increase [Pitta Dosha](/pitta-dosha-ayurveda/). If you are taking pain killers and getting ayurvedic treatment for any disease in which we need to pacify Pitta Dosha then our treatment may be less effective. Does Ayurvedic Medicine Interact with Modern Medicine? Most of the ayurvedic medicines contain natural ingredients. Sometimes, the same ingredients are also present in the food that you eat on a daily basis. Does your food interact with allopathic medicine or not? Not all foodstuff interacts with modern medicine. but a few may have interactions. For example, a banana may interact with ACE inhibitor because it is high in potassium content. Grapefruit may also interact with antihyperlipidemic drugs. Similarly, some herbal extracts may interact with modern medicine. So, you should use them with precaution. For example, curcumin may interact with blood thinners used in modern medicine. It may increase the tendency of bleeding if you are taking these two types of medicine together. Theoretically, hot potency of curcumin may increase chances of bleeding if taken along with blood thinners. But turmeric powder used in ayurveda or as a home remedy may not have similar effects because it is still less potent than curcumin. Herbs in natural form are less potent than extracts. So, turmeric in natural form is much safer than curcumin. The question is - What should I do if I have to take both types of medicines together? Just keep at least 3 hours precautionary gap between ayurvedic medicine and modern medicine. It will help you to avoid several side effects and drug interactions. This should be helpful in most cases. Please note that each medicine has different pathways of action in your body. So, consult ayurvedic practitioner what can be done in your case. His advice will be precious to avoid any possible drug interaction and side effects. "}
