We are within an office called Chicago Healing Collective, which also offers massage, sports medicine and psychology. Your health, and that of our community, is of the upmost importance to us and is the driving factor behind how we are operating. Due to this we are continuing to ask all clients and practitioners to mask in the shared spaces (hallways, wait rooms) office spaces. Our clients include those who are at risk for immune-compromised health issues and and we aim to provide the best protection we can to anyone vulnerable. We thank you for your continued cooperation.
