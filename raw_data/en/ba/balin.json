The vaccination is only effective if administered before a person becomes infected with HPV, which means before a girl becomes sexually active. School-based vaccination mandates are currently the most successful way to achieve widespread childhood va ccination in the United States and are also particularly effective in redu cing racial disparities in vaccination levels. Vaccination mandates raise important questions. This Article considers the ethical, political, medical, and constitutional issues raised by vaccination mandates in the context of HPV vaccination and concludes that school-based HPV vaccination mandates should be adopted. To achieve the broadest protection agai nst HPV, the vaccine mandate should be extended to boys, if, as expected , currently pending clinical trials demonstrate that the vaccine is similarly effective for them. Policies giving parents broad authorit y to refuse vaccinations for their children seriously undermine the effectiveness of any vaccination campaign. Nonetheless, for practical po litical reasons, this Article argues that the vaccine mandate should be accompanied by broad parental authority to opt-out.

F o o d a n d D r u g A d m i n i s t r a t i o n ( \" F D A \" ) approved a new vaccine, Gardasil, to protect against four strains of the human papillomavirus (\"HPV\"), a sexually transmitted disease that is a major cause of cervical cancer and other serious illnesses. 2 Compulsory vaccination raises profound ethical, political, medical, and sometimes constitutional conflicts. This Article argues for compulsory HPV vaccination, finding that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the costs. Every year, more than six million people in the United States become infected with HPV. 3 In 2004, over 26% of all U.S. females were infected with HPV, with infection rates of over 44% for women ages twenty to twenty-four4 and over 80% for women by age fifty.5 Infection rates among men are similar.6 Ninety percent of HPV 1 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., Ten Great Public Health Achievements \u2014 United States, 1900-1999 , 48 M ORBIDITY & MORTALITY WKLY.

Each year nearly 10,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with cervical cancer and nearly 4000 die.8 HPV is detected in 99% of these cases.9 HPV is also associated with other less common fatal cancers and more common, but less dangerous, diseases including genital warts.10 If administered to people who have not previously contracted HPV, Gardasil is 100% effective in protecting against the four viruses it targets.11 In the United States in 2002, 26% of young women had engaged in vaginal intercourse by age fifteen and 70% by age eighteen.12 In a study of four common sexually transmitted diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") estimate that 18% of teenage girls have HPV. 13 Given this prevalence, the vaccine is far more likely to be effective if administered before a person becomes sexually active. In 2006, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (\"ACIP\") of the CDC reco mmended that girls age eleven or (Dec. 2007), http://www.cdc.gov/st d/hpv/STDFact-HPV-and-men.htm. 7 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, supra note 3, at 4; Gloria Y.F.

After evaluating scientific research, Part I concludes that, except for children with particular medical problems, vaccination is wise. Part II places the issue in a social context. In the twenty-first-century United States, state mandates, enforced through compulsory school attendance requirements, are the most likely means of achieving a high level of vaccination and assuring that vaccination extends beyond girls from privileged families. Part II further examines the strengths and weaknesses of \"no shots, no school \" policies, both generally and in the specific context of HPV, and concludes that HPV vaccination should be required as a condition of mand atory school attendance. Part III considers whether and when the law should allow parents to refuse vaccinations for their children, and concludes that, at the present time, state laws should allow broad parental authority to refuse a mandatory HPV vaccination. I. A FTER EVALUATING THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE , WOULD A REASONABLE YOUNG PERSON CHOOSE TO BE VACCINATED AGAINST HPV? This part considers the medical evidence that would influence a reasonable person deciding whether to seek HPV vaccination, including the diseases prevented by the vaccine, risks of the vaccine, opinions of medical experts, and individual attitudes toward medical intervention. Part I concludes that, on balance, the vaccine is advisable. 16 The largest factor motivating people to seek HPV vaccination is that it protects against the significant risk of cervical cancer.17 Since the 1950s, Pap smear tests have substantially reduced the risks of contracting cervical cancer.18 However, cervical cancer is still 14 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, supra note 3, at 16. 15 Id. at 17.

Vaccination against HPV reduces traumatic events of post-Pap smear surgical tests by preventing the transmission of HPV diseases.22 While women should still receive Pap smears after they have been vaccinated, their chances of irregular Pap smears are reduced after vaccination. In addition to cervical cancer and precancerous lesions, HPV infection is also strongly associated with many other cancers and sexually transmitted diseases. 23 Cervical cancers, other more rare forms of cancer, and invasive, costly tests resulting from abnormal Pap smears are serious Pap testing); David S.

In short, the HPV vaccination will prevent more unnece ssary deaths and traumas than many commonly mandated vaccines.24 When making a decision about the HPV vaccine, a reasonable person likely wants to know the risks associated with the immunization as found in clinical trials. Under FDA supervision, Merck studied the risks of the HPV vaccine during a five-year clinical trial involving almost 12,000 participants. 25 The evidence from these trials suggests that, in the short term, the HPV vaccination does not cause serious adverse side effects.26 One out of every 10,000 women 24 In its worst year, death rates from polio were less than those from cervical cancer.

As noted, the initial clinical trials involved a population of less than 12,000 participants for only five years.28 For a rare disease, this would be a large and long clinical trial, but for a vaccine proposed for half the population, against a condition that does not manifest for decades, the clinical tr ial is reasonably short. It is not yet known whether or how often b ooster shots will be needed to maintain the vaccine's effectiveness, 29 nor do we know whether vaccination against some forms of HPV will make other forms of the virus more dangerous.30 In addition to questioning the depth of the evidence supporting the vaccine's effectiveness, some vaccine opponents argue that it is unsafe. They rely primarily on data available from the 1989 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (\"VAERS\"). The Act requires that all physicians report adverse events following vaccination to the CDC and the FDA to make that information available to the public. 31 Judicial Watch, a conservative32 \"public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption,\" analyzed adverse reactions to Gardasil reported to Study Group, supra .

In addition to the medical evidence, many reasonable people considering vaccination are influenced by the recommendations of experts and professional organizations. In 2006, the relevant federal agencies, including the FDA, CDC, and ACIP, recommended that all girls be vaccinated at age eleven or twelve. 36 The ACIP guidelines have been endorsed by several professional medical associations including the American Medical Association (\"AMA\"), 37 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,38 and American Academy of Pediatricians.39 In May 2007, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published three original articles,40 two perspective articles,41 two 33 Press Release, Judicial Watch, Judicial Watch Uncovers Three Deaths Relating to HPV Vaccine (May 23, 2007), available at http://www.judicialwatch.org/6299.shtml. 34 Id.; see also Press Release, Nat'l.

Individual vaccination decisions do not, however, turn solely on scientific evidence or expert recommendations. Individual characteristics and attitudes also matter. For example, some individuals may take a \"wait and see\" approach, forgoing a decision on vaccination until the evidence of the vaccination's effectiveness grows. This approach is not without merit; the Public Citizen Health Research Group generally advises doctors and patients to avoid \"using newly approved drugs unless they are in the small minority of such drugs with a significant therapeutic benefit.\" 47 Analysis of newly approved drugs shows that 20% are withdrawn or subject to FDA warnings within twenty-five years; half of these warnings occurred within seven years of introduction.48 However, even though the respected Public Citizen Health Research Group generally advises avoiding new drugs for seven years,49 the group supports Gardasil as one of the exceptional new drugs that should be used without delay. The group notes that \"cervical cancer takes the lives of some 3700 American women each year. Preventing these deaths is obviously an end worth pursuing.\" 50 Unless there are alternative means of avoiding HPV and cancer, the cost of \"wait and see\" is death for many women and a painful struggle with cancer for many more. 45 Legal Momentum, HPV Vaccine: A Call for Mandatory Vaccination, http://www.legalmomentum.or g/site/DocServer/hpv.pdf?d ocID=385 (last visited Feb. 13, 2008). 46 Focus on the Family, Focus on the Family Position Statement: Human Papillomavirus Vaccines, http://www. family.org/socialissues/A000000357.cfm (last visited Feb. 13, 2008); see Family Research Council, Family Research Council Statement Regarding HPV Vaccines (Feb. 21, 2006), http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i= LH06B03. 47 Public Citizen, Protecting Yourself and Your Family from Preventable Drug- Induced Injury, http://www .worstpills.org/public/pag e.cfm?op_id=45#do_not_use (last visited Mar. 25, 2008). 48 Nicholas J.

Nonetheless, the costs of waiting for evidence to gather are high. It will take decades to know whether a girl who receives Gardasil in 2008 will suffer adverse side effects when she is older. Similarly, because it takes decades for cervical cancer to develop, direct evidence of the effect of HPV vaccination in reducing cervical cancer will not be immediately available. However, if Gardasil proves to be safe and effective in the long term, \"wait and see\" might mean that thousands of women will die unnecessarily from cervical cancer in the next twenty or thirty years. One of the nation's leading proponents of natural and alternative healing, Dr. Andrew Weil, also supports Gardasil: \"This is a big public health step forward. More than half of all men and women pick up HPV within a year of becoming sexually active. The vaccine won't work for women who already are infected with HPV, which is why it is s o i m p o r t a n t t o i m m u n i z e y o u n g g i r l s b e f o r e t h e y b e c o m e s e x u a l l y active.\" 52 On balance, the answers to whether a reasonable person would receive the vaccine are not clear. The most powerful argument against the vaccination is that the evidence is thin. But the evidence will only become thick in decades, not years or months. Both the risks of cervical cancer and the unrealistic alternative of avoiding sex for decades seem a high price to pay for better evidence about possible adverse side effects of the vaccine. Ample evidence supports HPV vaccination as a reasonable choice. 51 Merck 2007 Annual Review: Driving Growth with Our Commitment to Vaccines, http://www.merck.com/finance/ annualreport/ar2007/va ccines.html (last visited April 8, 2008) (reporting 7 million girls have received at least their first dose of Gardasil). 52 Weil is a leader in the alternative health movement and appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1997 and 2005.

S HOULD A STATE MANDATE VACCINATIONS AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES , SUCH AS HPV? Within months of the FDA's approval of the Gardasil vaccination, twenty-four state legislatures considered laws requiring the HPV vaccination for school admission. 53 In May 2007, Virginia became the first state to mandate HPV vaccination for school attendance.54 Part II considers whether mandating the HPV vaccine is the correct response in light of the numerous objections to a mandate. Part II.A discusses general issues common to any mandatory vaccination. It explores the claim that it is preferable to avoid mandates and encourage vaccination through education and voluntary programs. Other developed nations have achieved high levels of vaccination through such programs. Part II.A explores why the United States has come to rely on state vaccination mandates enforced through compulsory school attendance requirements, rather than voluntary programs. It considers the claim that mandatory vaccinations threaten constitutionally protected interests in individual autonomy, physical integrity, and parental authority. Part II.A concludes that mandates are both constitutional and preferable to a voluntary vaccination system. Part II.B focuses on specific issues related to making HPV vaccination mandatory. It describes the groups who have opposed mandating HPV and considers their major arguments. Finally, Part II.C addresses how adding the HPV vaccine to \"no shots, no school\" policies can effectively reduce deaths from cervical cancer and the racial disparities that exist among those suffering from the disease. A. While Organized and Funded Voluntary Vaccination Programs Are Theoretically Preferable to School-Based Mandates, in Recent Years, Only School-Based Mandates Have Effectively Achieved High Levels of Immunization in the United States 1. Based on U.S. Experiences, Mandatory Vaccination Programs Are More Successful than Voluntary Programs The best way to encourage vaccination against HPV is through an organized health care system, which assures that people have access to affordable, quality health care.

It first explores the organization of vaccination programs in the Unites States and then tackles the issue of how to finance vaccines. This section concludes that a \"no shots, no school\" policy is the only effective way to widely distribute vaccines in the United States Professor James Colgrove, a leading scholar of vaccination policy, observed that \"throughout the middle of the twentieth century, health officials relied very little on coercion.\" 56 Public health officials respected principles of liberty and autonomy, believing that persuasion was likely to be more effective than coercion because coercion triggers resistance. In 1927, the New York State Health Commissioner said, \"Persuasion is a slow process. Its results are seldom spectacular but they are certain and durable, accomplishing far more among average human beings than attempts at legal compulsion.\" 57 Similarly, the European countries with the highest levels of immunization \u2014 Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom \u2014 have achieved those levels without compulsion. 58 Mandates are not needed in Europe because all children have a regular source of primary health care, including organized vaccine services.59 B u t e v e n w h e n p e o p l e h a v e r o u t i n e access to primary care, organization matters. In the related context of routine Pap smears, European experience demonstrates that whether 55 See KAISER COMM'N ON MEDICAID & THE UNINSURED , THE UNINSURED : A PRIMER , 6 (2007), available at http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upl oad/7451-03.pdf (fin ding over 46 million Americans \u2014 18% of population \u2014 lack health insurance); Robin M.

The critical issue may not be whether a vaccine is mandatory or voluntary, but rather whether there is an organized effort to assure wide availability. As recently as the 1940s and 1950s, voluntary U.S. vaccination campaigns against polio and smallpox succeeded because there were large public and private commitments to publicize and make vaccinations available. 61 In recent decades, the United States has not seen such organized, voluntary, and widespread public health campaigns.62 Instead, the United States has relied primarily on school- based mandates to promote vaccination. School-based vaccination requirements are a relatively recent development in U.S. history. From 1968 to 1981, the percentage of states requiring at least one vaccination for school attendance went from 50% to 100%. 63 The effectiveness of school vaccination mandates is illustrated by a natural experiment that took place from 1970 to 1971 in Texarkana.64 60 Marc Arbyn, Cervical Cancer Prevention in Europe , 64 E NTRE NOUS, EUR.

When an epidemic broke out, the rate of infection was twelve times higher in Texas than in neighboring Arkansas.65 Soon after this epidemic, Texas mandated vaccination for school attendance, and the mandate withstood legal challenges ending when the Texas Supreme Court upheld the law in 1973.66 Experience shows that, in the United States, high levels of childhood immunization are achieved only through vigorous enforcement of \"no shots, no school\" rules.67 In the 1970s, levels of immunization remained low because school officials failed to enforce the rules; consequently, preventable diseases re-emerged.68 Immunization rates rose in the 1970s and 1980s because state and local health officials pressured school authorities to enfo rce the rules, threatening school officials with fines and other sanctions. 69 Children are also more likely to receive vaccinations when mandates are enforced not only for entry into public school, but also for day care, college, or as an aspect of approved home-schooling. 70 If organized voluntary programs are more respectful than mandates, and are effective internationally, why has the United States come to rely upon school-based vaccination mandates? There are two basic answers. First, the United States does not have a comprehensive, organized health care service. Second, the United States does not have universal health insurance, or even universal coverage for the costs of vaccinations. While a school-based vaccination mandate does not automatically produce an organized program to provide and finance vaccination services, this section ar gues that in the United States mandatory programs, rather than those that are voluntary or opportunistic, are more likely to eff ectively address the critical issues of cost and access in this century. 65 Id. 66 TEX.

These problems exist because many girls in that age group do not have a regular source of medical care. 71 By contrast, almost all infants receive medical care and vaccinations because most infants are born in hospitals with standards and professional norms requiring treatment including vaccinations. 72 Dr. Jon S. Abramson, Chair of the ACIP when Gardasil received FDA approval for girls,73 observed that, as a practical matter, universal vaccination can be achieved for newborns without a formal state mandate. 74 At the other end of childhood, when young people become sexually active, there are incentives to seek regular medical care to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.75 Family planning clinics serve this purpose, providing counseling about HPV and vaccination. As such, family planning clinics constitute a major source of health care information and services to low-income and minority women, precisely those who are at highest risk for cervical cancer. 76 H o w e v e r , m a n y m i d d l e s c h o o l c h i l d r e n \u2014 e l e v e n - t o fourteen-year-olds for whom Gardasil is most likely to be helpful \u2014 are too young for family planning clinics and thus do not have regular visits with a health care provider. 77 In sum, a voluntary program for 71 Supra note 55; See Matthew M.

Because the United States lacks universal health care, a vaccination mandate necessarily involves funding considerations. The HPV vaccine is the most expensive childhood vaccine recommended by the CDC, 78 costing $360 to immunize one child.79 The problem of vaccine costs is not confined to HPV vaccinations. Between 1987 and 2003, the price paid by the CDC for the total package of recommended vaccinations rose from $33.70 to $436, both because the number of recommended vaccines increased and because the price of individual vaccines went up. 80 Between 1995 and 2007, the cost to fully vaccinate a child in the public sector rose from $155 to $1170.81 A small majority of girls and women in the United States are covered by private insurance.82 Private insurers typically follow ACIP guidelines and cover recommended vaccines.83 In 2002, private sources \u2014 health insurance and out-of-pocket payments \u2014 financed 43% of the costs of childhood vaccinations.84 However, even people with private insurance that includes coverage for vaccinations confront financial barriers because \"[c]o-payments and deductibles can make 78 See ASS'N OF ST. & TERRITORIAL HEALTH OFFICIALS , COST TO IMMUNIZE ONE CHILD IN PUBLIC SECTOR , available at http://www.astho.org/pubs/ 2007HillCosttoimmunize1.pdf (citing CDC data). 79 See Kevin Outterson, Patient Buy-Outs for Global Disease Innovations for Low- and Middle-Income Counties, 32 A M.

Unfortunately, private health insurance coverage for vaccinations is decreasing rapidly. Between 2003 and 2006, the proportion of employer-sponsored plans that excluded coverage for vaccination increased from 5% to 20%. 88 In 2006, only 34% of states required insurers to follow current ACIP or American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for children and adolescents, while 49% of states had no rules requiring private insurance plans to cover particular services.89 Sharp federal restrictions on a state's authority to regulate employment-based insurance are a substantial barrier to state insurance mandates. 90 In response to the shrinking private insurance coverage for vaccinations, the federal Vaccines for Children (\"VFC\") program became the most important single source of vaccination funding, paying for 41% of al l children's vaccinations in 2002. 91 85 Rebecca Gudeman, High Cost of HPV Vaccine Limits Use in Surprising Way: The Problem with Private Insurance, 28 YOUTH L.

Children who have insurance that excludes coverage for vaccinations may obtain VFC funded vaccines only at federally qualified health centers, which are not available to many children. 92 Between 2004 and 2006, states introduced new limits on publicly funded vaccines for underinsured children as a result of rising health care costs and new restrictions on the use of state and federal funds. 93 In 2007, while many states considered vaccination mandates,94 other states, including New Hampshire, South Dakota, and Washington, launched voluntary programs to make the vaccine available free to eleven- to eighteen-year-old-girls. 95 In 2007, New Hampshire spent 28% of its immunization budget on HPV vaccines, half of which was funded by the federal government and half by private insurers. 96 Despite the enthusiasm and fi nancial resources, many New Hampshire girls seeking vaccination through the public program confront a four-month wait. 97 Girls with private insurance or the ability to pay out-of-pocket receive the vaccine more quickly.98 Some insurance companies deny coverage to girls who are eligible for a free vaccine under the state program. 99 Confronted with a shortage of the vaccine, New Hampshire doctors have \"devised an elaborate triage system.\"100 In New Hampshire, the triage system favors girls who are sexually active, older, or have had an abortion.101 Given that the vaccine is not effective in sexually active girls infected with HPV,102 this makes no sense.

Perhaps one reason why states are having trouble achieving high levels of vaccination through voluntary programs is that it is not a priority among local heath officials. For example, a local New Hampshire health offi cial commented on the ease of running a voluntary HPV program when compared to running flu shot programs stating, \"[w]e usually have to bust our hump every September to convince people to get their flu shots.\" 104 Implicit in this statement is that the HPV program is easy because local officials commit less effort to HPV vaccinations than they commit to encourage flu vaccines. While flu vaccinations are not mandat ory, a judgment has been made that public health officials should work hard to get flu vaccines to vulnerable people. 2. Mandatory HPV Vaccinations Do Not Violate the Constitution Bedrock principles of U.S. constitutional and common law affirm that a competent adult has the \"right to determine what shall be done with his own body,\" 105 and parents may make medical decisions for their minor children.106 Mandatory vaccinations are a major exception to these principles. All states require vaccinations for children entering school and for newborns. 107 State-mandated school immunization requirements have played a major role in achieving and maintaining low rates of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States. 108 Given our strong legal and cultural commitments to individual and parental choice in relation to medical care, why do we make an exception for vaccinations? When smallpox was epidemic and caused massive death and disability, a ge neral consensus supported laws mandating universal use of vaccinations. 109 Through the twentieth 103 Belluck, supra note 95. 104 Id. 105 Schloendorff v.

The public health justification for mandates reflects an ethical appreciation that no individual needs to be vaccinated against an infectious disease if everyone else is vaccinated. Nonetheless, it is broadly understood to be unfair to allow exceptions for \"free riders\" absent special and compelling circumstances. 111 Further, epidemiological research shows that near universal vaccination can eradicate deadly disease, but that even relatively minor exceptions can cause the disease to re-emerge.112 In addition, paternalistic reasons \u2014 a desire to protect as many individuals as possible from deadly diseases \u2014 also support mandatory vaccination. In the twen ty-first century, the question of mandatory vaccination must be situated in the context of \"a broader social movement for patients' rights and a rejection of medical paternalism, in a political climate in which the judgment of government and scientific elites is met with increasing cynicism and mistrust.\" 113 However, even in this context, significant public health considerations still just ify vaccine mandates. The states' power to mandate vaccinations is not constitutionally controversial. In 1905 the Supreme Court considered a constitutional challenge to a Massachusetts rule requiring smallpox vaccinations when necessary for public health or safety.114 Plaintiff Henning Jacobson challenged the law, assert ing basic rights of bodily integrity and personal autonomy, noting his prior bad experiences with vaccination. 115 Justice John Marshall Harlan, writing for the Court, rejected his claims finding: [T]he liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States . . . does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. On any other basis organized society could not exist with safety to its 110 Salmon et al. , supra note 58, at 436. 111 COLGROVE , supra 31, at 3-4, 12-13. 112 Id. at 12-13, 174-80.

Society based on the rule that each one is a law unto himself would soon be confronted with disorder and anarchy. Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his ow n, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others. In dicta, Justice Harlan also su ggested that vaccination mandates must be based on the \"necessity of the case\" and may not be exercised in \"an arbitrary, unreasonable manner\" or \"go so far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public.\" 116 The Court acknowledged that requiring a person to be immunized with knowledge that the vaccination would pose a special risk of harm to the particular person would be \"cruel and inhuman.\" 117 W h e t h e r a medical necessity exemption to vaccination requirements is constitutionally required has never been tested because all states provide them.118 At the time of Jacobson , many respectable doctors questioned the wisdom of the smallpox vaccine, indicating that medical support for a vaccine need not be universal for a mandate to pass constitutional muster.119 In 1922, the Court extended Jacobson to children to rebuff parents' claims that the Constitution protects their right to refuse vaccinations for their children. The Court affirmed the broad authority of school and public health authorities to determine the manner and types of vaccinations required. 120 Even if state legislatures have broad authority to mandate vaccines that prevent the spread of infectious diseases, claims of parental authority may be more powerful when the state demands vaccination against diseases that are not infectious, such as tetanus. 121 However, in the case of the HPV vaccine, the mandate can be justified on both public health and paternalist grounds; people infected with HPV are personally at risk of various diseases and, unlike tetanus, can easily transmit the virus and risk of disease to others. 116 Id. at 28. 117 Id. at 38-39. 118 See Hodge & Gostin, supra note 107, at 856-58. 119 Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 34-35. 120 Zucht v.

Professor George Annas asserted, \"[T]oday, almost 100 years after Jacobson , both medicine and constitutional law are radically different. We now take constitutional rights much more seriously, including the right of a competent adult to refuse any medical treatment, even life-saving treatment.\"124 T o m a k e t h i s a r g u m e n t , Annas relied primarily on the Supreme Court's 1990 decision in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health . 125 In that case, five members of the Court upheld a state law providing that the parents of a woman in a persistent vegetative state could not remove her feeding tube unless they were able to present \"clear and convincing evidence\" that she would want the tube removed. 126 The question whether the state may constitutionally compel vaccination seems far removed from the issue of whether the state may impose a demanding showing of proof to remove life support for a pe rson in a persistent vegetative state. 127 Specifically, infectious diseases create public health concerns that were was not present in Cruzan . Moreover, the fact that HPV is such a highly infectious disease mo re directly implicates the valid concerns addressed by the Jacobson Court a century ago. In summary, our state and federal co nstitutions give state authorities broad discretion to determine whether vaccines are required. In the case of HPV, delivering medical care to preteens presents particular challenges because many do not have a source of regular medical care 122 Hodge & Gostin, supra note 107, at 863-67 (summarizing cases). 123 COLGROVE , supra note 31, at 242-43. 124 George J.

These challenges are particularly acute for people who have low incomes or are racially or culturally vulnerable. Achieving high levels of vaccination requires an organized and well-funded effort. Given the failures of voluntary vaccination programs in Texarkana and New Hampshire, states should require HPV vaccines through school attendance requirements. B. Objections to Adding the HPV Vaccine to the List of Mandatory Childhood Vaccinations Do Not Withstand Scrutiny This section focuses on HPV and examines specific objections to making the vaccination mandatory. It first describes the major groups that have raised concerns about the vaccination. It then considers and responds to the major objections raised. Opposition to mandatory HPV vaccinations generally comes from sexual conservatives, some feminists and people of color, a lively antivaccination movement, and some public health authorities. For sexual conservatives, HPV is not a problem because of a belief that sex can and should be avoided until one is in a monogamous marriage with a desire to have children. 128 Some feminists question HPV vaccination mandates,129 remembering times when the medical establishment rushed to promote insufficiently tested innovations that proved seriously harmful to women. 130 Similarly, some communities 128 See HPV Mandate Stirs Protest , E DUC.

This argument underestimates the prevalence of sexual conduct among teens,135 the unfortunate fact that not all sex is voluntary, and the fact that the vaccine is effective only if administered before acquiring the virus. Also, vaccination requirements \"do not exist solely to prevent the transmission of disease in school or during childhood. Instead, they further society's strong interest in ensuring that people are protected from disease throughout their lives and are a highly efficient means of eradicating disease in the larger community.\"136 For example, every state requires that school children be immunized against rubella, even though the disease is typically mild in children. Children are immunized because of the need to protect pregnant women from the devastating effects that the disease can have on a developing fetus. 137 Similarly, every state requires vaccination against tetanus,138 even though it is not contagious. Most states require vaccination against hepatitis B,139 even though it is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Others oppose mandating the HPV vaccine because they believe drug companies in general, and Merck in particular, cannot be trusted.

Perhaps the de bate about Gardasil will jumpstart a serious focus on much needed reform of federal pharmaceutical regulation. In the meantime, Dr. Wolff, a longtime critic of the FDA, suggested that we have no choice but to trust the FDA. While the fact that new drug studies are funded and conducted by the companies promoting the drugs \"should always make one skeptical of the results reported, one cannot simply dismiss studies solely on the basis of who is their sponsor. To do so would lead to refusing to take almost all drugs.\" 159 In addition, many in the medical, scientific, public health, and feminist communities continue to seek evidence about safety and efficacy. 160 In the case of the HPV vaccine, the costs of rejecting the vaccine mean that significant numbers of women will die of preventable cancer. Yet another argument against requiring girls to be vaccinated against HPV is that if half the relevant infectious population (boys) is exempt from the mandate, there is no hope of achieving a high level of immunity.

If the vaccine is approved for boys, the argument for a mandate would be bolstered by the increased potential to completely eradicate HPV. The benefits of herd immunity beg the question of why boys have been excluded from the Gardasil approval process. The most obvious answer is that they are not at risk of contracting cervical cancer. However, boys can become infected with HPV, 164 transmit the virus to others, and suffer from diseases other than cervical cancer, which are also associated with the HPV strains Gardasil protects against. 165 Preliminary studies suggest that the HPV vaccine has similar protective effects for boys,166 though the FDA has not yet approved the vaccine for them. The lack of Gardasil's approval for boys is disconcerting. In the twenty-first century, state and federal policies rarely differentiate explicitly on the basis of gender. Under the Equal Protection Clause, government gender classifications are unconstitutional unless they are supported by an \"exceedingly persuasive justification.\" 167 What \"exceedingly persuasive justificat ion\" supports these gender-based policies? One response is that Merck only sought to have the vaccine approved for girls, and as a private company, Merck is entitled to engage in gender discrimination. But, public agencies are not 161 See COLGROVE , supra note 31, at 75-80. The other justification for mandatory vaccination is paternalistic, protecting indi viduals against serious diseases, whether or not infectious. 162 Id. at 3-4, 158-59, 169. 163 Id. 164 See Eileen F.

Because both private and public actors are constitutionally entitled to address problems \"one step at a time,\" 169 Merck decided to first address the area where its vaccine could prevent the most deaths, more specifically, deaths among women from cervical cancer. Furthermore, when Merck first sought FDA approval to undertake clinical trials of Gardasil, common sense may have supported taking one step at a time to recruit test subjects directly affected by the virus, namely women. Despite these responses, gender-based classifications remain the subject of more demanding scrutiny than ordinary social and economic regulation. 170 More important, as the evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective grows, the justifications for limiting testing and mandates to girls decreases.171 This Article does not fully explore the claim that the gender-targeted research and mandate of the HPV vaccine is unconstitutional. It does, however, suggest that it is 168 Merck's choice to test and market only to females does not wholly immunize public agencies from claims of gender discrimination. The FDA's response, \"we just do what our customers ask,\" may be similar to the airlines' claims in the 1970s that they could only hire attractive young women as flight attendants because that was what the customers preferred. Courts have held that customer preference does not justify sex discrimination on the part of an actor prohibit ed from discriminating on the basis of sex. See Diaz v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 442 F.2d 385, 388-89 (5th Cir. 1971); Wilson v. Sw. Airlines Co., 517 F. Supp. 292, 298 (N.D. Tex. 1981). 169 Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955).

Even if gender discrimination is not a valid legal claim, the gendered focus of the HPV vaccine should inform our thinking. C. The Case for Mandatory HPV Vaccination It is difficult for politicians to think about consequences beyond the next election, or for business people to think about the bottom line beyond a short horizon. Obviously, it is even more difficult to think about consequences twenty or thirty years out. The women who will die of cervical cancer in my lifetime had no opportunity to avoid HPV. Why should we worry about the unnecessary, premature deaths of our grandchildren or great-grandchildren? Although the answer seems obvious, it is difficult to translate in to either political or market terms. Generally, there are two reasons why states should add HPV vaccination to the list of mandatory school vaccinations. First, as noted earlier in Part II.A, young people are far more likely to receive timely vaccination prior to contracting the virus if vaccination is mandatory. If not vaccinated now, thousands of women will die unnecessarily from cervical cancer in twenty or thirty years, and thousands more will undergo costly and traumatic testing that the vaccine may prevent. Second, the positive impact of making a vaccine mandatory is greatest for low-income people and racial minorities. Disproportionately large numbers of those women who suffer and die unnecessarily will be women of color who may be saved by the vaccine. 172 In the twenty-first century, it is well-documented that African Americans and other people of color receive less adequate medical care than white people.173 This results partly because people of color are more likely to be poor and uninsured.174 I n a d d i t i o n , w h e n researchers control for wealth, insurance, education, medical conditions, test results, and all other factors, people of color 172 Infra notes 173-79. 173 See RONALD D. SMEDLEY ET AL ., UNEQUAL TREATMENT : CONFRONTING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE 29 (2002); id. at 39-79 (finding sizeable racial and ethnic disparities in health care, even after adjusting for socioeconomic differences and other facts relating to health care access). 174 RAND ROSENBLATT ET AL ., LAW AND THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM , 108-11 (1999). 2008] Human Papillomavirus Vaccination 1765 systematically receive medical care that is inferior to that provided to white people.175 It is therefore not surprising that there are marked racial and ethnic disparities in immunization levels among adults.176 African American women are 50% more likely to experience cervical cancer than white women, and African American mortality rates from cervical cancer are more than twice as high. 177 African Americans are not the only affected minority; Hispanic women have the highest levels of cervical cancer in the nation. 178 T h i s p a t t e r n o f h e a l t h disparity, which negatively affects people of color, does not exist with respect to childhood immunization,179 thus illustrating that school- based mandates are a particularly effective way to address racial disparities that are otherwise pervasive in health care. III. T HREE APPROACHES TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER , WHEN, AND HOW STATES SHOULD MANDATE HPV VACCINATION One way in which states seek to balance the conflict between the public interest in encouraging vaccination against communicable diseases and individual interests in autonomy and physical integrity is to allow exemptions for individuals or for parents on behalf of their children. Every state exempts people who have a medical condition that makes them particularly susceptible to a vaccination's risks. All 175 See, e.g. , June Elchner & Bruce C.

Traditionally, parents make medical decisions for children. For Gardasil to be legitimately accepted as a mandatory vaccine for children, both individual autonomy claims and claims that parents s h o u l d b e a b l e t o d e c i d e w h a t i s b e s t f o r t h e i r c h i l d r e n n e e d t o b e addressed. This part describes the complex landscape of parental consent to medical treatment and vaccination. It considers three approaches addressing parental choice in mandatory HPV vaccination for their children. First, states could mandate the vaccination and allow broad parental opt-out. Second, states might reject an HPV vaccine mandate because it is better to have no mandate at all than have a politically acceptable mandate with a broad parental opt-out. Third, states may mandate vaccination without parental opt-out, except for medical reasons. In the United States, no government has any general power \"to standardize its children.\" 181 This right to a \"private realm of family life which the state cannot enter\"182 was made with an explicit recognition that family cultures differ.183 The tradition of respect for family autonomy has remained strong in U.S. culture and constitutional law, 184 despite the original assumption that autonomy was based in part on the view that the man was the family decision maker and women and children were his property.185 180 Hodge & Gostin, supra note 107, at 874 n.23. 181 Parental control over the medical treatment of children is one aspect of the fundamental U.S. cultural and constitutional assumption that \"[t]he child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.\" Pierce v. Soc'y of Siste rs, 268 U.S. 510, 535 (1925) (holding law requiring children to attend pu blic schools unconstitutional). 182 Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 ( 1923) (holding that state may not prohibit students from learning foreign language). 183 The Supreme Court noted that in Plato's vision of the ideal commonwealth, measures for the collective training and edu cation of children \"have been deliberately approved by men of great genius.\" Id. at 401. 184 See, e.g. , Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 494 (1977) (holding that Fourteenth Amendment protects right of grandmother and grandchildren to live together despite single-family zoning law). But see Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 488 (1970) (holding that state may deny ad ditional welfare when more than four children live in family). 185 The type of family formerly venerate d by English and U.S. law was controlled by men and regarded both women and children as a form of property. Sylvia A. Law, 2008] Human Papillomavirus Vaccination 1767 In protecting parents' authority to make medical decisions for their children, the common law draws a sharp distinction between procedures required to save the life of a child and those that are required or recommended to improve conditions that may be serious but not life threatening. In cases in volving life-threatening injuries or conditions, courts can override parents' objections, including religious objections, to permit procedures to save a child's life. 186 A vaccine that protects against cervical cancer could be seen as a form of life-saving treatment. To do so, however, woul d require a liberal interpretation of existing principle because the risk of contracting cancer by HPV is statistical and remote. In addition to the principle that parents cannot deny their children life-saving treatments, there are numerous other exceptions to the rule that parents are entitled to make medical choices for their children. While state rules vary, most states allow children to consent to medical treatment without parental involvement in a number of situations. 187 The principle seems to be that the decision-making autonomy of older minors is re spected \"when the treatment is relatively low risk, and when denying access may cause the minor (or the public at large) to suffer permanent harm.\" 188 The patchwork of exceptions for older minors, and the principles underlying it, do little to resolve questions about HPV vaccinations and vaccinations more generally for teens or preteens. Perhaps consent to the HPV vaccine could be regarded as treatment for a sexually transmitted disease, allowed in all states without parental consent. 189 But this also seems a stretch given that the vaccine prevents rather than treats already acquired sexual transmitted diseases.

Massachusetts , the Supreme Court considered the claims of a Jehovah's Witness convicted of violating child labor laws after taking her nine-year-old niece and ward with her to distribute religious literature on the streets of their town. In denying her First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges to the child labor laws, Justice Wiley Rutledge famously wrote: \"Parents may be free to become martyrs themse lves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves.\" 191 Distributing literature on a public street is unlikely to make a martyr of a nine-year-old, but the Court held that state legislatures are entitled to enforce child labor laws over the religious objections of the parents. By contrast, denying a HPV vaccine to young women may lead to increased deaths from cervical cancer, 192 particularly among minority women.193 If a state can enforce labor laws against a parent's religious beliefs, it should also be able to enforce a life-saving vaccine to protect children despite a parent's objections. While states are not constitutionally required to provide exemptions for the parents of children who object to vaccination on religious grounds, states are free to do so and most have provided such exemptions. 194 Lower courts are divided on whether a state may limit exemptions to parents who object on religious grounds, rather than other forms of deep moral objections.195 190 Because states typically allow exemption from mandatory vaccination requirements for parents with religious objections, there are few legal decisions addressing whether such exemptions are constitutionally required.

Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 170 (1944). 192 See supra notes 7-13. 193 See supra note 13. 194 See Hodge & Gostin, supra note 107, at 859. 195 See McCartney v.

Compare Kleid F. Supp. 902, 907 (W.D. Ky. 1976) (holding that exemption for members of established religion does not violate 2008] Human Papillomavirus Vaccination 1769 As a practical matter, the availabilit y of exemptions affects the level of vaccination. When exemptions are broad and freely given, diseases that can be prevented through vaccination re-emerge.196 E v e n i f exceptions are narrowly drawn, many school authorities rubberstamp requests for exemption, and vaccine opponents offer Internet services that easily enable people to qualify for exemptions. 197 In some states, exemption from vaccination requirements on the basis of personal belief is so freely available that \"it is easier to claim this exemption than to complete the school immunization form that requires a health care clinician to obtain the child's medical record and transcribe the dates of vaccine administration.\" 198 One approach is to mandate HPV vaccine with broad parental opt- out provisions. The organization Legal Momentum supports this approach and finds that such provisions \"are vital to preserving individual decision making.\" 199 A mandate, even with a broad opt-out provision, helps to command the attention of public health and education officials to organize programs to provide vaccinations to all girls whose parents do not object. 200 Under a mandatory vaccination program, it is more likely that va ccines will be offered to racial Establishment Clause), with Dalli v.

The broad opt-out allows Legal Momentum to criticize conservative groups for taking \"stealth positions [which] assert that parents should have a 'choice' about vaccination rather than having states mandate it. Using the smokescreen of parental choice, vaccination opponents are playing politics with public health.\" 203 Another approach is to reject HPV mandates because of the practical political reality that such mandates will likely include broad parental opt-outs. Lawrence Gostin, an influential public health scholar and a strong supporter of mandates, opposes mandates for Gardasil. 204 The heart of Gostin's argument is that it is more important to preserve other mandatory vaccinations that limit the sweep of parental opt-outs than it is to add mandates that offer broad exemptions. \"The use of compulsion [for HPV vaccination], therefore, could have the unintended consequence of heig htening parental and public apprehensions about childhood vaccinations. It also does not help to offer generous religious and conscientious exemptions for HPV vaccinations because legislators may extend these to other childhood vaccinations, which would be detrimental to the public's health.\" 205 Dr. Jon. S. Abramson, former Chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the CDC, takes a similar position, advocating for HPV vaccination, but opposing an HPV vaccine mandate. 206 201 Supra note 178-79 (discussing racial and eco nomic disparities in relation to mandatory vaccinations). 202 Supra text accompanying notes 8- 10 (discussing HPV's harms). 203 Legal Momentum, supra note 45; see also Ross D.

Dr. Neal Halsey, Director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, commenting on the speed with which Gardasil moved from approval to mandate in 2007, said, \"For many of us in public health who have been involved in immunization and state laws, it's been too qu ick. You want the demand to come from the public who realize the potential benefits from the vaccine, not to be imposed upon them.\" Gold, supra note 75, at 10-11. 2008] Human Papillomavirus Vaccination 1771 A third approach is to mandate HPV vaccination and to limit parents' authority to opt-out of vaccinations for their children, except for medical reasons. Proponents of this approach argue the choice of whether to mandate a vaccine should be social, and mandates should have few exceptions. Children should not be denied the protection of vaccination because of their parents' religious, conscientious, scientific, or political beliefs. O pposition from parents, or other concerned citizens, should be an essential factor in determining whether to make a vaccination mandatory. But when the state decides to make the vaccine mandatory, individual exceptions should not be allowed because it is difficult to distinguish between parents who have religious, conscientious, or scientific objections and those who are simply free riders. In addition, herd immunity can be achieved only through a broad mandate for boys and girls with a narrow parental exemption. 207 Further, a process scrutinizing the legitimacy of parents' decisions to withhold vaccination would be cumbersome and costly. Professor Martin Guggenheim observed, \"If the bases for the mandatory vaccine are great enough to prevail in the first place, it is problematic to permit the uncertainties to resurface when discussing the parents' objection as applied to their child.\" 208 CONCLUSION Approximately 10,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year. Of those, nearly 4000 die. HPV is strongly associated with these deaths as well as other harmful diseases, and Gardasil prevents transmission of HPV. The prevalence of sexual activity and HPV infection rates in the United States, combined with the public health and scientific evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of Gardasil, support routine HPV vaccination for girls between the ages of eleven and fourteen. In the absence of a universal health care financing and delivery syst em in the United States, school- based mandates are currently the only mechanism with the potential to achieve widespread vaccination. In addition, such mandates have the benefit of proven effectiveness in reducing racial disparities in childhood vaccination levels. 207 See supra notes 161-66. 208 Email from Martin Guggenheim, supra note 121. Professor Guggenheim is a strong, informed, sophisticated advocate of parents' rights. See generally MARTIN GUGGENHEIM , WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHILDREN 'S RIGHTS (2005) (discussing children's rights, especially those antagonistic to parents' rights). 1772 University of California, Davis [Vol. 41:1731 Although public health principles support vaccination mandates with narrow medical exemptions, opposition to HPV vaccination mandates with broad parental opt-out are the next best choice. While there is valid concern among some public health advocates that broad parental opt-out provisions for HPV vaccination might threaten continued success of other important school-based vaccine mandates, the risk of such danger materializing is uncertain and speculative. In contrast, the health risks of HPV in fection are certain and preventable, and school-based mandates should be adopted. "}
