It's that time of year again! It seems like people all around us are coughing, sniffling and sneezing -- a sure sign that cold and flu season is here. While the winter holiday is a time of joy and happiness, it can also be a stressful time for many. Buying gifts, preparing for family visits or travel and dealing with cold, damp weather can add to our stress levels. And, as many of us are aware, stress can weaken our immune systems. Washing hands often, avoiding direct contact with others who are sick, getting adequate rest and keeping warm, well-nourished and hydrated are all healthy practices. But even the most conscientious among us know that these aren't always enough to ward off sickness. What does Ayurveda offer for building our immune systems so that we can protect ourselves during vulnerable times? In Ayurveda, the concept of immunity can be correlated to ojas, or our body's vital essence. Ojas not only builds immunity, energy and vitality, it also creates positive emotions like love, joy and happiness. A person with healthy ojas is easy to spot -- they have a radiant glow and complexion. While there is no official modern scientific correlation to ojas, some say it is oxytocin, the bliss hormone that is released during times of intimacy and bonding, like when a mother breastfeeds her newborn baby or during lovemaking. When we have strong ojas, all of our seven tissue layers, or dhatus, are functioning with full integrity. Having strong ojas begins with strong, toxin-free rasa, the first tissue layer, which is roughly correlated with blood plasma in modern physiology. The quality of our rasa is determined directly by the foods, substances and liquids we put into our bodies. So YES, what we consume matters! In fact, it may be the single most important factor in health, strength, immunity and disease prevention. Start building your ojas and immunity today with the following time-tested Ayurvedic approaches: - Ojas Drink A quick and delicious way to build ojas is to make a morning drink with these ojas boosting foods. Blend the following ingredients in 8 - 12 ounces of milk (organic, non-homogenized or raw cow milk) or almond milk: - 1 tsp ghee - 5 tbsps. blanched almonds - 2 to 3 dates - 3 to 4 strands of saffron - 1 tbsp shredded coconut - 1 tsp raw honey - Ashwagandha [Ashwagandha Arishtam](https://www.kottakkal.shop/collections/nerve-tonic-1/products/ashwagandha-arishtam?variant=6658068485#_l_41)is a fast-acting nerve tonic for reducing stress and building a strong immune system. - Chyavanprash [Chyavanprash](https://www.kottakkal.shop/collections/all-lehams/products/chyavanaprasam?variant=6658461701#_l_4a)has long been used to support a strong and healthy immune system. This \"miracle\" anti-aging jam is pertinently named after the great sage Chyawan, who lived to be over 100 years old as a result of eating this jam everyday. Made up of dozens of herbs and other natural ingredients, Chyavanprash penetrates deep into the tissue layers to boost the immune system. It is also a rejuvenative for the heart, respiratory and reproductive systems. Amalaki is the main herb in this concoction, which is a fruit that contains among the highest levels of Vitamin C and antioxidants in the world. Take it everyday and you will definitely develop that healthy ojas glow! - Oil Pulling [Arimedadi](https://www.kottakkal.shop/collections/oil-pulling/products/arimedadi-mouth-wash-oil?variant=6658644997#_l_4b)is a specially formulated mouth wash oil for added benefits. - Self-Massage/Abhyanga [Maha Narayan](https://www.kottakkal.shop/collections/joint-massage-oil-1/products/maha-narayana-oil?variant=6658676869#_l_3q)is ideal for its warm and nourishing qualities. Before bathing spend about 10-15 minutes massaging the warm oil all over your body. Use a straight motion for the long bones and a circular motion for the joints. Along with the above recommendations, support a healthy immune system by prioritizing adequate sleep, maintaining a consistent daily routine by eating, exercising and sleeping at optimal times, and eating a diet of warm, nourishing, plant-based foods and grains. Drink warm water throughout the day and make sure that you have regular bowel movements with complete elimination. If necessary, support your bowels with [Triphala](https://www.kottakkal.shop/products/triphaladi-churnam?variant=6658330373#_l_3s) or other digestive herbs.
