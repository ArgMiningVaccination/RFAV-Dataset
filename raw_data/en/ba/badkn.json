Ehrlich, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, January 18, 2001 (received for review October 9, 2000) The utility of live attenuated vaccines for controlling HIV epidemics is being debated. Live attenuated HIV vaccines (LAHVs) could beextremely effective in protecting against infection with wild-typestrains, but may not be completely safe as the attenuated straincould cause AIDS in some vaccinated individuals. We present atheoretical framework for evaluating the consequences of thetradeoff between vaccine efcacy (in terms of preventing newinfections with wild-type strains) and safety (in terms of vaccine-induced AIDS deaths). We use our framework to predict, forZimbabwe and Thailand, the epidemiological impact of 1,000different (specied by efcacy and safety characteristics) LAHVs.We predict that paradoxically: ( i) in Zimbabwe (where transmission is high) LAHVs would signicantly decrease the AIDS death rate,but ( ii) in Thailand (where transmission is low) exactly the same vaccines (in terms of efcacy and safety characteristics) wouldincrease the AIDS death rate. Our results imply that a thresholdtransmission rate exists that determines whether any given LAHVhas a benecial or a detrimental impact. We also determine thevaccine perversity point, which is dened in terms of the fractionof vaccinated individuals who progress to AIDS as a result of thevaccine strain. Vaccination with any LAHV that causes more than5% of vaccinated individuals to progress to AIDS in 25 years would,even 50 years later, lead to perversity (i.e., increase the annual AIDSdeath rate) in Thailand; these same vaccines would lead to de-creases in the annual AIDS death rate in Zimbabwe. Live attenuated vaccines (due to their high protective efficacy, low cost, and simple immunization schedules) have been used successfully to control smallpox, polio, and measles epidemics(1, 2). Preliminary attempts have been made to develop a liveattenuated HIV vaccine (LAHV) (3-6); however, the debateabout the potential utility of developing LAHVs has beencontroversial, mainly due to concerns that have arisen aboutvaccine safety (3, 4, 7-9). The major safety concern is that evena very attenuated strain of HIV (if used as a LAHV) couldactually cause AIDS in some fraction of vaccinated individuals(4, 5). Live attenuated polio vaccine has caused some cases ofparalytic poliomyelitis (10), and any live attenuated vaccine hasthe potential to cause disease. Studies in macaques of the closelyrelated simian immunodeficiency virus have shown that liveattenuated strains can be highly effective in protecting againstinfection with the wild-type strain (4, 11), but that some ma-caques develop AIDS as a result of the attenuated strain (5, 12).Concern about the potential safety of LAHVs has been height-ened by a recent report of the natural history of HIV infectionin a cohort of gay men in Australia (13). Some of these men wereinfected with a naturally attenuated strain of HIV. Long-termfollow-up studies of this cohort have shown that this strain ofHIV, although attenuated, can cause immune deterioration (13).The design of a LAHV therefore presents a formidablechallenge. The efficacy and safety of LAHVs will be determined by phase III clinical trials; however, the safety effects of any LAHV willneed to be understood at the epidemic level before any candidatevaccine can be considered as a potential epidemic control agent.Here we present a mathematical model that provides a theoret- ical framework that can be used for LAHVs to predict thetradeoff between vaccine efficacy (in terms of preventing newinfections with wild-type HIV) and vaccine safety effects (interms of vaccine-induced AIDS deaths) at the epidemic level.We evaluate the consequences of this tradeoff by using ourmodel to predict the potential epidemiological impact of vacci-nation with a variety of LAHVs in Thailand and Zimbabwe.Specifically, we use our model to address two research questions:(i) could vaccination with a LAHV lead to the eradication of the wild-type strain of HIV? and ( ii) what impact would a mass vaccination campaign with a LAHV have on the annual AIDSdeath rate? We discuss the implications of our results for vaccinedesign, phase III clinical trials, and epidemic control strategies. Mathematical models of HIV vaccines have been used: ( i)t o calculate vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage levels foreradicating HIV (using a prophylactic non-LAHV) (14-16), ( ii) to design phase III trials (17-19), ( iii) to evaluate the effect of changes in risk behavior on vaccination campaigns (15, 20), and (iv) to determine the degree of vaccine-induced cross-immunity that would be necessary to control multiple subtypes (20-22).These analyses (14-22) have evaluated the consequences ofvaccines that do not have the potential to cause AIDS. Here, wepresent a theoretical framework that enables us to model theeffects of a mass vaccination campaign that uses a LAHV. Weuse our model to explicitly quantify the tradeoff between thepotential efficacy (in terms of reducing the number of newinfections with the wild-type strain) and the safety effects (interms of vaccine-induced AIDS deaths) of a LAHV. We predictthe potential epidemiological impact of mass vaccination with avariety of LAHVs (with different efficacy and safety character-istics) in two countries with very different HIV epidemics:Zimbabwe (where the current HIV prevalence is 25%) (http: yy www.unaids.org yhivaidsinfo ydocuments.html) and is 2%) (http: yywww.unaids. orgyhivaidsinfo ydocuments.html). Methods Mathematical Model of Mass Vaccination with a LAHV. Our model tracks the temporal dynamics of individuals in five groups:susceptible individuals ( X), unvaccinated individuals infected with wild-type HIV ( Y W), individuals uninfected with the wild- type strain but infected with the vaccine strain (either byvaccination or transmission of the vaccine strain) ( Y V), individ- uals dually infected with the vaccine and the wild-type strain(Y VW), and individuals with AIDS ( A). Our model is specified by five coupled ordinary differential equations (see Appendix ). A flow diagram of the model is given in Fig. 4, which is published Abbreviations: LAHV, live attenuated HIV vaccine; pdf, probability density function; VPP, vaccine perversity point; TTR, threshold transmission rate.

Our modelingframework allows us to analyze the epidemiological conse-quences of cross-interactions among strains; similar frameworkshave been used to analyze multiple strain dynamics for myxoma,influenza, and tuberculosis (23-28) or to evaluate the effects ofvaccination and cross-immunity (29). We model vaccine efficacy by assuming that a LAHV can have two beneficial effects: ( i) a degree effect (i.e., the vaccine induces some degree of protection against infection with wild-typestrains), and ( ii) a therapeutic effect (i.e., the vaccine reduces the wild-type disease progression rate in dually infected individuals).Dually infected individuals ( Y VW) are individuals that are vac- cinated (i.e., they are originally YVindividuals), but subsequently become infected with the wild-type strain. We assume that thesedually infected individuals ( Y VW) (due to the presence of the vaccine strain) may have a lower viral load than unvaccinatedHIV-infected individuals ( Y W). Reductions in viral load will decrease the disease progression rate, thus YVWindividuals (in comparison with YWindividuals) will have a slower disease progression rate (30, 31). We model the safety effect of a LAHV by assuming that the vaccine strain can cause a fraction of thevaccinated individuals (who remain uninfected with the wild- type strains) to slowly progress to AIDS. We also include thepossibility that the vaccine strain could be transmitted fromvaccinated individuals ( Y V) to susceptible individuals ( X). Initial Conditions. To set the initial conditions for our analyses we used our model equations (assuming no vaccination), Latinhypercube sampling methodology, and parameter estimatesbased on probability density functions (pdfs) to estimate thecurrent annual AIDS death rate in Thailand and Zimbabwe. Weused the following pdfs: average survival time with AIDS (1 y mA) (pdf: 9 month s - 1 year - 18 months) (32, 33), average infec- tiousness (i.e., transmission probability) of wild-type HIV persexual partnership ( bW) (pdf: 0.05 to 0.1 to 0.2) (34), and average disease progression rate to AIDS due to infection with wild-typestrains ( v W) (pdf: range from 50% progression to AIDS in 7.5 years to 50% progression in 10 years) (33, 35-37). To obtain country-specific estimates we used current estimates of thepopulation size of sexually active adults and estimates of the average sexually activelifespan (31 years in Zimbabwe (http: yywww.unaids.org y hivaidsinfo ydocuments.html) and 49 years in Thailand (http: yy Fig. 1.

The parameter c (average rate of acquiring new sex partners) was derived as adependent variable. We compared our estimates with reporteddata on the current annual AIDS death rate in Zimbabwe andThailand. Uncertainty Analysis of Analytical Equilibrium Results. We used our model and conducted an uncertainty analysis of the endemicequilibria to predict whether mass vaccination with a LAHVcould eradicate wild-type HIV in Zimbabwe and yor Thailand. To make these predictions we analyzed our model to obtainanalytical expressions for the endemic equilibria states (seesupplemental Appendix , which is published on the PNAS web site). These analyses revealed that if the vaccination coveragelevel ( p) was greater than zero then either a coexistence endemic state would be reached (where both the wild-type HIV strain andthe LAHV strain would be present), or the wild-type strainswould be eradicated and only the LAHV strain would reach anendemic state. We derived analytical expressions for these twopossible endemic equilibria (i.e., coexistence or wild-type erad-ication). Then we used uncertainty analysis (based on Latin hypercube sampling, which is a type of stratified Monte Carlosampling scheme; refs. 38-43) to obtain 1,000 different sets ofparameter estimates to define the characteristics of 1,000 dif-ferent mass vaccination campaigns. Mass vaccination campaignswere defined in terms of vaccine efficacy (in terms of cand g), vaccine safety ( vV), and vaccination coverage level ( p); eachsymbol specifies a parameter in the model, see Appendix for precise definitions of each parameter. The pdfs that we used for c,g,vV, and pare described in the next section. We then determined for each of these 1,0000 parameter sets (by using thederived analytical expressions for the endemic equilibria)whether they would stabilize at either the coexistence or thewild-type eradication state. We derived country-specific results by using the appropriate demographic parameters for Zimbabweand Thailand. For further details see the supplemental Appendix . Prediction Methodology: Time-Dependent Uncertainty Analysis. To predict the potential impact of LAHVs on the annual AIDSdeath rate, we analyzed our model by using time-dependentuncertainty analyses based on Latin hypercube sampling. Pre-viously we have used this analysis to make predictions for other Fig. 2. Predictions of the epidemiological impact of 1,000 different LAHVs. Annual AIDS death rates are plotted in the form of box plots; the medianvalues are shown in red. Uncertainty analysis predictions (1,000 simulations foreach country) of the total annual AIDS death rates (per 100,000 individuals)are plotted for Zimbabwe ( A) and Thailand ( B). The total annual AIDS death rate equals the annual AIDS deaths that are caused by the wild-type strain plusthe annual AIDS deaths that are caused by the vaccine strain. Fig. 3.

By using uncertainty analysis we were able to use pdfs,rather than single values, to specify parameter estimates. Foreach analysis, each parameter was assigned 1,000 different valuessampled from the specified pdf; values were chosen by dividingthe pdf for each parameter into 1,000 equi-probable intervals,and then sampling the pdf (randomly and without replacement)1,000 times. The pdf for each parameter was sampled indepen-dently. We explored the potential effects of LAHVs with a fairlywide range of efficacy and safety characteristics. This method-ology enabled us to generate (for each country) 1,000 differentsimulations; where each simulation had a different vaccinationcoverage level and a different LAHV (as specified by the efficacyand safety characteristics). For each simulation we assumed thata mass vaccination campaign (with a coverage level of p) would be initiated at time 0 and a fraction ( p) of new susceptibles would be vaccinated annually. We predicted the effects of mass vaccination campaigns (with follow-up programs) that would vaccinate anywhere from 80%to 95% (range of pdf: 0.95 .p.0.8). Only a LAHV that has performed extremely well in terms of efficacy inphase III trials is likely to be licensed. Therefore we assumed thatthe LAHVs used in our vaccination campaigns would have fairlyhigh efficacy characteristics. To specify the pdf for LAHVefficacy we assumed that: ( i) the ''degree'' of vaccine-induced protection ( c) against infection with the wild-type strains was between 50% and 95% (range of pdf: 0.95 .c.0.5), and that (ii) the ''therapeutic'' effect of the vaccine ( d) in dually infected individuals reduced the wild-type disease progression rate from1- to 10-fold (range of pdf: 1 . d.0.1). The long-term risks of LAHV (in terms of the risk of developing AIDS due to thevaccine strain) might not be apparent in short-term phase IIItrials as disease progression rates are slow, therefore we evalu-ated the consequences of a wide range of risks. Risk was definedin terms of the vaccine-induced disease progression rate ( v V); we evaluated the consequences of vaccines that could cause any-where from 1% to 10% (with a most likely value of 5%) of thevaccinated individuals to progress to AIDS in 25 years. Thesevaccine-induced disease progression rates (pdf: minimum 1%,peak 5%, maximum 10% in 25 years) translated into a range inthe annual progression rate to AIDS of 5 to 40 individuals per10,000 vaccinated individuals. Finally, we assumed that, althoughthe vaccine strain could be transmitted, the infectiousness of thevaccine strain was 10- to 1,000-fold (with a peak at 100) lessinfectious than the wild-type strain (range of pdf: 0.10 . a. 0.001). Results The current annual AIDS death rate in Zimbabwe is 1,987 per 100,000 individuals (http: yywww.unaids.org yhivaidsinfo y documents.html), and in Thailand per 100,000 individ-uals (http: yywww.unaids.org yhivaidsinfo ydocuments.html). The median values from our estimates for the initial conditions forour analyses closely matched the reported data (predictedmedian estimate for Zimbabwe was 1,982 per 100,000, andpredicted median estimate for Thailand was 176 per 100,000). Predictions: Could a LAHV Eradicate Wild-Type HIV? All of our 1,000 predictions (for Thailand and Zimbabwe) gave the same result:the wild-type strain of HIV would be eradicated, and theprevalence of the vaccine strain would rise to an endemic steadystate. Hence, our results revealed that mass vaccination with aLAHV eventually would result in the replacement of the virulentpathogen (wild-type HIV) with the relatively avirulent pathogen(the LAHV strain). Further calculations revealed that at this newendemic steady state, the vaccine strain could be eradicatedsimply by stopping vaccination, because the basic reproductivenumber ( R 0V) of the LAHV strain (which is calculated from our model) is significantly less than one. Predictions: What Effect Would a LAHV Have on the Annual AIDS Death Rate? We then determined the time frame for eradication. Time-dependent uncertainty analysis of our model revealed thateradication of wild-type HIV would take several decades in bothcountries [Fig. 1 A(Zimbabwe) and Fig. 1 B(Thailand)]. The current annual AIDS death rate in Zimbabwe (Fig. 1 A)i s significantly higher than in Thailand (Fig. 1 B). However, in both countries AIDS deaths (due to infection with wild-type strainsof HIV) decreased quickly and dramatically because vaccinationcoverage level was high and the LAHVs were extremely effectivein blocking transmission [Fig. 1 A(Zimbabwe) and Fig. 1 B (Thailand)]. The annual AIDS death rate (due to the vaccine) inThailand and Zimbabwe reached the same endemic level [Fig.1C(Zimbabwe) and Fig. 1 D(Thailand)]. Our analyses revealed the epidemic-level consequences of both the efficacy (Fig. 1 Aand B) and the safety (Fig. 1 Cand D) effects of LAHVs. We then combined these efficacy and safety predictions to calculate whether the net effect (in terms ofthe total annual AIDS death rate) of vaccination with a LAHVwould be beneficial or detrimental. The total annual AIDS deathrate5AIDS deaths due to wild-type strains of HIV 1AIDS deaths that are vaccine-induced. The net effect of vaccination inZimbabwe was always very beneficial; the total annual AIDSdeath rate decreased substantially over time for all of the 1,000simulations (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, in Thailand the total annual AIDS death rate actually increased over time in the majority ofthe simulations (Fig. 2 B); thus the net effect of vaccination in this country was often detrimental. Determining the Impact of Vaccine Safety on the Total Annual AIDS Death Rate. We quantified the impact of vaccine safety (defined in terms of the percentage of vaccinated individuals who wouldprogress to AIDS as a result of the vaccine strain) on increasingthe total annual AIDS death rate. In Zimbabwe the total annualAIDS death rate decreased over time in all of the 1,000simulations; the predicted prevaccination (i.e., the current)annual AIDS death rates are shown by the dark blue data in Fig.3A. At any given time point after mass vaccination campaigns were begun, the total annual AIDS death rate decreased asvaccine safety increased; results are shown after 10 years (pinkdata), 50 years (yellow data), and 200 years (light blue data) ofvaccination in Fig. 3 A. In contrast, in Thailand after vaccination campaigns were begun the total annual AIDS death rate actuallyincreased over time in some of the simulations (Fig. 3 B); the predicted prevaccination (i.e., the current) annual AIDS deathrates are shown by the dark blue data in Fig. 3 B. Almost all of the 1,000 different LAHVs led to an initial increase in the totalannual AIDS death rate in Thailand, as can be seen from thepink data (which are predicted data after 10 years of vaccination)in Fig. 3 B. However, after several decades, some of the vaccines had increased (whereas others had decreased) the total annualAIDS death rate in Thailand; the outcome depended on vaccinesafety (Fig. 3 B). LAHVs have beneficial epidemic-level effects (by reducing transmission) and also detrimental effects (by causing vaccine-induced AIDS deaths). We used our predicted data to determinethe vaccine perversity point (VPP) for Thailand (Fig. 3 B); the VPP is a threshold defined in terms of the vaccine safety level.The VPP is defined (at any specified time) to be the vaccine-induced disease progression rate at which the beneficial epidem-ic-level effects caused by the vaccine equal the detrimentalepidemic-level effects caused by the vaccine; thus at the VPP thenet impact on the total annual AIDS death rate is zero. Almostall of the 1,000 different LAHVs led to an initial increase in thetotal annual AIDS death rate in Thailand, hence the VPP (at 10 Blower et al. PNAS uMarch 13, 2001 uvol. 98 uno. 6 u3621 POPULATION BIOLOGYyears) occurs at approximately 2% (which is the point at which the pink data cross the dark blue data in Fig. 3 B). At 50 years, the value of the VPP in Thailand is approximately 5% (i.e., avaccine-induced disease progression rate of 5% in 25 years); thisVPP (VPP 50) occurs at the point at which the yellow data cross the dark blue data in Fig. 3 B. LAHVs that had a faster vaccine-induced disease progression rate than the VPP 50caused more harm than good in Thailand (even 50 years later) as theyincreased the total annual AIDS death rate (Fig. 3 B). Con- versely, LAHVs that had a slower vaccine-induced diseaseprogression rate than the VPP 50caused more good than harm in Thailand as they decreased (after several decades) the totalannual AIDS death rate (Fig. 3 B). Mass vaccination with any LAHV that caused more than 5% of vaccinated individuals toprogress to AIDS in 25 years led to perversity (i.e., an increasein the annual AIDS death rate) in Thailand (Fig. 3 B), but not in Zimbabwe (Fig. 3 A). There is no VPP for Zimbabwe (at any time point) (Fig. 3 A), because all of the LAHVs that we ''tested'' in that country led to a decrease in the annual AIDS death rate(i.e., all of the predicted data for Zimbabwe, at every time point,lay below the dark blue data at time 0; Fig. 3 A). Discussion Our theoretical framework enables us to conduct a ''biological risk-benefit'' analysis for any particular LAHV for any specifiedHIV epidemic. We evaluated the potential epidemiologicalconsequences of 1,000 different LAHVs, where the vaccinesdiffered on the basis of efficacy and safety characteristics.Vaccination campaigns with exactly the same LAHVs may provebeneficial in one country (as we showed for Zimbabwe), butcould be detrimental in another (as we showed for Thailand).These results may seem paradoxical, because in both countrieswe used LAHVs that had exactly the same efficacy and safetycharacteristics. We obtained these apparently paradoxical re-sults, because the effectiveness of LAHVs (unlike the effective-ness of prophylactic non-LAHV) is determined not only by theefficacy and safety characteristics of the vaccine, but also by thetransmission rate. The transmission rate determines (for anygiven LAHV) the tradeoff between the vaccine's efficacy andsafety characteristics. Hence the transmission rate determineswhether the vaccine has a beneficial or a detrimental net impact(where net impact is defined in terms of the total annual AIDSdeath rate). In Zimbabwe the transmission rate is high, thus thebenefits of reducing transmission (i.e., high efficacy) outweighthe safety consequences. In Thailand the transmission rate isfairly low, thus the safety consequences can outweigh thebenefits of reducing transmission. Our results imply that athreshold transmission rate (TTR) exists. If the transmission rateis greater than the TTR, then the efficacy effect of a LAHVoutweighs the safety effect. Conversely, if the transmission rateis less than the TTR, then the safety effect outweighs the efficacyeffect. Our model can be used to determine the exact value ofthe TTR for any specified vaccine efficacy and safety level. Our results bring to light several issues that need to be considered regarding the utility of LAHVs as potential epidemiccontrol agents. First, our results indicate that LAHVs may onlybe useful for controlling HIV in countries where there are veryhigh transmission rates (i.e., where the transmission rate issignificantly greater than the TTR). Second, our results implythat if LAHVs are to be used then it will be necessary to decideon multiple goals for epidemic control strategies (44) rather thansimply to consider only eradication. For both Zimbabwe andThailand our analyses show that vaccination with a fairly effec-tive LAHV could lead to the eradication of wild-type HIV;however, on the way to eradication the total annual AIDS deathrate could increase in Thailand. It is obviously unacceptable toachieve eradication at the price of an increased AIDS death rate.Thus, our results suggest that it may be necessary (if LAHVs areto be used as epidemic control agents) to design fairly complex vaccination strategies that can achieve both eradication ofwild-type HIV and a significant reduction in the annual AIDSdeath rate. Optimal control theory could be used to design morecomplex vaccination strategies that can simultaneously attainmultiple goals. Such an approach would entail specifying anobjective function to maximize the benefits and minimize thecosts of vaccination. This methodology has been used previouslyfor designing optimal treatment strategies for HIV-infectedindividuals on chemotherapy (45). Third, our results imply thatit will be necessary to implement large-scale surveillance systemsto determine when wild-type strains of HIV have been eradi-cated; after wild-type HIV has been eradicated all of the AIDSdeaths would be the result of the vaccine strain. Our results also have important practical implications for vaccine design, and the implementation of phase III clinicaltrials. Our model can be used (as we have shown) to determinethe VPP for a LAHV used in any particular geographic region.Our results show that only LAHVs that induce almost no diseaseshould be considered for use, particularly in low incidence areas.It may be possible to develop a very safe LAHV, but it may onlybe possible at a cost to efficacy; increasing the attenuation ofvaccine strains (in the simian immunodeficiency virus model)tends to increase vaccine safety, but to decrease efficacy (3, 4, 7).We have quantified the extremely high safety standards thatmust be met before LAHV can be considered safe as epidemiccontrol agents. Very large numbers of participants will need tobe monitored for many years to determine whether such highlevels of vaccine safety have been attained in a phase III clinicaltrial. We have determined that the net effect of any LAHV isvery dependent on the transmission rate. Thus it will be neces-sary to conduct many phase III clinical trials of any candidateLAHV in a variety of geographic locations where there is a widevariety of transmission rates. Testing LAHVs could involveconducting many more phase III trials than the testing ofprophylactic non-LAHV. If phase III trials of LAHVs areconducted in only high transmission areas then these vaccinescould look very beneficial. However, if these vaccines were thenused to control epidemics where there is only moderate or lowtransmission then these vaccines could increase the severity ofthe epidemic. It appears unlikely that the HIV pandemic will be con- trolled\u2014particularly in Africa\u2014unless effective vaccines aredeveloped (36, 46). If prophylactic non-LAHV are used they willreduce transmission and produce only beneficial epidemic-leveleffects; perverse effects will only occur if risky behavior increases(15, 20). The effectiveness of high efficacy prophylactic non-LAHV can be assessed by evaluating our predictions for theannual AIDS death rate and considering only the efficacy effectsof LAHVs [Fig. 3 A(Zimbabwe) and Fig. 3 B(Thailand)]. These vaccines would eradicate HIV in both Thailand and Zimbabwewithout producing any perverse effects, unless risky behaviorincreased. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to develop suchvaccines. It is possible that LAHVs may be the most effectiveHIV vaccines that are developed. We have shown that LAHVs potentially could be very effec- tive as epidemic control agents, but that LAHVs should have anextremely low risk of causing AIDS in vaccinated individuals. Inaddition, there are several other safety concerns that need to beaddressed when considering LAHVs. For example, a LAHV maycause pathogenicity by recombining with a superinfectingwild-type strain. Our theoretical framework can be expanded toevaluate the consequences of these additional safety concerns.Clearly, there are many ethical issues that need to be debatedwhen considering LAHVs as epidemic control agents. We haveshown that while effective LAHVs could eradicate wild-typeHIV, these vaccines could also (in countries where the incidence 3622 uwww.pnas.org ycgiydoiy10.1073 ypnas.061029998 Blower et al.rate is low) increase the severity of the HIV epidemic. It is therefore possible that LAVHs may only be considered for usein developing countries (where incidence rates are high), but not in developed countries (where incidence rates are low). How-ever, any mass vaccination campaign based on LAVHs will needto be designed by considering the HIV pandemic rather thansimply a country-specific epidemic, because country-specificHIV epidemics are linked. Thus it appears likely that thediscussion of the development and the potential utility ofLAHVs for control of the HIV pandemic will become even morecontroversial.
