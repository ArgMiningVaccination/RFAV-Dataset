The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. John L. Mica (chair- man of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Mica, Barr, Mink, Cummings, Kucinich, Representatives Burton, Weldon, and present: Sharon Pinkerton, staff director, chief counsel; Jean Gosa, minority staffassistant. Mr. M ICA. Good morning. I would like to call this meeting of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Re-sources to order. This morning's hearing is entitled, Compensating Vaccine Inju- ries: Are Reforms Needed? I would like to start with an openingstatement, and then we will yield to other Members for the samepurpose. Today, our subcommittee will examine a program that is respon- sible for one of our Government 's most sensitive and difficult re- sponsibilities; the duty to compensate fairly, adequately, and effi-ciently those individuals who are injured or die as a consequenceof our universal vaccination policy. This policy is designed to protect us. Without a national vaccine policy, many illnesses, including measles, polio, diptheria, tetanus,and typhus, would endanger all of us especially our children. Re-search into hundreds of new vaccines, which range from loweringcholesterol to curing AIDS, is proceeding at a rapid pace. Our needfor new vaccines is an absolute certainty. This subcommittee recently held a hearing on the international AIDS epidemic and related drug treatments and prevention re-sponses. We learned that vaccine development represents the bestlong-term solution for preventing millions of AIDS-related deaths.I can assure you that people across the globe are anxiously await-ing an effective vaccine for that deadly illness. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov the many researchers and pharmaceutical companies for vaccine successes to date, and I wish them God speed in devel- oping new, safer, and more effective vaccines for the future. I alsocommend those who help to administer vaccines. They have strongsupport in Congress for accomplishing these critical missions. Earlier this year, our subcommittee examined adverse reactions that have been linked to the hepatitis B vaccine. Last month, ourfull committee examined anthrax vaccines and vaccination prac-tices. Today, we will focus on the workings of the HHS Vaccine In-jury Compensation Program that was designed to compensate thoseindividuals who are injured from certain vaccines that we routinelyadminister to our children. Despite the life-saving benefits of our national vaccine practices, we must not forget the cost of these benefits, particularly to thoseindividuals and families who regrettably experience tragic adversereactions. In simple terms, our vaccines now protect millions. How-ever, in some rare instances they cause serious harm, even death,to others. Today, we will examine how we compensate those who are harmed and consider how we might make the system we have es-tablished for this purpose, again, of compensating individuals, workeven better. The issue of compensating vaccine injuries is not a partisan issue. In 1984, my brother, Dan Mica, who was a Democrat Mem-ber of Congress, helped work with other Members of Congress increating an awareness for the need to compensate persons injuredfrom vaccines. Also a leading figure in helping to create compensa-tion for those who received injury was the ranking member of ourfull committee, Mr. Waxman. He was a key author of the vaccinecompensation legislation developed in the eighties. Our hearing today is devoted to examining the workings of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program administered byHHS. Is this program, which was established to be a no-fault com-pensation program, operating in a quick, easy and fair manner, aswas originally envisioned by Congress? Is the fund being adminis-tered as required under the law, ''with generosity, '' in keeping with the program's authorization language? In answering these questions, we will hear first-hand from wit- nesses who have had experience in the program dealing with inju-ries particularly to their children. We will also hear from attorneyswho represent the injured and from experts who provide medicaladvice at compensation hearings. Finally, we will discuss programissues with Government witnesses who administer the program. Recently, we have received many letters, calls, and visits from families of children injured after they were administered vaccines.We also have heard from practicing attorneys, medical profes-sionals, and associations with strong interests in this program. According to many, the current Compensation Program is not op- erating fairly or in the way Congress originally intended. I wantto learn more about these concerns and some of the problemsbrought to our attention from both sides and what should be doneto correct these problems. Today, we will hear that our national vaccine practices can have rare but sometimes brutal consequences for those who unfortu- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 no fault of their own, experience severe and sometimes even deadly adverse reactions. We will also examine theserious problems experienced by some who have sought compensa-tion, again, under this system that Congress created. Today, we will hear more about these concerns and recommenda- tions for our Compensation Program. Some issues that I hope willbe addressed today and which may require legislative changes in-clude some of the following: first, is the Compensation Program tooadversarial; are eligibility and standard of proof requirements toostrict; should we use the compensation fund for other purposes? To address the first question, why must injured families assume the role of petitioners and often go through a cumbersome adver-sarial and legal process to get final compensation determination?Legislative history indicates that Congress intended just the oppo-site. The process was intended to be informal and take no longerthan 240 days. Many cases now take years; in some cases, as longas 5, 6, even 9 years to reach a final determination. Why is this? Why must families hire specialist attorneys to proc- ess their claims? Why are attorneys declining in some cases to dealwith these cases? Why are attorney fees not being paid until some-times years afterwards? Families of the injured must now search for the few medical ex- perts who are willing to testify on their behalf. Should medical wit-nesses have their professional credibility challenged by skilled De-partment of Justice attorneys seeking to protect the Governmentcoffers? Must some families devote their life savings, incur hugedebt, and experience personal hardship while litigation drags on foryears? These problems may or may not be typical, but they do raisethe issue of whether reforms and safeguards are needed today. Other questions I hope we address in this hearing: Should the Department of Justice be reimbursed by injured families for costsof unsuccessful litigation in the Federal Circuit Court? Should theGovernment favor and facilitate mediation in place of litigation? Dowe, in fact, victimize again families that have already suffered ter-rible harm through what has turned into an adversarial process? I wish to learn more about this today from the Government, from the families, from their attorneys, and from the medical expertswho we have assembled as witnesses. The second concern I would like to address is whether eligibility and standard of proof requirements are too strict. Program partici-pants have told our subcommittee that the vaccine injury table, thekey to deciding claims, is unnecessarily restrictive. In fact, since1986, HHS has restricted coverage dramatically through changes tothe injury table. Were the changes always consistent with medicalresearch, and were they necessary? I realize that some will argue that the changes reflect sound science, which we all support. However, that the table was not de-signed to reflect only studies with conclusive proof of likely injurycases, conditions, or time requirements. The table also reflects com- pensation policy. I understand that judges in the Federal CircuitCourt have raised the issue in a pending case as to the constitu-tionality of giving the HHS Secretary authority to revise the injurytable. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 and HHS do if the court rules against HHS and the revised table? Will the court stop the program? What would happen to claims that were denied? I think there are many unan-swered questions here, and I hope that we can learn about someof these problems and solutions from our witnesses. In summary, I think some very serious programmatic and legal issues have been raised that need to be resolved. A key issue is theinjury table. Congress designed the original injury table with sortof a cushion that included injuries where the science was unclear.Although some research has occurred since then, much uncertaintyremains as to the causes of many childhood illnesses. Families and others have expressed skepticism about relying on a rigid chart that has been significantly tightened by HHS. Per-haps the criteria and the spirit of the original table should be pre-served. Considering the incompleteness of vaccine injury research,I can understand their concerns. Also, the standard of proof requirements may need to be reexam- ined. For example, a claimant 's burden might be one of simply demonstrating that the vaccine was related to the injury. The De-partment of Justice could be required to show by clear and convinc-ing evidence that the injury resulted from something else in orderto defeat the claim. These are types of simple changes that should be explored to en- sure fairness under circumstances where everyone agrees thescience is incomplete and regretfully will remain incomplete formany years to come. We must all recognize that the standards ofproof that are applied in compensation determinations are legal innature and not scientific. Finally, I realize that the Federal Government has other benefit programs, such as those for veterans and law enforcement officials,which provide that the benefit of the doubt goes to the injured inresolving benefit claims. Why does this program provide no benefitof the doubt for injured children? The third aspect I would like to address is whether we should be using the compensation fund for other purposes. Recent propos-als call for using the injury compensation fund for other purposes,including research and administrative expenses. While hundreds ofpotential vaccines are being developed and concerns have beenraised about restrictions in the injury table, it does not seem to methat it is now the time to reduce the vaccine tax or to raid the trustfund. The current tax of 75 cents per dose is not exorbitant, andthe cushion in the fund may only be temporary. Who can accurately predict what new vaccines and groups of in- jured persons will need to be covered in the future? I urge cautionbefore using the trust moneys to fund immediate or less compellingneeds. If the fund continues to grow over time, we might considerchanges. In terms of vaccine tax reduction, I think we should first consider redirecting or eliminating that portion of the vaccine tax, 25 per-cent, that goes into the general fund. Then we might consider useof moneys in the trust fund. Finally, there is the issue of a possible conflict that exists in hav- ing the Compensation Program as part of HHS. HHS conducts andencourages vaccine research and promotes vaccination policies and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov of possible conflicts increase when considering the Advisory Commission that oversees the Compensation Pro-gram. Should the commission use HHS staff? Should HHS overridecommission recommendations? I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on these and other issues. I extend my sincere thanks to those who have trav-eled long distances at great personal sacrifice to be with us andprovide testimony. We sincerely appreciate your willingness toshare your thoughts, your concerns and your recommendations onthese important issues. [The prepared statement of Hon. John L. follows:] VerDate Now I am pleased to yield \u2014Mrs. Mink, did you want me to yield to Mr. Waxman? Mrs. M INK. Yes. Mr. M ICA. Mr. Waxman, and I know he has another engagement. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank Mrs. Mink for allowing me to go forward first with my opening statement. Unfortunately, I have a conflict. There is an-other committee meeting at this very same time, so I am going tobe bouncing back and forth. But I did want to be here for the beginning of this hearing to ex- press some of my thoughts. And I, first of all, want to thank you,Mr. Chairman, because it is important for Congress to exercise itsoversight responsibilities by evaluating programs to see whatchanges are needed to improve these programs. I have a special concern about this issue, because I was the au- thor of the Vaccine Compensation Program in 1986. We enactedthis legislation because people were faced with only one alternativeand that was to go into court, a very tough alternative. It wasclearly adversarial to try to establish sufficient evidence in orderto get compensation and then to establish the damages for com-pensation. It struck us as an inefficient way to compensate peoplewho deserve to be compensated. The idea was to have a fair and timely, no-fault alternative to litigation for individuals who suffer vaccine-related injuries. Theprogram is charged with using the best available science in devel-oping the table of compensable vaccine injuries, and it was in-tended to rely on the advice of an Advisory Commission on Child-hood Vaccines that was to bring together all the people who havea stake in the system working effectively. There were three key reasons for creating the Compensation Pro- gram. These reasons are a good measure of whether it is workingas intended. First, we wanted to compensate children who were in-jured by vaccines, which society felt were essential to public health.Second, we wanted to give parents confidence that if their childwere to be injured by a vaccine, there would be predictable andgenerous compensation. In the absence of such assurance, immuni-zation rates, we felt, were sure to fall. And, finally, we wanted toprevent manufacturers from abandoning research into safer vac-cines, which is what they did in the 1980 's when the number of such companies dropped from 20 to just 3. Now, we as a society want immunizations to be available. We want companies to manufacture these products and to continue toresearch how to make these products safer. We thought that withthis vaccine compensation system, we would be providing that in-centive. I know there had been a long-standing debate over the timeliness of the program and about the scientific proof underlying vaccine in-juries listed on the vaccine injury table. We tried to strike an im-portant balance that we thought should have been respected. Vic- tims of vaccine-related injuries are to be compensated. Any lawyeror plaintiff will tell you that the process is less adversarial thanlitigation, and the CDC reports that immunization rates are at arecord high. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 clear this program isn 't working perfectly. Congress has acted twice to change the program, to make it more no-fault and less adversarial. The administration recently forwarded rec-ommendations for procedural reforms, which I look forward to mov-ing ahead with legislatively. And today 's hearing will be helpful in giving us further guidance as to changes that we need to make thesystem work as we intended. There have been disputes about the science and epidemiology of vaccine injury. We have always erred on the side of compensatingchildren, if there was a scientific argument that injuries were vac-cine related. At least that was always our intent \u2014to err on the side of making sure that we compensated people who were injured. We have tried to rely on the best available scientific evidence when revising the vaccine injury table. Injuries have been added,and injuries have been removed from that table. But in 13 years,it has never been Congress ' rule to second-guess the scientists. It would be a disservice to the public health if we were to start to dothat today. At every hearing held this year concerning vaccines, I have made the point of emphasizing the tremendous public health value of im-munizations. More Americans have been saved by vaccines than byany other medical intervention. Across the globe, 2 12million chil- dren die every year from childhood diseases. Another 750,000 arecrippled by these diseases. But American children are shieldedfrom this death and misery by vaccinations. I mention these terrible statistics because I know no one on this committee would want to discourage American parents from immu-nizing their children. But we want to be sure that when there arerare injuries, we want those children to be compensated. That iswhy we enacted the Childhood Vaccination Compensation Program.It was supposed to be a no-fault, less adversarial, more efficientway of compensating people so that we wouldn't push these casesinto the courts. But we left the door open for people to go to court, because we didn't want them to be precluded from the opportunity to presenttheir case in a court, if the compensation system was not working.I want us to see whether we have accomplished these goals, dowhat we need to change the system so that we make it fair to ev-erybody involved. It is important that the system work. A childwho is hurt should be compensated. The parents of that child whogo into that system shouldn't be faced with all the barriers thatthey have in a court system. I have a strong feeling about this com-pensation system, and I am hopeful that we can be sure throughour oversight that the program is living up to its objectives. I am going to be able to review the record. Some of you will no- tice that very few Members are here, but the record is important,and will be available for all of our colleagues and everyone else toevaluate. I will look forward to reviewing the record, if I am nothere to receive the testimony so that the totality of the record will give us guidance as to how to accomplish our important goals forthis program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the hearing, and I yield back the balance of my time. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov ICA. Thank the ranking member of the full committee for his testimony\u2014actually, for his opening statement, for his leader- ship on the issue, and authorship of this Compensation Program. I am now pleased to recognize the chairman of our full Commit- tee on Government Reform, the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Bur- ton. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You can call this my opening statement and my testimony. I am pleased that you are holding this hearing today on the Vac- cine Injury Compensation Program. As part of our ongoing inves-tigation coming out of both this subcommittee and Mr. Shay 's sub- committee, and the issues the full committee uncovered, there ismuch to be concerned about within the Vaccine Program. No one is suggesting that we do away with vaccines to protect the public at large. However, we also have a responsibility to pro-tect individuals and their families as well. One way of doing thatwill be to conduct good research in looking at ways to minimize ad-verse events with vaccines and to develop safer vaccines and to in-form parents of small children of possible risks due to side effects. Now, the chairman said there are rare side effects, and I may be the exception to the rule, but my granddaughter got a hepatitis Bshot and within 6 hours she was in the hospital, about to quitbreathing, she turned blue, and she was dying \u2014within 6 hours. My grandson, the only other grandchild I have, had five shots in 1 day. He had been perfectly normal up to the time he was receiv-ing these shots, and now he is autistic. Two out of two \u2014rare? We had a man testify before the full committee from Oklahoma University who said that 50 percent \u2014he is a scientist, doctor \u2014said that 50 percent of the kids that got the DPT shot had some sideeffects\u201450 percent. Rare? Were the parents informed about that? Was my daughter informed about it? For either of her children? Dochildren really need the hepatitis B shot between the time they areborn and 5 years old when hepatitis B can only be communicatedthrough blood, sex, or the mother being infected with it? Congress as a way of providing compensation \u2014and I want to tell you, we are going to dig into this \u2014the subcommittee or the full committee\u2014until heck won't have it. I mean, I am telling you, parents and grandparents, and every- body else ought to know the risks of these vaccines. Granted, theyhelp everybody. They help the society. They have kept our inci-dence of major epidemics down to almost zero. But parents stillhave the right to know the possible side effects of these vaccines,and it is criminal not to let them know. They should have all theinformation. Lincoln said, ''Let the people know the facts, and the country will be safe. '' Well, the same thing applies to medicine. Congress, as a way of providing compensation, enacted the Na- tional Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, subtitle 2 of title 21of the Public Health Service Act, on October 1, 1988. The Com-pensation Program is administered jointly by the Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, and theDepartment of Justice. It was designed as a Federal no-fault sys-tem designed to compensate those individuals or families of indi-viduals who have been injured by childhood vaccines. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov me just tell you a little bit about our family, these two grandchildren of mine. Do you know we can 't find an attorney to take on this responsibility? This is supposed to be a no-fault sys- tem. The chairman of this committee 's grandkids are going to have to fight in court to get compensation in a no-fault system. Baloney!And I want to find out if the pharmaceutical companies are behindany of this. And unfortunately we are hearing heartwrenching stories, too many to discount, that indicate that this no-fault system has be-come emotionally and financially devastating for families. My staffreceived a letter just yesterday from a woman whose child diedfrom the vaccine, and the attorney from the Government grilled heron everything from how many compressions she gave her daughterwhen trying to resuscitate her to what her educational level was.No fault? Her daughter 's death certificate stated the death was due to recent DPT and HB vaccines, and she was grilled and grilledand grilled. Why? No fault? Why must a parent be subjected to grilling by government law- yers who are oftentimes cruel in their questioning, especially whenthe evidence from the experts clearly states the death is related toa vaccine? This type of behavior from Government lawyers muststop, and we intend to make sure it does stop, if I have to bringeverybody from HHS, FDA, and everybody else up here every day.That has to stop, and the people that are in charge of these pro-grams, that has to stop. If there is a legitimate reason for those people to be com- pensated, they shouldn 't have to go through this. Losing the child \u2014 this woman losing this child is enough pain for her. Or seeing yourchild in an incapacitated state, that is enough pain for them. Theydon't need to fight this thing out three or four times in court. The Department tells us that it typically takes 2 years for a fam- ily to go through the Compensation Program. However, we arehearing from lawyers and families that the process is often muchlonger\u20144 years, 4 years or more for many, and the Department sometimes even suggests to families that they just give up theircase. No fault? No fault? This type of attitude is deplorable! Howmuch money is in that program \u2014$1.4 billion, one thousand four hundred million dollars. As I stated at our August 3 hearing, the committee will continue investigating the various facets of the Vaccine Program, includingthe Compensation Program until we can be confident that, one,vaccines are safe and effective; two, that there is adequate researchin the long-term safety and the interaction between vaccines; three,that all ingredients and fillers in vaccines are safe; four, that fami-lies and their attorneys are adequately compensated in a timelyfashion; and, five, that the Government is not keeping familiesfrom being compensated for injuries and death related to vaccinesthrough administrative changes, through bureaucratic red tape, orthrough bullying, and, finally, that families are informed of thepossible side effects and the risks. And I also want to find out if people at HHS, FDA, or any of the other Federal health institutes are getting honorariums, free trav-el, or any other kind of compensation, directly or indirectly, frompharmaceutical companies that have a vested interest in these VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov on the market. And to that end, we have already asked for all the records from the various people in these agenciesto check those out. Parents should have confidence in their Government and their health agencies, and they shouldn 't have to fight when their kids are injured by vaccines. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. M ICA. Thank the chairman of our full committee for his opening statement and also personal testimony. I would like to recognize now the ranking member of our sub- committee, the gentlelady from Hawaii, Mrs. Mink. Mrs. M INK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you for hold- ing today's hearing on the National Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram. And I concur with the statement just made by the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Burton. I think that there are some seriousproblems in the program and in the way that it is being adminis-tered, and I concur that this committee should undertake an exten-sive examination of the problems. As the ranking member of this subcommittee, I receive a number of letters from all across the country suggesting the difficulties thatpeople are encountering. Notwithstanding the fact that the as-sumption was that it was to be a no-fault system of compensation,many of the families affected by the immunization problems havehad enormous difficulty in receiving their due process. The Congress has attempted to make various amendments to the law designed to make it less adversarial, but obviously we have notgone far enough. Mr. Chairman, in 1991, one of my constituents filed a claim with the program on behalf of her deceased spouse who had died of polioshortly after receiving the Salk oral polio vaccine. The courts ruledagainst her; she filed an appeal; the court rejected the appeal, be-cause the attorney failed to list objections justifying the appeal.The court did not allow the attorney to amend the appeal or grantan extension to conform with this technical objection. The case wasdismissed, and the final irony, Mr. Chairman, is that the petitionerreceived no compensation for the death of her husband yet the Gov-ernment paid her attorneys fees. Mr. Chairman, when we established this program, we envisioned a system in which citizens would be able to file claims without as-sistance from attorneys. It does not appear that this is the systemthat we currently have. Virtually all petitioners feel the need to getlegal counsel, because the system is so complicated, and the de-mand for proof and connection between the injury and the vaccina-tion is so immense that the program has been moved into, again,a very adversarial one, far greater than what the Congress in-tended. There are several reform proposals that I believe we should ex- amine. The statute of limitations, for one. Adding specific injuriesto the table as medical evidence shows that there is a causal linkto the vaccine, and that ought to be extended. Allowing compensa-tion for the cost of setting up a guardianship for an injured child,and counseling of the families ought to be included as part of thecompensation. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 caution against proposals to slash the tax rate on the vaccines. This is a program that is, I think, well grounded, and the fact that there is a surplus in the trust fund I do not believe indi-cates the lack of necessity for the tax that is currently invoked;rather, it is because of the very stringent, conservative manner inwhich these cases are processed that the trust balance has nowgrown to over $1 billion. So, I would hope that the hearings that we shall be conducting in the subcommittee as well as the full committee will underscorethe importance of this program, the necessity of rendering it intoa true no-fault process, and granting these individuals not only thenotice that the chairman of the full committee insists is appro-priate but also the compassion and considerate handling of thesecases once they have come to the Government 's attention. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.[The prepared statement of Hon. Patsy T. Mink follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Thank the gentlelady. Now I'd like to recognize Mr. Barr. Did you have an opening statement? All right. And we have also been joined by another of our colleagues, Dr. Weldon, the gentleman from Florida. Did you have a comment or opening statement? Dr. W ELDON . Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for recognizing me. I believe the people who have preceded me have very elo-quently explored all the issues that we are needing to deal withhere. I just want to thank you for extending an invitation to allow me to be here as part of this hearing and, as well, the ranking memberfor concurring. And I am very pleased to see that a bipartisan con-sensus is drawing to the same conclusion that I have that we needto make changes in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program;that it is not working the way its authors intended it to work, and,therefore, your timing on this hearing is very critical. And I yield back. Thank you.Mr. M ICA. I thank the gentleman, and we will have additional statements added to the record, without objection. We will now proceed with our first panel, and I would like to call forward those witnesses. The first panel consists of Michele Clements who is a petitioner and mother of an injured child from Milwaukee, WI. The secondpanelist is Linda Mulhauser, and she is also a petitioner and moth-er of an injured child, and she is from New York City, NY. And ourthird panelist is Mr. John Salamone, president of Informed ParentsAgainst VAPP. We have those three witnesses. This is an investigations panel and oversight subcommittee of Congress. We do swear in our witnesses, so if you would remainstanding, raise your right hands. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. M ICA. Thank you. Witnesses answered in the affirmative, and I think these three panelists can give us some insight as totheir personal experience with the compensation fund. I might saythat we try to limit each of our oral witness testimonies to 5 min-utes. If you have additional lengthy statements or other docu-mentation you would like to have included as part of the record,I would be glad to do that by unanimous consent.I21We do havea request from Michele Clements, our first panelist, for presen-tation of I think approximately a 1-minute video. Is that correct? Ms. C LEMENTS . Correct. Mr. M ICA. Without objection, we will also allow introduction of that video. I would, with those comments, then, like to recognize Michele Clements, our first panelist. STATEMENTS OF MICHELE CLEMENTS, PETITIONER AND MOTHER OF INJURED CHILD, MILWAUKEE, WI; LINDA MULHAUSER, PETITIONER AND MOTHER OF INJURED CHILD, NEW YORK, NY; AND JOHN SALAMONE, PRESIDENT,INFORMED PARENTS AGAINST VAPP Ms. C LEMENTS . Thank you, Chairman Mica and \u2014\u2014 Mr. M ICA. Did you want to show that first? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Yes. Mr. M ICA. OK. Then we will just go ahead and show that video. [Video.] Ms. C LEMENTS . I don't hear the sound to it. Basically, this is the beginning of Andrew 's day and starting out with his medicines, his feeds, and things like that. And I think all we are going to see isthe starting of his feeds. [Video.]Ms. C LEMENTS . I do this on average maybe \u2014not maybe, but four times a day, but I also give him medications the same way \u2014 through his stomach. So, on average it is about eight times a dayI have to feed him or medicate him through his stomach. Mr. M ICA. If you could proceed with your testimony. Ms. C LEMENTS . OK, thank you. Mr. M ICA. And you might pull that mic as close as you can so we can hear you. Thank you. Ms. C LEMENTS . OK. Once again, I want to thank you, Chairman Mica and the members of the committee, for allowing me to sharemy son's life and my life as to what happened after he was vac-cinated. The day I found out that I was pregnant was a great joy. We couldn't wait for his entry into this world. It took us 3 months topick his name, because it was something we wanted him to beproud of throughout his life. Strong, kingly and manly is the mean-ing of his name. On January 31, 1992, he entered this world ahealthy, beautiful baby boy. We wanted the best for him as we didfor our other son, Michael. We don't allow smoking, drinking or drugs in our home, because we want a safe and healthy environment for our children. We tookour sons to the doctor for their well care checkups as scheduled andvaccinated them, because it was the best way to protect them fromlife threatening illnesses. We didn 't know about all the adverse re- actions that can come with vaccinating our children. On August 6, 1992, we were thrown into a world that many ex- perience but few know little about: the horror of what the DPT vac-cine can do to some children. My husband, Scott took 7 month old Drew in for his checkup and the third DPT shot. I asked my husband to make sure the doctorgave Drew a check-up to see that all was well with him before hegot his shots. I called Scott from work after the doctor 's appoint- ment to find out how Drew was doing. My husband explained thatDrew had been sleeping since his shots and I thought, good, be-cause after Drew 's second DPT shot he had cried for a very long time. When I got home from work, Scott told me that Drew had been sleeping most of the day and was still sleeping. Scott went to workand I woke up Drew so he could eat, but he went back to sleepagain. When Scott got home from work later that night, he waspassing our boys ' room when he heard a strange, rasping sound coming from the room. He checked on Mike, who was fine, andthen realized that the sound must have come from Andrew 's crib. When he got to Andrew 's crib, he had the shock of his life. Our little boy wasn't breathing and he was as pale as a China doll.Scott yelled for me to come and asked me, ''What is this?'' All I saw VerDate 11-MAY-2000 baby laying in his father 's arms as limp as a rag doll and as white as a China doll. I ran downstairs and grabbed the phone and dialed 911, but I was in such shock that I forgot my addressand street name. Scott followed me and handed me Andrew, and I realized for the first time that my baby wasn 't breathing. I did CPR on him, and after the second breath I gave him, he took in a deep breath him-self. The color came back into him and he appeared to be sleeping. The fire department came. Half of the men worked on Drew while the other half followed me to the boys ' room. I showed them Andrew's crib and the puddle of fluids we found him lying in. Onefire fighter told us that he believed that Drew had had a convul-sion. He said Drew was very warm and asked for some ice bags tocool him down. They told us Andrew would have to go to the hos-pital. Andrew was transported to the hospital in an ambulance, and by the time he got to the hospital, he was in the middle of anotherviolent convulsion that was so bad they wouldn 't let me in the room with him. Finally he stopped convulsing and the doctors explainedthat this may be the only time he convulses, and it may never hap-pen again. One month later, he was crawling on the floor when all of a sud- den he collapsed and began to jerk his arms and legs while hishead went backward and his neck stiffened. I grabbed him and toldScott to call 911, and at the hospital they explained to us againthat sometimes children have seizures and they grow out of them. Between the ages of 6 months and 3 12years old, Andrew had 84 seizures, the shortest being 15 minutes and the longest being 112 hours. Almost always, Andrew would run an unexplained feverwith the seizures even though he wasn 't sick. One doctor told me the fevers he ran with his seizures was because his body 's thermo- stat had been damaged, and his body could not regulate his tem-perature like it should. Still, with all those seizures, the miracle was that Andrew learned to walk and talk. At 3, he could count up to 20; he knewhis colors and shapes. We learned to live with his seizures eventhough we always lived in fear that 1 day he would have a reallylong seizure that would damage our bright, loving, intelligent littleboy. On the night of September 8, 1995, our worst nightmare came to life when Andrew went into a seizure that lasted 4 12hours. Standing by helplessly as our son seized for 412hours while his temperature climbed to 108.8 degrees is an experience no parentshould ever have to go through. When Andrew finally stopped seiz-ing, we were allowed to see him in the ICU. To our horror, we sawa child double the size he was when he came into the hospital.When we asked what happened, they took us out of his room. At7 a.m., a doctor told us that Andrew 's kidneys and liver were fail- ing. When we finally got to see our son again, he looked like another child. We couldn 't hold him, because he had a dozen tubes hanging off of him. A special bed rotated his body, keeping his body at one temperature and massaging him all at the same time. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov we were told by the doctor \u2014and I will never forget those words\u2014we were told: ''Your son is dying, and so that you un- derstand what I am saying, he will die before 12 p.m. If you wantto see him alive, you better call anyone who wants to see him now.Here is a phone you can use. Are you OK? Mrs. Clements, are youall right?'' Not knowing what to say, I said ''No, not my baby '' over and over again. ''He didn't go through 84 seizures to die. God has a great use for his life. He didn 't bring him through all these seizures to die now.'' Every organ in Andrew 's body was damaged and was functioning at only 10 percent. Andrew didn 't die that day as the doctors said he would. By the grace of God, he hung on to life. On September11, Andrew slipped into a coma. Andrew was in the hospital for 4 months while we waited for him to come out of his coma. During that time, I called our lawyer,Victor Harding, to tell him what had happened. Mr. Harding wasrepresenting Andrew in the U.S. Court of Claims which hears vac-cine injury compensation cases, and he told us that the Govern-ment had offered us $350,000 to take care of Andrew. All I could think of was how unfair it was. My son is fighting for his life. He may die, and if he lives, we don 't know what kind of condition he will be in. And the Government is telling us that allAndrew is worth, if he lives, is $350,000. That amount isn 't going to begin to be enough to care for a severely brain injured child forthe rest of his life. I told our lawyer, ''You can tell those Govern- ment lawyers where they can file that offer. '' As you can see, Andrew did live. He fought bravely to live. An- drew is a hero, and now it is my job as his mother to fight for himto have the best kind of life that I can give him. Andrew can't walk or talk; he can 't eat or drink; he has to be fed through a tube in his stomach. Sometimes we give him tiny tastesof food. I will put a drop of apple sauce or pudding on the tip ofmy finger and put it on his tongue, but it can 't be too much or he could choke because he can 't swallow properly. His body is 7 years old but his brain is that of a 3-month old. I was a good parent. I did what the Government and doctors told me to do, and I gave my son the DPT vaccine. And now he is crip-pled. His life has been sacrificed, and instead of being treated kind-ly and fairly by the Government 's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, we have been treated unkindly and unfairly. You may be wondering how we found out about the Vaccine Com- pensation Program. It wasn 't from anyone in the medical field. We found out from a stranger who had heard about what happened toDrew. Her son died from the DPT vaccine. She referred us to alawyer and sent us information about the DPT vaccine. Reading the information, I felt like I had just been transported into another world, a world that I didn 't believe could exist in our country where the Government keeps such information from us that could help us protect our children from becoming retarded. Ididn't know that when Andrew screamed for hours after his secondDPT shot at 4 months that it was a warning sign that shot mightnot be good for him. I didn 't know that in 1992 there was a safer VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov DtaP vaccine that causes fewer reactions. I wish Andrew had a chance to get the DtaP vaccine instead of the DPT. When we met with our lawyer, Victor Harding, he told us about applying for the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and whatto expect from the Government. He said that a lot of children likeDrew are denied compensation or offered so little money that itwouldn't be enough to take care of him for the rest of his life. LikeI said earlier, when my son was on what we thought was his deathbed, the Government offered us $350,000. We turned it down andproceeded to the next step. We had to fly to Washington, DC, for our compensation claim hearing in the winter of 1998. My stomach was full of butterflieswhen I gave my testimony about what happened to Andrew on thenight of August 6, 1992. I stayed for 5 hours of the 10 hour hearingand then went back home to care for my son. My lawyer was therefor the second half of the hearing on the following day. In the end, the Government turned Andrew down for compensa- tion. There would be no money to help us care for our son. TheSpecial Master told us that if we had applied for compensation ayear earlier, she would have found in our favor but because of thetable change, there was nothing she could do but find in favor ofthe Government. That angered me, and it still does anger me that this table can be changed by the Government after Congress put the table in thelaw to help children like Andrew get compensation. That tablechange sure wasn 't for the betterment of the families who go through horrific life changes due to vaccine injuries. The Govern-ment forces us to give our children these vaccines and then whensomething goes wrong, too bad, you are on your own. The Special Master told us to appeal, but where is the logic in doing that if the rules are still the same? We will take our chanceswith the vaccine manufacturer in court. Because if we don 't, what is going to happen to Andrew? The doctors told us Andrew could live to be 25 or even 40 years old. We want to care for him as long as we can. We don 't want him to be put into an institution where they won 't do for him like we can do for him. To care for him the right way, our home needs tobe wheelchair accessible, and we need a lift to get him into a van,and we need to be able to afford to buy all the medications andsupplies he needs after he turns 18 years old. We just want enoughmoney to care for him the right way, because no amount of moneycould ever really compensate Andrew or us for what the DPT shottook from him. Once again, thank you for listening to what has happened to my son and our family, and God bless you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Clements follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 ICA. Thank you for your testimony, and I would like to now recognize Linda Mulhauser, who is a petitioner and mother of an injured child from New York. Mrs. Mulhauser, you are recognized.Ms. M ULHAUSER . Thank you. My son Stephen is sitting in front of me so that he can do as much lip reading as possible, and I am wearing an FM microphoneto help elevate my voice for him. The interpreter was not availablefor today's meeting. Chairman Mica and members of the Government Reform Com- mittee, thank you for your invitation to appear at today 's hearing to tell of our family 's experience with the Vaccine Injury Com- pensation Program. Our son, Stephen, now 17 years old, was seriously and perma- nently injured by a DPT vaccination at 3 12months of age. Born healthy and full-term by natural childbirth, Stephen received thehighest Apgar score ratings of 9 and 10. At 7 weeks of age, Stephenreceived his first DPT vaccine. We were reassured by his pediatri-cian that the swelling at the injectionsite, among other changes wenoted, was only a mild reaction and of no concern. Following the pediatrician 's advice that the benefits outweighed the risks, Stephen was given and reacted severely to his secondDPT shot with over 9 hours of high-pitched screaming and highfever. During the next couple of days, Stephen 's eyes began wandering independently of each other and then spasm. He could no longerroll over or reach out to play with his crib gym, because his handswere fisted and held at his shoulders. Over our concern, Stephen was then given his third dose of DPT vaccine in half doses at 5 12and 612months of age. His pediatri- cian said that he must have this vaccine in order to attend school. We later discovered during our compensation hearing that from the day of the second shot in 1982, Stephen showed failure tothrive as his charted growth plummeted. Stephen 's brain had all but stopped growing during the time period he was receiving hisDPT vaccines. He remains affected with fine motor and gross motordifficulties, posturing, language-based learning disabilities, visualperception issues, behavioral problems, and profound bilateralhearing loss. He requires special schooling, assistance with simpledaily living skills, constant adult supervision, and numerous thera-pies. Having your child injured by a vaccine that is supposed to pro- tect him is devastating. Our experience of going through the com-pensation system only added insult to that injury. After 5 years ofpreparation for a civil suit through depositions, ready for trial, ourattorneys informed us that they had become obligated to advise usto put a stay on our case and apply for Government compensationprior to a 1990 deadline date. It was supposed to be a simple andexpedient process, taking about 18 months, with decisions to bemade by special masters without a trial. We were advised that wecould go back to the lawsuit if the desired outcome was notreached. Nine months later, we had our hearing in a New York Federal courtroom, requiring preparation and giving of testimony, including VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov Expert witnesses were called for both sides. Two months later, the special master determined that Stephen wasin fact injured by the DPT vaccine, as described within the guide-lines of the vaccine injury table. Although we considered this first step of the process to have been timely and professionally managed, it seemed only to lack a juryto be a traditional court trial. The next step of the process was to determine an amount of money to be compensated. We already had a life care plan in place,because we were ready to go to trial before entering the Compensa-tion Program. Instead of working with us to determine Stephen 's appropriate life care needs, the Department of Justice 's attorneys sought for years to trivialize the extent of Stephen 's vaccine inju- ries and to argue for irresponsibly insufficient funds to support areasonable quality of life. After 4 years of such negotiations, we needed to request another hearing to come to settlement requiring further testimony fromourselves and Stephen 's life care planner. It was determined on the spot by the chief special master that the life care plan the DOJ 's attorney and life care planner submitted was indeed unrealisticand ordered specific actions to be completed within 2 months. This hearing in and of itself, again, was handled professionally. However, 2 months turned into 4 before an agreement was signed.Further delays ensued to correct a significant math error relativeto the initial payment. The agreement was then filed at the end ofthe 90-day filing period. The stipulation then required that we be-come legal guardians of our own child, causing further delay beforeany checks would be issued by the annuity company. From the time we applied to the Vaccine Injury Compensation System to the time we were finally able to access the funds, 6 12 years had gone by. Our savings disappeared as we paid for thera-pies not covered by our insurance, hearing aids, and special school-ing, among other extraordinary expenses. Under the guidelines ofthe program, families are not reimbursed for any past expenses. We were very fortunate in that the law firm who represented us continued to fight on Stephen 's behalf far beyond any financial gain. In fact, the single payment of $30,000 allocated for attorney 's fees in pre-1988 cases only covered the expenses incurred in prepa-ration of our two hearings. The law firm itself received nothing forits efforts of representing Stephen over a 10-year period. Our attorney has described the hearing process as a ''full-out li- ability case.'' Once our case was won, he then had an item-by-item fight to obtain even the smallest of needs on Stephen 's life care plan. Concessions were only made on small items. Much time wasspent by the DOJ attorney forcing the discussion of petty matters,such as whether Stephen would benefit from the use of a $10 spe-cial needs doorknob \u2014one was allowed throughout his lifetime \u2014 rather than getting down to serious matters dealing with the qual-ity of Stephen's future. Deadlines were often extended. In our view, the recommendations of the DOJ attorney and Gov- ernment life care planner assigned to our case were unrealistic andirresponsible. For example, to determine the value of residentialcare, they specified a residential center only in its planning stagesor a charitable group home with no day services and a wait list of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov We were given a ''take it or leave it '' final offer, which still did not adequately address Stephen 's needs. This prompted our request for the second hearing, which took place 10 months later. We entered into negotiations for Stephen 's life care with the be- lief that, unable to support himself, his needs would be met, andhis future would be sufficiently secure so that he could live as inde-pendent and normal a life as possible. We were mistaken. Our ex-perience was a totally exhausting and extremely adversarial proc-ess of nickel and dime arguments. On the Government 's behalf, every effort was made by the DOJ attorney to hold on to as much of the fund as possible. This in-cluded an attempt to establish a reversionary trust requiring anymoneys not spent during the course of each year to be returned tothe Government. Such practices place at risk the future care andsecurity of every vaccine-injured child. The DOJ attorney continued to act as if he was still fighting a case, attempting to minimize the award which he had previouslyfought to avoid. This conflict of interest deadlocked negotiationsand added years to resolving our settlement. After a decision isgiven that a child should be compensated, DOJ attorneys shouldstep aside and allow others with input from life care planners andfamilies to determine the projected needs of the individual through-out the balance of their lifetime. As compensation is not retroactive to the date of the decision, each additional year of bargaining is 1 less year to be compensated.This places further undue hardship on already emotionally and fi-nancially strained families. Our perception is that the program re-lies on this tactic to force families and their attorneys to accept lessthan adequate settlements, which would provide optimal treat-ments for their vaccine-injured child. Once the determination hasbeen made that an adverse reaction was incurred, both sidesshould be working together in the best interest of the child. The all out effort, time, and expense required to successfully ne- gotiate the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program prompted ourmajor law firm to never accept another vaccine injury case. We are further concerned that life care plans used to determine settlement amounts are forwarded to annuity or trust companieswith the stipulation labels remaining. In our experience, copies ofthe life care plan have also been requested by courts and banks.A child's needs will inevitably vary. Type or frequency of therapiescan and do change. New treatments become available. Labels re-maining on life care plans used to determine payment schedulesleave open a real risk that at any time someone might withholdfunds if moneys aren 't spent specifically as tagged. We are ex- tremely uncomfortable that an individual as far removed as a bankclerk can potentially have a say over Stephen 's care, because a treatment is not listed on his life care plan. Every family who has gone through this system faces the same threat to their child 's welfare. Might I suggest that such labels be removed in the future before sending out the plan and that a letterbe issued to clarify the ability of legal guardians to utilize fundsin the most appropriate manner for the injured individual in theircare. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 we did everything in our power to provide the love, nurturing, and care to ensure a bright future for our first-born child, a life full of dreams and promise. Part of that care was toprotect him from harm and life-threatening diseases. We believedwe were protecting our son when we took him for his baby shots.Instead, his life and ours have been changed forever. Each day is a challenge, and we try to meet that challenge to make things a little better. My hope is that by our presence here,today's challenge will make things better for the many families ofvaccine-injured children who are in or who are attempting to enterinto the Vaccine Injury Compensation System, and for those whohave been rejected by the system following changes to the vaccineinjury table. Thank you for the opportunity to share our experience and to ex- press my concerns. [The prepared statement of Ms. Mulhauser follows:] VerDate you for your testimony. We will withhold ques- tions until we have heard from all the panelists. Next is Mr. John Salamone, and he is president of Informed Par- ents Against VAPP. You are recognized, sir. Mr. S ALAMONE . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the sub- committee. I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you today re-garding legislative and policy options for improving the VaccineCompensation Program. Before offering specific testimony concerning outlined areas for improving this program, I would like to state for the record thatI have served as vice chair of the HHS Advisory Commission onChildhood Vaccines and currently serve as an unpaid consultant tothe Subcommittee on Vaccine Safety for the National Vaccine Advi-sory Committee. But more importantly, I am the father of David, a 9-year old with polio contracted from the oral polio vaccine. As David 's dad and as president of Informed Parents Against VAPP, also knownas IPAV, a group of families who suffer from oral polio vaccine in-juries, I worked long and hard with immunization advocates tomove this country toward an all-IPV schedule or a killed virusschedule. I am a supporter of immunizations. I have seen first hand in my life the diseases that we can now prevent and believe that we mustmaintain a strong immunization system \u2014the safest one possible. With my son and others in IPAV having paid a huge personal pricefor mass immunization, I have also become very familiar with theNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The first topic I was asked to address concerns changing the ad- versarial nature of the Compensation Program procedures and thehearing process. Given the choice between the program and per-sonal injury lawsuits, the program wins. However, there is roomfor improvement. In their current form, the procedures are at timesadversarial and need to become more user friendly. Some suggestions to improve the process include: reevaluating the procedures to take into account the literacy level of most appli-cants. In its current form, either on the website or in the informa-tion packet, the language cites legal requirements and can oftenput off those unfamiliar with such legal terms. In short, put it inplain english. Provide simple and clearly defined steps an applicant must go through in order to be considered for an award. This will assist ap-plicants in working through the process and lead to a better under-standing on their part of what their responsibilities are. It would be ideal if new applicants could be provided with a counselor who can provide support through the application process.Most of the families who are dealing with vaccine injuries are sim-ply too overwhelmed. They need the kind of assistance that comesfrom a person, whose job description includes compassion as a re-quirement. The counselor can be empowered to provide references where ap- plicants can get legal aid. Perhaps a bar association or other thirdparty group can be asked to provide this special and much neededservice. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 is reforming the evidentiary and adjudicative standards for determining compensation. From my experience and those of our families, I feel that the evidentiary stage is generallyfair and runs smoothly for most applicants. An overall comment, however, is that the government trust of $1.4 billion is guarded too well. The coffers need to be opened toprovide the kind of humane service people in vaccine injury situa-tions not only need but deserve. For example, the damages phase,to use the common term, can become more flexible in allowing forspecial circumstances. We have had families who have gone bank-rupt trying to meet their children 's medical and emotional needs while going through the system. The Government can also provide greater clarity with regard to future lost wages. Some suggestions that come to mind include: ad-ministering intermediate funds to those in need based on good faithand a reasonable basis for claim; including family counseling ex-penses and reasonable fees and costs associated with the establish-ment of a guardianship or conservatorship; extending the currentstatute of limitations from 3 years for injury claims and 2 years fordeath to 6 years, and creating a specific method or formula for cal-culating lost earnings under VICP that is easily adaptable for indi-vidual use. The final area of review is ensuring the level of funding to meet future needs. Current funding is not in jeopardy and should cer-tainly be maintained. As future vaccines are created, these need tobe added automatically to the injury table with assignment of ap-propriate excise tax. Let me repeat: It is not about funding; it isabout access to funds for those who need it. If greater funds wouldequate to better services for applicants, then I would say, yes, pro-vide more funds earmarked for those services I outlined earlier. Ifthe committee takes action that will enable larger awards, then thecriteria for what is covered under an award would need to be re-evaluated. I firmly believe in the VICP. It has done the best job it can under its current design to fulfill its purpose. I have been impressed withthe dedication of those I have worked with in the program over thepast 6 years. I believe, though, that even they would admit thatimprovements can and should be made to ensure that this pro-gram, which has served us well for a decade, can continue to meetthe needs of those who sacrificed themselves for a universal vaccineprogram. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.[The prepared statement of Mr. VerDate ICA. Thank you. Thank all of our witnesses for their testi- mony this morning. I have a couple of questions, if I may. First, Mrs. Clements, I think you have been denied participation in the fund because of the original injury table being changed, andI believe you testified you felt this is grossly unfair. What wouldyou recommend as far as a process that you think would be fairer,and, again, what about individuals like you who have been deniedthe opportunity to participate because of these changes, you thinkthat Congress should take some remedial action to allow your par-ticipation? Ms. C LEMENTS . Basically, when we first applied for \u2014when I first got information on the adverse reactions, I got the papers, and myson fit the\u2014if you want to say qualified \u2014for getting compensated. Then, as I said, the table changed, and all of sudden there is justno one, basically, it sounds like could possibly be compensated be-cause of the way they changed this table. And if they could put it back to the way it was, more families could be compensated or make it, as Mr. Burton said, stop makingit impossible and stop making it where we have to go in and fightto prove that our child reacted. When my son reacted in 15 hoursto it, and we have 72 hours at that given time when we first start-ed that if he seized within 72, it is a reaction from the DPT shot.Then all of a sudden it is no longer on the table. I had a great problem with them taking the seizures off the table, because I know a high percent of reactions are seizures fromthe DPT shot, and that, to me, just showed a sign of saying, ''We don't want to pay anyone anymore, and we can get rid of this sec-tion of people or children that react, '' and if they could just look into it deeper and, like Mr. Burton said, investigate it in the long-term and not do a couple weeks, a couple months study, becauseour children are getting these shots up until possibly 6 years old,and we don't know what can happen at 6 months. The friend ofours whose child died, died at the fourth shot. So, the other thing of giving warning signs, my son had two prior warning signs to it, but because my doctor and a lot of doctors don 't tell us these adverse reactions, I didn 't know. My son may not be in this condition if I would have known that the, if you want to say,the junkiness that developed after the \u2014when he was 2 months old. He had a rattle in his chest, and I kept going to my doctor say- ing, ''Something is wrong. Something is wrong '' right after he had his DPT shot, and I was given the normal of ''Well, newborns make that sound.'' I go in for the 4-month old, and he does the excessivecrying. And I am not told that is an adverse reaction, so I go inwith the 6-months, and now I have a son who has a seizure dis-order and ultimately puts him in this condition. Now, I could havebeen\u2014that could have been eliminated if I would have known thewarning signs ahead of time. So, it is something to make sure that the doctors are forced to give out that information, that it is not a \u2014well, as I view it \u2014a cover up or a hiding, to go into a long study of what is going on with children that react, because some children don 't react on the first one. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov Have you had access to any other legal remedy? Have you pursued a suit against the manufacturers or \u2014\u2014 Ms. C LEMENTS . At this present time, our lawyers are looking into the steps of\u2014or looking into going after the pharmaceutical com- pany themselves. They figure there are ways of going after themanufacturers. Mr. M ICA. To date, to deal with the problems you have incurred, how have you had to deal with that financially \u2014just all your fam- ily resources or some other \u2014\u2014 Ms. C LEMENTS . Originally, when Andrew started out with his seizures, it was financially coming through us, and then we weretold that we could go and apply for SSI, and that would help takecare of the medical bills and things like that. So, probably withina few months, about 6 months we had to wait, and then SSI kickedin, and it started paying the bills. But, originally, we paid the be-ginning of those bills for probably the first 6 months of his reactingto it. Mr. M ICA. Ms. Mulhauser, it took you, what is 612or 712years to receive compensation? Ms. M ULHAUSER . It took 5 years to finalize all of the stipulation. It took another year and a half to go through the court system toestablish legal guardianship. So, the annuity company would notrelease the checks until we had proof of legal guardianship, and itwas a process we couldn 't start ahead of time, because the guard- ian courts required the stipulation to be filed. Mr. M ICA. Based on your experience, how can we speed up this process? Ms. M ULHAUSER . Like I testified earlier, I believe that if both the Government and the parents come to the table with the child 's best interests instead of fighting over the cost of one item or another orwhether it is going to cost $5 or $10, the process would speed upquite a bit. I think we could have taken 3 years off of our compensation time just by letting the life care planners who are qualified to determinelife care needs, with the doctors ' reports, the educational reports, the parent input \u2014there are plenty of resources that are available that a mediator, say, who specializes in the life care planning ofindividuals with disabilities, could bring that process to a conclu-sion much sooner than having high-priced lawyers arguing overitems. Mr. M ICA. Thank you. Mrs. Mink.Mrs. M INK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The testimony of all the witnesses on this panel is very, very pro- vocative, and I hope will be utilized to encourage this committee tomake some very important changes to the existing law. Mrs. Clements, what bothers me in the situation that you found yourself in, with respect to the symptoms that occurred imme-diately after the shots were given to your son, that no one ex- plained to you at that point that those were suggestive of adversereactions to the vaccination and that you relied on your physicianto be able to make an appropriate reading as to what was goingon inside your child 's system. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 it from your testimony that your physician did not provide you with such a forecast or analysis of what was going on. Is that correct? Ms. C LEMENTS . Correct. Mrs. M INK. Then it seems to me for the compensation system to insist that you as a parent, non-medical professional, be able tomake a decision to halt the Vaccination Program, which the Gov-ernment was insisting that every child have, is perfectly illogical.There is no reason for a parent to know when to insist that theGovernment stop the vaccination procedure. The physicians, on theother hand, have the knowledge and the training, or should have,and be able to make those decisions. Don 't you agree? Ms. C LEMENTS . Yes. Mrs. M INK. So, given that circumstance, it would seem to me that one of the things that the committee should look at is the re-sponsibility of the medical profession in each of these cases. Warn-ings should have been given. The medical profession should exer-cise sound judgment, and in the absence of exercising that soundjudgment, compensation should be automatic. I mean, that is mygeneral feeling. And to hear your testimony that such technical things as a stat- ute of limitations, that your filing was 1 year late, or that the tech-nicalities of the table had changed so as to disqualify your claimis absolutely unacceptable in tort law. I happen to be a lawyer. It is always the incident of the injury that establishes the date of the claim. It was through no fault ofyour own that you were not apprised of your ability to stop this in-jury from occurring and becoming more serious. The compensationconcept of the Federal Government should be an automatic process-ing of the claim, because certainly there could be no other justifi-able reason for your child being in this serious condition that heis in. The medical profession acted inappropriately and this injurycould have been prevented. And given those circumstances, the compensation approach should be categorically in your favor, since there could be no possi-bility of negligence on your part. It is not the case of trying to findblame on the medical profession, but certainly to deny compensa-tion in your case goes against all semblance of justice and equityin this country. So, I would hope that the committee would be able to take your testimony and your statement and correct that. And certainly withrespect to the timeframe, the Government should have a statute oflimitations where if they fail to act within a reasonable time, thatthe compensation claimed by the victim 's family ought to be auto- matically adjudicated by some third party. I think that since the Vaccination Program is one that is imposed by the Government for the public safety, that we ought to imposeupon the Government strict regulations with reference to the pro-tection of the parties involved, and, Mr. Chairman, those are myviews. Thank you.Mr. M ICA. Thank you. I would like to yield now to the chairman of our full committee, Mr. Burton. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am not going to ask but one question. I have to leave to go to a luncheon, but I will be back for further \u2014for another part of this hearing. I want to express to the parents my sorrow and all the parents across the country that have experienced what you have. I have similar feelings for my grandchildren, and may the good Lord blessyou and your families for what you have gone through and whatyou are going to go through the rest of your lives. I would like to just make a couple of comments. The reason that this fund was set up, as I understand it, is because the pharma-ceutical companies were concerned about massive lawsuits and howit might adversely impact their industry and how many of thosepharmaceutical companies smaller in nature, and even the largeones, might go out of business if excessive lawsuits, because of ad-verse reactions, occurred. And, so the Government and Mr. Waxman justifiably sat down with them, and said, ''OK, we are going to work this out so that there is a non-adversarial process that will take place where peoplewill be compensated fairly, and you will still be able to protect thepharmaceutical companies. '' And this fund of 75 cents a shot was established to take care of that. Now, we find it is an adversarial relationship; that people have to fight to get that money; they can 't get lawyers to take their cases\u2014and I know; I am speaking from personal experience now.We can't find many lawyers that even want to look at this. So, thisadversarial relationship that has been created should not be hap-pening, because that was not the purpose of the fund. Now, some people have said to me privately that they are con- cerned that even though we have $1.1 billion in that fund, that thefund may be depleted if they aren 't very careful. Well, my view is if it is a non-adversarial situation we are looking for, then if wehave to increase the cost per shot to $1 or $1.50, double it, to makesure that these people are adequately compensated for the tragedythat they have to endure, then we should do it. But there shouldnot be this kind of a problem. And I intend to be back for the gentleman who works for the fund and the people at the Justice Department, because I am sureCongress didn't intend that, and if they are trying to protect thatfund, then that is baloney. We can always raise the amount. AndI am not for tax increases, but I am for making sure that peoplewho suffer like these people have suffered are fairly and ade-quately compensated, because it wasn 't their fault that this hap- pened. The second thing that concerns me is that my son-in-law is a doc- tor, and I have talked to him about this, obviously, because it isour family that is involved. And I ask him about shots, and hesays, ''Well, we get guidelines from the Food and Drug Administra- tion and from the Health and Human Services, and unless it is ap-proved by the FDA, then, you know, I am very careful, and Idon't\u2014'' So, they rely\u2014the doctors rely, in many cases, probably inmost cases, on the judgment that is coming out of their associa-tions, which is coming from the FDA. And, so if we are not gettingenough information, then it seems to me that the Government VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov must be more forthcoming to the physicians so that they could be more forthcoming to the patients so that everybodywill know the risks involved. That hepatitis B shot that my granddaughter took, that almost killed her, would not have been administered had I known therisks or my daughter knew the risks. My grandson got five shotsin 1 day. You know, sometimes I think it is an overload of the sys-tem, like if you put too many plugs into an electrical socket, youare going to blow the breaker switch or you are going to \u2014if you have an old-style home, you are going to have the fuse blown. Andwe are loading these kids up with 25, 30 shots between the timethey are born and they are 5 and 6 years old before they go toschool. And we need to know from HHS and FDA and our healthagencies, through our doctors, what the risks are, and the parentsneed to know that so we minimize the kinds of problems we aretalking about here today. So, those are my views. I think I would just like to ask you, Mr. Salamone one question, and your son suffers from the polio vaccine,the live polio vaccine. You were talking about making sure thatdead viruses are used. Now, is there any indication from your re-search or from talking to scientists and physicians that if we usedead viruses that the risk is minimized even though they may getseveral vaccines? Mr. S ALAMONE . The only cases of polio in the United States for the past 20 years have come solely from the oral polio vaccine. Mr. B URTON . The live vaccine. Mr. S ALAMONE . That is right. And, so in answer to your question, I don't have any information to indicate anything specific regarding the killed virus, but I guess the facts are that polio in the UnitedStates, while we think that it has been eliminated, in reality, wehave been creating it by the very vaccine designed to prevent it,and that was the oral polio vaccine. And I am pleased to note thatas of January 2000, they are recommending now \u2014the CDC is rec- ommending that the oral polio vaccine no longer be part of the reg-ular vaccination schedule finally after 5 years, I might point out,of a lot of testimony. Mr. B URTON . And I wonder how many people suffered. Do you have any idea how many people \u2014\u2014 Mr. S ALAMONE . Well, on the books, they say between 8 and 10 a year, but, quite candidly, virtually every family that we deal withhas been misdiagnosed. And in the case of my son, it took them al-most 2 years to finally put the pieces together and figure out thathe didn't have half of his immune system, and that is why he gotpolio as a result of the vaccine. Mr. B URTON . If I might ask just another question of this witness, Mr. Chairman. So, the people from HHS and the people from the health agencies have known for how many years now that the live virus causedthis problem? Mr. S ALAMONE . Oh, I venture to say that the health industry has known for decades that you can get polio \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, let me\u2014my time is running out. So, they have known it for decades, and there was an alternative to that \u2014the dead virus\u2014that could have prevented polio, is that correct? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 That is right. A safer, killed virus was available. Mr. B URTON . And yet they went ahead and let the American peo- ple take the more dangerous virus for, you say, for at least a dec- ade or so. Mr. S ALAMONE . It was just a bad, old habit that went back to those days decades ago. Mr. B URTON . Well, I am not so sure. And one of the things that we want to investigate is whether or not the pharmaceutical com-panies, who have a huge investment in this, have influence orundue influence on the departments of health in this country. Ifyou know that a virus that is live causes this kind of damage toa young child, whether it is polio or anything else, and if they con-tinue to use it when there is an alterative \u2014for instance, the DPT shot is still being used today, and they have a DPaT shot that issafer, and when I asked people at the hearing we had not long ago,they could not explain to me why the DPT shot is still being used.The only thing that pops into my mind is there is money involved,and if there is money involved, why are HHS and the FDA allow-ing that to continue to be used? And, so we are going to check allthat out. It sounds like a similar situation with the polio virus vaccine. We are going to look into all that, and we are going to get the recordsof all the people who are in the decisionmaking process at thehealth agencies; we are going to get those records. We are goingto go back and find out where the money came from when they goto speak. We are going to go back beyond the organization thatputs the meeting together where they speak and find out if thepharmaceutical companies are underwriting all that and if they arepaying honorariums for these people. And if that is going on, thereare going to be some changes made in the way HHS and the FDAdo their business. And we are going to check everybody out, every-body. Mr. M ICA. Thank the chairman. If I may, Mr. Kucinich, can I recognize Dr. Weldon, and then I go to you? Would that be acceptable? Thank you. Dr. Weldon.Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Mulhauser, I was looking at your resume. You had a career in fashion design prior to your son 's illness coming along, is that right? Have you been able to work in that field at all or have any in- come since your son 's illness arrived? Ms. M ULHAUSER . No, I have not worked professionally since my son's vaccine injury. Dr. W ELDON . How much of your time is consumed with caring for your son, would you say, on a typical daily basis? Ms. M ULHAUSER . It is 24 hours. I mean, he sleeps at night, but even when he is in school, I am still responsible for overseeing histherapies, scheduling his doctor 's appointments\u2014\u2014 Dr. W ELDON . Can you give me an idea \u2014\u2014 Ms. M ULHAUSER [continuing]. Paperwork involved with the an- nuities and the checks coming in, annual accountings, financial ac- countings, petitions for maintenance to use the fund that has been VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov him. And I do a lot of volunteer work related to his school and the rights of the disabled, the rights of the deaf. Dr. W ELDON . And you have another child, is that right? Ms. M ULHAUSER . Yes, I do. Dr. W ELDON . Is it safe to say that the vast majority of your time since your son's illness has been devoted to petitioning the Govern-ment for compensation, caring for him, and that has essentiallyprecluded you from working in your field? Ms. M ULHAUSER . Yes, that is true. Dr. W ELDON . I notice there is a gentleman with you. Is he your husband, attorney? Ms. M ULHAUSER . My husband. Dr. W ELDON . Your husband. Your husband has a job, I take it? Ms. M ULHAUSER . Yes. Dr. W ELDON . And I would imagine that the vast majority of his free time when not working has been devoted to supporting yourson as well. Ms. M ULHAUSER . Yes. Dr. W ELDON . And when you apply for compensation, you don 't re- quest any compensation, and you are not eligible to get any com-pensation based on your lost income and the time that you havedevoted to caring for your child. Is that correct? Ms. M ULHAUSER . That is correct. Dr. W ELDON . OK. Ms. Clements, I want to ask you the same line of questioning. I see you brought your son with you today, and there is a lady withyou. I assume she is a relative of yours? Ms. C LEMENTS . My sister. Dr. W ELDON . Your sister. I assume for you to go out anywhere and do anything, you have to get either a family member to sit inand help you or to have somebody paid come in and help you? Isthat correct? Ms. C LEMENTS . I have someone in my family come in or take him with me. Dr. W ELDON . OK. And as you have been trying to work through the Vaccine Compensation Program, you are trying to get fundsjust to take care of him. You are not petitioning for any loss of yourtime, any pain and suffering on your part for this case. Is that cor-rect? Ms. C LEMENTS . Correct. There is nothing that can \u2014there is no amount. Dr. W ELDON . Just one additional question I have for you. You mentioned in your testimony that you were considering or you arein the process of filing a claim against the pharmaceutical companydirectly. Is that correct? Ms. C LEMENTS . Correct. Dr. W ELDON . The purpose of the Vaccine Injury Program was be- cause the vaccine manufacturers said they were going to get out ofthe business because of the huge number of claims that were being filed against them. One of the concerns that I have is that the pro-gram is so adversarial that individuals such as yourself will startthe process anew of filing claims against the pharmaceutical com-panies, and then we can be right back to square one that the sys- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 truly failed us so badly that the pharmaceutical companies are getting out of it again. Would you say that it is a correct assessment that people with situations such as yours have no choice and that they are going tostart filing claims against the pharmaceutical companies? Ms. C LEMENTS . Yes, I would say that is correct. Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, or Madam Chairwoman. I yield back. Mrs. M INK[presiding]. Thank you. I recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Kucinich.Mr. K UCINICH . Thank you very much, Mrs. Mink. There are a few things that emerge when one views this very im- portant public policy issue. First of all, the role of Congress. Thequestion has been asked, and it should be put before this commit-tee, whether or not Congress has essentially delegated away toHHS what is a legislative function. With respect to the National Institutes of Health, it appears to me that there absolutely is a need for more research of the adversevaccine reactions, because what we are dealing with here is a sys-tem that provides for compensation for those who have had an ad-verse vaccine reaction, but I think it is incumbent upon us not tosimply take it for granted that those reactions will occur; that moreemphasis needs to be put on research to make sure that everythingis being done to try to limit the amount of reactions which are oc-curring. The people who have come here today \u2014and I have had a chance to review the testimony \u2014certainly have pointed stories, and I think all Americans can sympathize with what happens when aperfectly normal child is given a vaccine and ends up with a cata-strophic injury. And we have to care about that. We have to be at-tuned to the kind of suffering that occurs. And, in a sense, thereis no amount of compensation that can genuinely help a family andan individual who has gone through that kind of trauma and willcontinue to go through it through their entire life. The thing that concerns me, Madam Chair, is that I understand the existing law still permits the Department of Justice to seek costreimbursements from unsuccessful petitioners who appeal theircase to the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals. Is that correct, MadamChair and Mr. Mica? See, that is one of the areas where this Congress, I think, can intervene on behalf of those families who have suffered. It justdoesn't seem fair that one should have to go through a route of try-ing to seek compensation or increased benefits and cost reimburse-ments, and then if you happen to lose, to have the Department ofJustice come after you for the cost of an appeal to the U.S. FederalCircuit Court of Appeals. Again, I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Mica, for his diligence on these issues, and the information that you have already broughtforward as a result of this committee 's work indicates that reforms are needed, and I am sure that with the Chair working with Mrs. Mink and this committee, that we are going to try to find some re-lief that will\u2014it will never make you whole again in terms of thedamage that has been done to your family and to your children, but VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov let other Americans know that Congress is listening and cares and wants to do something. So, thanks to all of you right here.Thank you, Chairman.Mr. M ICA[presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Kucinich. I recognize Mr. Cummings from Maryland.Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I can only echo what Mr. Kucinich just said. I think that so often when you think of something like a vaccine, looking at somethingthat is supposed to make life better and prevent problems, and un-fortunately in some instances we have a double-edged sword. I just have a few questions, Mr. Salamone. Is that how you pro- nounce your name? In your testimony, you advocate the creation of a specific method or formula to calculate lost earnings. Yet some people oppose sucha formula, because it may diminish the awards to successful peti-tioners. How would you respond to that concern? Mr. S ALAMONE . Well, you know, I have, I think, a very personal reason for addressing that issue. In the case of my son, he receivedzero, no compensation for future lost wages, and I believe in thiscase the assumption was if he can walk \u2014which David does like a drunken sailor, but he gets around with his brace \u2014that he can, with educated parents, do as well in this life as everyone else. Well, within a year of his award, David started intermittent tremors of his arms and hands. And as a result, he now had to domuch of his schoolwork on special equipment. Well, our neurologisttells us this is directly related to his polio, yet, again, this is some-thing that was after the fact, and therefore \u2014by the way, if I can use this opportunity, the original legislation provided that if indeedafter a claim was made something like this came up that was di-rectly related to the injury, that one had the option of going backto the Government and saying, ''This is directly related. We have this evidence,'' and the Government would work out an arrange-ment where they could compensate, if you will, for the needs relat-ing to that additional injury. Unfortunately, that was pulled back, and the Congress actually removed that provision, and, as a result, in a case like my son andothers, you have this situation where, again, they are not reallybeing fully compensated for their injury. Now, as far as the lost future wages, I believe that this is obvi- ously a complex issue, and the \u2014my concern, candidly, is the fact that people are totally eliminated from even consideration for fu-ture lost wages. So, I think we, first, have to establish the fact thatthere should not be a policy with the Government that would allowa special master to have a policy that says, ''You will not get future lost wages for your child, because that child can walk or that childhas educated parents. '' Those are the things that concern me. Mr. C UMMINGS . There is a great deal of concern that if the present program is changed, children whose conditions have notbeen caused by the vaccines would receive compensation. And howwould you address that concern? Mr. S ALAMONE . I am sorry, sir. Repeat the question. Mr. C UMMINGS . In other words, there is a concern that if the present program was changed, children whose conditions have VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov receive com- pensation. Mr. S ALAMONE . Well, I would first say to you I believe that when it comes right down to it, the Government should err on the partof the petitioner, if indeed it is an error. These are very difficultcases. This is supposed to be a procedure that is less adversarial,not non-adversarial, and certainly we don 't want to open the doors completely to cases that are not directly related to vaccine injury.But I would say if we have cases that even come close to consider-ation as vaccine-related, that I would rather the Government withits $1.4 billion trust err on the side of the petitioner. Mr. C UMMINGS . Well, I certainly would agree with that. Unfortu- nately, we have many people here in the Congress who probablywouldn't. When I look at all of this, having been a trial lawyer foralmost 20 years, to see the results of what happens, for example,in a malpractice case and see how States have limited the liabilityof doctors who may do the wrong thing or may be negligent, it isinteresting. But when you go through this experience, when you have a prob- lem like this, a vaccine that actually had the opposite effect thatit was supposed to have, I think you get a chance to see that \u2014peo- ple get a chance to see that side of it. And I would agree with you,and I hope that, as Mr. Kucinich said, that we will be able to comeup with some solutions that are fair and that we will do justice toall of those who may have been harmed. And I want to thank all of our witnesses for being with us today. Thank you very much. Mr. M ICA. Thank the gentleman from Maryland. I would like to also thank all three of our panelists for being with us and for the testimony you have provided the subcommitteetoday. Hopefully, it can help us in doing a better job in revising thelaw that was passed to compensate victims, make the structureand system work that we put in place to compensate for vaccineinjuries. So, we thank each of you, and we will excuse the witnesses at this time. I would like to call our second panelists. Panel two is Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne, a medical expert with Tufts University; Dr. ArnoldGale, a medical expert with Stanford University, and Mr. CliffShoemaker, an attorney with Shoemaker & Horn. As I indicated to our first panelists, this is an investigation and oversight subcommittee of Congress. We will swear in our wit-nesses. Also, if you have lengthy statements, they will be made apart of the record. Let me see, and is Dr. Gale going to testify too?Can you raise your right hands?[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. M ICA. Thank you. All of our witnesses answered in the af- firmative. I would like to welcome each of you and thank you for your par- ticipation today. And I think each of you have dealt with this com- pensation fund and process, and we look forward to your testimonyat this time. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Marcel Kinsbourne with Tufts Univer- sity. You are recognized, sir. STATEMENTS OF MARCEL KINSBOURNE, MEDICAL EXPERT, TUFTS UNIVERSITY; ARNOLD GALE, MEDICAL EXPERT, STANFORD UNIVERSITY; AND CLIFF SHOEMAKER, ATTOR- NEY, SHOEMAKER & HORN Dr. K INSBOURNE . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Marcel Kinsbourne. I am a pediatric neurologist. I have held research grants from the NIH. I have served on study groups of the NIH. I have been involved in the Compensation Pro-gram since its inception in 1988; in fact, before its inception, I waspart of a workshop offered for special masters in training for thatpurpose. So, I have an overview of the program from its start. I have also been involved in civil litigation, both for plaintiff and defense, and so I am in a position to compare the proceedings ofthe claims court Vaccine Compensation Act with civil litigation inthis country at this time. Now, I might just say what everybody else agrees that I am strongly in favor of public health policies with regard to vaccina-tion. I am addressing specifically the issues nominated by the com-mittee for discussion. And the first of these, of course, is the question of the adversarial nature of the proceedings as they now occur. Actually, when theproceedings first began in the late eighties, I didn 't think they were that adversarial. I really thought that they were somewhat consist-ent with the wording of the act which was that they should proceed''quickly, easily, and with certainty and generosity. '' This changed, however, and the proceedings have become more adversarial and continue to become more adversarial, and thatboth involves the manner in which the cases are defended, the peti-tioners are resisted, and the change in the rules that offer a pre-sumption of causation that have already been mentioned by severalspeakers today. These changes all go in one direction. I don 't believe, as I will explain, that the changes were made based on new science. Thereisn't any relevant new science. The changes are a matter of policy,in my opinion. Now, in terms of the manner in which the proceedings are con- ducted, it is increasingly the case in my experience that the De-partment of Justice attorneys fight harder and more stubbornly toresist findings of entitlement. They may use two experts. They maychange experts if the first expert 's opinions didn't serve the pur- pose. They may bring in three. A petitioner can 't usually manage to do that. In one matter in which I have been involved, the Department of Justice actually paid a group of independent investigators to per-form an original study, an expensive study, to overthrow twoclaims for which entitlement had already been found. These are thecases of Plavin and Hanlon v. HHS. This kind of funding, this kind of effort isn 't possibly available to those plaintiff attorneys that still consent to take these cases. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov might add that as has been said before, absolutely there is no way of proceeding in these matters without the help of an attor-ney; not just an attorney, an attorney who is well versed in theprocedures in the claims court. It has become a highly specializedaspect of law. So, not only is it the case that a special master is pressured in many cases to deny entitlement, it is also the case that when thespecial master nonetheless finds entitlement, that the fight goeson, as you have heard, increasingly at the damages hearings.Issues that had already been settled in the previous hearing are re-vived yet again, and then there is the nitpicking that has been de-scribed so well by previous witnesses. Now, not only does this make the process arduous and exhaust- ing, particularly for petitioners, it takes up time. I heard it said atthe last hearing, at which I also testified, that the average time tosettle a claim is 2 years. Well, I don 't know where that figure comes from. In my opinion, claims that are contested and gothrough to entitlement findings take longer. They have taken 4years, 5 years. The last one that I was involved in had been filedin 1991. As you have heard, the more time passes, the less com-pensation is subsequently offered. Now, if the decision is one that is unwelcome to the Department of Justice, the Department has the further resource of resorting toa multi-stage appeals process, and appeals against the decision ofspecial masters have been increasingly frequent in my experience. Now, it is also my impression that as part of the more stubborn contesting of these claims, there has been an increasing effort todiscredit medical experts who assist petitioners by accusing themof bias against vaccination or in favor of petitioners. In fact in thesame last hearing I mentioned, the Department of Justice attorneyput into the record as an impeachment exhibit the fact of my testi-mony to this committee last time, and then she argued that thefact that I testified to this committee showed that I was an advo-cate, and should impeach my credibility as a medical expert. I havethe transcript with me. The special masters \u2014\u2014 Dr. W ELDON . Mr. Chairman, I ask that that transcript be in- cluded in the record. Mr. M ICA. Without objection, so ordered. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 In my opinion, the special masters make every reasonable effort to adhere to the principle of a non-adversarial and friendly and expeditious process. They used relaxed rules of proce-dure. They are invariably courteous and compassionate to theplaintiffs. They try to move the case along, but this gets increas-ingly hard because of the opposition that is encountered at everystep of the way. I think that in summary, the quality of the proceedings has ap- proximated to the kind of adversarial argumentation and maneu-vering that is typical of civil litigation, and the question is, is thatwhat Congress wants? The second topic nominated by the committee was the matter of criteria for entitlement for compensation. In other words, what arethe criteria by which a claim can be automatically accepted as indi-cating that the damage complained of was caused by vaccine? Now,I would like to explain why this is so important. If it were the case that we had special tests for vaccine injury, if it were the case that the outcomes of vaccine injury were typicaland that you could look at the chart years later and say, ''Ah, this must have been a vaccine case, '' then there wouldn 't be such a problem. But in child neurology this is the exception rather thanthe rule. The reason is that there are a legion of causes of damageto children's brains, but the way the children 's brains react to these damages is quite limited, and the most common outcomes are cere-bral palsy, mental retardation, and seizure disorders. And it is usu-ally the case that you cannot tell from the cerebral palsy, from theseizures, or from the mental retardation what the cause was. So, in the case of vaccine injury it is like that. If one had to actu- ally prove that the vaccine definitely caused the outcome, thatwould be hard and sometimes not a possible job to do, as is thecase also with other causes in child neurology. One reason why this proof is so difficult is that research is lack- ing. Now, the research that is lacking is research that could, infact, often well have been done by now. In fact, the initial act in-structed the Secretary to commission the Institute of Medicine toprepare reports on the status of the science of vaccine injury causa-tion, and they did so in two reports I think in 1991 and 1994. In the report in 1994, they made a point of a fact that they had encountered in their efforts, from chapter 11, ''The lack of adequate data regarding many of the adverse events of the study was ofmajor concern to this committee. Obvious needs for research andsurveillance were identified. '' This opinion of the committee of the Institute of Medicine was published in 1994. I am not aware thatanything was done about it. Now, in fact, the rule changes that have been referred to, imple- mented in 1995 and 1996, were changes that, as everybody knows,made it harder for petitioners to prevail in their actions. Thesechanges were not based on new science. There is no new science.They were not based on the Institute of Medicine recommendation.Actually, they ran counter to those recommendations. Here is a specific about that. In the case of DPT vaccination, which is by far the commonest vaccination complained of, therereally is only one epidemiological study that has been recognizedas being definitive and reliable, and I quote from a publication of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov The study is called the NCES, National Childhood Encephalopathy study, which was done in Britain. Thecommittee says, ''The NCES is the only systematic study of long- term dysfunction after DPT, '' and the committee endorsed that study, and the following statement is to be found in the same docu-ment: ''The committee concludes that the balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relation between DPT and the forms ofchronic nervous dysfunction described in the NCES in those chil-dren who experienced serious, acute, neurological illness within 7days after receiving DPT vaccine. '' So, what are these acute, neurological events? They subdivide into encephalopathy and seizures. The NCES studied serious sei-zures lasting more than half an hour or complicated seizures. Well,what happened after that? Seizures were removed from the tableof entitlement after the IOM accepted the study which incrimi-nated them in relation to DPT. Encephalopathy. How was encephalopathy defined by the NCES, which was endorsed by the IOM? I would give a list, if I may, ofthe characteristics that were mentioned in the NCES document: al-tered state of consciousness, confusion, irritability, changes in be-havior, screaming attacks, neck stiffness, convulsions, visual, audi-tory, and speech disturbances, motor and sensory defects. This isthe list the NCES gave, and it is a list that is not inconsistent withneurological practice. What is left after the change? One thing: lowered level of con- sciousness after 24 hours. If you don 't have that, never mind you have all these other symptoms, you are not on the table, and Godforbid you die before the 24 hours are up, because then, certainly,you haven't met the criteria. So, I wish to present to the committee that the presumption of causation has been restricted to the point that it is tantamount tocausation-in-fact. It is tantamount to going and proving the case incourt every time over again. So, we have instead this lengthy proc-ess, this arduous process which might as well be conducted againstthe manufacturers as in the court of claims. And, now, the Secretary has introduced proposals for legislative changes. In section three of the proposals, there is a suggestionwhich would make it easier for the Government to overthrow eventable injuries. Now, when petitioners have to prove causation-in-fact because their injuries aren 't on the table, they have to prove that the pertussis vaccine or other vaccine really caused the prob-lem. But the Secretary would like to change the burden on the re- spondent to overthrow a table injury by not having them actuallyprove the specific disease but merely argue, ''Oh, there was a ge- netic cause. There was a metabolic cause. '' That is in section three. That section would make it even harder to recover under the termsof the act. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 respect to the third point, I have only a brief comment to make. As has been mentioned several times, there is a large amount of money in the trust fund. It was contributed not by man-ufacturers, not by the Government, but by citizens when they pur-chased vaccines. The purpose was to compensate people who are in-jured by vaccines. I believe the money should continue to be usedfor that purpose. Thank you, sir.[The prepared statement of Mr. follows:] VerDate ICA. Thank you for your testimony. We will now hear from Dr. Arnold Gale with Stanford Univer- sity. You are recognized, sir. Dr. G ALE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the ranking minority mem- ber, Mrs. Mink, and ladies and gentleman of the committee. Thank you for the privilege of testifying today about the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. I am a child neurologist and amember of the faculty of the Stanford University School of Medi-cine. And for the past decade, I have participated in the programby lending my expertise to the review of the medical records of pe-titioners filing claims for compensation. At the same time, I haveacquired a perspective of the process itself and of the deeper issueof vaccine-related injury, which I should like to share with you thismorning. Although a wide variety of vaccines are covered by theprogram, and while my remarks are pertinent to all of them, I willfocus primarily upon the pertussis vaccine, which has given rise tothe vast majority of claims. My role as a medical reviewer for the program is little different than that which I perform in my usual capacity as a clinician.Keeping in mind the criteria that are set forth in the vaccine injurytable, I review the medical records and the supporting documentsof each claim, seeking to answer these questions: Does a conditiondescribed on the table exist? If so, has it occurred within the pre-scribed timeframe? And if so, can a factor unrelated to the vaccinebe identified as the probable cause of the condition? If a condition described in the table occurs within the prescribed timeframe, and if no factor unrelated to the vaccine can be identi-fied as the probable cause of the injury, then the claim is compen-sable under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. I file a re-port with the program to that effect, and the claim typically pro-ceeds to the damages phase of the process. Alternatively, if no condition described in the table can be identi- fied, or if a condition has its onset beyond the prescribed time-frame, or if a factor unrelated to the vaccine can be identified asthe probable cause of the condition, then the claim is not compen-sable under the act. I file a report to that effect, and the entitle-ment phase continues, typically proceeding to an adjudicative hear-ing before a special master. The process is similar in cases in whicha child may have suffered a significant aggravation of a pre-exist-ing condition following immunization. Under the act, a table injury without an identifiable factor unre- lated to the vaccine is presumed to have been caused by the vac-cine, and proof of causation is not required. Only when injuriesoccur beyond the timeframe of the table does the petitioner havethe burden of the proof of causation. The fairness of the programrests heavily, I believe, upon this principle. The act provides for periodic revision of the table based upon ex- perience and the evolving understanding of the science and themedicine governing the table. With respect to the pertussis vaccine,perhaps the most significant of these revisions occurred in March1995, when ''residual seizure disorder, '' was eliminated as a dis- tinct condition, and the definition of ''encephalopathy'' was changed. The former was undertaken only after careful consider- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 experience with seizures following immuni- zation. Most seizures closely following immunization are febrile seizures, which are typically brief, self-limited events affecting geneticallypredisposed infants and children. They are benign and are not as-sociated with untoward outcomes. Most of the remaining seizures may be triggered by fever in chil- dren who have occult epilepsy \u2014that is, an already existing epi- lepsy\u2014but there is no evidence that the epilepsy itself is caused bythe vaccine, except when accompanied by signs or symptoms of anacute encephalopathy. Relatively few cases have been affected bythis change in the table. In contrast to more than 3,600 DTP-related claims adjudicated under the initial table, fewer than 300 total claims have been filedsince the change in 1995. The definition of ''encephalopathy'' incor- porated into the initial table was vague and confusing to my wayof thinking and to that of my colleagues, and it disregarded the dif-ferences in the signs and symptoms that are observed in infantsand older children. Because I had a role in framing the languageof the new definition in 1995, I can attest that the change was mo-tivated solely by a desire to clarify. Only a small fraction of casesfiled since that change has been affected. If my description of the mechanics of the program, and of its un- derlying table, is itself a little mechanical and a bit dry, the samecannot be said of the program 's hearing process. Its adversarial na- ture is ensured by the participation of lawyers and the special mas-ter. What should be a quiet, civil, deliberative discussion of factsand medicine too frequently degenerates into a contentious, vitu-perative, decibel-escalating exchange. Ad hominem attacks on phy-sicians by all attorneys are common. Most disturbing, from my perspective, has been the injection of pseudo-science provided by self-proclaimed vaccine-ologists. Withaccumulated experience, however, the special masters appear bet-ter able to readily identify such witnesses, crediting their testimonywith the weight that it deserves. Each participant in the program \u2014parents, special masters, attor- neys, physicians, and others with stakes in the process \u2014possesses a unique perspective, and it is that perspective which creates per-ception. Perception is a powerful thing. In 1977, the British Broad-casting Co. televised a documentary warning parents of the poten-tial dangers of the pertussis vaccine. During the ensuing year, therate of immunization among infants in Great Britain, a nation withaccessible, free health care, plummeted approximately 45 percent.During that same period, in a population roughly a quarter that ofthe United States, the number of deaths from pertussis, or whoop-ing cough, was quadruple our own. All too quickly, the perceptionof risk, which motivated so many parents to withhold immuniza-tions, was replaced by grief. The parents who petition the program have their own perspec- tives and perceptions, and they have my empathy and my sym-pathy for the loss of the children who would have been adults.Often their children have serious chronic neurologic disabilities,and they grieve for lost hopes and dreams. Among their needs isthe need to know why. Compensation from the program, then, pro- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov financial resources for future care and the ac- companying peace of mind. It vindicates the strongly held beliefthat the vaccine is at fault, despite the fact that there is no methodavailable to determine whether the vaccine did, in fact, injure theirchild. The special masters are dedicated to the principles that guide the program, the first of which is compassion. Uncompensated claimsare not attributable to their indifference, but rather to the rel-atively small number of cases that satisfy the minimal require-ments of the table. Never is the problem of perception as poignantas in the instance of the sudden, unexplained death of an infantfollowing immunization. In approximately half of such cases, the medical and pathological records are consistent with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome [SIDS],a condition not associated with pertussis immunization, accordingto the medical literature and the report of the Institute of Medi-cine. Still, it is unlikely that anything will dissuade a grieving par-ent that the close temporal relationship between immunization andan infant's death is coincidental. In nearly 25 years as a clinician, I have witnessed a few rare cases of infants and children whose acute neurologic disordersbegan immediately following immunization, and for which no rea-sonable alternative could be identified. Like most of my colleagues,I think that such events occur, may be vaccine-related, but thatthey are rare. With respect to the pertussis vaccine, there is no method avail- able today that permits causation in any individual case to be es-tablished. This opinion is widely held and well-supported by thecurrent medical literature. My own decade-long experience with theprogram has taught me that literally hundreds, if not thousands,of youngsters whose parents believe that they have been injured byvaccines, have, in fact, alternative diagnoses that account for theirneurological disabilities. The rarity of vaccine-related injuriesmakes epidemiological studies difficult to design and execute, andsuch studies could not establish causation in an individual case norprove that such injuries never occur. A half-century after widespread immunization began, our knowl- edge of such injuries is sparse. What we do know is that countlesslives have been saved and serious illness and disability preventedby immunizing against infectious diseases that were once thescourges of humanity. And, those vaccines have never been saferthan they are today. Thank you again for the privilege of testifying before you today on this critical matter. [The prepared statement of Dr. Gale follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 ICA. Thank you, and we will hear from our third witness, Mr. Cliff Shoemaker. He is an attorney with Shoemaker & Horn. Welcome, and you are recognized, sir. Mr. S HOEMAKER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am flattered to be included on a panel with two esteemed doctors. I probably wouldbe more appropriately placed on the panel with John Euler who isprobably my counterpart in this program. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I am very pleased to be with you here today to talk to you about a subjectthat is very near and dear to me. Before I begin, let me begin bysaying that I would like to place my father 's name, Ralph Shoe- maker, in the Congressional Record. My father died on September11 as I was preparing my testimony for this hearing, and my re-membrances of him were constantly with me as I prepared this tes-timony. I often tell people that I represent saints \u2014the parents of children who have been profoundly injured as the result of vaccinations. ButI want you to understand that I am not \u2014and I repeat the word ''not''\u2014against vaccinations. It is important that you understandwhere I am coming from in this regard. You see, my parents arealso saints; not because they put up with me, but because theyraised a handicapped child and helped her to become a fulfilled,beautiful person. The year that I was born, one of my sisters, who was then 9, con- tracted polio. She has lived her life in a wheelchair, because vac-cines to protect her against that dread disease had not yet been de-veloped. So now, as Paul Harvey would say, you know the rest ofmy story and one of the reasons why I am so committed to the de-velopment of safe and effective vaccines designed to protect usagainst serious diseases. And I might add as a sidelight here, Congressman Burton had an exchange with Mr. Salamone, and it brings up a perfect exam-ple of what I am talking about, because I am one of the people whohas said we cannot stop giving polio vaccines until we have vac-cinated our population for at least 10 years with kill virus vaccine.The reason for that is that we do have cases of people who havecontracted polio from live polio vaccine. We know that they canshed that virus for at least 8 years, so there is a pool of polio virusthere, and you cannot stop giving polio vaccine, at least not the killvaccine, until we are absolutely sure that this disease has beeneradicated. So, if there is any doubt about my view on vaccines,that is it. In a very real sense, I am here today testifying on behalf of the United States\u2014excuse me, sir. Mr. M ICA. If I may submit my unanimous consent your request for also the inclusion of your father 's mention, Ralph Shoemaker, into the record and also your entire statement. Without objection,so ordered. If you would care to go ahead and summarize. Thank you.Mr. S HOEMAKER . Thank you, sir. In a very real sense, sir, I am here today testifying on behalf of the U.S. Government; that is, that part of the Government whichis ''of the people, by the people and for the people. '' Abraham Lin- coln once said, ''It is as much the duty of Government to render VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov against itself, in favor of its citizens, as it is to ad- minister the same, between private individuals. '' I have been involved in vaccine litigation for over 20 years. Prior to the enactment of the Compensation Act in 1986, the families ofchildren, as Congressman Waxman explained, were forced to hirelawyers and file lawsuits against the vaccine manufacturers andvaccine administrators. These suits were expensive and time-con-suming, and the results were quite variable. At a ''Symposium on Public Concerns of Immunization '' held at Georgetown University in 1978, Dr. Leroy Walters made the follow-ing statement, which I think is very appropriate for our discussiontoday. He said, Consider the following metaphor drawn from military service: Mass immunization programs are a significant element in the war on infectious disease. In mandatoryimmunization programs, a system of conscription is employed to recruit soldiers forthis anti-disease campaign. As it happens, most of the recruits in the war on infec-tious diseases are children. In most cases, participation in the war on infectious dis-eases is beneficial to the young soldiers themselves. However, at least part of therationale for conscription is that the pediatric warriors will protect other childrenand the population as a whole against the onslaughts of infectious disease. As inall wars, some soldiers are injured. The number of child-soldiers and their contactswho are actually wounded in this war is small, almost infinitesimal. Yet service-con-nected disabilities do occur. At present, the draftees who are injured in the war oninfectious disease are in effect told by the conscripting authorities, ''Thank you for your contribution to the war effort, and best of success in coping with your disabil-ities.'' If you don't mind, I feel very funny just reading into the record something that I have already written and everyone can read forthemselves. I would like to respond to some of the things that Ihave heard here today. I feel like I am ready to explode with somuch information and so much that needs to be talked about. Congressman Waxman indicated this program was created be- cause plaintiffs only had this alternative to going into court, andthat is true. But as Congressman Burton pointed out, this programwas created because there was a national emergency, and that na-tional emergency was that the vaccine manufacturers were threat-ening to stop the production of vaccines. This was an emergency,and Congress dealt with that emergency in a brilliant fashion. Congress brought together people from all different walks of life. They brought in the manufacturers; they brought in people fromthe Department of Justice, from HSS; they brought in victims; theybrought in groups that represented victims. They took all thesepeople together, and they forged a political compromise. And Ithink it is important to understand that that was a political com-promise, not a scientific decision, not a medical decision, it was apolitical compromise. The table of injuries that everybody hastalked about today was a political compromise. Dr. Kinsbourne is right \u2014there was no new evidence that justi- fied changing that table when the Secretary changed the table, andI hope you will read what I have said about that. The table ischanged now so we have a situation where the only encephalopathyis one where you have reduced level of consciousness for at least24 hours. Now, maybe Dr. Gale can explain to me how a vaccinethat is capable of producing that kind of an injury cannot producean injury that is less severe? If it can produce a severe injury, itcan produce a less severe one. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 about the hepatitis B vac- cine. How do you make a study \u2014when you give a baby a hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital before they leave, how are you going to conduct the study that Dr. Gale asked about, a study of epidemiol-ogy? How are you going to design and implement a study, becauseyou have nothing to compare that baby with? At 2 and 4 and 6months, it is hard enough to know what the baby was like and toshow before and after \u2014that is tough enough. But you give it to a baby and the baby has an injury from the vaccine, how can youprove it? How do I prove it as a lawyer? That is the perfect wayto disguise an injury from a vaccine. Give it to a baby, and thenyou can blame it on genetics or structural abnormalities, and thatis what the Secretary is asking you to do, to not only make changesto this program but make it more difficult to collect on these cases.If you agree with their language on genetic abnormalities andstructural lesions, I can guarantee you that there won 't be anybody on this case. I just returned from Florida where I visited and met with law- yers who are prepared to work on hepatitis B vaccine claims. Wefiled over 130 such claims, and I can tell Congressman Burton thatthe problem we have in this program is that our meeting was notto discuss\u2014well, it was to discuss how we are going to prove causa- tion in these cases \u2014but our meeting was to discuss what we are going to do when we are forced out of this program if it is notchanged and how we are going to mount civil litigation in thesecases. That is the discussion we were holding. You are absolutely correct in saying if this program is not fixed, I can guarantee you that the hawks that are sitting on the side-lines and calling me crazy for staying involved in this program aregoing to carry the day, and we are going to be back in court suingmanufacturers, suing doctors, doctors who didn 't recognize that the first shot caused problems, the second shot caused problems, andthey went ahead and gave the third shot. One of the things we see of hepatitis B vaccine cases is we see people who received a series of vaccines and had repeated injuriesafter each vaccine to that. We have got to develop methods of show-ing doctors and telling doctors that if a child has a reaction to onevaccine, you don 't give him anymore. Stop this dogma of giving it to a child. We are working with doctors now who are trying to determine if there are genetic abnormalities or genetic genomes or genotypesthat can help us to identify children who are high risk of develop-ing reactions to vaccine. That is research that we are doing \u2014plain- tiffs' lawyers, the scourge of the Earth. It is not being done in theplaces where it should be done. We need research today, but wealso need a program, and I encourage you when you think of thatmilitary analogy, give us the burden of proof that you use for veter-ans' claims. Give us a burden of proof where the benefit of thedoubt truly goes to the petitioner. Take away this idea that this isa waiver of sovereign immunity and that everything should be nar-rowly construed against the claimants. That is not the case. Thisis a compensation program; it is remedial. The benefit of the doubtshould be in the favor of the claimants in these cases, and if thisprogram doesn't start working, something is going to happen. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov in a case the way I used to prove in con- tingency litigation. It was not uncommon for me to spend $50,000 on a case to prove causation \u2014hiring experts, performing epidemio- logical studies, performing biological testing programs. I can 't af- ford to do that in this program. Today, when I am finally com-pensated with the meager compensation that I get from this pro-gram and the expense reimbursement, I am paying yesterday 's bills. That is why none of my compatriots, none of the litigation law- yers in this country are willing to stay involved in this program.You heard from one of the claimants that her firm is no longer tak-ing any vaccine cases. It is a respectable, well-respected plaintiffs ' firm. Those firms will not get involved in these cases, because theycan't get paid on time; they can 't get their expenses reimbursed until the end of the case; they cannot afford to handle these cases. The war chest that I once carried when I was in contingency liti- gation is gone. I can no longer afford to do the things that I needto do. I am embarrassed by the limited amount of things that I cando to prosecute these cases. And I would say to Congressman Bur-ton, sure I will be happy to represent your grandchildren, but canyou come up with $40,000 or $50,000 to help me do the studies nec-essary to prove causation in these cases? Because the Governmentwon't do it, and there is a reason why they won 't. They feel like if they show or demonstrate that there is a problem with a vaccine,then people are going to be afraid, and people are going to not getthe vaccines. Let me just say\u2014and this is in the conclusion of my presen- tation\u2014anybody who points to this program and points to the chil- dren who are compensated and uses that as evidence that vaccinesare dangerous ought to be ashamed of themselves. And anybodywho points to this program on the other side of the case and saysthat the fact that such a small percentage are compensated showsthese vaccines are safe and people are just full of hot air, theyought to also be ashamed themselves. That is not the purpose of this program. It is not to try vaccines and determine whether they are safe. The purpose of this programis to compensate people in a fair and generous and simple way. Ifit is going to be highly adversarial, if we are going to have threeand four experts hired in every case to testify against us, then giveme the resources, give me the money to fight this battle like Iwould fight it in civil court. But I can't fight these battles the way this program is structured now. And that is why attorneys like myself are planning for the fu-ture, and the planning for the future is if this program isn 't fixed, then it will not be the model for tort reform that we all want. Itwill be a perfect example of how not to reform the tort system. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Mr. Shoemaker follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you, Mr. Shoemaker. We will now proceed with the questioning phase. And the rank- ing member and the chairman had to step out, so I am going to continue until they return. Dr. Kinsbourne, I would like to begin with you. I have to apolo- gize, I was paged out of the room by a phone call, but I was toldthat in your testimony you mentioned that after you appeared be-fore the committee the last time, you were testifying in anothercase, the objectivity of your testimony was impugned by the Gov-ernment attorney because of your willingness to testify before thecommittee. Is that correct? Dr. K INSBOURNE . That is exactly what happened. Dr. W ELDON . And what was the name of the attorney who made that claim? Dr. K INSBOURNE . Her name is Hewitt. Dr. W ELDON . And what is her position? Is she Department of Justice? Dr. K INSBOURNE . Department of Justice, yes. Dr. W ELDON . Could we get a copy of that exchange between you and her for the record, and I ask unanimous consent that it be in-cluded in the record. What was the nature of her argument? Could you just go over that? Let me just explain, the reason I am bringing this up is I am very disturbed by this. Because if this means that every time wepetition an attorney to provide us with testimony that the Govern-ment attorneys who are trying to protect this huge trust fund forsome reason, I don 't understand\u2014it is growing, and yet they keep trying to protect it \u2014then we are going to have a hard time getting people to objectively tell us what the problems are in this system.And I find that testimony you provided extremely disturbing. Youare free to proceed. I am curious to know what was the nature ofthe exchange? Dr. K INSBOURNE . As I said, I do have the transcript, and I will make it available. Dr. W ELDON . Just summarize it. Dr. K INSBOURNE . What happened was that in her cross examina- tion of me, she produced my written testimony to the previous com-mittee meeting as an exhibit; had me identify it; had me read pas-sages out of it into the record; did not, in fact, challenge anythingI said; asked me no questions about what I said, but establishedthat this was my document, this was my testimony. Dr. W ELDON . As I understand it, though, reviewing your personal background, you have a pretty impressive record of working onboth sides of this issue, correct? Dr. K INSBOURNE . I have an impressive record \u2014thank you, sir\u2014 of working of both sides of issues; of plaintiff and defense. How-ever, in the claims court, it is not customary for the Departmentof Justice to include experts who testified on the other side. So, Ihave not, in fact, had the opportunity of testifying for respondent,although I have expressed my willingness to do so in appropriatecases. Now, when it came to closing argument, Ms. Hewitt said to the judge ''The fact that Dr. Kinsbourne did testify to a congressional VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 had criticisms of the process shows that he is to some extent an advocate, '' and she compared me unfavorably, in terms of my credibility as a medical expert, with her medical ex-pert who she felt was not an advocate. Dr. W ELDON . One other question I have for you. You provided in your testimony some information on a report from the Institute ofMedicine, actually, a fairly old report from the Institute of Medi-cine\u2014I think it was 1991 or 1992 \u2014where they recommended a se- ries of studies that needed to be done to get at some of these issuesof low incidence of very serious side effects regarding vaccines. Iwould like to ask that we get a copy of that from you and get thatincluded in the record. I ask unanimous consent for that. Mr. M ICA[presiding]. Without objection, so ordered. Dr. W ELDON . As I understand it, none of those studies have been done. Is that correct? Dr. K INSBOURNE . To my knowledge. The point is not only that when they asked whether particular vaccines do or do not in prin-ciple cause certain outcomes, they have no studies to refer to, andthey were stuck with this and went out of their way to make thatpoint, and I will provide the information. Since that time, this problem has become more serious as new vaccines are being introduced, which almost without exceptionwould have been classified by them in this way had they beenavailable at the time. In other words, vaccines about which onereally simply couldn 't say one way or the other whether the rela- tionship existed, not because studies conflict, because studies don 't exist; have not in fact been done. The hepatitis B issue that Mr. Shoemaker mentioned is a major problem in this case. Hepatitis B has been put on the table for avery rare, almost unknown complication \u2014anaphylaxis. But the im- pression that many people have that hepatitis B can cause liverdamage, it can cause autoimmune disorders, has not been ad-dressed by systematic scientific study. So, if one is asked, as onecurrently is, to proceed on a causation-in-fact basis and one has toshow biological plausibility, one has to show that actually, in fact,there is evidence that the vaccine did that based on available sci-entific evidence, there is no such evidence, and the petitioner is outof luck. Mr. S HOEMAKER . May I add to what Dr. Kinsbourne just said? Dr. W ELDON . Sure. Mr. S HOEMAKER . There are studies and then there are studies. To use the hepatitis B example, we are seeing a lot of cases of post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis \u2014that is injury to the nervous system, the brain, the spinal cord. So, what does the study do? What is thestudy that is mounted to look at that? It is a study to see if thereis an increased incidence of multiple sclerosis in hepatitis B vac-cine\u2014people who receive the vaccine. Now, multiple sclerosis is this great big category of injuries. All it means is multiple lesions in time and space. Post-vaccinalencephalomyelitis is a very little piece, and actually if it is post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis, it shouldn 't even be included in mul- tiple sclerosis, because it has another cause. So, you look at this great, big universe and study it to try to dis- prove a relationship between vaccine and post-vaccinal VerDate 11-MAY-2000 is the study that is being done, then I say forget the study, save your money. Don 't spend your money on a multiple sclerosis study, because there are so many causes ofmultiple sclerosis that if you try and look and see if the total uni-verse of multiple sclerosis because of hepatitis B vaccine, you won 't find it. I can tell you that before you spend the first dollar, andthat is not the type of study that needs to be done. So, there are studies, and then there are studies, and you have to do the right kind of study. What we are seeing in those cases,for instance, is people that have a reaction to the first vaccine inthe series, they start getting better, having some recovery. Theyget the second vaccine in the series, and they have a much moreimmediate and more pronounced response to the vaccine. It is what the Government and other doctors refer to as positive rechallenge. In other words, once could be a coincidence, but twice,now you see what is happening. You have heard this from one ofthe victims who testified today where it wasn 't until after the third vaccination that they finally said, ''OK, we have got to stop these vaccines.'' Dr. W ELDON . I would like to ask all three of you to comment on this one question or concern I have. I am a physician, and this ismy first political job, and the devil is always in the details whenwe try to address these problems. And now we have an act, theVaccine Compensation Program; it had very good intentions; it hasgone astray, and, frankly, I think the attorneys have led us astray.Not to impugn you, Mr. Shoemaker or your profession, but it is justby nature, as Mr. Gale said, you put two attorneys in the room andit becomes who is going to win. And one side has more funds intheir pocket to fight their battle. I don 't think you can get the at- torneys out of the room, frankly. I don 't see how you can do that, and that is one question I have \u2014could you do this without attor- neys? I don't know if it is possible. But one of the questions I have is should we have language in the law that requires that the plaintiffs ' attorneys get compensated better, because this system is terrible the way it is described wherethere are virtually no attorneys willing to practice this type of lawanymore? I believe that is going to need to be addressed. And, No. 2, do we need to mandate that a certain amount of the money gets dispersed each year? Because if you are going to haveall these Department of Justice attorneys going to work each day,and their definition of winning is that no money is given out, andthey have got the deeper pockets to defend their position, then theultimate solution may be to mandate that a certain amount of themoney each year be given out and that it not become a case of whowins and who loses. I am just looking toward, ultimately, the day when we begin to draft language that will attempt to try to address the problemswith this program, because I think we are going to have to do that.It is critically important that we protect the Vaccination Program. Mr. S HOEMAKER . If I may respond to that. I hope you will read what I have written about interim fees and costs, because the Gov-ernment experts, when they testify in these cases, they submitbills; they are paid within 30 days. I could have brought a stackof bills here today from doctors that I can 't afford to pay right now. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov kind of hard for me as a plaintiffs ' lawyer to go out and beg some doctor to testify for me in a case when I can 't pay them up front, and I tell them, ''You may have to wait years to be com- pensated at the end of this program. '' I mean, that is me asking them to testify versus somebody calling them from Health and Human Services and asking them to testify. That is not quite aneven playing field, and I hope you will read that section about in-terim fees and costs. It is important that we be allowed to petition for costs. I just filed 130 hepatitis B claims. The filing fees alone were $16,000. Ifit costs me $500 a case to obtain medical records, multiply that by130, you are looking at $30,000 or $40,000 to collect records. Now,if I can get an expert at $1,000 apiece to review those claims, thatis $130,000. I am paying yesterday 's bills with the fees that I am getting today on cases that have been going on for years. I have remortgaged my house twice. I have taken my kids out of private school and put them in public school. I have gotten ridof the boat. I am no longer living the life of a contingent fee lawyer,and my friends think I am an idiot to stay involved in this pro-gram, and maybe I am, but I am dedicated to the program. But ifwe are going to have to fight causation battles in these cases, giveus the resources to do it. And I reject the Government 's proposal to give us interim costs after an entitlement hearing. That is a token offer, and I reject it.If you are going to give us interim costs and fees, give it to us atleast several times during the course of a proceeding so we can fi-nance the cases and pay for them. Dr. W ELDON . Dr. Gale, did you have anything you wanted to add to that? Dr. G ALE. Yes, if I might. There are ways to streamline the proc- ess and to make the process less cumbersome, to have the processtake much less time to compensate people. It could be an adminis-trative process. That isn 't what it is now. Now, it clearly is a litigative process. I don 't have experience in civil court, so I don 't have a basis for comparison, but I am told that it is a milder expe-rience, but it is still a litigative process. There would be no need to review records if there weren 't a table to compare medical records against. And there would be no reasonto have medical opinions if we didn 't have a table. So, clearly, the table, which is the linchpin of the program means that there willbe a need for physicians on both sides to review records and comeup with professional opinions about what likely happened to thisyoungster, when did it happen, and whether or not it was causedby something other than the vaccine. That could be eliminated. People could fill out a simple, plain English form, explain what happened to their youngster, submit aform, and be compensated. That could happen. I can 't do that, but the Congress could do that, if that is what it envisions for the pro-gram. If it maintains the table, however, then there will be physi-cians involved. It does not, however, have to be an adversarialprocess if there is a bank of physicians reviewing records with thebroadest possible definition of the injuries. There are three things that can be done to the table, because the table essentially mandates three things. It describes the injuries VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov It describes the timeframe during which the onset of the injury must occur, and then it describes, I suppose youcould call it, ''an out,'' and that is, if there is a factor readily identi-fiable separate from the vaccine that could have caused that injuryin that timeframe, then that becomes a non-compensable case. For example, you could do away with the provision for factors un- related; that is, you wouldn 't bother to look for a factor unrelated; you wouldn't care. Then a prescribed injury occurring within a cer-tain timeframe, no matter what the child 's medical record or his- tory suggested, would be compensable. Second, you could expand the timeframe. For example, in pertus- sis vaccines for encephalopathy it is currently 3 days. You couldmake it 7; you could make it 14; you could make it a month ormore. That clearly would expand, not only scientifically, the prob-ability that you would not have permitted any potentially vaccine-caused injuries to fall through the cracks, but necessarily, usingthe principle, I suppose, of unanticipated consequence, you wouldinclude an awful lot of youngsters with neurologic diseases that al-most certainly couldn 't have been caused by the vaccine. But that is a decision you could make; you could expand the time window. And last but not least, you could change, again, the definitions in the table, if you keep a table, and make them as broad as pos-sible. Mr. S HOEMAKER . In that regard, making them broad, if you look at the IOM report that you referred to, there are many conditionsthat describe, with reference to various vaccines, where the reportwill say specifically this condition \u2014like, let us take brachial neuri- tis\u2014this condition is biologically plausible. In other words, it is plausible that the vaccine caused it and that there have been casereports in the literature reporting this, but there have been no con-trolled epidemiological studies performed, and therefore their con-clusion is that there is not enough evidence to either accept or re-ject the fact that this was caused by the vaccine. If those were put in the table, if you included all those things where it is biological plausible and where there are case reportsand there haven 't been epidemiological studies, you would include a lot more cases within the table. I like the idea of eliminating thealternate causes to be able to streamline the table. Sure, you wouldovercompensate more than you are now, but so what? Otherwise,you end up with people on Medicaid; you end up with people withother programs. I mean, let us open this program up and make itcompensate, make it do some good. Dr. W ELDON . Did you have anything you wanted to add to that, Dr. Kinsbourne? Dr. K INSBOURNE . Yes, sir. I think that Dr. Gale 's suggestions are very humane, and I could certainly not take issue with them. I dothink that the medicine, as I have explained, is particularly tech-nical here, and it is not always obvious to a layperson what is orwhat is not a vaccine injury, or even what could be or what couldnot be a vaccine injury. I have reviewed many files sent to me, andmany times I am unable to support the claims, because I can tellthat this really wasn 't the vaccine. So, I think regardless of how one sets one 's criteria, we still need some legal assistance and some medical consultation, but it could VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov awful lot less than currently happens. It could absolutely streamline in the ways that my colleagues have suggested. Mr. S HOEMAKER . You still need to leave open the possibility of people that don't fit a table, even an expanded table. You need to leave open the possibility of being able to prove causation-in-fact inthose cases, and I would encourage you in those cases to adopt thestandard of proof that is used in veterans ' claims. If you look at what I have written here on veterans ' claims\u2014and if I can point to that page very quickly since I didn 't follow my script here today \u2014it is at the bottom of page 8 and on page 9. I have put in the specific language that is used in 38 U.S.C. section5107 for veterans ' claims. And it has the language in it where it says specifically ''The benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. '' It is taking it out of the civil context. If we are not going to be in civil courts and if we are notgoing to be litigious, if we are going to make this a program thatis non-litigious, then let us use a standard like this. I think the military analogy that I referred to at the beginning about our pediatric warriors, it makes sense to use the same stand-ard of proof that we use in veterans ' claims. So, I would encourage you to look at that on page 9, and it is specific language; it is beingused somewhere else; it is nothing we have to reinvent; it is lan-guage that is there; it has got material behind it; it can easily beplugged into this statute. Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. M ICA. Thank you, and thank you for leading a discussion on the questioning that I think will be helpful as we try to find someway to fix a well-intended program that has some very distinctproblems. The only question I might have is if we could take this totally out of the legal realm. Dr. Kinsbourne, you thought it might haveto be a little of both, but if this could be made strictly an adminis-trative process and then give recourse, if there isn 't satisfaction, into the legal realm, do you think that might be something thatcould be done? Dr. K INSBOURNE . I think yes, if the potential petitioners had some guidance counseling from informed people. Some people sim-ply don't have very clear ideas either way of what is a vaccine in-jury. As you have heard, often doctors don 't have a clear idea of what is a vaccine injury; in fact, the information to doctors hasmostly been, ''Oh, vaccine injuries are overstated. '' That is more what they are being told than how to recognize them when theyoccur. So, somebody with, I think, both medical and legal knowl-edge should be able to advise them. It doesn 't have to be in legal proceedings. Mr. S HOEMAKER . I think given the history \u2014thank you, sir\u2014I think given the history of the way the Department of Health andHuman Services has administered this program, making it morerestrictive and more difficult and more litigious and more \u2014very difficult to prove cases \u2014I think if the administrative process takes lawyers out of it and if claimants don 't have lawyers representing them, then all I can say is I will be waiting at the other end tofile their civil lawsuits. Mr. M ICA. Dr. Gale, do you want to respond? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 ALE. I am not sure that I have more to add to that. Mr. M ICA. Well, I think you have pointed out that we could es- tablish some broader parameters for acceptance as possible victims of vaccine injury, and I think you both have \u2014both Dr. Gale and Dr. Kinsbourne have pointed out the difficulty in pinpointing theconnection, although you make some assumptions within certainparameters. I think you said that you could identify those casesand medically it may be a guesstimate but a pretty accurate as-sumption. And some that fall outside of those parameters could behandled through litigation, but for the most part we could probablyexpedite many of these cases by going to an administrative proce-dure. If we had a panel of medical experts to \u2014if we set the general pa- rameters and made them broad, as you said, Dr. Gale, and thenhad a review by a panel of medical personnel, then we went basi-cally to a mandatory arbitration or mediation, do you think thatwould work, Dr. Kinsbourne? Dr. K INSBOURNE . If the panel were given very clear guidelines as to the criteria that they should adhere to, doctors will \u2014then natu- rally think the way they do. They will be skeptical; they will becritical; they will have a high standard for accepting any diagnosis,and it will be the easiest thing in the world for them to say, ''I am not convinced,'' and so on. They would have to be told very specifi-cally at what level of confidence a positive decision needs to bemade. If that were done, I think it would work. Mr. M ICA. Dr. Gale, did you want to respond? Dr. G ALE. I would agree with that. Like Dr. Kinsbourne, I have reviewed records for the Department of Health and Human Serv-ices that seemed immediately, upon review, to fulfill the qualifica-tions in the table and in my opinion were compensable. That is avery short process. You read the record, make a call later that day,file a report. That is compensable. If you keep the concept of a table, that is, if there is a reference to which injuries or conditions are going to be compensable, whichmeans that you will not compensate others, and if there is goingto be a time window, which means that somebody will be anoutlier, that is the consequence of that. If the window is at 3 days,if you are on the 4th day, you will be an outlier. That will changethe nature of how your petition is handled. If you expand the win-dow to 7 days, 8 days will make you an outlier. So, if you keep those two elements of the table for physicians to refer to, and then you will have to decide do you or don 't you want to keep the concept of factors unrelated to the vaccine as part ofthe process for physicians to review. That is, if we can clearly iden-tify that a youngster has a tumor that accounts for his or her neu-rological disorder, do we take that into consideration in decidingwhether a case is compensable or is it sufficient for the disorderoccurring within a time window to simply occur, in which case thecase would be compensable in spite of the tumor or in spite of theautomobile accident? If you eliminate, as preposterous as this sounds, but it is prepos- terous examples that usually help us to focus on what we aredoing, a preposterous example would be a youngster who gets animmunization for school at age 5 or 6 on a Monday and is struck VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov automobile on Tuesday and goes into a coma and comes to the hospital and is never well again. If there is no factor unrelatedto the vaccine as part of the reference table; that is, if you havea condition, encephalopathy, that occurs within 3 days of the ad-ministration of the vaccine, and in this case, in my hypothetical,it would\u2014that would become a compensable case, and that is fine,if that is what you intend to do. You would need to codify thoseguidelines so that if physicians are going to participate in the proc-ess, they know what you want of us. Mr. S HOEMAKER . To expand a little bit on that, I think I would like to represent the outliers in this case. I will never forget a caseI had where it was determined that the residual seizure disorderstarted 75 hours after the vaccination instead of 72 hours after. So,I would certainly encourage expanding the table, including thesecases that I talked with Dr. Weldon about where there are \u2014where there is this information that it is biologically plausible, there arecase reports, people suspect there could be relationship, but ithasn't been proven or disproven because there have been no epide- miological studies. Get all these things into the table, grossly re-duce the alternate cause aspects of the table, and if those twothings are done, I would say, yes, I am all in favor of improvingthe table to include more cases, to make it a more inclusive pro-gram. But then the next step is, I think you have to go beyond that for these other cases, and there are going to still be causation-in-factcases out there that don 't fit whatever table you come up with. I am still encouraging you to look at what I have written about mak-ing it clear that this is not a waiver of sovereign immunity, thisis a remedial program; making it clear and changing that burdenof proof to what is used in veterans ' cases, and doing the things that I have asked in here. And that brings me really to an issue of the statute of limita- tions. There are all kinds of statutes of limitation in these cases,and one of the things I keep thinking about as I puzzle over whatto do with them is why do we have a statute of limitations? Thisis a compensation program. Leave the States to take care of thestatutes of limitation as to whether people can file civil lawsuits.That is their job; let them do it. This program won 't affect it. I suppose as long as you are in the program, it will toll the State statute of limitation. That is fine; I agree with that. But why dowe even have a statute of limitations in this? I get calls all thetime. I get calls from people who were vaccinated August 5, 1997,with hepatitis B vaccine. They had to file their claim by August 6,1999, whereas somebody vaccinated 2 days later had until August7, 2000. Now, that doesn 't make any sense. The only purpose of that is to get lawyers in trouble and have them call their mal-practice carrier because they screwed up. It doesn 't make any sense at all. I applaud the Department of Justice for asking for a 6-year stat- ute, but why have any statutes of limitation at all? I am getting calls from people \u2014now, in the literature, it is coming out about whether or not MMR vaccine causes autism. Well, eventually thatmay be proven, and if it is proven, what about all those old cases VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov from MMR vaccine? Are they out of luck or can they file the claim? You are going to have all kinds of problems \u2014if you change the statute of limitation to 6 years, what do I tell the person who wasdismissed 2 years ago because he came to me 3 years and 6 daysafter the statute of limitation, and his child 's seizures had started 3 days after the vaccination? So, when he walked into my office thefirst time it was too late. I filed the claim; I got dismissed, becauseit was too late. I was bound to 3 years. Now, if you add 6 years soon enough, I should be able to refile his claim I hope. But what if you don 't get it added until it is more than 6 years since the vaccine? Now, I can 't file his claim, but I can still go into civil court and sue, because it is a child, and inmost States, the statute of limitations is tolled during minority. Itmakes no sense. Anybody that thinks this an easy program to work in as a law- yer\u2014I can guarantee you there are plenty of pitfalls in this pro-gram, and we all are looking over our shoulder every day becauseof the myriad of problems that we have like this. And I could goon and on and talk about them, but why even have a statue of limi-tations? Mr. M ICA. Mr. Burton. Mr. B URTON . Let me just say, Mr. Shoemaker, and I apologize, I just walked in, but if you could send the chairman of the sub-committee and myself a list of things that you think could orshould be done to eliminate these inequities, we will see if we can 't work on it together \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HOEMAKER . Thank you, sir. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. Mr. Mica and myself, to get them cor- rected. Mr. S HOEMAKER . Thank you, sir. Mr. M ICA. I would like to thank each of the panelists on our sec- ond panel for their insight and for their recommendations. We aregoing to try our best to see how we can reform this Vaccine InjuryCompensation Program that was set up with good intent but hasgone astray here. We particularly appreciate Dr. Kinsbourne and your besmirched reputation having dealt with our committee. We hope that you re-cover, but professionally we admire you and thank you again foroffering your testimony. Once again, sometimes people come backfor a second dose of abuse. Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Yes, I am sorry I missed your testimony, Dr. Kinsbourne. My assistant just told me how you were discriminatedagainst, I guess you would say, because you testified before ourcommittee. We will be back in touch with you and talk to you aboutthat as well. Thank you, sir. Dr. K INSBOURNE . Thank you, sir. Mr. M ICA. Thank you. We will dismiss this panel and call our third panel. Our third panel consists of two witnesses, Mr. Thomas E. Balbier, Jr. He is the Director of the National Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program with the Department of Health and HumanServices. The second witness is Mr. John L. Euler, and he is the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 the Torts Branch, Civil Division of the Depart- ment of Justice. Gentleman, if you will stand and be sworn.[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. M ICA. The witnesses answered in the affirmative. As I said, if you have any lengthy statements or documentation you would like to be made part of the record, on unanimous con-sent request, that will be done. First, we will recognize the Director of the National Vaccine In- jury Compensation Program, Mr. Thomas E. Balbier, Jr. You are welcome, sir, and recognized. STATEMENTS OF THOMAS E. BALBIER, JR., DIRECTOR, NA- TIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM, DE- PARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; JOHN L. EULER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, TORTS BRANCH, CIVIL DIVI-SION, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Mr. B ALBIER . Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am pleased to be here this morning to talk to you about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Withme to provide additional information if needed, are Dr. GeoffreyEvans, the Medical Director for the program, and Mr. David Benorfrom our Office of the General Counsel. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has been hailed by Secretary Shalala as the cornerstone of our Nation 's suc- cessful childhood immunization program. It provides a unique serv-ice to families suffering through one of the most difficult experi-ences imaginable. It makes a system available through which fami-lies can receive financial help in the most efficient and fair mannerpossible, while still preserving their rights to file suit in the tortsystem. The program significantly reduces, but it cannot eliminate, the tension and adversity inherent within any litigation process. Aswith every Federal benefit program, there are going to be eligibilityrequirements which seem unfair to some applicants. I can assureyou that everyone involved in the administration of the programmakes a concerted effort to ensure that fairness is the operatingprinciple in dealing with every family filing a claim under the pro-gram. We have been listening to concerns raised by those who may feel the system has been unfair and more adversarial than they had ex-pected. It is critical to remember that although the program is farless adversarial than the tort system, it does encourage anyonewho believes they have a condition caused or aggravated by a child-hood vaccine to file a petition for compensation. Petitioners ' rights are vigorously defended and advocated by their attorneys, who arepaid regardless of whether petitioners are compensated. However,it was never intended to serve as a compensation source for a widerange of naturally occurring illnesses or conditions, which unfortu-nately affect many of our children. The process of determining whether, and at what level, com- pensation should be awarded will always involve conflicting opin-ions and a natural tension. This has been recognized by everyoneinvolved in the day-to-day administration of the program as well as VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov Commission on Childhood Vaccines [ACCV], which was established by the act to ''advise the Secretary \u2014of HHS\u2014on the implementation of the program. '' The members of the ACCV include parents of children injured by vaccines, their attorneys, representatives of vaccine companies, andrecognized medical experts in childhood diseases. This diverse bodyhas provided constant oversight of the operation of the program,advised the Secretary on each and every modification of the vaccineinjury table, and has made numerous legislative and administra-tive recommendations over the years aimed at improving the oper-ation of the program. Most recently, it developed and approved a series of rec- ommendations that form the basis for legislation recently proposedby the Secretary of HHS. These proposals include many enhance-ments aimed at making the program more streamlined and less ad-versarial for its intended beneficiaries. The proposals would doublethe statutory time limit for filing a claim, expand compensation tofamilies, and simplify the process for adjudicating claims. I would like to talk for a minute about concerns related to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund. The trust fund was es-tablished to ensure that a constant source of funding would beavailable for the payment of compensation under the program. Thetrust fund is financed by an excise tax of 75 cents per dose imposedon each vaccine covered under the program. At this time, the trustfund balance is in excess of $1.4 billion. During fiscal year 1998,the trust fund received total income of $183 million, with $116 mil-lion coming from excise tax revenue. The remaining $67 millioncame from interest on the balances in the trust fund and morethan covered the 1999 outlays for awards, and for attorney fees andcosts, of just less than $50 million. The trust fund should be viewed as a specialized public health insurance fund, maintained with adequate reserves to handle li-ability exposure as new childhood vaccines come to the market andas important ongoing surveillance activities of the Public HealthService spawn new scientific studies of theoretical vaccine-relatedadverse events. Recently, coverage under the program was expanded to include four additional vaccines for which 279 petitions have been filed. Inaddition, there are more than 300 vaccines in various phases of re-search and development, some of which may eventually be addedfor coverage under the program and result in increased liability. There is good reason for the public to have confidence in the overall operation of the program. There have been two comprehen-sive, independent program evaluations conducted since the pro-gram was first enacted. The first, conducted by the HHS Office ofInspector General in 1992, concluded, ''The case process is efficient; the program is well organized with good procedures; no unneces-sary duplication of effort exists; roles and responsibilities are clear-ly defined; coordination and communication among the Federalagencies is strong, and petitioners and their attorneys are gen-erally satisfied with their experience in the program. '' The second study was done just last year when the Federal Judi- cial Center completed a report on the program, which concluded, inpart, that ''the case-management innovations and handling of ex- VerDate in the VICP. '' Currently, the General Accounting Office is conducting a review of the program at the re- quest of Senator Jeffords, and the GAO has indicated that the re-sults of the review should be released by the end of this year. All indications are that this program is working very much as in- tended by Congress. There will always be program areas that canbe improved, and we continue to implement initiatives to addressthese areas. The program has always been open to advice from allinterested parties, and mechanisms are in place to assure that thevaried interests of families, health care professionals, attorneys,and the vaccine industry are represented at a regular public forum. The ACCV, with its widely diverse membership, brings a good balance of perspective and has been instrumental in identifyingprogram improvements that have consensus support. With strongACCV support for the administration 's proposed legislative agenda to make this innovative program even better, it is now up to Con-gress to move these important changes forward as quickly as pos-sible so that our children can reap the benefits of the program ''in the most efficient and fair manner possible. '' Thank you once again for allowing me to come here today to tell you about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Iwill be pleased to answer any additional questions which you mayhave. [The prepared statement of Mr. Balbier, ICA. Thank you, and we will suspend questions until we have heard from our other panelist. Mr. John L. Euler, Deputy Director of the Torts Branch, Civil Di- vision, Department of Justice, you are recognized. Mr. E ULER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the sub- committee. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today. So that I may limit my remarks, I request that my full writtenstatement be entered into the record. Mr. M ICA. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. E ULER . Thank you, sir. Congress in the 1980 's was faced with a looming public health crisis concerning immunizations which involved complex, hotly de-bated medical issues overlaid with the emotion of personal loss andtragedy in individual cases. In order both to provide a more fea-sible avenue of compensation and stabilize the national immuniza-tion policy, Congress established this program. Petitioners are afforded a less adversarial system with free coun- sel in which their meaningful participation is assured. The debate,the emotion, the complexity of the cases were not eliminated andnever will be, but an effective mechanism is in place. As a result,almost 5,000 cases have been resolved and numerous families com-pensated while the supply of life-saving vaccines has been assured. The act of 1986 created a much needed alternative to products liability and medical malpractice litigation for vaccine injuries. Itremoves many of the more difficult elements of proof that plaintiffsfaced in traditional civil court. The program is no-fault. In otherwords, claimants need not establish that the vaccine was defectiveor that the doctor was negligent. The process itself is characterizedby streamlining features. Neither the rules of evidence or proce-dure apply rendering virtually all evidence that petitioners seek topresent admissible. The special masters make every effort to allowthe parties to present their best case. By design, this is not a straight claims process nor traditional litigation but rather a hybrid system that blends the best of both,even if it cannot escape entirely the frustrations inherent in anyadjudication. Critical to the prompt resolution of cases is the com-pleteness of the petition. This is a front-loaded system. In otherwords, petitioners are responsible for identifying the specific natureof their claim and providing all medical records and related docu-ments. When the initial filing is incomplete, petitioners are grantedliberal extensions. If there is delay, it is most often because of anincomplete record or an underdeveloped medical position. The paceof the process is largely controlled by petitioners. The role of the Justice Department is to implement the statute and uphold the provisions of the act. In other words, we help en-sure that compensation is provided to those who meet the criteriadetermined by Congress. We are obliged to protect the trust fundagainst claims by those who have not suffered a vaccine-related in-jury. In the spirit of the act, we do this in a far less adversarial man- ner than defendants in civil litigation. We participate in an earlytelephonic conference with petitioners and the court to discuss thedeficiencies in the petition. The format of the hearings is informaland accommodating. The hearings are undertaken with a sensitiv- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 that these cases involve highly emotional and per- sonal issues often concerning severely injured children. With regard to determining compensation, Congress has set forth a detailed list of compensable items. While it is often time-consum-ing, the key is that the program process is far more thoughtful andtailored than other systems. In most vaccine cases, the goal is noless than establishing a custom tailored plan of life time medicalcare, frequently a cooperative effort. I estimate that 90 percent ofthe damages cases are settled without a hearing. The Department published a packet entitled, ''Steps to Stream- lining Damages Under the Program, '' which sets forth ways to ex- pedite the damages phase. We distribute this document to counsel,and I have copies of it with me today. We also issued a guide toassist petitioners ' attorneys with attorneys ' fees and costs, and I have copies of that as well. In spite of these numerous accommodations, resolution of these cases simply cannot always be accomplished quickly. There existsan obvious tension between efficiency and due process. The issuescan be difficult and complex. The amount sought is frequently inexcess of several million dollars. In short, I believe the program is working as designed. As with any Government program, with specific criteria, there will be appli-cants who are dissatisfied, even among those who are awardedcompensation. Yet we cannot ignore the statutory criteria or theconsensus of the scientific community on medical causation issues.It is a program that relies heavily upon the most current and accu-rate scientific evidence available \u2014it does in fact rely on the most current and accurate scientific evidence available. In resolving claims, the court, consistent with statutory guide- lines, does not require scientific certainty, simply a preponderanceof the evidence. Mr. Chairman, thank you again for this opportunity. I will be pleased to answer any of your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Euler follows:] VerDate ICA. Thank you, and I would like to yield now to the chair- man of the full committee for questions. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Euler, I understand your employee, Ms. Hewitt, was the one who challenged the credibility of Dr. Kinsbourne when he testified recently at a case. Can you tell me why that happened? Mr. E ULER . According to Dr. Kinsbourne, Mr. Chairman, Ms. Hewitt entered into the record the fact that Dr. Kinsbourne hadtestified. Mr. B URTON . What does that have to do with anything? Mr. E ULER . Well, it has to do with cross examination. Normally, in cross examination, previous testimony of a witness, things thathave been published, things that they have said have been used.Certainly, petitioner 's counsel will use things that experts have said in an effort to cross examine. Mr. B URTON . So, it was assumed that he had a bias, because he testified before our committee and what he said? Mr. E ULER . I have not seen the record. I understand from Dr. Kinsbourne that she argued bias. Now, this is a pending case \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Yes. Mr. E ULER [continuing]. And I hesitate to talk about a pending case. Mr. B URTON . Ms. Hewitt works for you, doesn 't she? Mr. E ULER . Yes, she does. Mr. B URTON . Here is what she said: ''The fact that he recently testified before Congress about a number of issues, but in particu-lar about his views on the problems with this program, I think alsoshows that to some degree he is an advocate on behalf of the peti-tioners, and Dr. Holmes is not. '' I didn't know that testifying before Congress impeded people 's ability to testify in courts of law. Mr. E ULER . Well, I\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I think you ought to talk to Ms. Hewlitt \u2014Hewitt, or whatever her name is. I mean, it seems to me, you don 't know everything that she said, and she is your employee, isn 't she? Mr. E ULER . That is correct. Mr. B URTON . And you haven 't talked to her about this? Mr. E ULER . I have not. But I appreciate \u2014and I think that point that Dr. Weldon made is a good one. I think he raised the pointthat this might chill expert testimony. And in that respect, I thinkwe are duly rebuked. I don 't think we should be \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, we have had problems like this with the Jus- tice Department before. There have been 6,000 cases filed, 3,500 dismissed, 1,400 settled, and 1,100 pending according to the records we have. This is sup-posed to be a non-adversarial process, and yet when you were testi-fying, Mr. Balbier, you said it is less adversarial. It is supposed tobe non-adversarial, isn 't it? Mr. B ALBIER . That is not my understanding of the statute at all. Mr. B URTON . Well, Mr. Waxman who wrote the law said it was. Mr. B ALBIER . I heard Mr. Waxman say that the program is sup- posed to be less adversarial than the tort system. If it truly were a non-adversarial system \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 I guess we could go back and read the record ear- lier today, but I was sitting here, and I am pretty sure he said non- adversarial. But, anyhow, let us not dwell on that. Mr. B ALBIER . I would think that if it truly were a non-adversar- ial system, you would not have advocates representing the familiesthat are affected by childhood vaccines. Mr. B URTON . The reason you have advocates appearing on behalf of these people is because their kids have been harmed, and theyare not getting proper treatment by the Federal Government, andbecause of that, they have to hire attorneys. You know, my two grandkids, we have tried to find attorneys. Do you know how hard it is to find an attorney to take one of thesecases because of the way you guys run them around? They don 't want to do it. They don 't want to take 2, 3, or 4 years, because they know you can't afford to pay it. You know, you said that among those that participate in setting the standards in the decisionmaking process were the vaccine-pro-ducing companies. Is that correct? Mr. B ALBIER . That is correct. Mr. B URTON . Why? Mr. B ALBIER . The statute requires, or sets out who serves on the Advisory Commission of Childhood Vaccines. Mr. B URTON . And the vaccine companies are required to sit on that board to make \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . Yes, they are, sir. Mr. B URTON . Well, I think that is something that should be looked into. Why should those who have a vested interest be involved in the decisionmaking process. The reason this system was set up in thefirst place was because the pharmaceutical companies said thatthey were in jeopardy of having severe lawsuits that could jeopard-ize the viability of the companies. And so what Congress said was, ''OK, we are going to try to help you out by coming up with a non-adversarial situation, procedure,where you won't be jeopardized, but money will be put into a fundfor each shot that is given to protect the people who might beharmed.'' And, so it has become adversarial, and they are involved in the decisionmaking process. That makes no sense. It just doesn 't make any sense to me. They should not be involved. You should havemedical professionals and scientists who understand, like Dr. Ken-nedy who appeared before this committee, who said that 50 percentof the DPT shots \u201450 percent of those who got the DPT shot had adverse effects. He said 50 percent, and he is a scientist that hasbeen working on this at the University of Oklahoma. And yet the people who make the DPT shots can be involved in the decisionmaking process when we are talking about settlements.I don't understand that. And the DPT shots are still being given even though we have known for years that they have 50 percentside effects; some severe, some not so severe. I mean, these pharmaceutical companies make major invest- ments in vaccines; I understand that. And they have a very strongfinancial interest. And if something goes wrong with these vaccinesand they are taken off of the market, they suffer severe losses. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov I can understand why they want to keep those on the mar- ket and why some people maybe \u2014maybe\u2014at HHS and FDA pro- tecting and allowing them to give things that are dangerous to peo-ple these vaccines, these kids. And, so for them to be involved in any way in the decisionmaking process doesn't make any sense to me, because they do have a vest-ed interest. Mr. B ALBIER . I would agree with that. They are not involved in the decisionmaking process, sir. They are represented on the Advi-sory Commission, which is strictly advisory. They do not make anydecisions through the adjudicative process, but they do make rec-ommendations to the Secretary. Mr. B URTON . I am sure they do. Mr. B ALBIER . And there is one person representing vaccine com- panies. Mr. B URTON . Yes, I know. Mr. B ALBIER . We also have petitioners, attorneys; we have two parents who sit on that \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . You know, Shakespeare said, ''A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. '' If they are involved in the process at all because they have a vested interest, it is a mistake, especiallythose who have a lot of money invested in vaccines that are ques-tionable. We heard just a little while ago \u2014and I am sorry if I am going too long, Mr. Chairman \u2014we heard just a little while ago about a fellow whose child suffered from polio, because they gave him livevaccine, and they have known for decades that there was that risk,while at the same time, for decades, they have dead virus vaccinesthat could be given to people that were not nearly as risky. Why was that live vaccine kept on the market all those decades? Why is the DPT shot being used today when we had people testifyhere before the full committee that it was a problem, a danger?And then on the Advisory Committee you have the pharmaceuticalcompanies. I think it is something we need to take a hard look at. One-quarter of the claims have been adjudicated and finalized \u2014 one-quarter. So, we have 3,500 people who thought they had a le-gitimate case in a non-adversarial system. Their case was dis-missed\u2014I don't know what happened to them \u20141,100 are pending, and out of 6,000 only 1,400 have been settled. I just don't understand that. Are the decisions made by this board objective or subjective? Mr. B ALBIER . I would say that the recommendations made by our Advisory Commission are as objective as they can be, and in factwhenever anybody who serves on that commission does have avested interest on any matter that is being voted upon, they recusethemselves from a vote on that matter, which has happened fre-quently, especially with the vaccine companies ' representatives. For any issue that involves the vaccine made by the company that theyrepresent, they do not vote on that issue; they never have. Mr. B URTON . OK, we have\u2014my staff just told me they have 24 people on one of the decisionmaking bodies, and 11 of those havereceived money from the pharmaceutical companies that werebeing investigated. That is almost half. You say they all recusethemselves? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 that is a different advisory committee, I be- lieve. I believe the staff perhaps is referring to the Advisory Com- mittee on Immunization Practices, which makes recommendationson immunization policy; that is, which vaccines are given andwhen, to children. Mr. B URTON . It says it is an FDA advisory committee, Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, Center forBiologic Evaluation and Research. Mr. B ALBIER . That is yet again another advisory committee in- volved in immunization, which makes recommendations to theFood and Drug Administration for licensing. Mr. B URTON . Can you give me the makeup of the committee we are talking about? Mr. B ALBIER . Yes, I can. The Advisory Commission \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . How many of those people are physicians or sci- entists? Mr. B ALBIER . I'll be happy to answer. The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, by design of Congress, is a very diversegroup. Its purpose is to make recommendations to the Secretary onthe operation of the Compensation Program. It is comprised of ninevoting members \u2014three doctors, three lawyers, and three members of the general public. Mr. B URTON . OK, now the three doctors, where do they come from? Mr. B ALBIER . Two of them have to be pediatricians; one does not. Mr. B URTON . Do they have anything to do with HHS or FDA or any of the Government agencies? Mr. B ALBIER . That is a tough question to answer. By their very service on the commission \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I don't know if it is very tough or not. Do they have anything to do with FDA, HHS, or any governmental agency? Mr. B ALBIER . Many of the members on our commission have served on other advisory committees, for example. The currentmembers in the medical community \u2014Dr. Sam Katz has served on\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . How are they compensated? Mr. B ALBIER . They are compensated for their actual service that day on the Advisory Committee at a rate of compensation that isset in the statute. Mr. B URTON . Do any of them serve on any advisory boards or any pharmaceutical advisory boards connected with the pharmaceuticalindustry? Mr. B ALBIER . If they do, they have to indicate that to us. Mr. B URTON . Well, I would like to have, for the record, the back- grounds, the biographical sketches, and their connections for allthree of those people, if it is possible. Mr. B ALBIER . OK. [The information referred you have three lawyers. Do the lawyers rep- resent any agencies of the Federal Government in addition to serv- ing on these boards? Mr. B ALBIER . No. The statute requires that one of the lawyers has to be a petitioners ' lawyer, somebody who represents petition- ers under the compensation program. One has to be a lawyer whorepresents a vaccine company, and then \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . One of them has to be a lawyer that represents a vaccine company. Mr. B ALBIER . That is in the statute. Mr. B URTON . Why? Mr. B ALBIER . Because it is in the statue. Mr. B URTON . That seems, again, like a possible conflict of inter- est, because they represent a vaccine company who has a vested in-terest in what is paid and what isn 't paid and where they are sued. I think we need to look at that. I would like to know who that lawyer is and what companies he represents. Mr. B ALBIER . OK. Mr. B URTON . OK? Mr. B ALBIER . His name is Paul Strain. Mr. B URTON . Well, I don't want it right now. Mr. B ALBIER . We can provide that for you. Mr. B URTON . I want to have the complete background \u2014what companies he represents, what his background is, and whether ornot any of the vaccines that are under investigation as far as com-pensation being paid to patients. Mr. B ALBIER . Right. Mr. B URTON . And if he has represented in the past or currently any of those companies \u2014in the past or currently. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 about the third lawyer? Mr. B ALBIER . The third lawyer doesn 't have to be of any specified affiliation. Mr. B URTON . Could he be one that worked for a pharmaceutical company? Mr. B ALBIER . No, in my view, that would exclude him from being eligible. Mr. B URTON . Well, I want to check on that too. I want the same on his as well. And, also the lawyer that represents the families, I want to find out if any of those lawyers had any connection what-soever with any pharmaceutical companies in the past. I would like to have that in detail, and if I don 't get it, we will subpoena them. I am prepared to subpoena them, so you be sureto tell me that. Now, what about the three civilians?Mr. B ALBIER . There are three members of the general public. Within that category \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Do any of those have any connections with pharma- ceutical companies? Mr. B ALBIER . I can't answer that question. Mr. B URTON . Well, I want that too. I want to know if anybody that serves on this advisory panel \u2014any of them\u2014have any connec- tion to pharmaceutical companies, have ever received any moneysfrom pharmaceutical companies, represented them in any way, andwe are prepared to send subpoenas to any of them if we don 't get complete backgrounds on them. OK? I think I have talked long enough, Mr. Chairman.Mr. M ICA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have some questions, first, for Mr. Balbier. You have resolved 1,400 cases in which there has been compensation. Is that correct? Mr. B ALBIER . That sounds about right. Mr. M ICA. And over what period of time? Mr. B ALBIER . That is over the entire history of the program since it was first created. Mr. M ICA. Is that 1988, was it, or 1987? Are we talking about 140 cases a year? Mr. B ALBIER . There are about 100 or so claims filed, on average, each year, but the vast majority of claims filed were for years priorto the creation of the program. There was no statute of limitations. Mr. M ICA. Right now, there are about 100 cases filed per year? Mr. B ALBIER . Roughly. This year is an exception, of course, because\u2014\u2014 Mr. M ICA. Tell me about your budget. Mr. B ALBIER . Sure. Mr. M ICA. And you said this year you awarded how much in com- pensation? Mr. B ALBIER . So far this fiscal year, we have paid out $47.7 mil- lion for the\u2014\u2014 Mr. M ICA. That would be just through to August? Mr. B ALBIER . That would be through the end of August, and that is just for the pre-1988 program. Mr. M ICA. Your last complete year of awards, how much was that? That would be 1998? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 total of $135 million divided between the pre- 1988 program and the post-1988 program \u2014$79 million for the pre- 1988 program and $56 million for the post-1988 program. Mr. M ICA. How big is your staff? Mr. B ALBIER . My staff is about 21 employees. Mr. M ICA. Twenty-one employees. Full-time. And your expenses in the last fiscal year that you have a complete record for, I guess that would be 1998? Mr. B ALBIER . That would be $3 million, and that includes not only the funding for our staff but also funding for all the expertwitness testimony that is provided to the court as well. Mr. M ICA. So, $3 million and hundred and some million in awards\u2014$135 million? Mr. B ALBIER . Yes, sir. Mr. M ICA. Have there been any dramatic changes in the size of staff or expenditures for administrative costs of late, the last coupleof years? Mr. B ALBIER . No, sir. It has been $3 million since 1994. Mr. M ICA. Pretty much steady? How many of your staff are dedi- cated to analyzing the caseloads and outcomes? Mr. B ALBIER . We have physicians that work for the staff, and currently we have three full-time physicians on staff right now whoreview claims. Mr. M ICA. Are you seeking to add staff in the near future or do you have staffing requirements? Mr. B ALBIER . No, we are not seeking to add new staff. Mr. M ICA. And how do you determine the amount the medical re- viewers are paid? Mr. B ALBIER . It is really set by the standards used Government- wide for physicians. Mr. M ICA. There has been \u2014there was testimony earlier about the change in table eligibility as the result of changes in table.What is the difference in caseload before and after \u2014was it 1994 or 1995\u20141995, March 1995 table changes? Was there a substantialchange in the number of cases before and after? Mr. B ALBIER . There really isn 't; no, sir. The number of claims filed in fiscal year 1994, which was the year before the tablechange\u2014\u2014 Mr. M ICA. And how many was there? Mr. B ALBIER [continuing]. Was 106. The number of claims filed during 1995 did increase to 179, and 75 of those claims were claimsthat were filed for the period of time between when we publishedthe final rule amending the table and the 30 days later when itwent into effect. So, we received a number of claims that were filedclearly to get within the guidelines under the original table. And,so the claims went down the following year to 84 and then pickedback up to a level of 103 the year after. Mr. M ICA. Now, you cited a couple of reviews of this whole proc- ess that have been done, and I guess there is one ongoing. I guessthe Senate has requested a review also. And you say for the mostpart most folks who have had to deal with the fund are satisfied.You heard dissatisfaction about the length of time, particularly onecase that was brought to our attention \u2014the Mulhauser case \u2014 which took some 6 plus years. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 Nov that you are one of the two witnesses that testified that some of the delay was due to the victim as opposed to the Depart- ment. How do you respond to the charges from the victim that thedelay is due to the Department? Mr. B ALBIER . One of the difficulties I think that we have in the damages process, which as I understood her testimony, the part ofthe process that she said took a rather lengthy time, is that fromthe petitioner's standpoint and from their attorneys who representthem, their job is to get as much money for their client as they pos-sibly can. On the Government side, we have a different task. Our task is not to limit compensation to pay out as little as possible. Undernormal litigation, that would be the role of anybody who is suedin any sort of a lawsuit, but that is not our role. Instead, our roleis to try to provide a reasonable level of care for the vaccine-relatedinjuries. I think that is perhaps the reason for the problem. Not only do we have to develop a life care plan that meets the requirement ofthe statute, and that provides for all the various elements of com-pensation in the statute, but we also have to try to figure outwhich items of care are related to the vaccine injury and only payfor those injuries. Mr. M ICA. Well, it sounds like a lot of \u2014there was a great deal of dispute, at least in this case, about small ticket items as opposedto the larger picture and also giving sort of benefit of the doubt tothe petitioner. Is there any way that we can speed this process up or make it less contentious and adversarial? Mr. B ALBIER . There is. We have been looking at this, and our Ad- visory Commission has been looking at this issue to try to speedup the whole process. Mr. M ICA. Does that mean a statutory change? Mr. B ALBIER . Yes, it does, although we have done a number of things administratively to try to speed up the process as much aswe can. However, I think to view the litigative process \u2014and it is a litigative process \u2014with only an eye toward speeding up the proc- ess, could create some problems that we may not want to create.In other words, we could have a speedy process, but then people 's rights would not be protected. Another difficulty, quite frankly, is the time it takes to negotiate damages on a claim \u2014and that is done by the Department of Jus- tice trial attorneys \u2014they have to develop a life care plan that will meet the needs of that child for the rest of their life. Oftentimesit is in the interest of the petitioner to delay that so that they cansee how the child develops. That is done as part of their strategy. So, yes, we could make a quicker process, and there are many ways that you heard earlier individuals testify that could make itquicker, but in so doing I think we have to be very careful so thatwe don't sacrifice the rights of people to get what they truly de-serve under the program. Mr. M ICA. Mr. Burton. Mr. B URTON . I find that interesting when we have deadlines. My two grandchildren, we had to file \u2014we found out the week before VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:43 that they had to file. And if we had gone past that deadline, I guess we would have had no recourse \u2014the week before. So, I mean, I am glad you have this concern about being fair tothese people, but if you only have a certain date that you have tocomply by, it kind of leaves people out in the cold. This is supposed to be a no-fault system, and you keep talking about litigation. I just don 't understand that. I mean, it was de- signed to be a no-fault system. Why litigation? Litigation denotesadversarial problems \u2014an adversarial situation. That doesn 't sound like no-fault. You can answer that in just 1 second. How much, Mr. Euler, will it cost to care for an injured child for the lifetime of that child? Mr. E ULER . It depends on the child, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Give me a rough idea, say, for one that lives to be 25. Mr. E ULER . I can't. It is very hard to have a hypothetical, be- cause each child is different. Mr. B URTON . No, but we have had some children here today who have had some severe problems. I have a severe problem in myfamily. We have already laid out several thousand dollars. And Iknow that a lot of families can 't afford that. So, what are they to do? If the vaccination was responsible for it and we don 't find out for 10 years and the statute or the time period runs out, what are theyto do? Go to SSI? Mr. E ULER . Congress has the ability to change the statutory cri- teria, which we are charged with implementing. We have alreadyrecommended that the statue be essentially doubled, the statute oflimitations, from 3 years to 6 years. Mr. B URTON . Why not just take the lid off of it? Mr. E ULER . That is something Congress has the power to do. Mr. B URTON . Would you think that would be a good idea? Mr. E ULER . I think we would have to consider it. I think every program has time limits. Every program anywhere \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But you don't know how a child is going to \u2014I mean, the child may not have a problem that is visible for 5, 6, 7years, and then all of sudden the statute has run out, and thatchild is ruined for life, and the parent has no resources to take careof it. Mr. E ULER . The statute begins to run from the onset of the con- dition, now, whenever that it is. It doesn 't necessarily run from the date of vaccination, though there can be debate over when thatonset is, but it may be several years out. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much. It sounds like to me we are going to have to come up with some amendmentsto the current statute, and we have to do it relatively soon. Thank you, sir.Mr. M ICA. Thank you. The President in an Executive order in 1996 recommended agencies adopt alternative dispute resolutions and that we try to proceed in that fashion. Has the Department of Justice or HHS instituted a formal pro- gram of alternate dispute resolution with regard to the VaccineCompensation Program? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Much of the process itself has elements of what we call ADR. For example, I referred in my testimony to that initial telephone conference that the special master convenes with the pe-titioner and with Justice counsel. What is done there is the peti-tioner is advised of the deficiencies in the complaint and how theycan go about fixing it. I am not aware of any other system thatdoes that. And that type of informal processing exists throughoutthe program. The court, in addition, does in fact take additional ADR steps at times in the damages phase. If it doesn 't look like it is being worked out, we have some success getting another special masterto take a look at the case to try to resolve it. That has worked outwell on occasion, and that is sometimes one of the things we do. But this is clearly a less adversarial, informal process, and there are not rules of evidence, there is not civil discovery. The idea isto get all of the information out on the table and then to come toa resolution for that child 's care. That is what we are trying to do. That is not an easy process for petitioners, I grant that. They workhard at it, but sometimes it takes awhile. Mr. M ICA. Mr. Balbier, do you keep a log of the cases that have been resolved and then how \u2014or when they were initiated and when they were resolved? Do you have such a log from the time \u2014 on each case? Like, this year, you said you resolved, what, X num- ber? Mr. B ALBIER . We have a system, of course, where we input data\u2014\u2014 Mr. M ICA. But what I would like \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER [continuing]. That tracks the date of the claimant's\u2014\u2014 Mr. M ICA [continuing]. If you could provide us, just get this year's or the last year 's cases and get us the date when the claim was instituted and then was \u2014well, we know when it was re- solved\u2014so we could see how much time they were taking up. If you could provide us with that. Mr. B ALBIER . We do track that, and the average is about 2 years. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 ICA. I have additional questions. I do want to also learn from HHS what you are doing to inform the public about the pro- gram. I can't take any responses at this time, and I am going toadjourn the hearing. I will leave the record open for at least 3weeks by unanimous consent request. We will be submitting toboth the Department of Justice and HHS and the program alengthy series of questions for response, to be included in therecord. I do want to thank both of you gentlemen for appearing with us today and providing information. Also thank the other witnesseswho participated in the hearing. Hopefully everyone working together \u2014and I have directed staff to meet within the next week to come up with some legislativeremedies. I know that some have been recommended to the Speak-er, and we will consult with Mr. Waxman, Mrs. Mink, and otherswho have expressed an interest hopefully to come up with a legisla-tive package that is remedial and hopefully effective. There being no further business to come before this subcommit- tee at this time, this meeting is adjourned. [Whereupon, at 1:57 p.m., the subcommittee was "}
