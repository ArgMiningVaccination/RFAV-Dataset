REVIEWS - Reviews - Questions Overall no complaints I've only had a chance to try one does and I for sure didn't feel I'll the next day. Going to try it again with some friends for a party soon and will update how that goes. Game Changer Over 30 (and with 2 young kids), a fun night out with friends means a dreadful next day. No Days Wasted is the solution to your social needs. I can wake up feeling human, and don't feel like I have to chose between going out, or having a productive weekend. Great product! I love this stuff, works great, I've handed some out to my friends, they all love it too, now if they will only buy their own and stop stealing mine hahaha Right on! I have gotten to utilize the DHM Detox twice now. Whereas it definitely worked well enough after a few tequila drinks one evening, the real test was after a party I hosted. I was trying to be good by having a few light drinks, however, I had a few friends insist on making me some drinks as the night wore on. I am about to turn 51 and definitely \"feel it\" after mixing different alcohols. I ended up consuming 3 different alcohols. Luckily the next day, all I needed was my usual coffee in the morning to wake up properly and was able to carry on a regular day and even made it to the gym! no sluggishness! What I know is I feel great after a night drinking. I'm not taking a chance on how it works, I'd rather take precaution--- ordering more!
