There's some science in drinking a hot toddy and its affect on the common cold.", "sitename": "The Journal News", "date": "2016-12-12", "cleaned_text": "Can a hot toddy cure the common cold? There's no real cure for the common cold, but a little bit of whiskey could offer some relief. The classic hot toddy, typically made of whiskey, honey, fresh lemon juice and hot water, might help ease nasal congestion and the sniffles \u2014 much like a bowl of chicken noodle soup. For decades, people have used the hot toddy as a natural remedy for easing aches and pains associated with the common cold, and for the most part, it was assumed that it works because your brain thinks it works, not because there is actual science behind it. But as it turns out, the drink is pretty great, from a scientific perspective, at kicking a cold to the curb. \"The alcohol dilates blood vessels a little, making it easier for your mucus membranes to deal with the infection,\" said Dr. James Burns, medical director of the wound and hyperbaric center at Peninsula Regional Medical Center. According to the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/) and Prevention, the exact timing and duration of flu and cold seasons can vary. Most of the time, cold activity peaks between December and February, but can last as late as May. The average adult usually gets two to four colds a year, while the average child may get anywhere from six to eight. Although most other illnesses can be treated, there is no vaccine for the common cold, the most frequent infectious disease in humans. \"When it comes to colds, the best defense is a good offense,\" said Gunta Wheeler, an emergency and urgent care provider in Ocean City. The primary methods of prevention are proper hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands and staying away from other sick people.

Wheeler recommends patients begin taking fast acting allergy medicine, such as Zyrtec or Claritin, at the first signs of a cold. These medicines will work to ease suffering from seasonal allergies \u2014 itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing \u2014 while giving your immune system a better chance at beating the infection. Wheeler would only recommend natural remedies, like a steaming hot toddy, on a case by case basis. Although, she does believe the drink might be able to do the trick. Not only does it help fight off infection and the growth of microorganisms, the alcohol will work its magic in the sleep department, making cold sufferers just groggy enough to get some needed shuteye. \"Sleep is imperative for beating a cold,\" she said. \"While you could turn to NyQuil, a hot toddy works just as well at easing congestion, and a bit more naturally.\" But before slinging back a half dozen cocktails, it is important to know that too much alcohol will do anything but make you feel better. In addition to being an excellent natural decongestant, alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it pulls fluid from the body. It also is a blood thinner, which could cause serious problems if a patient mixes it with the wrong medication. \"A candidate for the hot toddy treatment would be someone of legal drinking age, who is not taking other medications and is relatively healthy otherwise,\" she said.
