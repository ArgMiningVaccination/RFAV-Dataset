The idea of a spirit or a soul can scare most logically minded individuals. It is dismissed as \"mumbo jumbo\". If this is you, then read no further. This article is for those who are open to the idea of something more, or those who are already serious meditators. The very essence of yoga, the very meaning of the word is Union. Union with what you may ask? Union with the Divine. The sole purpose and goal of yoga is connection with Supreme Source, divine energy, higher self, \"the matrix\", the field, Samadhi. Everything that we do in yoga - Asanas (poses), Pranayama (breathing), Mudhras (gestures), Cleansing (of body & mind) are all to settle the mind and prepare you for mediation, so you may attain Samadhi, the final stage, at which union with the divine is reached. In mainstream yoga, here in the west, we have diluted the practice and lost the true essence of what yoga is. A way of life! Instead we come on to the mat for a short while, do some acrobatics and carry on with our day without giving a thought to what yoga really is. Most of us just want to lose weight, overcome a condition or stress a little less. That's why we do yoga. However, yoga is about our thoughts, words and action. Balancing your energies so you are living life through your highest purpose. Here are a few of the qualities yoga cultivates if you practice daily with an open heart and mind: Purity of speech, actions and thoughts. Seeing only good in ourselves and others and a clarity of mind. Power of attention, stability and creativity. Feelings of joy, playfulness and a balance in sexual energy. Confidence, fearlessness, and a deeper sense of love. Loving all of creation with an open heart. Unconditional love for self and others. In yoga the heart is the centre of emotions so its a case of listening to your heart, not your thoughts. Witness state. Understanding that this life is like a movie. Its not who you truly are and nothing lasts forever. This 3D world is ever changing, from moment to moment, so its a case of living life without attachment and in the moment. Forgiveness for yourself and others. Letting go of thoughts of the past (guilt) and obsessing about the future (worry). Living in this present moment. The present moment is the only place of power because it is the only reality that is true. Here and now is where you create so you can live that creation tomorrow. Most of us live in our head, past or future, but never in the present. Connecting to the divine, higher power. Surrendering to something bigger and allowing life to unfold from moment to moment without the need to control, resist or fight. Fighting and resisting are symptoms from the lack of trust. When we surrender and flow with life we have an inner knowing (trust) that everything is as it should be and we will always be fine. Begin to cultivate these qualities today and you will find your life will change for ever. Yoga has been know to cure physical and mental disorders as well as enhance the overall quality of life. In our education system we are never taught how to live. What should you do if you suffer a loss or find yourself in debt, and everything else life throws at us. Instead we are taught algebra, geography, history etc. All very good but what do you do when you feel depressed or when your husband leaves you or your best friend commits suicide? What happens when you burn out and hit rock bottom and lose your job? Yoga gives you the tools to live a healthy, happy life on a day to day bases. The idea that our thoughts and emotions create our reality is now huge in the west but for over 4000 years this has been the teaching in most eastern philosophies. It all begins and ends in the mind, for as long as you are in your physical body anyway. I have included this powerful meditation (below). Practice it every day, morning and evening and you will feel the benefits in all areas of your life. Remember, if Supreme Source does not resonate with you, replace it with whatever you believe. God, inner self, higher self, the field, the matrix, consciousness etc: To begin, take a deep inhale and exhale. Release stress on the exhale and say to yourself, \"Now I am going to meditate. My first priority will be to my connection with Supreme Source, so I will not be involved in my thoughts, nor in my mind and nor in my body. 1. Place your right hand on mother earth and left hand (palm up) on your lap. Place your attention on your left palm. Bow your head, be humble and say, \"Oh divine energy, please help us to get balanced in our left channel. Oh mother earth, please absorb all negativity, all the left sided activity, depressive activity, the tamas guna, in your mother earth. Please earth all imbalances.\" Now just watch, can you feel. Energy is coming in the left hand (cool) and negative energy (hot) is being pulled from the right hand towards mother earth. 2. Place the right hand on the lap (palm up) and left hand up to the sky (bend the arm at 90 degrees). Say, \"Oh ether element, please remove all the obstacles, all right sided over activity and my futuristic attitude of the rajas guna in you. Oh divine energy, please help us to get balanced in our right channel.\" See the cool energy travelling in your right palm and hot energy, imbalanced energy, is sucked towards the sky through the left hand. Slowly place your left hand on your lap. See, are you balanced? 3. Slowly place your Right hand on your heart. Confidently say, \"Oh divine energy, by your grace. I am not this body. I am not mind. I am not this thought. I am Pure Spirit.\" 4. Place your Right hand on your Left shoulder/neck. Turn your head to the right. Confidently say, \"Oh divine energy, by your grace. I am not guilty. I am not guilty at all. I am Pure energy and Pure energy is never guilty, so that is why I am not guilty. I am not guilty at all.\" 5. Slowly place your Right hand on your forehead. Press it forward. Confidently say, \"Oh divine energy, I forgive everyone. I forgive, I forgive, I forgive.\" 6. Slowly place your Right hand on the back of your head. Lean back. Confidently say, \"Oh divine energy, I forgive Myself. Whatever unkindness I have shown to myself, I forgive myself.\" 7. Slowly place your Right hand on the Crown area. Spread your fingers towards the sky. Press the palm on the crown and slowly rotate clockwise. Confidently say, \"Oh divine energy, please give us self-realization. Please help us get connected with Supreme Source. Please help us to establish our self-realization. Please establish our Yoga. Our Connection.\" Lift your right hand 2 inches above the crown and just watch the energy coming from the head and the palm, without any reaction, without any thinking. Again press it, move it clockwise 7 times, lift and watch. Slowly put your right hand on your lap. Lift your left hand 2 inches above your crown. Don't touch the crown. See if you feel some energy flow in the left hand also. Place your left hand on your lap. Meditate in this thoughtless state with the flow of energy for a few minutes. See the thoughts have absolutely gone See that you are in silence as well as the present state. Also watch the flow of energy in your palms, on your fingertips as well as the crown chakra Slowly bow down to sage Patanjali. Open your eyes. Maintain balance, present state and take this clarity throughout your day.
