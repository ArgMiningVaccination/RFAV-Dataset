These days, there's no escaping how much of our lives we live through the handheld computers we keep in our pockets. But, also like many of you, I often wonder what impact all of this screen time is having on our health and particularly the health of our children. With Mental Health Awareness Month beginning next week, I thought it would be a good time to explore this question in more detail. Varying research on the impact of screen time It's tempting to conclude, unequivocally, that the Digital Age is harmful to our youth \u2014 and there is certainly a mountain of studies to give us pause. Researchers have found that the internet \u2014 and particularly social media \u2014 can [cause](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2021/10/29/addictive-potential-of-social-media-explained/) the same biochemical reaction in our brains that triggers addiction to alcohol, drugs, or other thrills that are damaging in excess. For young people, research has [linked](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023191) screen time with obesity and depressive symptoms in teens; and for \"tweens\" between the ages of 8 and 11 years, [lower scores](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(18)30278-5/fulltext) on cognitive assessments. At the same time, we also hear of studies that [indicate](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329) large amounts of screen time may not have a meaningful impact on teens' wellbeing and that moderate internet use [could](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/127/2/e330/65234/A-U-Shaped-Association-Between-Intensity-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext) actually be better for adolescents than too little or too much. More data for research These contradictions can be traced to the complexities of studying a young person's life in real time, including accounting for the many factors influencing development and measuring accurately how children engage with their screens. The National Institutes of Health's [Adolescent Brain Cognition Development Study](https://abcdstudy.org/about/) is helping to fill in some of these gaps. In its detailed examination of more than 11,000 children as they age from 9- and 10-years-olds to young adults, scientists are collecting demographic, biological, and neuroimaging information, in addition to data on screen time that children and their parents report. Their datasets have allowed researchers to analyze specific behaviors and outcomes for a large number of children over significant periods of time. One recent [study](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/mental-health/3769040-screen-time-linked-to-ocd-in-youth-study/) showed an association between increased video game-playing and YouTube-viewing and heightened risk of developing obsessive-compulsive disorder two years later. Another [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256591) suggests that more screen time correlates to only a slightly higher risk of poorer mental health and behavioral problems, while also being associated with benefits, such as more close friends. The 'screenome,' a new way to study screen use Still, one of the biggest challenges of researching screen use remains the reliance on what people report about what they see and do on their screens. Scientists are just beginning to set up frameworks to more accurately and objectively collect this information. One such initiative, [The Human Screenome Project](https://screenomics.stanford.edu/), is based here at Stanford University. The name intentionally echoes The Human Genome Project, the international initiative that successfully sequenced the human genome, our individual biological signatures. Stanford Medicine Professor Thomas Robinson, MD, and his co-principal investigators at the Screenome Project, Professor Byron Reeves, PhD, and Professor Nilam Ram, PhD, in the School of Humanities and Sciences, strive to do the same for our digital presence. They've created a platform that tracks participants' screen use by recording screenshots every five seconds and transmitting them securely to the researchers. Even a few hours of an individual's screenome demonstrates just how unique each person's digital footprint is. Some cycle quickly through apps in more than 100 sessions a day. Others hold fewer, longer sessions to watch videos or play games. And even two different hours or days for an individual are singular. When the project launched in January 2020, the lead researchers already had more than 30 million screenshots from more than 600 individuals. Now, Tom tells me, they are equipped with more than 350 million screenshots from adults and adolescents to conduct tests of our observations, assumptions, and even preconceived notions about the impact of digital media use. One key feature of the high-frequency observations from the screenome is the ability to look at changes within an individual over time in addition to differences between individuals, offering the potential for truly personalized, precision health. Expanding our understanding over time Insights from the Screenome Project will no doubt enhance what we're learning from other studies and long-term initiatives \u2014 work that informs evolving guidelines from the [World Health Organization](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/health/screen-time-kids.html), the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/5/e20162591/60503/Media-and-Young-Minds) and other professional groups. As the body of research grows over time, so will our understanding of how specific uses of digital media directly or indirectly affect the health and wellbeing of young people as they mature. When we are able to better distinguish detrimental digital behaviors from socially-positive ones, we will be able to make more informed choices for ourselves and our families. While it is impossible to abstain completely from the technology that pervades our daily existence, it is realistic to aim for healthy relationships with our devices that support \u2014 rather than impede \u2014 our wellness. These resources provide more information about the health effects of screen time and strategies for managing the impact on our wellbeing.
