We continue to build a pipeline of innovative biologic and oral therapies in core disease areas: rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis. Through our ongoing efforts in discovery, biomarkers, clinical research and external innovation, we are poised for continued leadership and growth, bringing transformational medicines to patients and healthcare professionals around the world. Every year, more than 19 million people around the world die from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This tremendous global burden compels us to develop new therapies that will change the face of these diseases with the goal to eliminate them. We focus on finding and developing truly transformational therapies that target underlying disease pathways, important pathways, and novel mechanisms of action. We continue to seek and develop the next generation of transformational cardiovascular & metabolic therapies. Pulmonary hypertension refers to high blood vessel pressure in the lungs, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive form of this often-debilitating condition. While the disease affects more women than men, it can also develop in children of any age and across all ethnicities. About 15 people out of every million are affected by PAH. Our understanding of the complex pathways and molecular mechanisms of PAH has enabled us to develop tailored medicines to improve patient outcomes and make a difference for people around the world living with this disorder. Our vision is to advance human health by helping to achieve a world free of life-threatening infectious diseases. We will do this by discovering and developing transformational therapies and vaccines that prevent, treat and cure some of the world's most life-threatening infectious diseases such as HIV, viral hepatitis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and Ebola. The research priorities of our Neuroscience Therapeutic Area include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder and neurological autoantibody-driven diseases like myasthenia gravis. Across neuroscience, our researchers are identifying synergies among neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases to maximize the potential clinical value of our treatments. We are actively developing therapies that are designed to modify disease with the goal to address the unmet needs and alleviate the disease burden for patients with these conditions, as well as the healthcare professionals and loved ones who care for them. Cancer claims millions of lives every year and the number continues to rise. We aim to transform cancer to a preventable or curable disease by delivering diagnostic and therapeutic solutions that prolong and improve patients' lives. We are committed to delivering targeted therapies to fight the devastation of cancer. Ortho-Gynol was introduced in 1931 as the first prescription family planning product from the Ortho Products operating unit. This pioneering contraceptive gel was based on the need for trusted family planning products. HALDOL\u00ae (haloperidol) was discovered by Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V. in 1960. Patients taking HALDOL\u00ae could be treated at home instead of in an institution. It became the gold standard for treating schizophrenia for more than 25 years. Ortho Pharmaceutical introduces the second oral contraceptive available in the United States (Ortho-Novum 10 and Ortho-Novum 2, produced by Syntex). Ortho Diagnostic Systems introduces RhoGAM Rho(D) immune globulin, the first medication developed to prevent Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn. We introduced a cell line technology that enables faster and most cost effective discovery, development and production of a range of potentially [transformational vaccines and monoclonal antibodies](http://www.janssen.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/patented-technologies). [PROCRIT\u00ae](http://www.procrit.com/), approved by the U.S. FDA for use in 1989, is a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of anemia. Centocor, now part of Janssen Biotech Inc., introduces [REMICADE\u00ae](http://www.remicade.com/), a prescription medication used to treat many auto-immune conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis. [AdVac\u00ae technology](https://www.janssen.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/vaccine-technology), based on the development and production of adenovirus vectors is introduced. It can be used to develop vaccines against life-threatening infectious diseases such as Ebola. Established in celebration of the legacy of \"Dr. Paul\" and in recognition of current researchers demonstrating a similar spirit, the Dr. Paul Janssen Award was first presented in 2006. [ZYTIGA\u00ae,](https://www.zytiga.com ) a prescription medication used in combination with prednisone to treat men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, is introduced. [DARZALEX\u00ae](http://www.jnj.com/news/all/DARZALEX-daratumumab-Approved-by-US-FDA-First-Human-Anti-CD38-Monoclonal-Antibody-Available-for-the-Treatment-of-Multiple-Myeloma) (daratumumab) injection for intravenous infusion is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy.
