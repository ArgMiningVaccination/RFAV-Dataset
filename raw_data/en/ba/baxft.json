But to avoid putting yourself and your family at risk during [coronavirus disease 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), examine your habits to make sure you're not cutting corners on your health. Perhaps the most important factor when it comes to your habits during this time is to avoid spreading germs. Keep calm with COVID Coach This app can help you cope with pandemic-related stress.

For specific guidance on everything from vaccinations and personal hygiene to keeping your home clean and avoiding contact with others, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)is a great resource. But maintaining good health during the COVID-19 pandemic means getting vaccinated, following guidance for covering your face in public and considering paying extra attention to your eating habits, exercise and personal schedule. With that in mind, here are some things to consider: Get vaccinated against COVID-19 The CDC has recommended everyone ages five years and older get their primary series of COVID-19 vaccine, and everyone 12 years and older also receive a booster. Here's why: - Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community. The vaccine works with your immune system, so it will be ready to fight the virus if you're exposed. If you do get COVID-19, the vaccine will help you from getting seriously ill. [COVID-19 vaccines are safe](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html). Each of the available vaccines for COVID-19 were developed using science that has been around for decades. The vaccines went through all the required stages of clinical trials and have been shown to be safe and effective. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines have received and continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. - The vaccine is a key tool to help stop the pandemic. When enough people are vaccinated, it becomes harder for COVID-19 to spread from person to person. This protects the entire population, including those who cannot be vaccinated, like newborns and those who are allergic to the vaccine. - The vaccine is a safe way to build immunity without getting sick. People who recover after being sick with COVID-19 have natural immunity to the disease. However, it's not clear how long that protection lasts. The CDC recommends the vaccine even for those who have been sick with COVID-19. - You can resume many activities once fully vaccinated. It takes your body two weeks after being vaccinated to develop the antibodies that fight COVID-19. Once you are [fully vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html), you can go out in public without a mask or having to social distance except where required by law or regulations. Visit the TRICARE website to [schedule a vaccination appointment](https://www.tricare.mil/HealthWellness/HealthyLiving/Coronavirus/COVID-Vaccine)or use the [Defense Health Agency's Appointing Portal](https://www.tricare.mil/DAP)to book your appointment at a DOD COVID-19 vaccination site. Wear a well-fitting mask The DOD requires personnel in areas of high community transmission to wear face coverings and to [social distance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)while on the installation, even if vaccinated. Those who are not vaccinated must wear masks and social distance on the installation and during official duties outside the home, regardless of the level of community transmission. The [CDC provides data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)on levels of community transmission. It also [offers guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7030e2-H.pdf)and definitions of low, moderate, substantial and high spread. All DOD personnel should continue to comply with CDC guidance regarding areas where masks should be worn, including within airports. The latest CDC guidance to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others is to get vaccinated as soon as you can and wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission. These practices can slow the spread of the virus and help people who may unknowingly have it from transmitting it to others. The CDC recommends masks for unvaccinated adults and children ages 2 and up that: - Are non-medical and disposable - Are made with breathable or tightly-woven fabric - Have two or three layers - Include a filter pocket The DOD does not authorize the use of novelty masks, masks with ventilation valves or face shields. Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth when removing your face covering. Wash your hands as soon as you finish.

Order your medications online to avoid contact with people who may have the virus. [Here's how to get home delivery for medications under TRICARE](/health-wellness/healthcare/how-to-get-home-delivery-for-medications-under-tricare/). Be kind to your mind Mental health is just as important as physical health. Here are a few ways to stay informed with updates on safety while keeping current events in perspective. - Engage your mind in your favorite activities. Schedule time for yourself to participate in the activities you enjoy the most. Whatever your thing is \u2014 reading a book, painting, playing an instrument or streaming your favorite music, dancing, writing, singing, etc. \u2014 do it, enjoy it and you'll feel better for it. - Avoid information overload. Watching or reading too much negative news can increase anxiety. Instead, limit the time you take in negative news and use the extra time to fill yourself with something positive, like writing down all you are grateful for or using these other [tips for emotional wellness](/national-guard/psychological-health-program/emotional-wellness). - Practice self-care. Plug into tools to help you de-stress and take care of yourself.
