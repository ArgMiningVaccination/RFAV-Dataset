Kamel is a witty, blunt-talking doctor who grew up in San Jose and came to medicine by way of Harvard, Columbia, and U.C.S.F. In his ordinary professional life, he is a research physician, and spends most of his time studying the causes and treatment of strokes. In early February, when there were still fewer than a hundred confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States, Kamel watched the spread of the epidemic with interest but no particular urgency. Toward the middle of that month, he told me recently, his sense of personal alarm began to kick in, not because of any change in external circumstances but because his wife was due, in a few weeks, to give birth to their second child. \"There's this sort of heightened anxiety in general when you're expecting a kid,\" he said. \"So a lot of my initial interest was as a doctor in general but also personally thinking, Should we be stocking up on Purell, formula, all this stuff?\" In the weeks after the baby, a boy, was born, Kamel's anxiety ticked up another couple of notches. Kamel, a self-professed Twitter addict, had been following reports from physicians working in and around Seattle, where [the outbreak was intensifying](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/a-week-at-the-epicenter-of-americas-coronavirus-crisis). In mid-March, he came across a Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/Chenbariatrics1/status/1238322250392039424) that supposedly reproduced notes written by a critical-care doctor working on the front lines. The notes were written in an opaque medical shorthand, and they described a hospital that was desperately short of personal protective equipment (P.P.E.) and overrun with critically ill COVID-19 patients, some of whom were in their twenties and had no underlying medical conditions. \"As much as you try to be rational and scientific-minded, I think the brain has a funny way of dismissing things that aren't directly related to you,\" Kamel told me. \"So, even given the early reports out of China, and then the stuff out of Italy, there's this element of, like, O.K., it's gonna be different here, without being able to specify why it was any different.\" But the notes from Seattle were a wake-up call. Within a week, he said, \"I was just a complete wreck. I was looking at my son, and thinking, like, How is he going to handle life as an orphan?\" On March 21st, in the midst of his gloom, Kamel got an e-mail from someone he knew from his medical residency, a primary-care physician who works on an Indian reservation in Minnesota. The primary-care physician had seen an article in the Times about quarantine parties taking place entirely online, and he invited\u2014begged, really\u2014other members of their residency class to meet up with him in a Zoom video-conference call. The virtual cocktail party happened that Saturday night, and the conversation turned so quickly to COVID-19 that Kamel's baby boy barely rated a mention. Instead, the group of friends talked about how best to manage a disease that five months ago had never been seen in a human being. So far, most of the world's attention has been justifiably dedicated to stopping the transmission of the disease, whether by quarantines and [social distancing](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-vital-importance-of-isolation) or [vaccines](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-long-will-it-take-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine). But the doctors on the call needed answers to a different question: what to do when COVID-19 showed up at their hospital doors. They needed to know whether it was unusual for patients to get better before they got worse, for instance (no, it seems to happen with some frequency), or whether hydroxychloroquine would exacerbate poor cardiac outcomes (possible, but not likely). In ordinary times, these were the kinds of questions that would get sorted out by randomized trials and meta-analyses, but that kind of science took time that they didn't have. The lack of P.P.E. was another concern. Many of the doctors on the call had previously practiced abroad, in places like Bolivia, Uganda, and Haiti, and they'd been in situations where it was not a given that they'd be able to protect themselves against whatever contagions they were treating. Nevertheless, the notion that it might be up to them to secure functional P.P.E. for themselves and their colleagues at hospitals in the United States was a shocking novelty. The Minnesota primary-care physician told his friends that he'd scoured the shelves of his local hardware stores for construction-grade N95 masks and was ready to send bundles to anyone who needed them. A cardiologist who also lived in Minnesota said that she'd been writing letters to her governor about the critical need for more P.P.E. The urgency of the conversation about P.P.E. stemmed in large part from the same fear that Kamel had been experiencing. Although there is much about COVID-19 that is frightening for everyone\u2014the speed of transmission, the scale of the spread, the medical and economic devastation left in its wake\u2014for health-care workers and others on the front lines of the outbreak, there is a special concern. Without adequate P.P.E., they are at serious risk of contracting the disease themselves. And, since many of the doctors on the call were married, with young children, whatever risks they bore themselves would all but certainly be shared with their families. Kamel's wife, who was listening in on the call from the other end of the couch, was, he said, \"utterly terrified after our conversation.\" However, Kamel told me that seeing the faces of his residency friends, with whom he'd shared some of his most difficult days during his training as a physician, was a \"huge existential lift.\" \"It was very reassuring to feel like I wasn't going into this alone. We'd done something very difficult in the past, and we can deal with this.\" Kamel and other physicians on the front lines of the pandemic are now operating in an atmosphere of pervasive uncertainty. Though more and more is being learned every day, there is still a tremendous amount of information, some of it very basic, that we simply do not yet have about COVID-19. Information about how a disease spreads among populations, how it progresses in the bodies of patients, and how its clinical course might be shortened or ameliorated is usually considered crucial for doctors trying to figure out how best to care for their patients. For COVID-19, however, all of this is still being sorted out. Compounding these difficulties is a strong sense among many of the physicians I've spoken to that the federal government, and particularly the Centers for Disease Control, has not supplied the sort of clinical leadership that the moment demands. To fill that vacuum, doctors have been able to look to high-impact medical journals and academic institutions, such as the University of Washington, in Seattle, and Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston. But, much like Kamel, they've also relied on more informal networks to get the information and the support they need. Prashant Bhave, a cardiologist in North Carolina, told me that on-the-ground reports he'd heard from friends and former colleagues had given him a useful counterbalance to some of what he'd been seeing and hearing elsewhere. \"If you'd watched the Coronavirus Task Force, or the news, you might have gotten a sense that there was a mask shortage,\" he said. \"But you wouldn't necessarily understand that there were emergency-department residents using the same mask for a week at a time. I got that through other communities of people who are actually doing the work.\" In addition to talking to friends and colleagues, Bhave had recently watched a live stream of grand rounds at U.C.S.F., in which doctors discussed the symptoms and treatment of COVID-19. In his own hospital, he said, \"We're trying to figure out, does every patient with COVID need an echocardiogram? What blood tests are you going to send? Are those going to be things that you're going to do on every patient? There's not consensus on that, and so listening to grand rounds from U.C.S.F., where I really respect the people, is super valuable.\" For obvious reasons, many of the earliest findings from American physicians emerged out of the Seattle area, where the country's outbreak first took hold. In mid-March, around the time that Kamel read the anonymous clinical notes online, Elizabeth Kaplan, a hospitalist at the University of Washington, learned that her responsibilities would soon include handling an influx of COVID-19 patients. One of her new tasks was to admit and triage so-called rule-outs, patients who were waiting on tests to determine if they had the disease. \"I wasn't yet doing any clinical care, but I was realizing my job was going to be changed,\" she said. Kaplan is a very accomplished physician, but she told me that one of her deepest fears has always been that she might harm a patient because of something she didn't know. In her usual hospital work, there were always experts and published guidelines that could fill in any gaps she might have in her training or education. But, with COVID-19, \"the people around me were scared, and were learning at the same time. That unknown\u2014that I was going to let patients down by not being able to offer them anything\u2014was scary.\" On Thursday, March 12th, Kaplan posted a brief note on Facebook. She'd gone to work that morning in an old black fleece that she used to wear during residency, and said in the note that she \"wanted to pass on huge gratitude to the healthcare workers who I trained with or who trained me.\" Kaplan told me later that the current situation had \"brought back the fear I used to have going into a call in residency, when I was worried I was inadequate.\" The post, she said, drew many responses, both online and off, including from doctors around the country who had clinical questions. \"They asked me, 'What are you doing about P.P.E.? What treatments are you using? What are the clinical presentations you're seeing?' \" Kaplan was able to point them to a Web site maintained by the University of Washington that offered regularly updated guidance for physicians on the front lines. The exchanges, she said, \"gave me this incredible sense of camaraderie, and also a reminder that I had been trained well to function in uncertainty.\" In early February, Rebecca Cogswell, the cardiologist in Minnesota who had been writing letters to her governor, had a nightmare in which she and her colleagues were wearing hazmat suits and deciding which of their patients to put on ventilators. \"I was super doomsday from the beginning,\" she told me. \"I just looked at my husband, and I said, 'There's no way this is going to be contained.' \" To prepare for the arrival of COVID-19, she kept up with what was being published in the major medical journals and watched a Webinar with Chinese cardiologists that had been organized by a professional organization. But she also relied on an informal group of cardiologists around the country who traded video messages on an app called Marco Polo. \"One of my colleagues will be in the I.C.U. and say, 'O.K., the numbers in Detroit are such and such. This is how many rule-outs we have. We also just saw this case where we had fluid collection around the heart that we had to drain.' \" Charles Everett, a critical-care pulmonologist in the Bay Area, told me he'd also been keeping an eye on the outbreak throughout February and into early March, and had even built his own epidemiological model to estimate how many patients his hospital might see. But, unlike Cogswell, he'd initially believed the officials, in the federal government and elsewhere, who'd said that the outbreak was still relatively contained in the U.S. It took a number of alarming reports out of Washington and Italy to change his mind. The notes from the anonymous physician in Seattle made a particularly strong impression. Though he had no idea who wrote them\u2014and still doesn't\u2014he says it was clear to him that \"this was a clinically savvy person. This was doctor talk, one hundred per cent.\" Everett told me that the C.D.C., at that point, \"was a dead zone\" for clinical information, and the notes helped him understand what to expect. Everett quit Twitter several years ago\u2014\"I profess to hate it, which I mostly do, but I hate it because I loved it so much\"\u2014but he quickly realized that it was one of the few places to get the information he might need. \"It was not happening in C.D.C. briefings every day, the way I feel like it should have been,\" he told me. \"I was, like, There's nobody who's got any formal, official sources of information here. We're in a void. All the information is in places where I don't go and I don't know how to access. And we need somebody tasked with that. So I literally said, 'Who's got a Twitter account?' \" Only one of the members of his physician's group did. \"I was, like, 'Sorry, you're it. You've got to be on Twitter.' \" This is probably the place to mention that I know all of these doctors\u2014Kamel, Bhave, Cogswell, Everett, and Kaplan\u2014through my wife, Jess, who is an infectious-disease doctor at SUNY Downstate, in central Brooklyn. For much of the past two months, she has watched with significant trepidation as the number of cases in New York grew from a trickle to a stream to an overwhelming flood tide. Most of her patients have significant health problems, and many are poor. Jess has been deeply worried about them\u2014not only because COVID-19 outcomes are worse for people with so-called co-morbidities but also because the recent lockdowns, as necessary as they have become, pose dire risks to people who were already living economically and medically precarious lives. On Wednesday, a patient called and said that her home-health aide had died of a suspected case of COVID-19; who could safely help her, the patient wanted to know, while she was under quarantine? Worrying about her patients is not a new experience for Jess. But what has made the outbreak qualitatively different from her normal practice was the thought that she might, despite every precaution, bring the disease home to me and our two kids. At some level, this was, of course, a reasonable concern. In my own experience, there's an element of black comedy in performing the rituals of extreme social distancing while seeing your spouse off to the hospital each morning. Nevertheless, the risk to either of us suffering a bad outcome from COVID-19 was very low, and the risk to our kids was even lower. And, data aside, whatever chance there was of something serious happening seemed more than a fair trade for getting to watch my wife practice her indispensable trade. Jess is the daughter and granddaughter of physicians\u2014on our kitchen bulletin board hangs a copy of a letter that Albert Sabin sent her grandfather along with a batch of polio vaccine\u2014and being a doctor is something she loves, and something I love her for loving. In recent weeks, Jess's worry has taken the form of an anxious anticipation. When people ask how she's been feeling, as they often do these days, she sometimes responds with a story about the end of the first year of residency, when nine of her classmates decided to go skydiving over Hawaii. Jess and a friend took off in a plane about the size of a minivan, each of them strapped to a tandem instructor. Jess and her instructor jumped first. When they finally landed, exhilarated, her friend said that watching Jess step out of the plane had been the most terrifying part. By the final weekend of March, when Governor Andrew Cuomo designated SUNY-Downstate a COVID-only hospital, Jess still had yet to see a confirmed case of the disease. Her days were spent, for the most part, on the phone with her suddenly house-bound patients, and on Zoom with her colleagues to prepare for the oncoming crush. The schedules for the new COVID-19 wards were changing every day, and Jess expected to start consulting on them at any moment. But that Sunday morning, while our kids were playing Just Dance Now on the Apple TV, she developed a dry cough. She immediately put on a mask, and, when it was time for lunch, isolated herself to eat. That afternoon I drove over to her boss's house, to pick up a thermometer. (Ours was broken, and I had confirmed earlier in the day that there were none to be had for purchase anywhere in our neighborhood.) Standing on his stoop, at a safe distance, Jess's boss told me that the networks through which information about COVID-19 was travelling, though faster now because of the Internet, reminded him of the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when he had been a young doctor. \"It was just everybody asking each other what they were seeing,\" he said. Later that night, I started feeling sick, as well. My symptoms were nowhere close to unbearable, and I had none of the now-classic COVID-19 triad of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Instead, I had a dull ache behind the eyes, coupled with a general weariness. It was the sort of thing that, in another season, I'd have written off as an obnoxious but manageable cold. On Tuesday, however, Jess was able to get tested for COVID-19. The next night, the chief resident texted her the result: positive. One of the strange and unsettling features of COVID-19, as a disease, is that it appears to progress in a nonlinear fashion: people often feel bad, and then better, and then bad again. The possibility of a sudden downturn, it seems, is one that can't be dismissed until you recover completely. For now, though, both of us have been lucky. Jess has not felt especially well, but she has been able to spend most of her daylight hours on the phone, helping her patients figure out how to get the routine medical services they need at a time when they can't physically visit her clinic. Mental-health services, she says, are in particularly high demand: her patients, especially those with underlying conditions, are terrified that they'll get sick, and that anxiety has become its own problem in need of resolution. Despite being able to do a version of her job from home, however, she is impatient to get back to the hospital, not least because she will likely have some immunity to the virus. By Thursday evening, SUNY Downstate had admitted more than two hundred and fifty inpatients with COVID-19, and, on Saturday, the president of the hospital told CNN that his supply of surgical gowns was so low that his medical staff would have to start using rain ponchos and garbage bags instead. \"We're in the middle of a global pandemic, and everyone wants to feel useful,\" Jess told me. \"For me, the thing I can do to be useful is to be back at work.\" Hooman Kamel started his COVID-19 rotation two weeks ago. In the days before he began, he told me, \"I was just so despondent. It was so dark. And then I started, and I'm, like, all right, you know? Once you get into it, you see what you're dealing with. I've been feeling much better. It's still a terrible situation, and it's stressful as hell. But it did feel like some of that gloom lifted.\" When his rotation started, Kamel decided to shave his head, as he had during residency. In part, he said, he was nervous to spend the half-hour it would take to get a haircut in close proximity to another person, but, like Elizabeth Kaplan, he also felt a deep connection to his years of medical training. \"It just felt, like, O.K., if we're going back onto that kind of footing, let's do it.\" To protect his wife and kids\u2014as well as his mother, who is seventy, and who's been helping with night feedings\u2014Kamel moved out of his apartment in Manhattan and into one owned by a friend, in Brooklyn. Each day, while he was at work, his wife found his car and delivered a few basic necessities: T-shirts, trash bags, beer. Eventually the strain of that separation became too much: last Monday, Kamel moved back home. \"We're technically on the front lines, but there are other people who have it much harder,\" Kamel said, when I asked how he spent his days on the I.C.U. Paramedics and emergency doctors, he said, \"are the ones who are working in much less controlled conditions. They really have no idea what they're going to see. And then the airway team doing intubations\u2014it is a tough thing, in general, in critically ill patients, but to be doing it with the layers of protective gear they have to wear, and the risk to themselves . . . \" Kamel's I.C.U. was one of the first in the hospital to be dedicated entirely to COVID-19 patients. The unit got its first case on March 15th, and by the time he showed up, on March 24th, all twelve of its available ventilators were in use. The ventilators will not cure anyone, but they will, with any luck, keep patients breathing long enough for their immune systems\u2014at the moment, the only proven treatment for COVID-19\u2014to eradicate the disease. \"The virus causes very diffuse pneumonia, all throughout the lungs,\" he told me. \"And then the body's response to the virus, inflammation, causes damage. So the lungs aren't functioning well, and it's very hard to keep the oxygen levels in the blood up to where they need to be. And sometimes the ventilator settings you have to use are not comfortable. So most of the challenge is: how do you use the ventilator in a way where you can get enough oxygen into their blood without causing more damage to the lungs?\" Kamel has had no trouble getting gowns, gloves, or procedure masks, but his hospital, like most, has a shortage of N95 masks. \"Everyone at my place can get at least one N95, which they can then reuse,\" he said. One mask per day, I asked him, or one per week? \"They just get one,\" he said. \"It's not ideal.\" At the time we spoke, Kamel himself had three N95s\u2014two of them sent to him by the primary-care physician in Minnesota\u2014that he was cycling through. Each day, he wears one mask for the duration of his twelve-hour shift. At the end of the shift, being careful not to contaminate its concave surface, he puts the N95 in a paper bag and hopes that the forty-eight hours until its next use will be enough to kill any surviving virus. Then he goes home and puts on another mask to be around his wife and sons. \"I am wearing a mask at all times, which is pretty terrible,\" he told me. \"I think the smell of surgical masks is going to be seared in my brain for life.\" I asked Kamel what the mood was like inside the I.C.U. \"It's just the human condition, you know?\" he said. \"The highs and the lows. There are these poignant moments where you're FaceTiming with a family member. I went into a room, put a patient's daughter on the phone so she could see her mom. Her mom is sedated in a coma, on a ventilator, super sick. You're watching the daughter cry. She's unable to be there in person, because there's all these restrictions on visitors to try to protect everyone from this virus. So that's been super sad.\" At the same time, he said, \"Being with our staff, and seeing how everyone's rallying\u2014like our nurses\u2014has been incredible. They're stepping up to the plate and figuring out how to reconfigure an I.C.U. to take care of these patients, and doing it with grace and good humor. That's been pretty amazing to watch.\" More Medical Dispatches - Surviving a severe coronavirus infection is hard.
