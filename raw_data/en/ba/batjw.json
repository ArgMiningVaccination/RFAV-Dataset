Allow 2 - 3 business days for delivery. 2 Please refer to the NS Immunization Manual Chapter 10 for vaccine eligibility for high risk conditions. You can consult with local Public Health to request vaccine for high risk conditions on a case by case basis or if you are unsure if your patient is eligible 5 Vaccine Refrigerators Any refrigerator used for vaccine storage must be : Large enough to hold one month's inventory3 Equipped wit h a min-max thermometer or data logger 4 Able to maintain vaccine storage temperatures between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C5 Dedicated to the storage of vaccines only 3 As manufacturers of vaccine are gradually moving toward the use of pre -filled syringes, it is important to plan for the increased space requirements the changes in vaccine packaging will require. 4 The recommended type of thermometer is Canadian Scientifi c or another Minimum -Maximum (Min -Max) thermometer that is calibrated to +/ - 1\u00baC accuracy 5 Although there may be some commercial grade small fridges designed specifically to maintain drugs and vaccines, any other style of small, single door fridge (e.g. b ar fridge) is unpredictable in terms of maintaining temperatures within the required range of 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 C and should NOT be used to store vaccines. For more detail refer to the National Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines 6 Organizing the Vaccine Fridge Remove expired vaccine from the fridge Return all expired unopened vaccine to local public health Order the amount of additional vaccine you will need for one month Ensure products that expire first are placed in front the fridge Store vaccine between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C Store full bottles of water on empty shelves and in the door Don't store vaccines on door shelves Store only vaccines in the refrigerator Open the door only when necessary 7 8 Routine Vaccine Orders and Pickup Supplies required for routine monthly vaccine pick up from your local public health office : hard sided cooler insulating ma terial such as bubble wrap frozen ice packs Min-Max thermometer 9 Vaccine Cold Chain Break Management and Reporting If you become aware of inappropriate vaccine storage conditions, do not discard the vaccine . Report details of the cold chain break to your local Public Health office . do not discard vaccines mark the products as be ing exposed to cold chain break store e xposed vaccines in the fri dge, in a container/bag marked \"Cold Chain\" complete the Vaccine Cold Chain Exposure Report Form in Appendix A document action that has been taken to protect the vaccines note the product's appearance (e .g., evidence of ice for mation ) document the names of the vaccine, lot number, expiry date, and quantity use the exposed vaccines deemed safe to use before using new vaccine document name, number, expiry date of vaccines not safe to use return unopened vials of exposed vaccine in to local public health10 Emergency Preparedness and Vaccine Storage a nd Handling When immunization providers have reasonable cause to believe that weather conditions, natural disasters, or other emergencies might affect vaccine storage conditions, urgent procedures should be implemented in advance of the event. In preparation for any emergency, the following steps should be taken : Identify all alternative storage facilities with back-up pow er Have arrangements f or transportation of v accines Pack the refrigerator with adequate cold pa cks and water bottles while the power is sti ll on Ensure availability of appropriate packing containers, cold packs, et c. Prepare a list of emergency phone numbe rs: Power compa ny Temperature alarm monitoring company Back up storage facility Transport compa ny Weather service Document vaccine details name, expiry, # doses Record refrigerator temperature, time and date Post Event : For vaccines exposed to temperatures outside 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C range refer to section titled Vaccine Cold Chain Break Management and Reporting . 11 Reporting Requirements Reporting of Immunizations to Public Health Each person receiving an immunization should receive an individual record for personal retention and reference containing the following information : immunization : Name of the person immunized DOB Gender Health Card Number Vaccine name Lot Number Date Given (Day, Month, Year) Site Route Dose Professional signature As key participants in the publicly fu nded immunization program, all i mmunization providers must provide detailed information for each immunization provided to their local public health office .
