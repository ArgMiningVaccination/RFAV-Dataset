Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) acts as the regulator of healthcare services in Wales on behalf of the Welsh Ministers who, by virtue of the Government of Wales Act 2006, are designated as the registration authority2. HIW has responsibility for the registration and inspection of independent health care services in Wales. This includes the regulation of independent hospitals3, independent clinics, independent medical agencies, and private dentists. Sections 22 and 23 of the Act provide Welsh Ministers with broad regulation making powers and powers to publish and keep under review, statements of National Minimum Standards (NMS). The NMS set out \"minimum\" standards and most providers will have no difficulty in meeting them and many will exceed them. The intention of the NMS is to ensure that patients and people who choose private healthcare are assured of safe, quality services. These national minimum standards and the regulatory framework within which they operate, are part of a broader Welsh Assembly Government policy to improve the quality of care to ensure that patients receive treatment and services that are safe and of an assured quality. Any decision made by HIW in the exercise of its registration functions can be appealed to the First Tier Tribunal (Care Standards)4. The standards will form the basis for judgements made by the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) regarding registration decisions, the imposition or removal of conditions of registration, variation of any conditions and enforcement of compliance with the Care Standards Act 2000, including decisions about suspension, cancellation or prosecution. HIW will consider the degree to which a regulated service complies with the standards when determining, for the purposes of its registration functions, if a provision of the regulations has been breached. Wherever possible, the relevant regulation(s) that may be breached if the standard is not met is listed but this should be taken as a general guide rather than a comprehensive legal reference. The standards are intended to be qualitative, in that they provide a framework for judging the quality of services experienced by service users, but they are also designed to be measurable. Inspecting against the regulations and these standards, HIW will follow a consistent inspection methodology and reporting format. In assessing whether or not an 2National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales establishment or agency meets a particular regulatory requirement, the HIW will consider if it meets each of the relevant standards. Independent healthcare services differ in their size and complexity and the way providers demonstrate that they meet the standards may vary depending on their organisational structure and systems. Registered persons are responsible for ensuring that their services meet these standards, comply with the Act and have knowledge of whatever other legislation is relevant to the services they provide. It is anticipated that they will use these standards in their day to day monitoring of the quality of services provided. Assessment against the standards should be seen as integral to good governance and continuous improvement. The onus is on the registered provider to demonstrate they are meeting the standards on a continuous basis and that their own effective internal scrutiny arrangements identify and drive improvement. Reference is also made to relevant supporting information to assist providers and managers. In revising the current NMS for independent healthcare, the following principles have been applied: Who these standards are for These standards are for registered providers and managers of services that are required to be registered by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales. The standards will assist them in ensuring that they provide the minimum standards of quality and safety that enable them to comply with legislation.These are: Standards will be fit for purpose in 2011 and beyond. The principles of good regulation are met (Better Regulation Executive (BRE)5). As far as possible standards are aligned and consistent with standards for the NHS. Unnecessary repetition of standards is avoided. Where relevant, they address 'service specific' variances. Standards are clearly articulated and easy to understand for people who use, as well as provide services. Standards enable registered persons to comply with the law.3National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales The standards might also be helpful to people who work in or use registered services, the public, Welsh Assembly Government officials and commissioners of services. The standards will be taken into account in decisions made by HIW and in any proceedings (both civil and criminal) taken under the Act.6 What types of services do these standards apply to? Independent Healthcare services are defined in section 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000. There are three main types of services: Independent Hospitals; Independent Clinics; and Independent Medical Agencies. The following services are classed as independent hospitals and these include: acute hospitals (who provide a wide range of services including medical and / or surgical treatment, including investigations, under general anaesthesia or intravenously administered sedation); mental health hospitals; hospices; dental hospitals providing treatment under general anaesthesia; maternity hospitals; hospitals providing termination of pregnancy; hospitals providing cosmetic surgery; and 'prescribed techniques' or 'prescribed technology'. Prescribed techniques and prescribed technology are termed in this way as they are specifically prescribed within the regulations that are made under the section 2(7) of the Act. They currently include: Endoscopy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). Circumcision of male children. Dialysis. In vitro fertilisation (IVF). Use of a Class 3B or 4 Laser or Intense Pulsed Light Source (IPL). Below are examples of what the above services might provide.4National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Acute hospitals Acute hospitals generally have one or more overnight beds subject to certain exemptions but some may only provide day case procedures and patient admissions are normally planned or at short notice, rather than as an emergency. Services may be provided for both adults and children but will vary in the types and complexity of treatments that are offered. Treatment under general anaesthetic or intravenously administered sedation will be provided in these types of hospitals. Because of the nature and complexity of the services offered, acute hospitals will have facilities to care for patients who require critical care level 1 or 2 but may, depending on the types of surgery performed, also provide critical care level 3. Where critical level 2 or 3 are not available and unexpected complications arise that necessitate patients to be transferred to a higher level of critical care, they may need to be transferred to NHS critical care facilities. Formal transfer arrangements must be made with NHS providers before services are permitted to operate and procedures for emergency transfer clearly documented for all staff and consultants. In some circumstances, for example, where children are admitted for treatment under anaesthesia, transfer arrangements should be made in advance of their admission, even if they are not required to be implemented. Each hospital must also have appropriate medical cover at all times. These are medical practitioners (often referred to as the resident medical officer (RMO)) who may be directly employed or contracted by the hospital and work in support of Consultants. Many of the Consultants who operate or consult at an acute hospital are not directly employed. They are granted 'practising privileges' to consult or treat patients at the hospital. Advice about who can be granted a right to practise is usually recommended by the Medical Advisory Committee (MAC). Each actual hospital has its own MAC (usually made up of consultants from a range of specialties) who can then consider applications to practise at the hospital and advise the registered person of their views. Consultants seeking practising privileges are required to comply with a range of checks about themselves and their clinical performance, before being able to work in the hospital and will be required to adhere to the hospitals policies and procedures. The details of what treatments and other services that each hospital provides will be set out in their Statement of Purpose which the registered provider is required to compile. The services available may include all, some or only one of the following: Medical treatment which requires overnight care. Surgical procedures which may be under anaesthesia or intravenously administered sedation. IVF. Termination of pregnancy.5National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Cosmetic surgery. Maternity services. Dental treatment. Cancer services. A prescribed technique or prescribed technology (ie Endoscopy, HBOT, Circumcision of male children, Dialysis, IVF, Class 3B / 4 laser or IPL). Note: the above services may also trigger registration in their own right. Those acute hospitals that offer a more complex range of treatments and procedures will usually include the following departments: Diagnostics. Pathology. Radiology. Pharmacy. Out Patient consultations. A brief overview about the types of services that are frequently provided in an acute hospital are detailed under A - Z below: A - Z of services: Cancer services: The majority of cancer services are delivered in the NHS but some patients may have part of their course of treatment in independent hospitals. Children's services: Children are treated relatively infrequently in independent acute hospitals and, apart from hospitals with dedicated paediatric units, should only be admitted for day case or overnight surgical care7. Children requiring anaesthesia need specially trained staff and appropriate facilities. Children with pre-existing medical conditions requiring intervention, both acute episodes and planned (elective) intervention, require the services of a dedicated paediatric unit, with paediatric medical and paediatric nursing staff on duty at all times, and should not be treated outside these facilities. Children who become unwell, unstable or who develop complications as a result of planned surgery, should be immediately transferred to a paediatric unit. Cosmetic surgery: Cosmetic surgery is the general term describing surgery performed to correct a problem caused by other surgery or to create a more pleasing appearance for whatever 6National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales reason.It includes procedures such as breast augmentation, face lifts, ear correction, facial implants and fat reduction. The majority of cosmetic surgery procedures are performed in the independent sector. Critical care: Some patients in independent acute hospitals may require critical care. Where the hospitals are carrying out complex operations, for example, cardiac surgery or transplantation, there must be critical care beds available for patients postoperatively in those hospitals. In other cases, post-operative complications may mean that a patient requires critical care support. The hospital has to ensure the necessary arrangements are in place so that critical care can be provided as needed, in the establishment. Alternatively, arrangements should be in place with a provider of a higher level of critical care, so that patients can be transferred to appropriate facilities as necessary. Critical care provision by independent hospitals in Wales or transfers to a higher level of critical care, should be informed by the good practice contained in the Designed for Life: Quality Requirements for Adult Critical Care in Wales, Welsh Assembly Government 2006 and the Independent Healthcare Advisory Service (IHAS) Critical Care Transfer Position Paper April 20098. Decontamination: The decontamination of reusable medical devices is the combination of processes which, if not correctly undertaken, individually or collectively, will increase the likelihood of micro-organisms being transferred to patients or staff. The decontamination process is required to make medical devices safe for use on the patient and safe for members of staff to handle. The reusable medical device life cycle includes acquisition, cleaning, disinfecting, inspection, packaging, sterilisation, transportation, and storage before use. This cycle is used to render a reusable item safe for further use. Best practice standards and guidance for decontamination and decontamination environments to enable providers to comply with legislative requirements, are set out in Health Technical Memoranda (HTMs) and Health Building Notes (HBNs) and providers are expected to meet these standards for registration and ongoing. The MHRA9 also provide advice and guidance on best practice. Diagnostic services: (ionising radiation) The use of ionising radiation in health care is regulated through a range of legislative measures that implement Euratom Directives to protect employees, the public and patients. This legislation applies equally to the NHS and to the acute independent sector and is enforced by a number of inspectorates including those from the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency. As of 1 December 2009 Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) took over responsibility for inspections and enforcement in 7National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales relation to Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations (IR(ME)R, 2000 and its subsequent amendment regulations in November 2006. Incidents which result in a patient receiving a radiation dose much greater than intended, must be reported to HIW. Pharmacy services: Existing legislation applying to drugs and medicines includes the Medicines Act 1968 and subordinate legislation, Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and regulations made under it, the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Consumer Protection Act 1987. Hospitals need to be familiar with, and observe, the statutory requirements and make adequate arrangements concerning Controlled Drugs, Prescription Only Medicines, Pharmacy Only and General Sales List medicines held and administered in the hospital. Apart from the HIW there are other inspectorates with rights of access to pharmacies in independent sector hospitals. Home Office drugs inspectors have the authority to inspect private hospitals, which hold controlled drugs. (A licence issued by the Home Office10 is also required if a registered provider wishes to produce, supply, possess, import or export controlled drugs). Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory products Agency (MHRA) inspection and enforcement officers have a duty to investigate any breaches or suspected breaches of the Medicines Act 1968. Independent hospitals that are corporately owned, also have to have an 'Accountable Officer' to ensure arrangements and safe management of controlled drugs in the hospital. Pathology services: The quality of pathology services is maintained in three main ways - accreditation of pathology laboratories, state registration of scientific officers and clinical scientists, and underpinning training programmes. Accreditation of pathology laboratories should be to Clinical Pathology Accreditation (UK) Ltd (CPA) standard or equivalent. Pathology services may, in whole or in part, be carried out in the hospital, by contract with the laboratory service of a NHS hospital, by contract with another independent hospital or commercial provider or by a combination of these arrangements. See also, in particular, regulation 37 of the Regulations. Transplantation: Most transplantation is carried out in the NHS because of the constraints of organ availability, the huge expense and complexity of the procedures and the resources needed. However, some kidney transplants are undertaken in independent hospitals mostly using a related live donor, or cadaver kidneys for which the NHS is unable to find a use.8National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Transplantation is legislated by the Human Organ Transplants Act 1989 and regulated by the Human Tissue Authority (HTA). The Act prohibits commercial dealings in human organs for transplant and restricts the transplanting of organs between people who are not genetically related. The Act also requires information about the removal and the use/ disposal of transplanted organs to be sent to the HTA to approve all transplants from living donors, whether or not the donor is related to the recipient. Treatments which may trigger registration in their own right: Below are types of treatments or procedures, that may be provided as part of the overall services of an acute hospital or may be registered as independent hospitals and solely provide these individual services and no others. Termination of pregnancy services: The Abortion Act 1967 (as amended), requires termination of pregnancy to be carried out in an NHS hospital or, in relation to Wales, in a place approved for this purpose by the Welsh Assembly Government. Abortion can be a medical or surgical procedure but abortions are generally day care procedures, so women tend to leave the establishment where the procedure takes place within a couple of hours. However, they may develop complications or be in pain or be anxious about how much bleeding to expect. They should therefore be given contact telephone numbers to ring for advice. It is important that the registered person records that this information has been provided. As medical abortion is now more frequently used (ie where a woman is given tablets to terminate the pregnancy but the actual abortion occurs some time later, sometimes when the patient has returned to her own home) it is particularly important that information and support services are available. Respect is due to the dead foetus based on its lost potential for development into a fully formed human being. Full account should be taken of any personal wishes that have been expressed about disposal of foetal tissue. All foetal tissue should be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the Human Tissue Act 2004 and the guidance provided by the Human Tissue Authority. Endoscopy: Endoscopes are medical devices inserted in the body for diagnostic or surgical purposes. There are two types of endoscope, flexible and rigid: flexible endoscopy uses natural body orifices (eg mouth, anus, nose) to introduce into the body a long flexible device. The inserted end of the device has a camera, operated remotely by the practitioner, which is used to view the internal organs. These procedures usually include upper and lower gastroscopy, bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy, cystoscopy and hysteroscopy. rigid endoscopy is where a rigid endoscope with a surgical instrument at the inserted end is introduced through the skin. It is also known as minimally invasive 9National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales surgery or keyhole surgery and includes arthroscopy, laparoscopy, hysteroscopy and cystoscopy, among others. It is important that endoscopes are properly decontaminated before they are re-used. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment: Hyperbaric oxygen treatment involves specialised equipment and experienced staff to deliver oxygen at higher than atmospheric pressures. The services are carried out by or under the supervision of, a medical practitioner. Services provided may include treatment of the following conditions: air or gas embolism; decompression illness; carbon monoxide poisoning; gas gangrene; necrotising fasciitis; thermal burns. Chambers regulated by the HIW will be classified as Type 1 or 2 depending on the levels of critical care management provided, as defined by the Critical Care Minimum Data Set (CCMDS): Type 1 chambers - these are able to accept patients who need level 2 or above critical care. Type 2 chambers - these are unable to accept patients who need level 2 or above critical care at the time of referral, or who are thought likely to deteriorate to those levels during hyperbaric treatment. Dialysis: Dialysis units provide services to people with chronic renal disease and are often located either within an NHS hospital or as a satellite unit in the community provided by the independent sector. Dialysis care provided by the independent sector is almost exclusively NHS funded care. (In some instances, because the care is 100% NHS funded care and the NHS consultant provides the medical care, services operated by private providers may not be required to be registered with HIW). They may provide: Renal dialysis and / or Peritoneal dialysis. The standards do not apply to dialysis which takes place in the patient's own home.10National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Class 3B or 4 Lasers or Intense Pulsed Light Source: Class 4 lasers and intense pulsed light sources are used in a variety of settings and for a variety of purposes. Examples of their use include: medical treatment in acute hospitals; dental treatment; refractive eye surgery; dermatological conditions; invasive cosmetic surgery by medical practitioners; minimal or non-invasive cosmetic services (which may be carried out by beauticians or healthcare professionals). Uses include the removal of hair, tattoos, birthmarks or other blemishes from the skin. Class 4 lasers and intense pulsed lights are powerful devices which, if faulty or used incorrectly, have the potential to cause serious injury to those operating them, recipients of the treatment and other persons in the vicinity, and to ignite flammable materials. Class 3B lasers are concentrated energy sources used for physiotherapy, eg to relieve chronic pain and backache by 'massaging' the tissue by pulsing the beam through it; for acupuncture; and for wound healing, for instance pressure sores, venous and diabetic ulcers, and for softening scar tissue. The majority of users are Registered11 Physiotherapists and Podiatrists - who will be exempted from regulation. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) provide advice on the use and safety of lasers - DB 2008(03) Guidance on the safe use of lasers, IPL systems and LEDs, April 2008. As a minimum, registered persons should be able to demonstrate that service users and patients are protected from adverse incidents or effects from their use, by informing their operational policies, procedures and practices through the standards set out in the MHRA guidance. Treatment protocols must be written by an expert medical or dental practitioner and a certificated Laser Protection Adviser must provide advice on the safety of the laser installation and day to day operational use. In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF: IVF treatments are licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) and fall within regulation under the Act as a listed service. IVF treatments may also be provided within larger acute hospitals where other medical services are also provided.11National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Other types of independent healthcare services: Maternity services: Section 2(7)(c) of the Act brings within the definition of 'independent hospitals' establishments in which obstetric services and/or, in connection with childbirth, medical services are provided. Maternity services may be provided in a range of settings: Independent Clinics - for example, ante natal or post natal care by private doctors. Independent Hospitals - provision of more complex care, including caesarean sections. They may also have midwife led units. It is expected that obstetricians, gynaecologists and anaesthetists who provide services in independent hospitals are current Members or Fellows of their respective medical Royal Colleges, have sufficient experience and seniority and are of good standing. They are also on the specialist register of the General Medical Council. Midwives must be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and have notified her/his intention to practice to the Local Supervising Authority Midwifery Officer. It is expected that a Head of Midwifery is appointed in all maternity units. Mental health hospitals: These types of establishments will have one or more overnight beds and offer services to adults or children with a mental illness and / or learning disability who require either short or longer term treatment and nursing care who require specialist assessment, treatment or rehabilitation. This includes patients who may be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. The Care Programme Approach (CPA) was introduced in Wales in 2004 and applies to people who have been detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. It provides a framework for caring for people with mental health problems and a co-ordinated care management system. This requires assessment, care planning, co-ordination and review of care. A recent review of the CPA in Wales identified a number of recommendations for improvement (Review of the Care Programme Approach in Wales 2009) and registered persons are encouraged to use these national minimum standards to help them meet the review recommendations. Some hospitals may also offer treatment for substance misuse for treatment of withdrawal from drugs or alcohol. The services offered may include some or all of the following support: Psychiatry. Occupational, speech and language therapy or physiotherapy. Art, music or drama therapy.12National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Psychological therapies. Recreational activities. Services to manage physical health needs. Hospices: The Act brings within the definition of 'independent hospital' establishments the main purpose of which is to provide palliative care. For ease of reference, such establishments are described as hospices. These are establishments with one or more overnight bed and generally provide treatment and care for either adults or children. Services will be designed to meet the range of complex and diverse needs of both the patient and their carers by access to a multi-professional specialist palliative team. Some hospices also provide outreach services to patients in their own home. Some hospices may have their own 'in house' pharmacy services (see also section on 'pharmacy services' under Acute Hospitals above). Children's hospices support parents with the burden of longer term care for children with life limiting conditions that often progress slowly over a number of years, (providing symptom management and respite care as well as support through death and bereavement). They need to be designed to provide environments that are appropriate for children with these conditions. The 'All Wales Palliative Care Standards for Children and Young People's Specialised Healthcare Services' (Welsh Assembly Government, 2008), builds on the National Service Framework for Children, 2005. Independent Clinics: Independent clinics are establishments within which services are provided by private medical practitioners. For a service to be classed as an independent clinic, it cannot provide overnight beds or for example, a listed service (s.2(7) of the Act) such as procedures under general anaesthesia or intravenous sedation. Patient consultations are generally in premises where the doctor either has a designated consulting room or this is shared with other doctors. Appointments can be booked in advance or not required if it is a 'walk-in' service. Both general and psychiatric consultations may be provided. Services may include: Basic physical or psychiatric measurements and investigations. Minor procedures such as curettage, cautery, cryocautery of warts, or other skin lesions. Longer term treatment for chronic conditions. Treatment for drug and alcohol misuse. Medicines may be prescribed.13National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Discussion of diagnosis and treatment options or onward referral for other services. Weight management / weight loss services. Travel vaccination services. In addition, establishments where no overnight beds are provided but palliative care services are provided by a medical practitioner(s) are classed as independent clinics and may include the provision of care, treatment, therapy and support services. Independent medical agency services: These are often termed private 'call out' medical services. They may be provided to patients who are permanent residents or residing on a short term basis. Services may include: Basic physical or psychiatric measurements and investigations. Minor procedures. Prescription of medicines. Discussion of diagnosis and treatment options or onward referral for other services. Travel vaccination services. Internet consultation, diagnosis or prescription. Independent medical agencies may also provide an 'Out of Hours' call out service for independent clinics. Using these standards: The standards have been written so that they are meaningful to all types of services, regardless of the setting. They have been developed to make it clear what applicants are expected to have in place at registration and ongoing, with further additional elements which they should demonstrate, once they are registered and providing the service. Each standard includes the following sections: The standard number and title. The regulation(s) that may be breached if the standard is not met. The main overarching standard statement in bold. A section titled 'what this means', is intended to add clarity to the scope of the standard and registered persons' should also take this into account when deciding whether they meet the standard. 14National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Taking into account the scope of the standard, registered providers should also consider: What service users can expect. The types of activities that staff or teams need to be doing. If the provider is an organisation, the following aspects also need to be included: How establishments provide assurance to the corporate board and. How the corporate board assures itself that the standards are met and regulations are complied with. The standard sets out the essentials that should be in place at registration, including (where appropriate) any service specific elements and those aspects that need to be considered once registration has been granted and the service is operating. A final section provides links to supporting information relevant to the standard. Updated guidance to reflect areas for improvement can also be accessed via the NHS Wales Governance e-Manual at: www.nhswalesgovernance.com Standard one, Governance and accountability framework, underpins the other standards by ensuring that arrangements are in place to manage and monitor compliance. Services and teams can use the standards to: assess for themselves how well they currently meet them; benchmark with others to improve further; identify what they do well and should be shared; identify what they do less well and need to put right themselves or which may need to be addressed at a corporate level; map against their own professional standards and show how they complement and sit alongside them; and make changes which contribute to overall quality improvement within their services. Providers, their Boards and Managers can use the standards to: self-assess against the standards at all levels and across all activities as a key source of assurance to enable them to determine what areas are doing well and those that may need to do better. Using the standards in this way will help embed them into day to day activities and operational working. 15National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales National Minimum Standards for Independent Healthcare Standard 1 Governance and accountability frameworkRegulation 6, 7, 9, 19 Organisations and services operate within a clear and robust framework for decision making and accountability designed to achieve successful delivery of their purpose, aims, and objectives, in a manner that: a) upholds organisational values and standards of behaviour; b) complies with all relevant regulatory, accreditation, licensing requirements, standards, directions and instructions; c) secures the efficient, effective use of resources; d) safeguards and protects all assets, including its people; and e) ensures good governance when working in partnership with others. What this means: Effective systems and processes are in place to assure the organisation, patients, service users, regulators and other stakeholders, that they are: Meeting the relevant national minimum standards and complying with regulations; Providing high quality, evidence based treatment and care through services that are patient / service user focussed; Continually monitoring the quality of treatment and services; Putting things right quickly, when they go wrong; and Providing treatment and services in accordance with their Statement of Purpose. Elements to be in place at registration and ongoing There is a document which clearly sets out: lines of reporting, accountability and responsibilities for all of the services provided by or to, the hospital, clinic or agency; and reporting to the corporate board. Where responsibility is delegated from the registered provider to the responsible individual or to a registered manager, permitting them to make certain decisions, this is documented and signed by someone with the relevant authority.16National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Where required by legislation to have named persons for specific functions that are related to the activities of the service, their name, responsibilities and lines of reporting are documented and made known to staff and service users. There is a Statement of Purpose and Patient Guide in place, which meets the requirements of Regulations 6 and 7. There is a quality improvement system(s) in place to continually identify, manage and respond appropriately to risks, concerns, incidents, errors, adverse events and poor performance. Relevant policies and procedures required under regulation 9 are in place. Service specific elements to be in place at registration and ongoing In vitro fertilisation (IVF) Establishments carrying out IVF treatments, will have a copy of their licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) Additional ongoing elements - once the service is operational Registered persons, regularly receive information about risks, concerns / complaints, incidents, errors, adverse events and poor performance to ensure action is taken as quickly as possible, to make improvements to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of patients and service users and ensure compliance with regulations. Registered persons can demonstrate investigation of and action from critical incidents. Registered providers have arrangements in place to review and ratify policies and procedures before they are implemented. Information about the quality of treatment and services or compliance with the regulations and how these are managed, is provided to the registration authority when requested. The Statement of Purpose and Patient Guide are kept under review and where revised, HIW are notified at least 28 days prior to the revision taking effect and sent a copy of the updated document.17National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Supporting information and guidance Note: this list is not exhaustive.

What this means: Services need to be designed, developed, reviewed and implemented so that they do not compromise or limit access and service users are assured that: Their rights and freedom to make choices will be promoted and respected; Good equality practices are in place and regularly reviewed to help prevent and eliminate discrimination; That reasonable adjustments will be made to services to reflect their individual needs; They will not be refused a service, receive a less favourable service or a service on different terms to other patients and service users on the grounds of their age, race, nationality, gender or sexual orientation, religion or belief, disability. Elements to be in place at registration and ongoing There is an equality and diversity policy in place which sets out the organisation's approach to service user's rights and equality, regarding the services provided. Service users or persons acting on their behalf, have information explaining their rights and how they can raise issues specifically relating to equality, diversity and human rights. Service users are assured that should their freedom to choose, need to be restricted at any time to safeguard them from harm or risk of harm, will be managed in accordance with The Mental Capacity Act 2005: Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards, or other relevant legislation (for example The Mental Health Act 1983 (as amended by the Mental Health Act 2007)).19National Minimum Standards for Independent Health Care Services in Wales Service specific elements to be in place at registration and ongoing Termination of pregnancy Through written information, women who undergo termination of pregnancy are able to express their preference for the disposal of their foetal tissue.
