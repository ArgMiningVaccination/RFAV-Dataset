The summary con- tains research summaries of 75 projects funded in2008. PURPOSE The purpose of USGA Turfgrass and Environmental Research Online is to effectively communicate the results of research projects funded under USGA's Turfgrass and Environmental Research Program to all who can benefit from such knowledge. Since 1983, the USGA has funded more than 350 projects at a cost of $29 million. The pri- vate, non-profit research program provides funding opportunities to university faculty interested in working on envi- ronmental and turf management problems affecting golf courses. The outstanding playing conditions of today'sgolf courses are a direct result of using science to benefit golf .

USGA Turfgrass and Environmental Research Committee Steve Smyers, Chairman Julie Dionne, Ph.D. Ron Dodson Kimberly Erusha, James T. Chris Williamson, Ph.D. iiSince 1983, the United States Golf Association has funded more than 350 university research projects at a cost of $29 million. The Turfgrass and Environmental Research Program provides direction to these intuitions and employs science as the foundation to benefit golf in the areas of turfgrass and resource management, sustainable development, and environmental protection. At the end of each year, the USGA provides a summary of the research conducted under this important national program and thisreport summarizes the results from 2008. There are two primary goals of the research program. The first is to develop turfgrasses and cul- tural systems with better stress tolerance and reduced water requirements and pesticide use. To address the USGA's first research goal, 49 research projects were funded in integrated turfgrass management,physiology, breeding, genetics, and course construction practices. The second goal is to investigate envi-ronmental issues and sustainable resource management for golf courses. Five research projects thatinvestigate the environmental impact of golf courses are reported. The research program actively coordinates and supports research, associated educational pro- grams, and other partnerships to benefit golf, the environment, and people. For example, the USGA,GCSAA, and National Turfgrass Evaluation Program (NTEP) together have developed turfgrass varietytesting programs conducted on golf courses throughout the United States. In addition, the USGA workswith state research foundations and superintendent chapters to fund applied research through the Grant-in-Aid Research Program. Ten research projects are included in this report under the Grant-in-AidResearch Program. USGA's Turfgrass and Environmental Research Program also provides funding tothe National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to support the Wildlife Links Research Program. Seven proj-ects are currently being funded and summaries of their progress are included in this report.2008 USGA Turfgrass and Environmental Research Summary Jeff L.
