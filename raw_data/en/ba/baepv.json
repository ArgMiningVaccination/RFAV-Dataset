Activities such as dance, dance movement therapy, Tai Chi, Somatic Experiencing, and Alexander technique have helped many people treat health challenges, preserve wellness, or are practiced just for the joy of the experience. Mental health counseling often focuses on the counseling relationship and words exchanged within, emphasizing emotional healing and reparative mentalization, however, the body plays an important role in mental illness and can be an important resource for healing. Dance is used generally for many reasons, but the most common seem to be to release stress or deep emotions or to express joy. Dance therapy is defined by the American Dance Therapy Association as \"the psychotherapeutic use of movement to promote emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual, for the purpose of improving health and well-being.\" It is an intentional method of using dance as an adjunctive treatment for various psychological challenges but it is typically used as a general holistic treatment and not prescriptively. It is based on the assumption that mind, body and spirit are indelibly connected and it's primary interventional tool is engaging the body in intentional dance. Tai Chi and Qi Gong are energy modalities that engage the body in gentle movement to move energy. They are key components of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Tai chi is considered to be an overall practice of gentle movements, often conducted while standing. These movements have formed the foundation of various martial arts and were established as expressions of movements found in nature. In tai chi, the chi, or life force energy, moves in a series of patterns or sequences. Qi gong has 2 components: internal and external qi gong. External qi gong is considered to be similar to Reiki in that a healing process takes place between two people. In general, qi gong is considered to be internal and the movements are more specific and targeted to address specific issues, as compared to tai chi which tends to be more general. Both of these approaches are essential elements of moving meditations and mindfulness practice so they are recommended in a wellness practice. They have also been found to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Research has also demonstrated that these practices have helped to treat substance abuse, traumatic brain injury, sleep issues, and Parkinson's disease. Somatic Experiencing is a form of healing that was created by Dr. Peter Levine and uses body movement to heal and release trauma. It was created to be an analogue to animals who, when they have experienced trauma, engage in movement designed to release the stress of the pain and then they often return to a baseline of wellness. Because humanity has an advanced prefrontal cortex, we can get stuck in processing trauma with our conscious minds and SE is one way to engage \"frozen trauma\" in the body and fully process it and release it. Training in SE is a three-year, heavily supervised process but it can be conducted by licensed or non-licensed professionals. Alexander Technique was created by Frederick Matthias Alexander to assist with vocal training in the late 19th century. The general goal of Alexander technique is to observe habitual unhealthy body movements and postures and correct them for optimal movement and alignment. There is little data on mental health outcomes for Alexander technique but it is gentle and seeks to return the body to its natural mechanical state before accumulated stress created problems. Sound Healing When Dr. Thompson and I ran our in-person CAM for Mental Health conference a few years ago, one of the most popular presentations was the sound healing presentation. I had not anticipated this and it struck me as remarkable. Conference attendees were able to experience some brief sound healing using tuning forks in the session and they found it to be an intriguing experience. Frequencies make up the universe and sound healing seeks to return unbalanced frequencies back to harmony. Sound healing can be offered by practitioners using a variety of methods but the most common techniques use tuning forks or Tibetan singing bowls. These bowls can be made of metal or glass. The bowl method varies in that some practitioners use many bowls that correspond to each chakra and use them to align or tune each chakra and another approach is called a sound bath where many bowls surround the person and are utilized at the same time. More generally, the bowls are used as a meditative tool and they have been found to integrate the left and right sides of the brain. The tuning forks follow a similar model but are somewhat easier to transport, but like the bowls are safe, and non-intrusive. They can be used to augment or amplify many other approaches such as acupuncture, cranial-sacral, chiropractic, Reiki, etc. Tuning forks, and all forms of sound healing, are designed to access one's innate healing ability and produce harmonic resonance where vibrations of harm or disorder are brought back into inherent balance. People seek out sound healing to address stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, among others. Both movement therapies and sound healing can be used to enhance wellness or as forms of treatment for mental health issues, however they are often used along with traditional counseling. Currently, more research exists to support the use of various movement therapies than sound healing but it appears that more evidence is to come for all of these approaches as people continue to seek out non-verbal therapies. For those interested in movement or sound healing, please see the Association for Creativity in Counseling where clinical applications and research are shared. ______________________________________________________________________ Dr. Christine Berger is an assistant professor of counseling and is licensed as a professional counselor in Maryland and Virginia.
