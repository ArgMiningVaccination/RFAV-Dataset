[Carrie Lam](https://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam?module=inline&pgtype=article)Cheng Yuet-ngor pledged that every resident would receive a free jab and said the government was prepared to purchase as many as 30 million shots if the vaccines required two doses to be effective. Advance purchase agreements had been signed with two pharmaceutical giants and another deal with a third was in the works, Lam revealed at an afternoon press conference. \"We hope to vaccinate the majority of Hong Kong citizens in 2021, so our daily lives and border exchanges can return to normal,\" she said. Lam's announcement came amid concerns that Hong Kong risked being left behind in the race for vaccines while the city on Friday confirmed 86 new Covid-19 cases amid a fourth wave of infections. Health authorities also toughened border control measures, including requiring all arrivals from outside China to quarantine at one of 36 designated hotels from December 22. Dedicated coaches will also be used to ferry arrivals to their hotels. Revealing details of the vaccine procurement for the first time, Lam said authorities had signed advance purchase agreements with two manufacturers that would each supply 7.5 million jabs. The first batch of 1 million, from mainland supplier Sinovac Biotech, would arrive next month, she said, while another million co-developed by Germany's BioNTech and US-based Pfizer were to arrive no later than the first quarter of 2021. The latter package was secured via mainland firm Fosun Pharma. The third company, AstraZeneca, would also deliver 7.5 million shots to the city in an upcoming deal by the second half of next year at the earliest.

The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine was being made in Europe, while Sinovac's was manufactured on the mainland, a government source said. Pressed on whether Hongkongers would be enthusiastic about accepting a Covid-19 vaccine supplied by a mainland firm, Lam urged residents to be apolitical, and trust the scientific assessments of her team. But she ruled out making the vaccination scheme mandatory. \"I cannot run a mandatory vaccination programme. I couldn't even run it for the flu ... [for which] the vaccines are well-recognised, so how can I run a compulsory vaccination programme for an emergency vaccine?\" she said. \"So much depends on whether people are forthcoming enough to be vaccinated to protect themselves, their family and society at large.\" Lam also said Hongkongers would not have a choice in the brands of vaccines provided. \"This is very much a government vaccination programme. So the purchase, administration, the prioritisation and the distribution will all be government-managed,\" she said. The chief executive said an extra incentive for vaccination would be the ability to travel, but she refused to commit to exempting those who got a jab from compulsory quarantine, citing the unpredictability of the pandemic situation. Medical staff, workers at care facilities for the elderly and disabled, and patients with chronic illnesses would be first to be vaccinated, with Lam estimating that high-risk groups encompassed about 3 million residents. She said the direct purchase of promising vaccines was part of a two-pronged strategy under which officials were to buy from at least two different manufacturers that employed different vaccine development technologies to offer \"risk diversification and better protection\" for residents. The government had also begun work on legislation that would allow for the purchase of vaccines from developing countries - now restricted under the current drug approval regime - if they proved to be efficacious and safe, she said. Friday's latest update on the city's months-long effort to secure vaccines drew a mixed response from the community. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, who along with other infectious disease experts advised the government on vaccine procurement, said the choice of the two vaccines was largely the right call. But he pointed out that Sinovac had yet to publish its third-phase trial data on the vaccine's efficacy and safety rates, adding it would be acceptable if it showed the possibility of side-effects such as headaches and rashes in about 2 to 3 per cent of those receiving the jab. Dr Arisina Ma Chung-yee, president of the Public Doctors' Association, said the government should make its decision-making process transparent including key vaccine trial data. She said a previous \"serious adverse event\" during Sinovac's trial in Brazil, which led to a temporary suspension, was not explained to the public. Patients' Rights Association spokesman Tim Pang Hung-cheong agreed the public's right to know was important, adding that residents should be allowed to choose the brand of vaccine. Pro-establishment lawmaker Elizabeth Quat, who chairs the legislature's health services panel, on the other hand, urged Lam to secure at least half of Sinovac's vaccines, or 3.5 million shots in January. 02:02 Fourth wave of coronavirus cases in Hong Kong prompts tougher Covid-19 measures \"Ordinary citizens, not just high-risk groups such as medical workers, could get a shot before the Lunar New Year, and the government could reopen the mainland border for them to celebrate the festival with their Chinese families,\" she said. Apart from buying directly from manufacturers, the government has joined the global Covax Facility procurement mechanism managed by the World Health Organization, along with two other platforms, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. In her policy address last month, Lam said Beijing would set aside \"a certain amount of vaccines developed or produced on the mainland for use by Hong Kong people when necessary\". The vaccines procured so far, however, are not part of the stock reserved by the mainland. The central government revealed last Friday that it would have 600 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine ready for the market this year, while Macau officials also said they would have a first batch available before the end of 2020. Secretary for Food and Health Professor Sophia Chan Siu-chee, meanwhile, warned that the current fourth wave was spreading faster than previous ones. \"In terms of the number of infection clusters, or confirmed cases, or the speed of transmission, this wave is rising more rapidly than the first few,\" she said. Chan said the seven-day rolling average of daily infections in Hong Kong had now hit 92.3, and warned most of these cases were highly infectious, with about 90 per cent of patients carrying a high viral load. The health minister also warned of growing strain on public hospitals, citing official figures that showed a usage rate of more than 70 per cent for isolation wards and beds, and a 75 per cent occupancy rate of intensive care unit rooms with isolation equipment. A source close to the policymaking process, meanwhile, said the administration was also working out the details of a fourth round of relief measures, with the amount of money set aside close to that of the third round's HK$24 billion (US$3.1 billion). The funds will be aimed at groups hardest hit by social-distancing measures that have been toughened amid the latest wave of infections. Additional reporting by Danny Lee "}
