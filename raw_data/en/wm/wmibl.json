Used safely, aromatherapy can help children (and adults) feel calmer and sleep better. It can also help to reduce the perception of nausea, discomfort and pain. Used improperly, though, the essential oils of aromatherapy can be harmful and even dangerous. We spoke with [Lisa Squires, RN, BSN, CCRN-K, HNB-BC](/clinical-staff/squires-lisa), a clinical nurse with the [Integrative Health Program](/centers-programs/integrative-health) at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, about safe practices when using aromatherapy with children. \"Aromatherapy has grown in popularity over the last few years,\" says Squires. \"And much of that popularity is justified. Aromatherapy can be incredibly helpful, especially in calming a child who is tense. But with the growth in the use of essential oils has come an increase in the incidence of poisoning, skin injuries and other health problems from incautious practices.\" Squires cautions parents to remember that just because essential oils are natural, it doesn't mean they are safe. Essential oils are highly concentrated extracts from plants. They can be toxic if swallowed and cause irritation or burns if applied directly to the skin. To keep everyone safe: While a personal inhaler, carefully used, is the simplest and safest aromatherapy method, several other practices can be effective if used with care. \"Aromatherapy can be wonderfully beneficial for kids and adults,\" Squires says. \"Used with care, it can be a fun addition to a family's stress-management toolkit.\" Contributed by: Lisa Squires, RN, BSN, CCRN-K, HNB-BC Are you looking for advice to keep your child healthy and happy?
