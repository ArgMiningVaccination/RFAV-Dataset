You may know that this training program was only offered in-person at the Blue Deer Center, the home of Plant Spirit Medicine. However, the increased demand for this training has moved us to create a powerful and nurturing virtual program for students around the world. Plant Spirit Medicine is one of the fundamental offerings of the Blue Deer Center. Therefore, it embraces the same mission, vision and values of the Center, as it brings its medicine into the world. As most people know, we are living in a time of pressing urgency to solve the environmental issues the world is facing on a global scale, from biodiversity loss to species extinction. Clearly, an alarming imbalance between humans and our natural world has spread in modern societies. A lack of connection with nature, lack of understanding of the vital role nature plays in our lives, and not realizing that we, humans, are actually part of it. In these modern times, we have seen an increased desire and need for humans to connect with nature, ancestral wisdom and the land. This course - supports our human hearts to be touched by the spirits of plants. The Blue Deer's mission is to help and support human beings to start that personal journey towards balance with our environment through our programs, specifically our upcoming introductory online course. Are You Wondering What is Plant Spirit Medicine? Plant Spirit Medicine is a form of spiritual healing rooted in ancestral traditions that combines classical Chinese Medicine Five Element theory with the indigenous practice of calling upon plant spirits to heal. Plant Spirit Medicine recognizes that like humans, plants have spirit, and their spirit has the unique capacity to touch and heal the spirit of a human being and restore us to our own essential nature. Plant Spirit Medicine differs from many forms of herbalism in the importance it places on the relationship between the plants, the healer and the client. Our ancestors lived this way--an existence in which there is no illusion of separation from nature. They would make friends with the spirits of nature and call upon them for healing and other everyday affairs. This ancient practice, long forgotten in the West, was remembered, revitalized, and reintroduced by Blue Deer's Founder, the late teacher and healer, Eliot Cowan, and has proven to be as effective in today's world as in times past. Modern people are once again turning to plants for guidance and for their ability to heal us in body, mind and spirit. When we take the time to build a relationship with them, they give us what we need to live a much deeper and richer experience in our lives. It is important to clarify that Plant Spirit Medicine course content offered by Blue Deer does not include the use of psychedelic plants, such as ayahuasca, peyote, mushrooms, and other mind-altering substances.
