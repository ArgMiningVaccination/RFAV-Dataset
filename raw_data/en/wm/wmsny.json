The August Roadside Survey, as it is called, is conducted on sunny calm, mornings, with a heavy dew on the grass, between August 1st-15th of each year with results posted in September. Most upland wildlife, particularly pheasants, hate to be wet. On mornings with a heavy dew, hen pheasants bring their broods to the roadsides to dry off before they begin feeding. This natural tendency allows the birds to be counted and reproduction can be evaluated by counting the number of broods seen and their size. Survey routes are 30 miles long and are entirely on gravel roads. When conditions are favorable, Iowa DNR biologists and conservation officers drive their assigned routes, at 10-15 mph, and count all the pheasants, quail, partridge, rabbits, and jackrabbits seen. In all, there are 210-30 mile routes driven (6,300 miles) every August to assess Iowa's upland game populations. Most counties have 2 routes, and the information from all of these routes is condensed to produce the following: [2023 Small Game Distribution Map](/Portals/idnr/uploads/Hunting/annual/2023DistributionMap.pdf) [ 2023 August Roadside Survey Map](/Portals/idnr/uploads/Hunting/annual/2023SurveyMap.pdf) Shows the current information on ring-necked pheasants, along with comparisons to the previous year's survey.
