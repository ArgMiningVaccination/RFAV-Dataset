The Federal Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines for people 6 months of age and older. The City of El Paso has received the Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson vaccines and booster shots. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is a single-dose vaccine and the booster is provided two months after the initial shot. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines require two doses to provide full effectiveness and the booster is provided five months after the second dose. The first dose will help your body process, recognize, and then remember the virus, in other words, the body starts the training required to produce antibodies (defense) which are needed to fight the virus if you are exposed. The second dose will help strengthen your immune response and develop more antibodies to fight the virus. The first dose gives partial protection against the virus while the second dose gives additional protection and helps the body be ready and avoid infection. Booster shots are administered to remind the body's immune system about the virus it needs to defend against. This improves or gives the immune system a boost. No. For those that have received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, there is no reason to be alarmed. However, people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their healthcare provider.

The City of El Paso will provide updates as they become available.

Currently the City of El Paso is providing vaccines to individuals 6 months and older. When registering you should receive a confirmation email. Please be sure to check your Spam and/or Junk folders.

You still can be infected by someone who has COVID-19, your body needs time to produce antibodies and you are not fully protected against COVID-19 after only 1 dose of the vaccine.

If you feel sick, develop cough, lose sense of smell or taste, fever, sore throat, nasal congestion. These symptoms are not caused by the vaccine and you need to get tested. Reactions to the vaccine typically happen after 1-2 days after receiving the vaccine. If more days have passed, it is likely NOT the effects of the vaccine and you might be getting sick. NO. If you test positive that means that you are infected with the COVID-19 virus and need to isolate. The vaccine does not make the test positive since the vaccine does not contain the live virus. If you received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, you do NOT need a second dose, as the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is a single-dose vaccine. If you received the Pfizer vaccine, the second dose can be taken 21 days after receiving your first shot. If you received the Moderna vaccine, your second dose is due between 28 and 42 days after receiving your first shot. You should receive the same brand vaccine for your second dose. This vaccine is not interchangeable, and it is recommended to receive both doses from the same manufacturer. Additionally, it is recommended to get the second dose from the same provider that provided the 1st dose. The provider will identify the location where to obtain the 2nd dose. If your first provider was the City, we will advise you of your second dose appointment via email, text or phone.

These signs and symptoms are mild to moderate particular after the first dose. The incidence of fever has so far been found to be higher after receiving the second dose. People that have been previously infected may experience more intense signs and symptoms but that is expected and not a reason to be alarmed. It is not considered an allergic reaction and those signs and symptom will resolve within 2-3 days. Severe allergic reactions are rare but can happen. According to the World Health Organization, serious side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine rarely occur but may happen if you have had a severe allergic reaction to any other vaccine, to the first COVID-19 vaccine or to any components of the vaccine, for that reason talk to your primary care provider because that might be a contraindication to receive the vaccine. Yes, it is safe you can receive your COVID vaccine, please consult with your primary care provider if you have history of severe allergies that required hospitalization.

Yes. The technology used on this vaccine has been in the make for many years now and has been tried in thousands of individuals before approval and authorization was requested. The FDA is required to make decisions that are guided by science and data regarding authorization or approval of COVID-19 vaccines and any other vaccine, biological or medication. Up to now, after the vaccine was given authorization, thousands of doses have been administered and so far, there has not been any indication of any other side effects attributed to the vaccine and continues to be considered safe. We are encouraging everyone who receive the vaccine to register with CDC at V-safe to report how they feel after the vaccine and to monitor for any side effects. That will give valuable information to the CDC and the manufacturers in regards to the side effects people experience after vaccination. Yes. The vaccine is given to people free of charge since the vaccine was purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars.
