Sixty years ago, chiropractors were being arrested for \"practicing medicine without a license\" and now they are working in unison with medical doctors, physiotherapists, neurologists, massage therapists...and the list goes on. There are a few common misunderstandings with respect to chiropractic. The most common of these involves the fact that most people believe we are \"bone doctors\". This is not entirely untrue, however, if you ask a chiropractor they would classify themselves as \"nervous system doctors\". Because of the way our bodies are designed, the spine and the spinal cord have a close, intricate relationship with one another. As a result, abnormal spinal function can effect the delicate tissues of the spinal cord and the nerve roots. The nervous system becomes irritated which can disrupt the function of the tissues or organs the nerves control. Chiropractic is the science of locating these areas of spinal malfunction, or subluxations, and correcting them to promote improved motion and to ensure the nervous system is working without irritation. Most people often believe that chiropractic only deals with the joints in the spine. This is also untrue. Chiropractors can assess and treat any joint in the body from your hands to your feet. This is important considering many injuries or problems in the arms or legs can cause associated problems in the spine. There is a specific art to chiropractic, as the treatment is given mainly with the hands. It takes years to become proficient in the skill of finding subluxations and then performing an adjustment to correct the subluxation. The word adjustment describes hundreds of ways of using carefully directed and controlled pressure to restore spinal bones to a more normal position and motion. After years of training, chiropractors become experts at using just the right amount of force in the right direction. Chiropractic is truly an art. The philosophy of chiropractic is another area which is not entirely understood by the general population. Chiropractors believe that the body heals itself, it is not the doctor that heals you. Nature needs no help, just no interference. The human body has the innate tendency to try to maintain a state of good health, provided it is given the essential ingredients. Chiropractic adjustments relieve interference on the spinal column and nervous system to allow your body to function at its fullest capacity. The concept of \"wellness\" is not new to chiropractic. Chiropractors have been promoting this idea for decades. They realized long ago that to maintain ideal health, you need not only a healthy body but also a healthy mind and a healthy spirit.
