Diabetes mellitus, or diabetes, is a group of diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels. These high levels are the result of the body's inability either to produce or to use insulin properly. \"Insulin deficiency\" means the body no longer makes insulin; \"insulin resistance\" means the body makes insulin but doesn't use it properly. Here's what happens: Every time you eat, your food is broken down into a variety of nutrients, including glucose (or sugar), which is used as fuel (or energy) in your cells for normal daily living. Glucose needs the help of the hormone insulin, which is made in the pancreas, in order to move from your bloodstream into your cells so it can be used as energy. The pancreas is a small organ located near the stomach. When you eat, your brain signals the pancreas to make insulin. Insulin acts like a key to unlock your cells so glucose can pass from your bloodstream into your cells. Insulin is important because it lowers your blood sugar and helps keep it within normal levels. Without insulin, glucose (or sugar) stays in your bloodstream and cannot get into your cells. This is what leads to high blood sugar readings. You may experience several signs or symptoms of diabetes, or you may not have any symptoms. Following are the classic symptoms: Frequent urination Thirst Fatigue Unusual weight loss Frequent infections, such as urinary tract infections; yeast infections; or gum, skin and bladder infections Blurred vision Sometimes, long-standing, undiagnosed diabetes can r esult in other symptoms such as: Erectile dysfunction/impotence Slow healing of cuts and sores Numbness, tingling and burning of hands and feet Diabetes also may lead to a serious health condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA (see page 32). W ith- out insulin, the cells of the body can't get the energy that glucose provides. As a result, the cells use stored fat for energy instead. As fat is broken down, ketones are released into the bloodstream and eventually appear in the urine.Chapter 1 Stomach Liver Pancreas Blood- streamSugarDiabetes: An Owner's Manual3What is Diabetes? Understanding Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes (formerly called \"juvenile onset diabetes\") is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although older adults may develop this disease as well. Only 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin. With the help of insulin therapy and other treatments, even very young children can learn to manage their condition and live a long, healthy and happy life. Understanding Type 2 Diabetes Most people with diabetes\u2014more than 90 percent\u2014have type 2 diabetes, which also may occur at any age. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but either the body can't use it properly (\"insulin resistance\") and the body isn't making enough insulin. Diabetes is a progressive disease, so over time, the pancreas will make less and less insulin and eventually will stop making enough insulin (\"insulin deficiency\"). With insufficient insulin, the liver also may release stored glucose (glycogen) into the bloodstream at any time, causing your blood sugar to rise in the morning after an overnight fast. When any of these factors happen, glucose can build up in the bloodstream causing high blood sugar, or \"hyperglycemia.\" Following are characteristics of people at risk for developing type 2 diabetes: Pre-diabetes (see page 4) Sedentary lifestyle Body mass index (BMI) of > 25 kg/m2 Family history of diabetes High triglycerides, or fat, in your blood High blood pressur e Excessive alcohol consumption continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual Glucose ReceptorInsulinCell without diabetes Cell with diabetes 4In addition, certain groups of people are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including: African-Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and Native Alaskans Women who have had gestational diabetes Women who have given birth to a baby weighing mor e than nine pounds Women with polycystic ovarian syndr ome (PCOS) Individuals with acanthosis nigricans, a darkening of skin that appears around the neck, elbows, underarms and knuckles If type 2 diabetes is not well contr olled through a healthy diet, regular exercise and medications, it can lead to serious complications. Understanding Pre-Diabetes \"Pre-diabetes\" is a condition that occurs when blood glucose levels are higher than normal\u2014but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Pre-diabetes also is called \"impaired fasting glucose\" or \"impaired glucose tolerance.\" People with pre-diabetes are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than people with normal glucose levels. Research shows that some long-term damage to the body, especially the heart and circulatory system, may occur in people with pre-diabetes. Studies also show that the best way to control pre-diabetes is to control your weight by losing 7 to 10 percent of your total body weight and exercising regularly. Three blood tests can determine whether you have pre-diabetes, type 1 or type 2 diabetes.What is Diabetes? Blood Test What It Measures Without Diabetes With Pre-Diabetes With Diabetes (Type 1 or 2) Fasting plasma Blood sugar levels < 100 mg/dL 100-125 mg/dL > 126 mg/dL glucose fasting > 8 hours Oral glucose Blood sugar levels 2 hours < 140 mg/dL 140-199 mg/dL > 200 mg/dL tolerance test after eating (often used to diagnose gestational diabetes) A1C Average blood glucose < 5.7 (average 5.7-6.4 (average > 6.5 (estimated over 2-3 months blood glucose range blood glucose range glucose number < 100 mg/dL) = 117-137 mg/dL) = 140 mg/dL)continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual5Understanding Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes is a common medical problem that usually occurs between the sixth and ninth month of pregnancy. During this time, the placental hormones in the mother's blood increase her need for insulin. Insulin, the hormone produced by the pancreas, helps keep blood sugar within normal levels. When the body is unable to produce enough extra insulin or it's not working effectively, high blood sugar, or gestational diabetes, develops. In most cases, the mother's blood sugar returns to normal levels after the baby is born. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at high risk\u2014between a 35 to 60 percent chance\u2014of developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years following the pregnancy. Gestational diabetes occurs in about 7 percent (7 out of 100) of all pregnancies. Most women with gestational diabetes have no symptoms, so a blood test is the only way to diagnose the condition. The test usually is performed at the end of the second or beginning of the third trimester (24-28 weeks). Women with the following risk factors may be tested earlier: 25 years of age or older Being overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) before becoming pr egnant Having a family history of diabetes Previously giving birth to a baby weighing mor e than 9 pounds Belonging to a particular ethnic group, including African-Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, Asian Americans and Native Americans Women with polycystic ovarian syndr ome (PCOS) Women with a prior history of gestational diabetes Untr eated gestational diabetes can increase the risk of macrosomia (a baby weighing more than 9 pounds before birth), the most common complication for women with this condition. Babies of this weight may have problems during delivery, as well as breathing problems and low blood sugar levels after birth. Most women can control gestational diabetes with diet and exercise. Those who cannot keep their blood sugar within a normal range through diet and exercise alone may need to take medication. Your physician may refer you to an endocrinologist.What is Diabetes? continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual6What is Diabetes? continued >> Here are some tips to manage gestational diabetes: Eat healthy and make appropriate food choices to pr ovide good nutrition for you and your baby. Meet with a registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator to develop a meal plan during pregnancy and after delivery. Monitor blood sugar levels as directed to make sur e they're within a normal range. A certified diabetes educator can show you how to test blood sugar levels daily. Get regular physical exer cise, but check with your doctor first to learn the guide-lines for safe exercise. Check urine ketones each morning befor e breakfast to monitor adequate carbohydrate intake. Ketones are the result of the body using stored fat, instead of glucose, for energy. They're released into the bloodstream and eventually appear in the urine. A registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator can show you how to test for ketones using a small plastic cup and Ketostix \u00ae strips, purchased at your local pharmacy.Diabetes: An Owner's Manual A1C Test The A1C test (glycated hemoglobin) measures a person's average blood glucose level over the last two to three months. The A1C also can be reported as an estimated average glucose value (eAG). People with diabetes should get their A1C tested every 3-6 months. The table to the right shows the relationship between A1C and eAG: Average Amount of Glucose in Cells A1C % eAG mg/dL 5 97 5.5 111 6 126 6.5 140 7 154 7.5 169 8 183 8.5 197 9 212 9.5 226 10 240 10.5 255 11 269 Non-diabetes A1C or greater7 Planning Healthy Meals Chapter 2 continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual Choose from at least three of the food groups, ideally incorporating a fruit and/or vegetable, at each meal. Healthy fats can be added in moderation.Planning for a healthy diet and choosing healthy foods that best meet your needs and eating habits are important steps in managing your diabetes. A balanced diet also helps you feel better. You can make a difference in controlling your blood sugar levels and reducing your risk for the complications of diabetes by eating the right kinds of foods at the right time in the right amount. Drinking alcohol also can affect your blood sugar levels, so be sure to talk with your doctor or certified diabetes educator to learn the risks of drinking alcohol when you have diabetes. Eat at the right time. Eat three meals a day spaced four to five hours apart at about the same time each day. This is especially important if you're taking certain diabetes medications. Eat the right kinds of foods. There are three major nutrients in food: Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates (or \"carbs\") raise blood sugar . Choose whole grains, fruit, low-fat milk and vegetables every day. Pr otein: Protein does not have a major effect on blood glucose. Choose lean beef, pork, chicken, fish, eggs/egg whites, reduced fat cheese and tofu. Fat: Very little dietary fat turns to glucose, but certain types of fat can increase the risk of heart disease. Meat/protein (1/4 of a 9\" plate)Starches (1/4 of a 9\" plate)Fruit (1 serving) Vegetables (1/2 of a 9\" plate)Milk/yogurt (1 serving) 9\" plate8 Eat the right amount of each nutrient type Carbohydrates provide energy, fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, so it's important to eat reasonable amounts of carbohydrates at each meal. Here are some examples of one carbohydrate serving, which equals 15 grams of carbohydrate: 1 slice bread 1 small apple 1 cup milk 2 small cookies Carbohydrate foods include: Starches (grains, cer eal, starchy vegetables such as corn, peas and potatoes) Fruits and fruit juices Milk and yogurt Desserts and sweets Nonstarchy vegetables have little effect on blood sugar and provide few calories. They can help lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and they have other health benefits\u2014so incorporate more vegetables into your diet. Some examples of nonstarchy vegetables include green beans, broccoli, spinach and tomatoes. Talk to your certified diabetes educator about how many grams of carbohydrate per meal or snack (or how many servings of carbohydrate) you need to manage your diabetes. You also can learn about \"carb\" counting to keep track of how many carbohydrates you eat at each meal.Planning Healthy Meals continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual9Planning Healthy Meals 1.Start with Serving Size and Servings Per Container because the rest of the label is based on this informa-tion.

Recent evidence supports that all individuals, includ- ing those with diabetes, should be encouraged to reduce the amount of time spent being sedentary (e.g. working at a computer, watching TV) particularly by breaking up extended amounts of time (more than 30 minutes) spent sitting. Here are some types of exercise that can help you stay healthy: Aerobic exercise Aerobic exercise increases your heart rate, works the large muscles in your arms and legs, and makes you breathe harder. It also can improve or lower blood sugar levels by helping your body's cells use insulin more effectively.Some types of aerobic exercise include: W alking Running Strength training Strength training builds and maintains muscle and bone mass, and gives you the strength you need for daily activities. Strength training also improves blood sugar levels by helping your body's cells use insulin more effectively. You can do strength training by using small weights or weight machines, or by using your own body weight with exercises such as push-ups. For adults with Type 2 diabetes strength training is recommended at least two times per week. Stretching and flexibility Stretching and flexibility exercises, including yoga and Pilates, keep your joints and muscles flexible and help prevent soreness from other activities. If you have certain diabetes complications, talk to your doctor about physical activities you should not include in your exercise routine, such as high-impact activities, heavy lifting or strenuous exercises. Regular physical activity is an important part of managing your diabetes because it helps improve your body's ability to use insulin and reduces your risk of complications. continued >> Swimming Cycling Water aer obics Diabetes: An Owner's Manual Dancing Chair aerobics18Getting Exercise and Physical Activity Safety Guidelines It's important to have a medical exam before you begin any exercise program and to exercise safely. If your doctor encourages you to exercise, start by being active for only 5 to 10 minutes a day, and work up to longer exercise sessions over time. You can begin with simple activities that include: Parking in the far corner of a parking lot and walking to your destination Taking the stairs instead of the elevator Walking a hallway several times Exercising to a video Y our doctor may recommend a stress test or an electrocardiogram test (EKG) if you: Have heart disease Are over the age of 35 Have high blood pressur e or elevated cholesterol Use tobacco Have a family history of heart disease Physical activity may cause your blood sugar to dr op more quickly than usual, so be sure to ask your doctor how to avoid the risk of low blood sugar. In addition: Always wear your diabetes identification which you can obtain with the help of your certified diabetes educator. Carry a cell phone with you. Check your blood sugar before and after exer cise. Always carry sugar-containing food or glucose tablets to tr eat low blood sugar. Warm up befor e and cool down after you exercise. Drink plenty of water. Stop if you have any pain or discomfort and call your doctor. Do not exercise when insulin is peaking. Do not inject insulin into an area that you plan to exer cise. Always have your blood glucose meter with you. Wear comfortable and supportive shoes and cotton socks.continued >> Diabetes: An Owner's Manual Blood sugar levels also can increase after you've been physically active because your muscles need more glucose during exercise. Be sure to talk with your doctor about ways to reduce the risk of your blood sugar level rising after exercis-ing. In addition: 1. Make sure you get a str ess test, if recommended. 2. Check your blood sugar before and after exercise. < 100 mg/dL: Y our blood sugar may be too low to exercise safely; consume a snack (15 grams of carbohydrate) before beginning your workout. 100-250 mg/dL: This is a safe pre-exercise blood glucose range; proceed with your workout. 250-300 mg/dL: Check for ketones in your urine: - Do not exercise with ketones; they can cause ketoacidosis. - If no ketones are pr esent, begin your workout and test blood glucose after 5-10 minutes of activity. Only continue to exercise if your blood glucose level begins to drop. > 300 mg/dL: Do not exer cise until your blood glucose level returns to a normal range (100-250 mg/dL). Exercise one to one-and-a-half hours after eating.Guidelines for blood sugar range before exercise19Monitoring Your Blood Glucose Chapter 4 Monitoring your blood glucose level can help you understand how your meal planning, exercise and medications are working to control your diabetes. Information on how often and when you should check your blood sugar with your blood glucose monitor, or meter, will be part of your diabetes treatment plan. You can choose from a variety of different types of blood glucose monitors. Work with your diabetes care team to make the best choice for you. It's also important to keep a logbook of your daily sugar levels so you can track your progress. Your doctor will need to see the logbook to treat you effectively. In addition, be sure to record other information that could affect your blood sugars levels. These include being sick, getting more exercise than usual, forgetting to take your medication or celebrating a special holiday. Keeping track of your blood glucose readings helps you manage your blood sugar in two ways: It can identify patterns that tell you how your activities af fect your blood sugar. It can tell you if you need to make changes to your diet, activity level or other areas of your life. Her e are the basic steps for fingerstick blood sugar monitoring: Gather all of your supplies. These include your blood glucose monitor or meter, test strips, a lancing device, a lancet (a tiny needle), a \"sharps\" container (a heavy plastic bottle for used needles and lancets) and your blood sugar logbook. Be sur e to check the expiration date on your test strips, and do not use them if they've expired. Wash and dry your hands and the ar ea on your skin where you'll use your lancing device. Use the lancing device to prick your skin surface and obtain a small drop, or sample, of blood for the testing strip to run your blood glucose test. These helpful hints will make it easier to obtain an adequate dr op of blood: \u2014 Hold your hands under warm water if they feel cold. \u2014 Hang your hands down at your sides for 30 seconds and gently \"milk\" the finger fr om the palm of your hand to your fingertip before lancing. \u2014 After lancing, hold hand on table or below waist to get a dr op of blood. \u2014 Deliver the blood drop to the test strip. \u2014 Change the lancet so you will be ready the next time you check your blood glucose. Write down the r esults in your blood sugar logbook. Always bring your meter with you to appointments.The only way to know how well your diabetes treatment plan is working is to check your blood sugar at different times during the day\u2014every day. continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual 20Recommended Glucose Target Ranges Leading organizations that help people manage their diabetes prefer slightly different glucose target ranges, or the healthy level of your blood sugar. The measurement \"mg/dL\" means how many milligrams (mg) of sugar for 100 milliliters (dL) of blood. For example: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends glucose levels: Before meals 80 - 130 mg/dL 1 - 2 hours after start of meals (less than) < 180 mg/dL The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) r ecommends glucose levels: Before meals (less than) < 110 mg/dL 2 hours after meals (less than) < 140 mg/dL Be sure to talk with your diabetes car e team about your glucose target range and record it here for future reference: My glucose target: Before meals _______________________________ After meals ________________________________Monitoring Your Blood Glucose continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual Continuous Glucose Monitoring Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are devices that provide real-time glucose readings, throughout the day and night, allowing people with diabetes to see their blood sugar levels and track how quickly they are increasing or decreasing. Some of the newest CGMs (Freestyle Libre and Dexcom G6) do not require fingerstick calibration and may minimize the need for routine monitoring with a glucometer.21 Learning About Medications to Manage Diabetes: Oral Medications, Combination Medications and Insulin Pumps Chapter 5 For instance, people with type 1 diabetes take insulin injections or use an insulin pump because their bodies no longer produce insulin. Most people with type 2 diabetes take diabetic pills, insulin or both. Some can keep their blood sugar in control with careful meal planning and regular activity. If you take medicine and need to take either more of your medicine or a different type of medicine or insulin, this does not mean your diabetes is getting worse. Over time, diabetes can change, and your medications and treatment plan will change, too. Remember, the key to managing your diabetes is to control your blood sugar levels, and you can do this in different ways. Most people with diabetes need to take medication to keep their blood glucose within a target range. How Diabetes Medications Work Medications that treat diabetes affect different parts of your body, including the pancreas, liver, intestines and muscles. It's important to talk with your doctor, certified diabetes educator or pharmacist about the particular medication you're taking, and make sure all your questions are answered. Be sure to ask about any side effects of the medications. Some medications increase insulin sensitivity, or how insulin works, in the cells while other medications prevent the liver from making and releasing too much glucose. Some medications cause carbohydrates to break down more slowly, while others work on the hormones your body secretes. continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual22Oral Medications Sulfonylureas Lowers blood sugar by stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin Side effects may include low blood glucose or hypoglycemiaGlimepiride pancr eas to release insulin to lower blood sugar after meals Side effects may include low blood glucose or hypoglycemiaRepaglinide (Prandin \u00ae) Nateglinide (Starlix\u00ae) Biguanides Keeps the liver from releasing too much stored glucose Side effects may include GI disturbances such as gas, bloating, diarrhea, or upset stomach , or how insulin works, in the muscle cells and fat cells Pioglitazone (Actos\u00ae) Take once a day.

Learning how to prepare and administer insulin is an important part of your diabetes care plan. Insulin is divided into five different groups, depending on its onset of action (when it starts working), peak action (when it's working the hardest) and effective duration (when it stops working).

For many patients, mixed insulin does not adequately control blood sugars. Usually you take this before your breakfast and evening meal. Rapid/intermediate-acting insulin: Humalog mix Novolin 70/3025Before you begin taking any medication, such as insulin, be sure to talk with your certified diabetes educator about any side effects. For instance, some side effects may include the following: Low blood sugar Weight gain Low blood potassium (primarily with insulin) Changes in fat tissue at the site of injection Allergic reactions Injecting Insulin The first time you do something new, you may feel uncertain about how to do it correctly. This is true for taking insulin to treat your diabetes. But once you learn how to inject insulin, you'll feel more confident in your ability to take this medication. The injection technique is the same for those who use a syringe or insulin pen. Some general instructions for taking injections are to choose an area of your body where you'll inject the insulin, and change the site for each injection. Use fatty tissue such as your belly, the top of your thigh, your hips or buttocks. Arms should be used as a last site choice due to access and arm variabil-ity. Be sure to wash your hands before you begin. Then clean the injection site with soap and water, or use an alcohol wipe.Taking Insulin Using Insulin Pens and Injectables An insulin pen and pen needle, which may be more expensive, can be used instead of a syringe to inject insulin. Several types of insulin pens are available for purchase. Be sure to read the instructions carefully if you decide to use one of these devices, and always check the label on the insulin to make sure you're using the correct insulin type. Below are some general instructions for using insulin pens:Diabetes: An Owner's Manual Inspect insulin and clean rubber tip with alcohol. Attach a new needle before each injection. Never leave a needle on the insulin pen. Always prime your insulin pen before injecting by r emoving the needle cap and shooting two units of insulin into the air. If you don't see insulin after repeated priming, don't use the pen because it may not administer the correct amount of insulin you need. Be sure the dose window shows \"0\" after the safety test. Then select your r equired dose. Insert the needle into your skin and inject your dose by pressing the injection button all the way in. Hold the button in that position and count to 10 (the window should be back to \"0\"), then withdraw the needle. Remove pen needle. Recap pen and store. continued >>26Taking Insulin Be sure to store your unopened vials or pens in the refrigerator. Don't freeze or allow insulin to become warmer than 86 degrees, and be sure to use it before the expiration date. Open vials may be refrigerated or kept at room temperature for one month. Avoid heat and direct light. Pens, cartridges and vials are good for a limited time after their first use. Record the date you use them and store them at room temperature. Store unopened vials, pens and cartridges in the refrigera-tor, and be sure to check their expiration dates. Drawing Up Insulin\u2014 Single and Mixed Doses Some patients take a single dose of insulin; others take a \"mixed dose,\" which involves combining two different types of insulin medication in one injection. It's important to talk with your certified diabetes educator about the steps you must follow to \"draw up,\" or prepare, either a single or mixed dose. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before you prepare your insulin doses. If your insulin is \"cloudy\" in appearance, roll it between the palms of your hands and mix it well. Never shake a bottle of insulin. Diabetes: An Owner's Manual For a single dose: Wipe the top of the insulin bottle with an alcohol swab. Take of f the cap and pull the plunger down to the units of insulin you need. Put the needle into the vial and push the plunger down, pushing air into the vial. Tur n the vial and syringe upside down and pull the plunger down to draw the units of insulin you need into the syringe.

Put the needle into the cloudy vial and push the plunger down, pushing air into the vial. Pull the needle out of the cloudy insulin bottle\u2014you should not draw out any cloudy insulin yet. Pull the plunger down to the prescribed units of clear insulin you'll need (these will be air units). Y ou need air in the syringe equal to the amount of clear insulin you'll take. Push the needle into the clear vial and push the plunger down, pushing air into the vial. Without taking the needle out of the clear vial, tur n the clear vial and syringe upside down and pull the plunger down to draw the units of clear insulin you need into the syringe. Check for air bubbles and push insulin back into the bottle if you see any sign of bubbles. Pull the needle out of the vial of clear insulin and carefully push the needle containing the clear insulin into the cloudy insulin vial. Without taking the needle out of the cloudy vial, tur n the cloudy vial and syringe upside down and pull the plunger down to draw the units of cloudy insulin you need into the syringe. Make sure you draw the correct units of insulin because you can't push any insulin back into the cloudy vial. Now you should have: ________ units of clear + ________ units of cloudy = ________ total units Pull the syringe out of the bottle. You'r e now ready for your injection. Push the needle through the skin and push down the plunger . Count to 10 and pull the needle out of your skin. War ning: Never mix Lantus (Glargine) or Levemir (Detemir) with other insulins.28Insulin Pump Therapy Insulin pumps can sometimes be used instead of giving multiple daily injections of insulin by an insulin syringe or pen. (You still need to learn how to inject insulin with a syringe or pen, however, you still need to learn how to inject insulin with a syringe or pen in the event the pump malfunctions, continued >> or before deciding to use a pump) The pump is a small, battery-operated device that's filled with rapid-acting insulin. It's connected to a narrow plastic tube that's inserted just under the skin and taped in place. There are also pumps available without tubing. The pump site is changed every two to three days. Small amounts of insulin, called \"basal,\" are deliv-ered to the body 24 hours a day. Larger amounts of insulin, called \"bolus,\" can be administered by the pump before meals or snacks. An insulin pump also can provide intensive insulin therapy. This alternative to daily injections may be right for you if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, take insulin, test your blood sugar at least four to six times a day, and count carbohydrates. Your doctor can help you decide if an insulin pump is appropriate for you, and provide a prescription if insulin pump therapy is right for you. The newest technologies integrate continuous glucose monitoring with insulin pump therapy which can automate some of the insulin delivery.Diabetes: An Owner's Manual Taking Insulin 29Treating Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia Chapter 7 Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) A blood sugar reading below 70 mg/dL is considered a lower-than-normal level of sugar in the bloodstream. (In gestational diabetes, a blood sugar reading below 60 mg/dL is considered below normal.) Some people may have no symptoms, but typical signs and symptoms of low blood sugar include the following: Sweating Shakiness Anxiety Nervousness Rapid heartbeat Dizziness/light-headedness Headache Sudden hunger Weakness Impaired vision Confusion Numbness or tingling around the mouth or lips Low blood sugar is caused by several factors. Below ar e some of the most common causes: Missing or delaying a meal Eating a meal that's smaller than usual Taking an insulin dose that' s mismatched with the amount of carbohydrate you eat at a meal Taking too much insulin or other diabetes medication Taking rapid-acting insulin too early befor e the start of a meal Drinking alcohol without eating Being more physically active than usualIf you'r e having any symptoms of low blood sugar, you must test your blood sugar immediately. Always carry your blood glucose meter with you. If your blood sugar is less than 70 mg/dL (or 60 mg/dL if you're pregnant), you need to treat it immediately by eating or drinking 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate. If your blood sugar is less than 50 mg/dL, you need to double the portion size listed below and eat or drink 30 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate. continued >> Diabetes: An Owner's Manual30How to Treat Low Blood Sugar Use the \"The Rule of 15\" 1. The following examples contain approximately 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate. 3-4 glucose tablets \u00bd cup of apple juice 4-6 ounces of regular (not diet) soda 1 tablespoon of sugar, honey or syrup 5-7 Lifesavers\u00ae hard candy 8 ounces of skim milk 2. Check your blood sugar 15 minutes after eating or drinking the fast-acting carbohydrate food sour ce. Once your blood sugar is above 70 mg/dL, you can have a snack if your next meal is longer than one hour away. In your snack or meal, be sure to include foods with carbohydrate, protein and fat. An example of a snack may be half a sandwich with a piece of fruit. 3. If your blood sugar is still below 70 mg/dL after 15 minutes, eat or drink another 15 grams of fast-acting glucose, wait 15 minutes and test your blood sugar again. 4. Document all of your low blood sugar episodes on your log sheet and discuss them with your diabetes car e team. By recognizing the patterns that cause low blood sugar, you can take steps to prevent them in the future. 5. Untreated low blood sugar or low blood sugar that does not improve with the above treatment can become an emergency involving loss of consciousness or a seizure. You also may faint. Contact your doctor or 911 if your symptoms do not improve and your blood glucose remains below normal despite multiple attempts to treat it.Preventing Low Blood Sugar Here are some tips to help prevent hypoglycemia and manage it if it happens to you: Eat meals and snacks at consistent times, such as br eakfast at 8 a.m., lunch at 12 noon, an afternoon snack at 4 p.m. and dinner at 6 p.m. \u2014 Be sure not to skip meals. Follow directions car efully as to when to take insulin in relationship to eating meals. The timing of insulin injections is very important. Understand how carbohydrate-containing foods and your insulin/medication doses are connected. The more you know about the foods you eat, the more you can control your blood sugar by taking the correct amount of medication. Carefully measur e your medication. If you think your dose needs to be adjusted, contact your doctor for help. \u2014 Do not adjust your medication yourself without talking to your physician. \u2014 If you exercise or ar e going to be physically active, you may need to either eat additional snacks or have a plan to adjust your medica-tion. Talk to your diabetes car e team for instruc- tions about the best way to use insulin when you exercise. \u2014 Always remember to check your blood sugar befor e, during and after any physical activity. \u2014 If you use insulin or take oral medication that can cause low blood sugar, you should carry the following items with you: \u00b0 Your glucose monitor or meter \u00b0 Fast-acting glucose tablets \u00b0 A snack that contains carbohydrate, protein and fat \u00b0 Always carry a Medical Identification, or \"ID,\" card, or medical ID tag (such as a necklace or bracelet) with your diabetes information listed. This is especially important if you use insulin. Treating Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia continued >>Diabetes: An Owner's Manual31 Carry a cell phone with you, if possible. Always check your blood sugar before driving or operating heavy machinery , especially if you use insulin. \u2014 Low blood sugar can limit your ability to drive and make decisions. Test your blood sugar as dir ected by your diabetes care team. \u2014 Vary the time of day at which you test your blood sugar so you can r ecognize patterns. \u2014 The most common times to check are when you'r e fasting, before meals, two hours after meals and at bedtime. \u2014 Bring your recor ds and meter to each office visit so that you can review this information with your diabetes care team. If you have a history of severe hypoglycemia, it' s very important that family, friends and co-workers know how to recognize and treat your low blood sugar in case you need assistance. What to Do in the Case of Severe Low Blood Sugar If symptoms of low blood sugar become serious and you're unable to swallow, call 911 or have someone take you to the nearest emergency room for treatment. Some people with diabetes have a family member or friend who has been trained to give a glucagon injection, which is a medication that rapidly raises blood sugar. For more information on how to receive this training, please contact your doctor or certified diabetes educator. Treating Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia continued >>Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar) Hyperglycemia means there's too much glucose, or sugar, in the bloodstream. Some people may have no symptoms of hyperglycemia, but typical signs and symptoms include the following: Increased thirst or hunger Frequent urination Feeling more tir ed than usual Confusion Cuts or infections that are slow to heal Stomach pain Nausea Blurred vision Dehydration Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet Hair loss These symptoms can vary from person to person, so it' s important to work with your diabetes care team and develop a plan to help you recognize and treat high blood sugar when it happens to you. Increased thirst can be a sign of high blood sugarDiabetes: An Owner's Manual32Treating Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia continued >> Here are some helpful tips if you experience hyperglycemia: Review your food choices. Y ou may be eating too much food or too many foods that are high in carbohydrates. Review your exercise habits. If you're not as active as usual, your body may not be using carbohydrates in the same way. Review your medications. Make sur e you're not skipping any medications and are taking them as prescribed. Sometimes if your medications have been changed recently, you also may experience hyperglycemia. Additionally, some over-the- counter non-diabetes medications can affect your blood sugar. Stress also can impact your blood sugar levels, so try to identify the sources of stress in your life and take steps to manage them as best as you can. Some ways to prevent hyperglycemia are to follow your treatment plan and keep your regular visits with your diabetes care team. Call your doctor or diabetes care team if your blood sugar is higher than 240 mg/dL or if there are ketones in your urine. Ketones are the result of the body using stored fat instead of glucose for energy. You can test for ketones by using a small plastic cup and Ketostix \u00ae strips, which you can purchase at your local pharmacy.Diabetic Ketoacidosis In type 1 diabetes, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may lead to a serious health condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA. Without insulin, the cells of the body cannot get the energy that glucose provides. As a result, the cells use stored fat for energy instead. As fat is broken down, ketones are released into the bloodstream and eventually appear in the urine. Here are some common signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: Stomach pain Increased urination, leading to dehydration Heavy breathing or tr ouble breathing A dry mouth or fruity breath Confusion Coma Vomiting or diarrhea If you experience any of these symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, have a blood glucose r eading that's greater than 240 mg/dL, have ketones present in your urine, or have a fever of 101 degrees or above, call your doctor. It's important to continue to take your insulin, check your blood sugar levels and your urine for ketones, and drink eight ounces of water every hour.

Talk with your diabetes care team about getting a flu shot every year. Ask about a sick-day menu, liquid carbohy-drates that you should have on hand if you have nausea or are vomiting, and any extra diabetes supplies you should be sure to have. Find out how frequently you should check your blood sugar levels. Keep a list of telephone numbers that include your doctor, your certified diabetes educator and your pharmacy. Always have a list of your current medications available. Drink plenty of liquids. Drink 8 ounces of water or other calorie-fr ee beverages every hour. You also can have ice chips, sugar-free popsicles, sugar-free soda, sugar-free jello and clear broth. If you're unable to eat, you'll need to drink liquids that contain sugar . Choices include fruit juice, regular soda and sports drinks. Check your blood sugar frequently , on average at least every four hours. Check your urine for ketones if your blood glucose is greater than 240 mg/dL.When you're sick or have an infection or injury, and your body is under stress, it responds by releasing hormones. These hormones can cause high blood sugar levels and make it harder for you to get well. Continue to take your medication and insulin. If you have nausea or diarrhea, check with your doctor or certified diabetes educator to find out how to adjust your medication doses. Check your temperature. A fever may dehydrate you, so be sure to increase the amount of water you drink. Call your doctor when you have a fever to get further instructions on how to reduce it. Let a family member or friend know that you're ill and keep in r egular contact with them. Ask them to check on you during your illness. Keep track of your illness and recor d your blood sugar levels, temperature and symptoms. continued >> Diabetes: An Owner's Manual34Here are symptoms to watch for when you're sick. If you experience any of them, you need to call your doctor for immediate medical attention: You can' t keep liquids down for more than four hours. You'r e vomiting or dehydrated.

But when you have diabetes, coping with stress is important because it helps keep your blood sugars in your target range.

Take time to enjoy life by spending r elaxing time with your family/friends or starting a hobby. Talk to a counselor or close friend, or join a support gr oup to get the emotional support you need.
