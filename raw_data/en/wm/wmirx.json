Yet, the underlying mechanisms adjuvants use to achieve effectiveness remain unknown. Evidence suggests that lymphatic transport may play a crucial role. Because of their characteristics, the vaccine elements must be transported from the injection site to, through and from the nodes via lymphatics. Hence, we hypothesized that adjuvants significantly alter lymphatics connected to and within the node leading to more effective transport and immune responses. We measured lymph transport by examining; the pumping/contractility of isolated, rat mesenteric prenodal lymphatics and the nodal vascular structures in response to adjuvants. We treated the isolated lymphatics with 3 different classes of adjuvants: Adda-vax, CpG ODN, and Alum at 4 transmural pressures. We recorded lymphatic diameters and contraction frequency at each pressure. Videos of the experiments were used to analyze lymphatic contractions and track lymphatic diameters. From the diameter measures, we determined lymphatic pump function and vessel contractility and used statistical analysis to determine the effects of adjuvants on lymphatic pumping/contractility. To begin to evaluate how the adjuvant may affect lymph transport within nodes, we analyzed the nodal blood and lymph vascular structures using immunohistochemistry with and without adjuvant treatments. These data indicate that adjuvants altered delivery of lymph by decreasing both tonic and phasic lymphatic contractions, decreasing lymph pump frequency and fractional flow. We effectively imaged the nodal lymphatic network architecture using Lyve-1 confocal microscopic immunofluorescence histochemistry.

In vitro, Ubx self-assembles in mild buffer at the air- water interface. These strong and elastic biomaterials could have a variety of applications in medicine. Techniques that would allow us to better understand (and enhance) materials assembly require materials assembly in extremely low salt solutions. These fibers are more blue fluorescent, indicating a higher number of the di-tyrosine bonds per unit volume. The purpose of this experiment is to compare di-tyrosine bond formation in fibers formed by Ubx and Ubx tyrosine mutants to distinguish between possible sources of additional bonds. We changed the tyrosines at positions 4,12, and 240 to serines, which will not affect the structure of materials, but will prevent formation of known di-tyrosine bonds. We hypothesize that mutant forms of Ubx will fluoresce less than plain Ubx because the di-tyrosine bond interactions are fewer in these mutant forms. The intensity of blue fluorescence in fibers composed of Ubx or its mutants were measured via confocal microscopy. The results of the experiment indicate high protein concentration increases the probability of random interactions forming between tyrosine residues. In addition, mutant forms of Ubx can form more random tyrosine interactions in comparison to plain Ubx at low salt concentrations. Shorter incubation periods in the buffer solution allow random fast-forming bonds to stunt specific interactions between tyrosines. In conclusion new, unidentified, interactions between tyrosine residues are formed in protocols that differ from ours. This work was supported NIH 2R01 GM099827-06 to SB.

Various renal immune cell populations following an AKI play an important role in its pathophysiology and the potential for CKD progression. In AKI, Th1 and Th17 subpopulation of T-cells have been identified as detrimental toward recovery resulting in CKD while increasing the number of Tregs may prevent progressive injury. Lymphatic vessels, and inflammation-associated lymphangiogenesis, help to restore homeostasis following tissue injury. In the present study we hypothesized that increasing renal lymphangiogenesis would help to reduce pro-inflammatory immune cell numbers in the kidney and thus improve the likelihood of recovery following an AKI. Our lab has recently characterized transgenic mice that overexpress the potential lymphangiogenic signal VEGF-D only in the kidney upon doxycycline administration. These conditional \"KidVD\" mice exhibit marked lymphangiogenesis throughout the kidney. To test our hypothesis, we utilized KidVD mice in two models of kidney injury: cisplatin nephrotoxicity and isolated glomerular injury. We first induced lymphangiogenesis to expand the renal lymphatic network in KidVD mice and then induced injury. One week following the AKI, we characterized the renal immune cells by flow cytometry in KidVD mice and their wild type littermates. Our results identified a trend showing a reduction in Th1 type T-cells in KidVD+ mice, while no difference was observed in Th17 or Treg numbers. Renal lymphatics may therefore help to limit the AKI to CKD progression. This work, GB, and JR were supported by NIH R01 DK119497 to JR.

Diastolic dysfunction underlies HFpEF, therefore insight into mechanisms that mediate relaxation can provide new potential targets for novel treatments. We hypothesized that cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC) plays a significant role in the regulation of crossbridge cycling, thereby catalyzing lusitropy to mediate diastolic function. cMyBPC (-/-) mice were used to identify functional effects of a gene; allowing us to observe the biological system without it present. We compared cMyBPC (KO) vs cMyBPC (tWT) in survival, echocardiography, and intact papillary muscle experiments; we used Vevo 3100 system to perform real time echocardiography. Data sets were analyzed using SPSS software. Survival and other analyses found (P<0.05) that relative to the tWT, cMyBPC (KO) showed shortened life span. By echocardiography, cMyBPC (KO) hearts exhibited slower e' and higher E/e' to indicate diastolic dysfunction, hypertrophy, reduced ejection fraction, and abbreviated systolic ejection. cMyBPC (KO) mice also exhibited decreased peak calcium to peak force time and abbreviated force duration relative to tWT. This means the KO exhibits accelerated crossbridge cycling and an inability to catalyze relaxation in response to increased pacing frequency due to the lack of cMyBPC.

However, the concentrations of nicotine in chronic tobacco users are too low to activate target neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which makes this an unlikely mechanism for neuroprotection of the dopaminergic (DA) neurons lost in PD. We previously showed that nanomolar concentrations of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby reducing the ER stress response, which results in neuroprotection. To directly test this hypothesis, we created a novel transgenic mouse line called ' 2-mutant', with enhanced ER export of 2* nAChRs. Surprisingly, 2-mutant mice demonstrated significant increases in sites (ERES) within substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DA neurons of female, but not male mice. We next compared tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in SNc DA neurons between midbrain of 2-mutant and wildtype (WT) littermates. Area of SNc TH labeling served as a measure of somatodendritic morphology, while TH intensity was used as an indirect measure of dopamine synthesis. We found that female, but not male, homozygous 2-mutant mice had significantly higher TH area and expression than WT littermates. These data support sex differences in the relationship between ERES regulation, SNc DA neuron morphology, and TH content in the mouse SNc. Future work will focus on using 2-mutant mice to elucidate mechanisms underlying sex differences in ERES biology of DA neurons, and neuroprotection in a model of PD.

Using acyclic middle-aged female rats that mimic the menopausal stage, we found that estrogen treatment increased infarct volume after stroke, indicating that replacing ovarian hormones was not neuroprotective. Acyclic rats also have lower circulating levels of the neuroprotective peptide hormone Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF- 1), and surprisingly, intracerebroventricular IGF-1 delivery reduced infarct volume and inflammatory cytokine levels in the brain. However, this treatment did not reduce circulating inflammatory cytokine levels or improve long-term depressive behaviors. Evidence that stroke leads to gut dysbiosis and increased gut permeability suggests that targeting the gut via systemic IGF-1 administration, such as an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, may be more effective at repairing the gut post-stroke. To test this, acyclic middle-aged (9-11 months) female rats were subject to endothelin (ET)-1 induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) or sham surgery and terminated 2d later. I.p. IGF-1 or vehicle injections were administered 4h and 24h post-MCAo. Sensorimotor assessments, blood, and gut samples were obtained pre and 2d post operation. Systemic IGF-1 administration did not reduce infarct volume or attenuate sensorimotor deficit post-stroke. At 2 days, IGF-1 treatment did not show consistent improvement in gut repair; however, peripheral levels of inflammatory cytokines were reduced in preliminary assessments. Since gut repair/regeneration typically has a 3-4 day cycle, these results suggest that future studies should examine stroke outcomes at the late acute stage (5d after stroke) to fully assess IGF-1's reparative properties on the gut.

Hypertension is also associated with immune system activation and inflammation that can lead to lymphangiogenesis. Lymphangiogenesis is the expansion of the lymphatic vasculature and plays a large role in the resolution of inflammation. Angiotensin II, salt, and asymmetric dimethylarginine induce hypertension, immunity and inflammation, and sodium retention in mice and humans. We hypothesized that these hypertensive stimuli will directly increase lymphangiogenesis. To determine if hypertensive stimuli induce mouse lymphatic endothelial cells (mLECs) to proliferate, mLECs were cultured and treated with hypertensive stimuli for 24 hours and qRT-PCR was performed. Results showed no significant changes in lymphatic gene expression for the lymphatic markers LYVE-1, PROX-1, and podoplanin. To observe the effects of hypertensive stimuli on intact lymphatic vessels, mesometrial vascular beds were excised from PROX-1 tdTomato mice and cultured in hypertensive stimuli with and without conditioned media for 8 days. Conditioned media was prepared by treating splenocytes with hypertensive stimuli for 24 hours. Mesometrial lymphatic vessels treated with hypertensive conditioned media showed a significant increase in average sprout length at day 8 (p<0.05). Lymphatic vessels treated with hypertensive conditioned media also had a significant increase in the average number of sprouts at day 8, except for the salt treatment. In conclusion, hypertensive stimuli did not have a direct effect on mLEC proliferation, but the presence of immune cell conditioned media increased lymphangiogenesis.

This process involves cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion. Previously in this lab, single cell sequencing was used to analyze the genes expressed in non-invading and invading endothelial cells. Results from multiple data sets showed that Never-In-Mitosis Related Kinase 10 (NEK10) was significantly upregulated in invading cells. In this project, proliferation and invasion were examined using gene knockdown and pharmaceutical drug treatment in invasion assays to better understand the cellular mechanisms of angiogenesis. We hypothesized that the knockdown of NEK10 would impact cellular invasion and proliferation, and Palbociclib would inhibit proliferation in treated cells but would have no effect on invasion. Human endothelial cells were transfected with three different NEK10 siRNAs, and qPCR results showed partial (40%) knockdown of NEK10 for all three. In an invasion assay with siNEK10, there were no significant differences in invasion density in the siNEK10 groups compared to the si2M control group. Immunofluorescence staining showed only one siNEK10 sequence group had a slight significant difference with less proliferation than the si2M group. When cells were treated with Palbociclib in separate invasion assays, proliferation was significantly inhibited compared to untreated groups. However, there were no significant differences in invasion distance between treatment groups. Further investigation of NEK10 and Palbociclib will be done to gain a better understanding of how each can impact angiogenesis and cellular mechanisms.

Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is a translation protein that negatively regulates peptide elongation. eEF2K is upregulated in some cancer cells and promotes their survival. The role of eEF2K in CD4+T cell activities remain unknown. Studied here were the phenotypic differences between wild-type (WT) and eEF2K knockout (KO) effector CD4+T cells. Preliminary data showed that eEF2K KO CD4+T cells produced significantly more reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that increased ROS and decreased expression of antioxidant, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) led to low survival of eEF2K KO CD4+T cells. When treated with ROS inhibitor, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), the survival and expression of SOD1 in eEF2K KO CD4+T cells should be similar to the WT. Using Western blotting methodology, we report here that the expression of SOD1 in both WT and eEF2K KO populations were statistically similar. The lifespan of WT and eEF2K KO CD4+T cells was measured using trypan blue staining every two days and cells were subcultured on day three. Cells treated with 5mM NAC had better survival than the controls. Additionally, eEF2K KO CD4+T cells have a higher survival, compared to WT, after the treatment of NAC. The culmination implies that T cell survival is decreased due to high generation of ROS and eEF2K lowers ROS, affecting CD4+T cell survival.

Regulating T cells that mediate inflammatory autoimmune disease is a major clinical need. By exposing the harvested cells to different indole concentrations, it is hypothesized that indole will suppress inflammatory T cell responses and increase regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this study, we characterized the effects of indole on T cell activation and effector function with the goal of engineering a bacterial platform to produce indole in vivo as a means to attenuate autoimmune disease. Cells collected from the spleen and lymph nodes of wild-type mice were passed through a 70\u00b5L strainer and red blood cell lysis buffer was used to obtain single cells which were then negatively selected through a magnetic column to obtain CD4+CD25- cells. Then antiCD28, antiCD3, and IL-2 proliferate and differentiate the cells in different concentrations of indole and were incubated for three days before intracellular marking was used to determine cell quantity and type. FoxP3 is a transcription factor unique to Tregs and was used in this experiment. Under Treg skewing conditions and increasing indole concentrations, the concentration of Tregs significantly increased compared to the control group. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN- decreased and the alternative costimulatory molecule PD-1 decreased compared to the control group under increasing indole concentration. In conclusion, these data provide a strong rationale for engineering indole production into a synthetic microbial platform and may offer a unique and efficacious modality for treating autoimmune diseases.

Hypertension is associated with inflammation, and persistent inflammation results in lymphangiogenesis, the expansion of the lymphatic vasculature. Lymphatic endothelial cells line lymphatic vessels which aid in the trafficking of immune cells and interstitial fluid. We hypothesize that the hypertensive stimuli angiotensin II, salt, and asymmetric dimethylarginine will directly increase lymphangiogenesis. Human lymphatic endothelial cells were cultured and treated with hypertensive stimuli for 24 hours. qPCR revealed there were no changes in gene expression of the lymphatic markers LYVE-1, PROX-1, and podoplanin. To examine lymphangiogenesis, 3-D collagen matrices were made, the treated cells were allowed to invade for 24 hours, and then they were fixed and stained with toluidine blue. When compared to the saline control, hypertensive stimuli significantly increased the number of lumen-forming structures and the invasion distance (both p<0.05). However, hypertensive stimuli significantly decreased the average lumen diameter and the number of cells per invading structure (both p<0.05). These findings suggest that hypertensive stimuli do not induce cell proliferation; however, they cause an increase in lymphangiogenesis. This work was supported by NIH RO1 DK120493 to BM.

Since all current FDA-approved treatments of influenza A virus [e.g. oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza)] need to be administered within 24-48 h post infection in order to be effective, rapid and early diagnosis of influenza infection can both improve the treatment outcome and reduce viral transmission. The overall objective of this project is to engineer a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) able to bind the H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) protein for influenza diagnosis. Phage panning was carried using either the full-length HA or the HA stem region (HAmini) as the target protein in alternative rounds. The target protein was biotinylated and phages displaying HA binders are pulled-down by immobilized streptavidin Unfortunately, after 6 rounds of phage panning, little enrichment of DARPin binders to HA or HAmini was observed while the positive control antibody, CR6261, was able to efficiently bind the biotinylated HA and HAmini. In conclusion, we failed to enrich HA-specific DARPins. One possible reason for the failure is the partial denaturation of the target protein during prolonged storage. In the future, freshly purified proteins or unmodified proteins will be used in the phage panning.

These immune cells are sensitive to various microenvironmental changes. These changes induce certain levels of MCs activation, further leading to their degranulation with subsequent release of numerous bioactive mediators. These mediators modulate the surrounding tissues and initiate immediate immune/inflammatory responses. In addition, MCs might be pre-activated by the low-grade inflammation. Such may diminish the MCs responses when foreign challenges affect the body. In this study, we assessed the ability of the pre-activated MCs to respond to an acute challenge. This study included 4 cohorts for both male and female SD rats; that received intraperitoneal injections of 48/80 compound, cromolyn sodium, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in different combinations. The 48/80 acts as a chemical MC activator, the cromolyn sodium acts as a MC stabilizer, and the LPS mimics infection-related MC activation. Influences of various treatment regimens on blood pressure and heart rate were examined using an MRBP machine specially designed for rats. Intensity of the MCs' activation and degranulation were evaluated microscopically in mesenteric tissue segments, stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated avidin, followed by toluidine blue staining. Samples of serum and lung tissue were collected for determinations of MCs-derived mediators. Preliminary data demonstrate expected trends, but more analyses and experiments are under way.

Phillip West Dept. of Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology Texas A&M College of Medicine Bryan, TX Mitochondrial dysfunction can play a key role in disease, aging, and infections. Release of mitochondrial constituents such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and ATP into the cytosol stimulates the innate immune system and promotes pathology in several diseases. CMPK2 is a complex mitochondrial protein described to be involved in mtDNA maintenance and induced after immune challenges. Though some studies have described CMPK2's role in viral infections, the specific function of CMPK2 in mitochondrial homeostasis at steady state and after challenge remains unknown. The objective of this project is to explore the role of CMPK2 in mtDNA maintenance and mitochondrial metabolism at rest and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. CMPK2 protein is present in the lungs and brain but not in liver and muscle of WT mice at baseline. Analysis of mtDNA copy number and Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-related proteins showed no significant difference in WT and CMPK2-KO mice in liver and lungs before and after LPS challenge. In vitro analysis of immortalized bone marrow derived- macrophages indicated higher levels of OXPHOS proteins at baseline and soon after LPS challenge in CMPK2-KO cells. Similarly, CMPK2-KO cells had higher maximal respiratory capacity and spare respiratory capacity than WT cells with no changes in glycolysis status. These results indicate that CMPK2 does not play a role in mtDNA maintenance but seems to be involved in mitochondrial metabolism. Future directions include metabolic assessment of primary cells and tissues of WT and CMPK2-KO mice to advance our understanding of CMPK2 function in mitochondrial homeostasis.

Evidence suggests that thalamic inputs to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) cholinergic interneurons (CINs) play an important role in behavioral flexibility. Our previous studies showed that chronic alcohol intake reduced thalamic excitatory inputs to DMS-CINs and impaired behavioral flexibility in reverse instrumental learning. In this project, we aimed to rescue this behavioral inflexibility by optogenetic manipulation which could enhance thalamic inputs to DMS- CINs. Two-bottle choice alcohol drinking and alcohol vapor chamber sessions established a history of chronic alcohol intake prior to behavior training. The rats were trained in operant chambers to learn left lever presses associated with a sucrose solution reward and right lever press associated with a food pellet reward. Then, rats were trained with reversed contingencies (left lever press with food reward and right lever press with sucrose) to assess behavioral flexibility. Before reversal training, half of the rats received in vivo optogenetic stimulation via optic fibers implanted in the DMS. The rats demonstrated goal-directed behavior following initial training but were unable to do so after reversed contingencies training, suggesting optogenetic stimulation was unsuccessful at rescuing impairment of behavioral flexibility. This reduced behavioral flexibility may facilitate compulsive alcohol use in patients with AUD. Understanding how chronic alcohol intake affects CINs in the striatum and behavioral flexibility will allow for the development of therapeutic approaches to treat AUD in the future.

In order to study contextual processing, healthy individuals ( n=25) underwent a fear- learning paradigm. Fear conditioning (light paired with loud noise) occurred in one context, followed by extinction (same color light paired with no noise, E) in another, to create danger and safety contexts, accordingly. Each context had two interleaving colors of lights, one associated with the noise (CS+) and another that isn't (CS-). On the following day, the extinguished conditioned stimulus (CS+E) was presented again to assess extinction recall (ER) and fear renewal (FR) in safe and dangerous contexts, respectively. Participants' physiological responses were assessed using skin conductance response (SCR), and their behavioral responses were assessed by recording their reported expectancy of a loud noise. We found no difference in skin conductance between CS+E and CS- during early ER, but higher CS+E in late ER. During FR, the participants displayed a greater SCR to CS+E. Behaviorally, subjects expected a loud noise from CS+E relative to CS- in ER, regardless of context. FR displayed no differences. Physiologically, participants appropriately recalled safe and dangerous contexts in early ER and FR. Behaviorally, participants showed impaired learning of ER and FR. In the future, the study will recruit PTSD patients and compare their performance with the healthy individuals reported here to identify the effect of PTSD on contextual processing.

Human disease typically occurs via bacterial inhalation, where bacteria infect host monocyte/macrophages. Experiments in our lab show that C. burnetii utilizes a functional Type IVB Secretion System (T4SS) to modulate the host innate immune transcription factor Nuclear Factor-B (NF-B) during infection. Stimulation of C. burnetii infected THP-1 Lucia cells with PAM3CSK4, a TLR2 agonist, shows that bacteria block NF-B activation in a T4SS-dependent manner. In this study, we used THP-1 cells to examine whether C. burnetii employs its T4SS to inhibit the gene expression of NF-B- driven pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF during infection. Non-adherent THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI media and infected with either C. burnetii NM II or NMIIdotA, a T4SS-defective mutant, at an MOI of 25. Cells were stimulated with 0.1, 1 and 2.5 ng/ml of PAM3CSK4 at 2 hours post infection (hpi) and total RNA was harvested at 6hpi and 12hpi using Trizol. After RNA extraction, samples were DNAsed to remove any residual genomic DNA present. Next, cDNA was synthesized from each sample and (+/-) reverse transcriptase PCRs performed with primers for IL-6 to account for DNA contamination. Currently, RT-qPCRs are being performed to analyze the differential expression of IL-6 and TNF in THP-1 cells infected with either C. burnetii NM II or NMIIdotA. We anticipate that results from these experiments will corroborate our preliminary observations suggesting that C. burnetii utilizes its T4SS to inhibit TLR-induced NF-B activation during infection.
