Her passion is to empower her clients to thrive, prevent diseases, and live their best lives. A graduate of Columbia University in New York City, where she grew up, Dr. Riob\u00e9 later obtained her medical degree at New York Medical College and completed her residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Medical College of Pennsylvania and the University of South Carolina. She learned conventional medical practices that she used for four years following her graduation and board certification in OB/GYN. Dr. Riob\u00e9 grew increasingly frustrated with the \"cookie-cutter\" Western medicine that she had learned and practiced. Although Western medicine serves its purpose for acute, life-threatening conditions, she felt that it did not serve to help clients prevent disease or treat chronic diseases in an effective way. She allowed her passion to treat the root cause of a problem to lead her to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Integrative medicine, and Functional medicine. She obtained a second board certification in the exciting new field of Integrative medicine in 2017. Dr. Riob\u00e9 incorporates these three disciplines into her practice to provide an integrative, customized approach combining leading-edge modern medical testing and technology with time-tested energy-based methods of TCM. As a doctor, entrepreneur, and mom, the doctor knows first-hand how easy it is to be consumed by a hectic lifestyle. She enjoys practicing what she preaches by eating healthy, meditating, making time for her family and herself, and working out. She also stays on the path to prevention by obtaining her annual integrative check-up, and encourages others to do the same. Dr. Riob\u00e9 is the founder of Awakened Wellness Now where she teaches and coaches clients to achieve self-empowerment in wellness.
