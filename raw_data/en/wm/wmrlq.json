This can provide a natural way to fight infection and potentially lower your pet's risk of chronic diseases as they age. Immunity dog supplements are meant to be given in conjunction with a complete and balanced diet. Common ingredients in immune supplements for dogs include fish oil, flaxseed oil, and other sources of [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.greatpetcare.com/dog-supplements/omega-3-for-dogs-benefits-and-supplements-to-try/) to help reduce inflammation. [Turmeric](https://www.greatpetcare.com/wellness/turmeric-for-dogs-benefits-and-uses/), another popular ingredient, also provides anti-inflammatory benefits that can help reduce recovery times from some illnesses. Additionally, ingredients like colostrum and probiotic blends can aid in promoting digestive health. Before introducing any new supplement into your pet's diet, talk with your veterinarian. Generally, however, you can consider giving your dog an immunity supplement if they have a weaker immune system or suffer from pesky allergy symptoms. Dogs who eat a homemade diet may also be good candidates for an immune supplement, as they may not be getting all the essential vitamins and minerals they need to support their immune health through diet alone.

Human immune supplements may contain ingredients that are toxic to dogs and cats. Dog immune supplements can be found in a variety of forms, such as chews, liquids, powders, or capsules. Depending on the type, immunity supplements may be given during regular meal times or after eating. Many manufacturers recommend starting slow with a lower dose and then slowly increasing to the daily recommended amount after your dog has had time to adjust. This can help avoid gastrointestinal upset. Follow the recommended dosing instructions on the label or ask your veterinarian if you are unsure. Additionally, pet parents should be aware that the market for dog supplements, like the market for human supplements, is wide ranging. Before making a purchase, do some research on the brand to see if their products are tested by a third-party lab. You can also look for special certifications on the label, such as the [National Animal Supplement Quality Seal](https://www.nasc.cc/nasc-seal/) (NASC), to ensure the brand is committed to quality standards and transparency. Again, it's best to talk to your veterinarian before starting your dog on any new supplement, especially if they have a pre-existing health condition, such as bleeding disorders, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, or gastrointestinal ulcers. In addition, dog immune supplements may not be necessary for dogs who already receive proper nutrition through their diet. Most dog immune supplements are designed to provide long-term benefits, not to address an immediate issue or provide a quick overnight fix. While they can help provide an immune boost, they should not be perceived as a cure-all that will ward off any and all illnesses. The reality is that dogs can and will get sick from time to time, just like we do, regardless of the supplements we use. "}
