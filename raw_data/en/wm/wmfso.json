This investment has contributed to meaningful changes, especially for women and children, who suffer the brunt of the world's disease and disability. Women today are far less likely than they once were to die in ch ildbirth; children are more likely to survive to their fifth birthdays. The promise of recent years has emboldened world leaders to iden tify progressively more ambitious international goals in health: ending preventable maternal and child deaths, eradicating malaria, and halting the transmission of HIV. Such transformative changes in the lives of the world's poorest people would be possible over the next 25 years, were it not for systemic obstacles that threaten to both impede further su ccess and undo the gains already made. Most of the world is now at a point where continuing progress depends on building the health system, the administrative and technical infrastructure that underlies all hea lth services. Attention to clinical medicine and technological innovations (things like vaccines, contraceptives, diagnostics, drugs, and oral rehydration therapy) has driven much of the success in globa l health over the past two decades, but these solutions may be reaching a point of diminishing returns. Continuing progress in the future w ill not be possible using the same tools that worked in the past. Donors need to revise their strategy to account for epidemiological, economic, and demographic changes in their partner countries. Now is a good time for the United States government and other donors to take stock of their investments in global health. The timeline on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), global targets that have driven international development work for the past 15 years, is running out, and there is ongoing discussion about a new development plan to replace them. With this in mind, th e U.S. Agency for International Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.2 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS Development (USAID) Bureau on Gl obal Health commissioned this short report. See Box S-1 for the Statement of Task. This report sets the discussion of health systems in the context of several important, current themes in global health. Two topics of particular relevance for USAID are ending preventable maternal and child deaths and bringing about an AIDS-free generation. The agency is also part of a global discussion about universal health coverage, the provision of a basic package of essen tial health services to the entire population. There is an emerging consensus, backed by the World Bank and the World Health Organization (W HO), that universal coverage is the best way to improve population health in poor countries. Growing economies in many middle-income countries make it possible to fund this basic package of services from domestic sources. Such developments change the relationship between US AID and its partner countries, and have broad implications for the future of donor assistance for health. This report discusses the past and future of global health. First, it gives context by laying out broad trends in global health. Next, it discusses the timeliness of American investment in health systems abroad and explains how functiona l health systems support health, encourage prosperity, and advance global security. Lastly, it lays out, in broad terms, an effective donor strate gy for health, suggesting directions for both the manner and substance of foreign aid given. BOX S-1 Statement of Task An ad hoc committee under the auspices of the Institute of Medicine will prepare, over 6 months, a brief and focused report to Congress and other U.S. government authorities on the value of American investment in health systems in low- and middle-income countries. The report will summarize how health systems improvements can lead to better health, reduce poverty, and make donor investments in health sustainable. The committee should also describe an effective strategy for donor investment in health given the increasing self-sufficiency in USAID's partner countries. The study will not involve detailed technical comparisons of specific regional or country strategies, but rather will recommend broad priorities for health systems strengthening.

Donors often favor vertical progr ams, which allow greater financial control and easier impact monitoring; such programs are also useful for acute emergency response. The U.S. government has invested heavily in vertical programs, most notably through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), its flagship initiative for HIV and AIDS. PEPFAR and programs like it have met with good success. Protecting these successes and continuing progr ess in the future depends on the judicious integration of vertical programs with local health systems. Attention to Health Systems Cannot Wait A strong health system is the best insurance developing countries can have against a disease burden that is shifting rapidly and in ways that history has not prepared us for. In many places, ancient problems such as hunger and infection exist in the same communities, even the same households, as the so-called diseases of affluence, things like diabetes and hypertension. At the same time , climate change is aggravating problems of seasonal disease, and globa lization is driving new pandemic risks. In short, there is a tidal wave of health problems facing the developing world. Ministers of health confront increasingly complicated tradeoffs: between treating children an d adults, between preventative and curative services, and among different ways to pay for health. There is still time to manage these tradeoffs and to make investments that support a range of health needs. Directing foreign assistance to health system improvements is an efficient way for donors to help their partner countries prepare for changing patterns of disease. There are also practical constraints driving the need for more efficient donor support. The past 20 years have seen tremendous economic growth\u2014nearly 1 billion people escaped extreme poverty. In 1990, almost 60 percent of the world lived in low-income countries, now only about 12 percent do. Emerging middle-income countries have become better at collecting taxes, making foreign assistance a proportionately smaller piece of c ountries' total health spending. Using donor assistance to improve the lives of the billion people left in dire poverty poses a dilemma to donors. Three-quarters of the world's Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.4 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS poorest people live in middle-income countries where foreign aid is not necessarily needed or welcome. Many of the rest are in fragile states, where political instability and poor infrastructure can prevent aid from reaching people. The challenge of reaching the poor is forcing governments to re-evaluate their aid strategies, identifying those investments with potential to transf orm the lives of the world's most marginalized people. Functional Health Systems Abroad Encourage Health, Prosperity, and Security There are bottlenecks in the organization of health services in many developing countries and these bottle necks allow diseases to spread. Extending health services to rural ar eas and marginalized people could do much to improve population health, and the cost of doing so is affordable. A modest increase in h ealth spending\u2014less than $2.50 per person per year\u2014could avert 37 percent of the global burden of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and 6 percent of global cancer. Attention to the financing and infrastructure that support health services would also help grow the global economy. Every year 150 million people, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, fall into poverty because of health expenses; millions more stay poor because they are too sick to work. Health spending poses a financial hardship for about a third of households in sub- Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. In response, patients may sell assets in distress, borrow at high interest, or forfeit future earning power through de bt bondage. Donors can help avert these economically disastrous practices by helping their partner countries develop effective prepayment systems and sustainable revenue sources for health. Reducing waste is another valuable consequence of investing in health systems. Governments in low- and middle-income countries often face pressure to allocate health monies unfairly, spending heavily, for example, on tertiary care centers that serve the relatively wealthy. Nongovernmental providers are an increasingly important source of care, especially for the poor. While competition from these providers could, in theory, drive broad improvements in service delivery, it is difficult to create market competition in health without extensive regulatory and enforcement capacity. As nongovernmental providers become more important, so does the government's oversight and management role. The potential economic payoffs of investing in health systems are substantial. Recent analyses indicate that an increase of only $5 per person per year in the 74 countries that account for 95 percent of Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.SUMMARY 5 maternal and child deaths would yield nine times that in terms of lives saved, disability prevented, unplanned pregnancies averted, greater workforce participation, and incr eased savings and investments. A 2 percent increase in current health expenditures would be enough to underwrite this transformative invest ment. The effects of such spending go beyond health. Healthy workers ar e more productive; healthy children are better able to learn. In the long term, investment in health drives increased productivity and improves the lifetime earning power of workers and consumers in the developing world. A strong health system also a llows for effective response to pandemic disease, something only 20 percent of the world's nations are currently prepared for. The tools that enable emergency response\u2014a well-trained workforce, an information system to support surveillance and data sharing, a solid infrastructure for clinical care and laboratory analysis, and strong management of the health sector\u2014are essential pieces of the health system. The same investments that improve daily functioning also build capacity for emergency response. When health systems cannot respond to emergencies, there is a risk that a contained health problem will escalate into a protracted political crisis. The governments of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are currently confronting this risk as th e Ebola virus, a disease of uncommon virulence and case fatality, spr eads through their countries. Ebola response would tax any health system, but the West African nations affected have particular vulnerabiliti es. They must now cope with an increased burden on their limited surveillance, laboratory, and clinical infrastructure, while trying to contain what could be a devastating global epidemic. Ebola has drawn attention to the consequences of neglecting health systems development in low- and middle-income countries. AN EFFECTIVE DONOR STRATEGY FOR HEALTH The challenge of the future of aid programming is to sustain the successes of the past 25 years, while reducing dependence on foreign aid. The committee suggests changes to th e U.S. government's foreign aid strategy that would build capacity in partner countries and make a clear statement about the United States ' commitment to sustainable development. Recommendation: Congress should respond to the social, economic, and epidemiological ch anges in developing countries Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.6 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS by directing more health aid to health systems building. The committee sees three crucial components of this strategy. a) Future programing should emphasize technical cooperation and country ownership in health systems, making investments over a long time period, and giving more attention to measuring the outcomes of their contributions to health than the inputs. b) The United States should make good use of its comparative advantage in science and technology by investing more in global health research and professional training for students in developing countries. c) The United States should also invest in monitoring and management, and require rigorous, external impact evaluations for U.S. government global health projects that involve technical innovation or new models for service delivery. The committee concludes that health systems limitations are the binding constraint preventing furthe r progress in global health. Building technical capacity in developing countries would help relieve this constraint and would show the U. S. government's commitment to a future when countries run their health programs independently. A Transition in How to Give Development Aid for Health Donors can foster country ownershi p of development programs by supporting their partner countries' national priorities and making donor funding for these priorities additive with local funding. Country ownership requires a complicated balancing of donor and recipient interests. But, when countries own their health and development programs and when their foreign partners set a standard of mutual transparency, citizens are better able to hold their governments accountable for the successes and failur es of their health systems. Improved government accountabilit y is a long-term benefit of development, the sort often obscured by donors' short funding cycles. Fluctuations in development funding from year to year prevent sustainable programming. They force undue attention on the wrong measures of success, emphasizing what the donor contributes to health, not what that contribution produces. A longer time frame on foreign aid and a transition to measuring the outcomes of donor projects instead of the inputs would contribute to more effective, sustainable development. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.SUMMARY 7 A Transition in What to Give as Development Aid for Health Technical solutions and support for service provision have long been central to the U.S. government's foreign aid strategy. Over time, this kind of aid can cultivate dependence on foreign assistance. The development of knowle dge and public goods, on the other hand, is a transformative investment and one that makes wise use of the United States' comparative advantage in science and technology. To this end, Congress could direct the attention of American scientists to questions that benefit the poor, especially in the emerging field of implementation research and in the development of medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics. Global health research also has a va luable capacity building component, developing cadres of researchers and managers in low- and middle-income countries. Training should also be a central piece of the aid strategy, but it should be substantive, advanced training with some emphasis on administrative professions. The United States can help alleviate the health workforce crisis by supporting higher education in developing countries through scholarships and partnerships with American universities. Donors can also help identify innovative ways to make the best use of the trained staff available in countries. Good project monitoring is a cornerstone of public management. Donors can invest in the capacity for civil registration in developing countries and should require more rigorous monitoring of their own projects. However, monitoring shoul d not be conflated with project evaluation. An independent, formal impact evaluation is an indispensable piece of those health programs that involve technical innovations or new models for service delivery. Only by comparing donor activities to clear counterfactuals can all stakeholders be confident that their investment in health is eliciting meaningful change. CONCLUSION Foreign policy decisions are always shaped in part by the current social and political climate, but they are also partially predetermined by the trajectory of commitments al ready made. Attention to the management, financing, and infrastructure that support health is a priority by either calculation. Buildi ng health systems abroad is in the strategic interest of the United States and should be a priority for the U.S. Congress.

Child mortality has fallen by almost half since 1990 (You et al., 2013). Mate rnal deaths have declined by about the same amount (WHO, 2012c). Now there is good consensus that a package of life-saving services coul d vastly reduce child and maternal deaths in developing countries (Bhutta et al., 2005; Bryce et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2003; Stenberg et al., 2014; USAID Bureau for Global Health, 2013). Demographic models indicate that the widespread, equitable implementation of these simple interventions could eliminate preventable maternal and child deaths over the next 20 years (Jamison et al., 2013). For the first time in history, ending the world's preventable maternal and child deaths is a realistic goal. Meeting this goal still presents cha llenges, however. Only 31 of 137 developing countries will meet Millennium Development Goal 4, dramatically reducing child morta lity by 2015; far fewer will reduce maternal deaths to levels set in Millennium Development Goal 51 (Lozano et al., 2011). UN models indicate that the global child mortality rate will fall to the specified level around 2028 (UN, 2014). But, if current trends continue (see Figure 1-1), many countries will not meet the 2015 targets until 2040 or later (Lozano et al., 2011). This is not to say that countries must necessarily st ay on their current trajectories\u2014 rapid change is possible. Improvements in health rarely take a linear path (Fr\u00f8en and Temmerman, 2013; Walker et al., 2013). In maternal and 1 The Millennium Development Goals are a set of global targets to improve health and standard of living in poor countries. They were developed at the UN Millennium Summit with the support of 189 countries (Oestergaar d et al., 2013; Oxfam International, 2011). Millennium Development Goal 4 is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds of 1990 rates; Goal 5 includes a target for three-quarters re duction in maternal mortality ratio from 1990 levels (UNICEF, 2012).

Rather, these deaths are the result of a dozen smaller failures: delays in treatment, lack of proper referrals, clinicians not trained in emergency case management, poor quality medicines, problems with blood banking, and stock outs of essential supplies. Making progress against maternal mortality requires addressing a constellation of related problems. The same is true for deaths in children under five. Around the world, deaths in the first month of life, often on the first day, account for the greatest portion of child mortality (Liu et al., 2012). Newborn lives are protected with many of the same interventions in pregnancy and delivery that benefit their mothers. Other common killers of children, including pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria, are greatly complicated by the potentiating effects of poor nutrition (Black et al., 2008; You et al., 2013). Although the relative burden of different infections varies by country, there is a resoundingly common problem with equity. Poor children are more likely to get sick; they are more exposed to disease vectors, contaminated water, poor housing, and crowding. Their poor nutrition and lowered immunity ma ke ordinary infections more dangerous for them, but they are less likely to access any lifesaving measures, from routine immunizations to curative care (Gwatkin et al., 2004; Victora et al., 2003). Improving child survival means removing the barriers that keep the most vulnerable people from health (UNICEF, 2010). Yet there is a risk to putting maternal and child health too much at the center of a global health agenda. Such emphasis, though helpful in building momentum for change a nd marshaling funding, can make pregnancy, delivery, and early childhood services a sort of vertical health program, 3 delivering good care selectively to a narrow group. The very importance of these services makes it necessary to deliver them as effectively as possible, integrating them with primary care. Women of childbearing age in poor countries have a range of health complaints, including noncommunicable conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, asthma, depression, and injury (Stenberg et al., 2014). Children, similarly, should not survive the routine infections of early childhood only to suffer at school age for want of basic surgery or trauma care. Indeed, recent analyses indicate that the world's overall burden of death from infections, malnutrition, ma ternal and neonatal causes, is decreasing; it fell by 9.2 percentage points between 1990 and 2010 3 A health program targeted to a specific c ondition, often with sp ecialized management, logistics, and delivery.

At the same time , the share of deaths from cancer, injury, diabetes and heart disease has grown. Non-communicable causes now account for two-thirds of all deaths worldwide (Lozano et al., 2012). EMERGING MOMENTUM FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE Balancing competing priorities in health is at center of an important discussion on how to plan for globa l development after 2015 (sometimes called the post-2015 development agenda). There is an emerging consensus, backed by the Wo rld Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO), that bringing health and economic stability to the most vulnerable people in the wo rld can be best achieved though universal health coverage (Brearle y et al., 2013; Latko et al., 2011). The goal of universal coverage is \"to ensu re that all people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them\" (WHO, 2012b). As such, it is a means to an end, a way to bring the full benefits of a healthy life to everyone. Universal health coverage aims to bring about a fairer distribution of essential health services. This is partly to correct a historical problem, whereby public spending in developing countries has favored the rich (Moreno-Serra and Smith, 2012). In countries that have implemented universal coverage, the removal of financial barriers to care and the investment in primary health services have been an effective remedy to this problem. In Thailand, for exam ple, the benefits of universal coverage, especially the reduction in infant mortality, were more pronounced among the poor (Gruber et al., 2012; Vapattanawong et al., 2007). That does not mean that the growing support for universal coverage is a promise to supply high-tech curative procedures to every patient. Universal coverage applies to priori ty conditions, conditions which are, ideally, identified from national epidemiological data (Bristol, 2014; WHO, 2012b). Furthermore, reaching universal coverage in a country can be long process\u2014it took 127 years in Germany (Averill and Marriott, 2013). There is no reason, however, that developing countries should have to wait as long. Thaila nd has made rapid progress over the past 40 years, introducing a national coverage scheme in steps, starting with the people in formal employme nt and with basic coverage for the poor, and gradually expanding from there (Hanvoravongchai, 2013). Women and children have the most to gain from universal coverage; they are the furthest behind (Quick et al., 2014). Because they are Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTRODUCTION 13 poorest, they are also the most deterred by costs. But they are not the only ones who stand to benefit. Build ing a cohesive health system in low- and middle-income countries, whic h universal coverage aims to do, is a necessary pre-requisite for all of the Millennium Development Goals in health (Travis et al., 2004). In a larger sense, building a reliable health infrastructure in developing countri es has consequences that go beyond health, to advancing global prospe rity and security. When implemented effectively, universal coverage can be an instrument for poverty reduction and government accountability as well as health. Such are the concerns of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the agency in the U.S. federal government, \"that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, demo cratic societies to realize their potential\" (USAID, 2014). THE CHARGE TO THE COMMITTEE USAID's Bureau for Global Hea lth commissioned this report to study the value of health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries. This discussion is particularly important now, as the timeline on the Millennium Developmen t Goals runs out and new goals for global development replace them. The U.S. government can use this time to take stock of its investment in global health, reviewing its changing role as a partner in development. To this end, USAID commissioned the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to bring together an expert committee to produce a short and focused report on investing in health systems in developing countries. Box 1-1 gives background on the study and statement of task. This report aims to help government decision makers assess the rapidly changing social and economic situation in developing countries and its implications for effective development assistance. Many countries that have traditionally been recipien ts of donor assistance for health are now able to finance basic health services from domestic monies (Jamison et al., 2013). Even among countries that depend more on donor aid, the burden of disease and health needs is changing; donor strategy has to change with it. In light of these developments, this report will discuss why an investment in health systems is crucial to sustain the gains of the past 25 years. First, it will describe why it is in the United States' pressing national interest to improve health systems in developing countries and why that needs to be done now. Next, it will lay out what actions will best serve this goa l and how to go about them.

At their meeting in February 2014 the Standing Committee helped to develop the statement of task shown below. While doing this, the Stan ding Committee was sensitive to the fact that this report would be a narrowly focused project, and that its authoring committee would meet only once. The Institute of Medicine co nvened an 11-person ad hoc consensus committee in March 2014 to examine the questions set out in the statement of task. These ad hoc committee members included some members of the Standing Committee and other experts with needed expertise. (See Appendix A for committee member biographies.) The committee met in April 2014 to hear testimony and deliberate. (See Appendix B for the meeting agenda.) The committee developed an approach to their task, considered the evidence and testimony, and came to tentative conclusions at this meeting. At this time, they determ ined that questions relating to corruption in donor aid, and the role of donor and recipient governments in controlling corruption, were outside the scope of this report. Over the next months, the committee revised drafts, refined conclusions, and solidified references , resulting in the present report. Statement of Task An ad hoc committee under the au spices of the Institute of Medicine will prepare, over 6 months, a brief and focused report to Congress and other U.S. government authorities on the value of American investment in health sy stems in low- and middle-income countries. The report will summarize how health systems improvements can lead to better health, reduce poverty, and make donor investments in health sustainable. The committee should also describe an effective strategy for donor investment in health given the increasing self-sufficiency in USAID's partner countries. The study will not involve detailed technical comparisons of specific regional or country strategies, but rather will recommend broad priorities for health systems strengthening.

Conclusions Improving maternal and child survival is an important goal, but there is a risk to making it the centerpiece of the global health agenda. The global disease burden is changing. Countries need a way to respond to these changes, and creating a targeted health program for maternal and child he alth is not a viable long-term solution. Bringing good services to a large number people is the next main challenge in global health. Developing a strong health infrastructure in low- and middle- income countries will improve heal th, and will have consequences that go beyond health to buildin g a more stable and prosperous world.

As such, the health system includes much more than the health care delivery system, though this distinction can get lost in policy discussions. The WHO has identified six building blocks of a health system: the leadership , who steer the health sector and set the country's policies; the information system that supports vital registration, surveillance, and monitoring, financing, human resources, coverage, and quality of care; an accountable financing system to raise and pool funds; a productive workforce and tools to ensure they are deployed efficiently; an affordable supply of essential medicines, vaccines, and technology and a functional regulatory authority to protect their quality; and, lastly, a service delivery system that can work through public or private sector providers (WHO, 2007a, 2010a). The health system is a social ins titution. It produces a set of essential public health functions, things li ke disease surveillance, medicines regulation, research, and policies (Khaleghian and Gupta, 2005). Curative and preventative health care are a part, but only a part, of the health system's essential services (CDC Office for State Tribal Local and Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.18 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS Territorial Support, 2014). The health system is the foundation supporting effective health services. A TRADITION OF SUPPORTING GLOBAL HEALTH Health assistance is usually d escribed as either vertical (or categorical, targeted programs) with systems dedicated to specific service or condition, or horizontal (or integrated programs), which support more comprehensive care. Ve rtical programs generally have separate management and logistics systems: this can include a separate workforce, surveillance system, and method of assuring drug quality (Victora et al., 2004). Horizontal programs, on the other hand, tend to work more generally through primary care systems (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2006; Victora et al., 2004). In practice, the distinction between vertical and horizontal health programs is not always clear; most services have a range of vertical and horizontal elements (Atun et al., 2008; Oliveira-Cruz et al., 2003). For example, immunizations delivered though primary care may be paid for with vertical, donor financing. Conversely, immunizations may be paid for fro m the general health budget, but provided at free-standing vaccine clinics or on vaccine campaign days (Atun et al., 2008). Over time, donor interest in rela tively more vertical or horizontal health aid has fluctuated. In 1988, Carl Taylor and Richard Jolly decried an emerging battle in development assistance between proponents of selective and comprehensive primary care (Taylor and Jolly, 1988). They concluded that functional health syst ems have both selective, or vertical, elements, and comprehensive, or horizontal, ones (Taylor and Jolly, 1988). Nevertheless, they cited \"abundant experience\" of vertical programs that have, \"been started at the insistence of international donors so that they can monitor the flow of their dollars and take credit for their impact ... leav[ing] countries with en trenched bureaucraci es that resist eventual integration into [primary health care]\" (Taylor and Jolly, 1988, p. 975). They acknowledged the valu e of technological innovations, but cautioned that these technologies would \"not make much difference\" without attention to organization, management, financing, and the training health personnel (Taylor and Jolly, 1988, p. 973). They also identified an \"urgent question\" for future debate: how to develop a sustainable infrastructure for primary care in developing countries (Taylor and Jolly, 1988, p. 975). Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 19 Their concerns are as relevant today as they were 26 years ago. Vertical health programs have continued to enjoy some popularity among donors. Such arrangements work well when there is urgent need to respond to an epidemic or when international cooperative action is necessary for success (Peters et al., 2013b; Victora et al., 2004). Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 through an international, vertical health program (Atun et al., 2008; WHO, 2010d). More recently, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has brought life-saving treatment to 6.7 million people in 65 countries (PEPFAR and Department of State HIU, 2014). At times, however, the free-standing structure of the vertical program can impede success. Malaria eradication efforts, for example, may have fa iled because case surveillance was not integrated into primary care (Atun et al., 2008; Bradley, 1998). There are also concerns with negative spillover effects of vertical programs: they create a hierarchy of diseases, encourage fragmentation, are often inefficient (Atun et al., 2008). Most of all, as Taylor and Jolly pointed out, vertical initiatives depend on dedicated funding and specialized management (Taylor and Jolly, 1988). They are designed for donor funding needs, and are not typically sustainable when outside funding ends. Experts have debated the merits of vertical and horizontal health strategies for decades, but there is re markably little scientific analysis on their relative effectiveness (Atun et al., 2008). It is clear, however, that vertical programs attract funding in places with weak health infrastructure and poor public management (Victora et al., 2004). When these programs are then run in a way that undermines the local health system, the initial management and infrastructure problems are not likely to improve. To put it another way, failure to plan for the careful integration of vertical programs with general health services aggravates the very staffing and organizational constraints that made foreign assistance necessary in the first place. The future of global health will require building off established platforms, integrating HIV, tuberculos is, malaria, and maternal and child health programs with primary care systems, using targeted investments to improve the broader health infrastructure countries' depend on (Atun et al., 2013; Samb et al., 2009). In an era when donors aim to speed progress to health goals, duplicating pieces of the health system for vertical programs will not be a sustainable or sensible strategy.Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 21 A concern with sustainability, the ability of a project to function effectively after outside support comes to an end, takes particular precedence now, as aid recipient countri es are increasingly able to fund health services independently (WHO African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control, 2014). Sustainability and judicious integration of vertical programs with health systems are especially salient topics for the U.S. government, whose investment in health has grown over the past 25 years. Much of this spending is directed to targeted programs for maternal and child health, malaria, t uberculosis, and, most of all, HIV and AIDS. (See Figure 2-1.) PEPFAR, the U.S. government's flagship program in global health, has driven much of this increase and accounts for about half of its bilateral health aid (IHME, 2014). PEPFAR has helped stem the tide of the HIV epidemic and averted a humanitarian and political catastrophe. The success of this program alone compels a thoughtful appraisal of the United States' continued work in global health. In 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry lauded the birth of the millionth child protected from the ve rtical transmission of HIV because of PEPFAR (PEPFAR, 2013a). This child's future, already inextricably linked to the United States, will depend on a functional health system to support a healthy life. Through prompt and judicious development action, the United States can help provide this. This chapter will discuss the value of transformative investment in health systems, emphasizing why such action is necessary now, and why it is in the best interest of the Un ited States. The first section discusses the timeliness of health systems building. Years of successful action against communicable disease, especially against HIV and AIDS, drive an urgency to the need for stronger health systems. Global epidemiological and economic changes are at work to the same end. Economies are growing around the world and people are living longer. Donors need to respond to this su ccess with a revision in their aid strategy. There is a unique opportunity to take stock of foreign aid now, as countries set development goals for 2015 and later. Next, the chapter will discuss the relationship between strong health systems and good health, prosperity, and security around the world.

The urgency of this need stems in part from the natural progression of decades of vertical health programming to strengthen curative and preventative services; larger demographic and political trends driv e the rest. Deliberate and thoughtful action now can help ensure the succe ss and sustainability of the U.S. government's targeted health investments. Sustaining the Investment in HIV and AIDS The U.S. taxpayer supported $7.4 bi llion dollars in bilateral aid for health in fiscal year 2014. Adding contributions made through multilateral and charitable organizatio ns raises the total by about a quarter (IHME, 2014). The vast majority of this spending (75 percent for much of the 2000s) was dedicated to HIV and AIDS programs (Emanuel, 2012). The returns on this investment have been substantial. The first cycle of PEPFAR averted roughly 1.2 million deaths and contributed to the 19 percent reduction in HIV transmission (UNAIDS, 2010; Walensky and Kuritzkes, 2010). These early successes have allowed for a new target: eliminating new HIV cases in children by 2015, with a longer goal of eventually halting all transmission of the virus, ushering in an AIDS-free generation (Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, 2012). Key Finding Health assistance is usually described as either vertical or horizontal. Vertical programs are targeted to a specific disease or service; horizontal ones support more comprehensive care. Donors tend to value vertical health programs because of their immediate, but less sustainable, effects. Conclusion When donors run vertical programs in a way that undermines the partner country's health system, or when they fail to integrate vertical programs with general heal th services, they only aggravate their partner countries' staffing and organizational problems. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 23 In the early days of PEPFAR, the program's staggering logistics posed the biggest obstacle. The past decade has shown that it is possible to bring good quality antiretrovira l drugs and the necessary supportive care to patients in remote places. The program is no longer in its emergency response phase. The next stage is in many ways more complicated\u2014it depends on building technical depth in recipient countries (Bendavid and Miller, 2010; IOM, 2013). It will not be possible to halt HIV transmission or see an AIDS-free generation without systemic changes to the organization of health services. The 2013 PEPFAR strategy document acknowledges this, calling for increased ownership from partner country govern ments (Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, 2012). This report emphasizes the importance of sharing the responsibility for AIDS programs a nd supporting countries to develop comprehensive health financing plans and systems for financial accountability (Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, 2012). PEPFAR began as a program with a relatively narrow, if ambitious, mandate to bring antiretroviral therapies to the world's poorest AIDS patients and prevent the spread of HIV in their communities. This was extremely successful, and its success wi ll have consequences for the U.S. and developing country government s (IOM, 2013). The patients who, through American generosity, avoided an early AIDS death are now facing lifetimes managing HIV as a chronic disease. They will have to deal with the long-term comorbidities of HIV while facing the routine morbidities of aging, all of which depends on decent primary care and the underpinnings of a reliable health infrastructure. The purpose of prolonging lives threatened by HIV was not to lose them 10 years later to diabetes, also a gruesome and expensive disease. While the U.S. government cannot and should not fund treatment for every health problem as PEPFAR has done for HI V and AIDS, a responsibility to these patients will influence its future involvement in global health. Foreign policy is shaped in part by the current social and political climate, and is partly predetermined by the trajectory of commitments already made. Attention to the manage ment, financing, and infrastructure that support health services in poor countries is a priority by either calculation. A functional health system is the most important prerequisite to maintain ground against the HIV epid emic in Africa. A stronger health system in poor countries is also the best insurance against a complicated and changing future burden of disease. Finally, a stronger health system reduces the future dependence of low- and middle-income countries on foreign aid.

What demographers call the epidemiological transition, a shift in population-level causes of illness and death from infectious to chronic disease, took more than 100 years in western Europe (Omran, 2005). This process happens both more quickly and less directly in countries that started later (Kengne and Mayosi, 2014; Santosa et al., 2014). In the Micronesian island of Nauru, for example, diabetes, road traffic accidents, and circulatory disorders became prominent so suddenly and (especially with road traffic injuries) among the young, as to obscure any noticeable improvement in lifespan from reducing infectious disease (Santosa et al., 2014; Schooneveldt et al., 1988). More often poor countries cope with the dual burden of infectious and chronic diseases in different s ub-populations. Maternal and child mortality are much higher in South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa than in the rest of the worl d, largely because the poorest people have remained outside the reach of the health system (WHO, 2014d; WHO et al., 2014). These same places have growing epidemics of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and the co-morbidities of obesity. Now the differences in burden of disease are as pronounced within countries as among them. Different soci al classes have widely different lifestyles, diets, and access to health services, leading to an epidemiological polarization, the co-existence of both modern and ancient patterns of disease among different groups in the same country (Frenk et al., 1989). Meanwhile, urbanization, which increases growth and access to health services, has contributed to a protracted epidemiological shift where problems of hunger and infection linger in the same community, even the same household as the so- called diseases of affluence (things like stroke, hypertension, chronic heart and kidney disease, and diabetes). Rural to urban migration has abruptly changed meal patterns and diet. Emigrants to cities no longer raise their own food, nor do they necessarily have common mealtimes. Cities offer women opportunities in the paid workforce, precluding extended breast feeding and leaving less time to cook. Packaged foods a nd vegetable fats are the cheapest and easiest way to eat. Such a diet will drive adults to obesity and its manifold co-morbidities, but provi de little protein or appropriate weaning nutrition to children, who then fail to grow (Agyei-Mensah and de-Graft Aikins, 2010; Caballero, 2005). Starvation in utero and early Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 25 childhood triggers a process of meta bolic compensation that puts the underweight child, ironically, at increased risk of obesity in adulthood (Barker, 2012; Caballero, 2005). For all these reasons, the WHO reckons that adults under 70 in poor countries are more likely to die from a noncommunicable disease than their counterparts in rich ones (WHO, 2014c). The health effects of globaliza tion and climate change only complicate the picture. Poor countries struggle with industrial pollution, putting people at higher risk of chronic diseases like asthma (Shiru, 2011). The effects of climate change, fe lt harder close to the equator, will introduce vector-borne disease such as malaria and dengue to higher altitudes (McMichael, 2000; Miranda et al., 2011). More intense rainstorms could lead to a longer breeding season for mosquitoes (McMichael, 2000). At the same time, th e worldwide threat of infectious epidemics has not receded as much as the classic epidemiological transition would have predicted. Anti-microbial resistance and globalization have contributed to the emergence of new pandemic viruses, such as H5N1 avian infl uenza (Santosa et al., 2014). A tidal wave of health problems is pressing down on the developing world. Preparedness for these changes is understandably poor. A recent study in Tanzania found that, with the exception of HIV services, care for chronic diseases, such as hyperten sion, diabetes, and epilepsy, was woefully inadequate (Peck et al., 2014). Staff at the health posts and dispensaries closest to patients were not informed on how to manage these conditions; less than half of the nurses surveyed had even a fair knowledge of diabetes care, though 79 percent were competent to manage HIV (Peck et al., 2014). Even if the workers were better trained, diagnostic equipment and medicines we re scarce. Thirty percent of the primary health posts visited did not even have a functional scale (Peck et al., 2014). It is difficult to say what portion of the problem in the Tanzania study is specific to the challenge of noncommunicable disease care and how much is a reflection of a broader problem in the health system (Kengne and Mayosi, 2014). Either way, it is a reminder that shifting patterns of illness in poor countries are overwhelming the health infrastructure. Ministers of health in poor countries face increasingly complicated trade-offs: between pr eventative and curative services, between treating children and adults , and among different ways to pay for health. There is still time to ma nage these trade-offs, but decisions need to be made before the full for ce of the chronic disease epidemic hits Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

There are invest ments in health technology and the drug supply chain, for example, that can improve treatment for a range of conditions. In the opinion of this co mmittee, directing foreign assistance at these kinds of systemic improvements is an efficient way for donors to help aid recipients prepare for the in evitably changing patterns of health and illness. Economic and Demographic Changes The past 25 years have seen tremendous global growth; almost a billion people have escaped extreme poverty 1 (Poverty: Not always with us, 2013). Their national economies have improved at the same time. In 1990, 57.8 percent of the world lived in what the World Bank classifies as a low-income country; by 2011, only 11.7 percent did (see Figure 2-2) (Jamison et al., 2013). Increasing nati onal incomes mean a broader tax base, and governments have made commensurate improvements in their ability to collect revenue. Tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) increased by four percentage points between 1990 and 2011 in low- and lower-middle-income countries, and by 6 percentage points in upper-middle income countries (Jamison et al., 2013). A broadening tax base will mean decreasing prominence of donor assistance for development. At the same, donor assistan ce has declined. The 2008-2009 financial crisis re duced the amount of aid money available; by 2011, growth in bilatera l development assistance for health had slowed to its lowest annualized rate since 2001 (Leach-Kemon et al., 2012). The growth of middle-income countries is something to celebrate, but important disparities often hide beneath the aggregate improvements. Most of the billion people left in dire poverty, by some estimates 75 percent of them, live in middle-income countries (Sumner, 2010; UN System Task Team, 2012). Using development assistance to change their lives is complicated. Foreign aid is becoming less welcome in emerging economies, most notably in India and China, two countries that together account for slightly less than half of the world's poorest people (Mohanty, 2012; Olinto and Uema tsu, 2013). The challenge for the future of development is to use our remaining influence and a proportionately decreasing share of nati onal budgets, to benefit the most 1 Defined by the World Bank as <$1.25 a day, adjusted for 2005 purchasing power parity (Ravallion et al., 2008).

The solution lies in identifying investments that transform lives for the people suffering the brunt of ill health and early death. To start, this means investing in health not just health services. In a letter to The Lancet , 16 ministers of health and foreign affairs and heads of global public health organizations explained that the future of global health lies in, \"governance, management, and leadership to address inequalities, reach the most vulnerable and marginalized people, and create an enabling policy and lega l environment\" (Engstr\u00f6m et al., 2013, p. 1862). There is a window of time now when such transformative investment is not only possible but affordable . Stenberg and colleagues (2014) recently modeled the costs to suppor t health systems, maternal and newborn health, pediatrics, immuni zation, family planning, HIV and AIDS, and malaria against their re turns as measured by social and economic benefit to society. They found that a 2 percent increase in current spending for health could, over 30 years, yield nine times that value, not just in terms of an estimated 184 million lives saved, but in workforce participation, smaller fam ily size and lower dependency rates, and increased savings, investment, and workforce productivity. Their models called for a substantial initial investment to health systems and the training of another 675,000 doctors, nurses, and midwives by 2035. The returns will come more slowly; many projected benefits cannot be realized until 2050 or later, as they a ffect the growth and development of infants and children who will not enter the workforce for decades (Stenberg et al., 2014). Regardless, ai d for health still offers one of the best returns on investment available (Gates and Gates, 2014). As with most investments, rewards come from early action and a long time horizon. The Post-2015 Development Agenda Improving systemic effectiveness in poor countries, increasing social protection, and setting up resilient local management are important themes in post-2015 development discussion (OECD, 2013a; UN Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals; UN Secretary- General's High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, 2013; UN System Task Team, 2013). These are not necessarily new ideas. The 1993 World Development Report Investing in Health also emphasized efficiency, encouraging attention to the interventions that give the best value for their cost (World Bank, Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 29 1993). The report recommended that a publicly financed basic package of essential services be available in all countries, and that increased donor aid should be used to meet this goal. Twenty years later, there is new enthusiasm for the same idea, now framed as the movement towards universal health coverage. Donors would do well to invest in the infrastructure that will support universal health coverage in deve loping countries. Their investment would yield considerable returns to the world economy, and will have a substantial diplomatic value beyond that. As donors' proportional contribution to health spending in developing countries decreases, it will be more important to use donor influence judiciously. For the U.S. government this will mean making investments that reflect American values, including compassion for the most vulnerable. Health diplomacy, a term used to describe diplomatic efforts to advance international cooperation on he alth, has the potential to generate goodwill, as it has done in the 65 PEPFAR recipient countries (Bendavid and Miller, 2010; U.S. Department of State). By the same token, there would be a serious reputational risk to the United States if any of the health gains we helped underwrite with PEPFAR were to be lost now. Such a loss is possible as long as defi ciencies in national health systems prevent countries from managing the program effectively. In the opinion of this committee, a modest increase in spending and a few, judicious changes to the U.S. government's aid strategy would help keep as friends a growing and dynamic group of low- and middle-income countries. This action could have substan tial payoffs in developing a more stable and prosperous world.

The United States supports health in poor countries because it is a moral obligation and because health has an intrinsic value (IOM, 2009). Improving health abroad is also a wise investment to spur short- and long-term growth. There is an i mmediate dividend from deaths and illness averted, and delayed gains wh en healthy children grow up and contribute to their societies. Their health is of direct benefit to their home countries and of larger benefit to building a more stable, peaceful world. Key Findings Countries with high child and maternal mortality also have growing epidemics of cardiovascular dise ase, diabetes, and obesity. The shifting patterns of illness are over whelming the health systems in poor countries. Global economic growth has created a broader tax base in developing countries, making donor assistance a proportionately smaller piece of national funding for health. Using development aid to help the bi llion people left in dire poverty is complicated. Many of them live in increasingly self-sufficient middle-income countries or in fragile states, where political volatility makes them hard to reach. Conclusions The success of the PEPFAR program alone compels thoughtful appraisal of the U.S. government's continued work in global health. It will not be possible to maintain the ground against the HIV and AIDS epidemic without attention to the management, financing, and infrastructure that support health services. There would be a serious reputational risk to the United States if any of the health gains of PEPFAR were to be lost now. Such a loss is possible as long as deficiencies in national health systems prevent countries from taking effecting ownership of HIV and AIDS care. Helping the poor requires transformative investments in health, not just health services. The Unit ed States should support the infrastructure underlying universal health coverage in developing countries. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 31 The epidemiological and demogra phic changes described in the previous section drive a need for donors to support health in developing countries, investing in the entire infrastructure, not just pieces of service delivery. Congress needs to consider support for health systems as an investment in health, prosperity, and global security. Improving Health U.S. action in global health has long addressed interventions, the pieces of clinical care that most immediately prevent death. Low- and middle-income countries may be approaching a point of diminishing marginal returns on such investme nts. Effective clinical medicine depends on a service infrastructure. While there is no one blueprint for how this infrastructure should look, there are certain common organizational features of good health systems (Mills, 2014). In an analysis of five parts of the world (Bangladesh; Ethiopia; Kyrgyzstan; Tamil Nadu, India; and Thailand) th at have made better progress in health than their economically and geographically similar neighbors, Balabanova and colleagues (2013) identified political commitment, effective management and regulation, and the ability to adapt to limited resources as common precursors for success. Boxes 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 give examples of innovative systemic changes that have improved health indicators or service delivery in poor countries. Dysfunctional Health Systems Spread Disease, Good Health Systems Prevent It Organization is often the biggest ch allenge in delivering health. The failure to control and treat tuberculosis in much of the former Eastern Bloc, for example, is primarily an organizational failure. The Soviet health system had four vertical programs for tuberculosis control: the penitentiary system, X-ray screening services, hospital care, and primary care. All four programs had separat e management and funding streams; there was no sharing of staff or funding among programs (Atun and Coker, 2008). Treatment protocols calle d for lengthy hospital stays, not only wasting money and roughly 80,000 allocated hospital beds in Russia alone, but encouraging hospita l-acquired tuberculosis (Atun and Coker, 2008; Atun et al., 2005a). The Soviet system persisted even after donors implemented DOTS, 2 the WHO standardized treatment. 2 Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course.

Much public health spending went to fixed hospital costs and, despite having 429 doctors per 100,000 people in 1990, the primary care system was neglected and community health workers poorly trained. The system depended on revenues from Moscow, and was not viable after independence. Beginning in 1996, Ministry of Health reforms dramatically restructured health delivery to strengthen the Kyrgyz system. Closing hospitals was central to these reforms. Under the Soviet system, a hospital's funding was based on its number of beds, a system that gave no incentives for preventative services. The reforms shifted to payment for performance, and rewarded faster patient turnover. Fewer hospitals could then serve the same number of patients, so 42 percent of hospitals closed between 2000 and 2003. The money saved from keeping half-empty hospitals open was used on drugs, food, and supplie s, as well as improvements to primary care. The reforms shifted health care to an outpatient system, requiring commensurate shifts in the workforce. The WHO and USAID supported the government to emph asize family practice in the medical education, both in medical school curricula and with continuing medical education. Community health posts, remnants from the Soviet era, were revamped and their staff retrained. These posts helped meet the increased demand for primary care, particularly in rural areas, where hospitals had closed. The reforms allowed for nearly universal coverage in essential primary services, and drove improvements in health outcomes. Between 1997 and 2006, infant mortality fell by nearly 50 percent and under-five mortality fell by over a third. Adult mortality rates also improved. Life expectancy in Kyrgyzstan has risen since the mid-1990s and is higher than in the wealthier Kazakhstan and half a year higher than in Russia, where pe r capita gross national income is 13 times greater. A SOURCES: Balabanova et al., 2013; Ib raimova et al., 2011; Kutzin et al., 2009; WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2013. Research in Russia indicates that clinicians and patients resisted DOTS, seeing it as a foreign imposition (Atun et al., 2005a). The program took off poorly. The Russian payment structure directly contradicted the DOTS protocol, rewarding surgery and inpatient treatment regardless of whether the patient recovered (Atun et al., 2005b). By 2003, DOTS coverage in Russia was roughly 35 percentage points lower than in other countries with a similar disease burden (Atun Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 33 et al., 2005a). As of 2012, Russia had a tuberculosis incidence of 91 per 100,000, a figure that has declined relatively little since the 2000s, and parts of the country now report the world's highest rates of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (WHO, 2010c, 2012a). Tuberculosis control in Russia has not floundered because of a problem with DOTS, an elegant strategy that has helped control the disease in much of the world. The pr oblem stems from bottlenecks in the national health system and a failure to integrate four competing vertical programs and a primary care system (Atun et al., 2010). It is also a cautionary example of how narrow, disease-specific health programs can BOX 2-2 Grassroots Management and Health Worker Expansion in Ethiopia Despite being one of the poorest co untries in the world, Ethiopia is working towards a goal of unive rsal primary care by 2017. The national strategy relies heavily on di strict health offices to plan and manage the delivery and financing of primary care. District officials are encouraged to choose suitable, local priorities and manage their budget to meet them. The district system relies on relia ble data and organization. Every district health office keeps family health folders containing demographic information and patient histories organized by household. Health extension workers manage the folders and feed the household data into a national health information system. These data inform district and federal health plans, making both more responsive to local realities, and allow for modern disease surveillance and monitoring. District officials also manage the national Health Extension Programme, which trains local women to provide basic primary care. Though Ethiopia has only 2-3 doctors, nurses, and midwives for every 10,000 people, health extension training brought an additional 30,000 health workers to rural distri cts in 5 years. District health offices tailor the health worker tr ainings to suit local needs and, because the trainees are chosen fr om the communities they work in, they are well received by their clients. District health planning and delivery has helped increase access to health posts from 38 percent in 1991 to 89 percent in 2011. Health outcomes are also improving. Between 1997 and 2011, under-5 mortality fell from 166 to 88 deaths per 1000 live births. During the same period, infant mortality fell 42 percent, and is now comparable to wealthier countries in the region.

The Soviet health system developed in the 1920s and 1930s was appropriate to the disease burden and technology of the time. By the 1980s, it was already in decline (Atun and Coker, 2008; Fleck, 2013). Othe r countries in transition could soon face similar obstacles. At the same time, changing the health systems and improving disease response can be mutually reinforcing. Before polio vaccination campaigns began in 1985, children in Mexico were only vaccinated at their mother's request, and vaccine coverage was low, probably below 40 percent (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2006). The polio immunization program greatly increased coverage, but a 1990 survey found that only 42 percent of children were fully immunized on schedule (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2006). Poor infrastructure for patient track ing was preventing proper quality control (Knaul et al., 2012; Sep\u00falve da et al., 2006). The introduction of computerized immunization records in 1990 brought the percentage of children immunized on schedule up to 92 percent in only 3 years (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2006). The health effects were imme diate: polio and diphtheria disappeared from Mexico within a year, autochthonous measles, within 6 years (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2006). Similarly, donor funding for HIV helped strengthen parts of the health system in Ghana (Atun et al., 2011). Global Fund 3 activities have improved the drug procurement system, and procurement for HIV supplies is now integrated with the national system; the Global Fund also supported health infrastructure improvements such as health post modernization, laboratory equipment, and vehicles for field supervision (Atun et al., 2011). Ghanaian health officials have credited these activities with creating an increased demand for health care (Atun et al., 2011). Rwanda also used international gr ants for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria response to build stronger health systems (Binagwaho et al., 2014). During the last decade, health posts built for AIDS patients have been integrated with the primary care system; supply chains developed for distributing antiretrovirals have expanded to deliver medicines for a range of diseases (Binagwaho et al., 2014; Price et al., 2009). The benefits of these improvements have been felt disproportionately in the countryside, as the government made a deliberate decision to scale-up treatment in areas that would otherwise have been outside the reach of the health system (Binagwaho et al., 2014). After the 1994 genocide, 3 Officially, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 35 Rwandan leaders made rebuilding the health system a priority. As a result, health indicators improved; child mortality and mortality from tuberculosis, have both roughly c onverged with global averages (Binagwaho et al., 2014). BOX 2-3 Improving Medicines Procurement and Distribution, Tamil Nadu, India Until 1995, the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu required government health posts and hospitals to run independent medicines procurement and distribution systems, managing funding from one of the directorates: Medi cal Education, Medical and Rural Services, or Public Health and Preventive Medicine. Persistent allegations of corruption plagued the purchasers, none of which was large enough to command an efficient economy of scale; distribution costs were high and stock outs, common. In an effort to make drug procurement more efficient and tr ansparent, the state government created the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation, an autonomous agency responsible for every level of essential drug procurement and distribution to all government hospitals and health centers. Medical Services Corporation chooses its drug suppliers through a transparent open-tender process. Th e details of each bid, including manufacturers' licenses, quality standards, and prices, are visible to all prospective suppliers. Throughout the process, a system of checks and penalties helps keep qu ality consistent. Late deliveries face fines of 1.5 percent of the order's cost; suppliers are not paid until after the delivery passes quality testing. Any supplier failing more than one quality test is blacklisted. The corporation supplies drugs directly to district warehouses. Each facility then draws its stock from its respective warehouse, according to specific needs. Both warehouses and health facilities keep up-to-date records of their stock levels and drug use; the corporation monitors statewide drug levels and movement. If the data suggest a likely stock out, the corporation can transfer supplies from a neighboring district. Medicines account for about 15 percent of the state health budget in Tamil Nadu, and are essential to clinical care. The Medical Services Corporation commands a purchasing power that has brought down the cost of certain classes of drug s, resulting in savings that have been used to furnish district hospitals with diagnostic equipment previously available only at expensive private hospitals. The corporation's emphasis on openne ss, quality, and efficiency, has improved drug quality and patient confidence in the health system. SOURCES: Lalitha, 2008; Muraleedharan et al., 2011.

Universal health coverage is a move ment to promote access to essential services without financial hardship. Un iversal coverage has considerable economic benefits that will be discussed in the next section. There is also growing evidence that it improves health, especially among the poorest people in society for whom the real and opportunity costs of care present obstacles. Thailand and Mexico are both middle-income countries where universal coverage has been a goa l since the early 2000s. In both countries, universal coverage increased use of health services among the poor, especially among those who had been paying for services out-of-pocket (Gruber et al., 2012; Knaul et al., 2012). Child mortality was one of the most improved indicators in both countries. In Thailand, infant mortality among the poorest 30 percent of the population fell 30 percent in only 2 years (Gruber et al., 2012). In Mexico, the first 6 years of universal coverage saw child morta lity decline by 11 percent among the newly insured; for the rest of the country, the improvement was a more modest 5 percent (Knaul et al., 2012). Perhaps the most dramatically-changed health indicator after Mexico 's health reforms was the maternal mortality ratio, which dropped 32 percent among the previously uninsured and 3 percent among the rest of the country (Knaul et al., 2012). A rapid improvement in maternal mortality ratio is a victory for the Mexican system. Ending preventable maternal deaths requires skilled attendants at every delivery and reliable emergency care; it is therefore notoriously slow to improve. Improvements in maternal health can therefore be seen as proxy measure of the strength of the health system. Ninety-nine percent of the world's ma ternal deaths are in developing countries, \"mak[ing] maternal mortality ratio the most inequitably distributed health indicator in the world\" (Frenk et al., 2012, p. 2). Universal health coverage has the po tential to correct this inequity. Health coverage schemes that start in rural areas and offer free treatment for the conditions poor people suffer from, can improve health with minimal increased expense. In Thailand, universal coverage cost slightly less than $25 per capita (Gruber et al., 2012). In Mexico, where the package of covered services has increased more, now covering more than 95 percent of outpatient and genera l hospital visits, the government Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 37 Key Findings There is more than one correct way to organize a health system, but good systems are invariably gro unded in political commitment, effective management and regulation, and the ability to adapt to limited resources. A judiciously directed increase in spending of less than $2.50 per person per year could avert a la rge share of the world's cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Conclusion Narrow, disease specific programs best maintain their effectiveness when integrated with primary care. increased per capita spending on health by about $2324 between 2000 and 2010 (Knaul et al., 2012). The exact costs of universal coverage will vary by country. The Lancet Commission on Investing in Health estimates that bringing an essential package of clinical interventions to 80 percent of the population in low- and middle-income countries by 2025 would be inexpensive; cost estimates range from less than $1 to $2.50 per person per year (Jamison et al., 2013). This investment could avert 37 percent of the global diabetes and cardiovascular disease burden and 6 percent of global cancer (Jamison et al., 2013; WHO, 2011). The cost of inaction, though harder to calculate, is almost certain ly higher. Healthy people are more productive members of society; healthy children are better able to learn (Kieny and Evans, 2013). Failure to correct health inequalities can deplete human capital in developing countries, which are the most desperate to keep it, and undermine al l efforts at development (Brearley et al., 2013). 4 Adjusted for USD purchasing power parity.

Attention to health financing promises particular returns for the broader global development agenda. Every year, 100 million people fall into poverty because of health expenses, a nd millions more stay poor because they are too sick to work (Averill and Marriott, 2013; Xu et al., 2007). Improving the social safety net and bringing basic health care to these people will be an essential piece of ending global poverty and building a more prosperous world. Health Expenses Are Poverty Traps The path out of poverty is not linear. The $1.25-per-day poverty line is somewhat arbitrary, 5 and many of the billion who crossed that line in past 20 years did so because they both started and remained close to the cutoff (Towards the end of poverty, 2013). While the middle class is growing in developing countries overall (see Figure 2-3), the relative prosperity of Latin America, Easter n Europe, and East Asia drives most of that success (Kapsos and Bourmpoula, 2013). The majority of sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia lives in some state of tenuous poverty. (See Figures 2-4 and 2-5.) The lines between extremely poor, moderately poor, and nearly poor are dynamic in these parts of the world. In rural India, Anirudh Krishna found that over 25 years, 11 percent of his sample had escaped poverty, while 8 percent who started out not poor had fallen below the poverty line, lead ing him to conclude that, \"almost as many people have sunk into poverty over the past 25 years as have emerged from it\" (Krishna, 2004, p. 131). An illness or major accident is the main reason the poor in developing countries stay poor and the moderately less poor fall back (Krishna, 2004, 2011; Kristjanson et al ., 2010). This problem often takes the form of \"a succession of adverse events,\" starting with an expensive illness or accident (Krishna, 2011, p. 5). To pay for health care, households invariably reduce basic consumption, and then they may sell their assets in distress or take on high-interest debt (Krishna, 2011; Kruk et al., 2009). The episode can go on for years, as with a chronic disease, 5 Economists derive the cut po int from the average poverty lines in the world's 15 poorest countries, measured in 2005 do llars and adjusted for differences in purchasing power parity (Towards the end of poverty, 2013).

Research on hardship financing, either selling assets in distress or borrowing (oft en at high interest) to pay for health care, suggests that health e xpenses pose a financial hardship to about a quarter of all households in developing countries, nearly a third in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia (Kruk et al., 2009). The poorest households, which lack assets to sell, may raise funds by signing away their future earning power into debt bondage (Krishna, 2011). Debt bondage sabotages emerging economi es. The International Labour Organization estimates that, after de ductions for housing, uncompensated overtime, and labor below market wage, bonded labor costs the global economy $19.6 billion in unpaid wage s, roughly $9 billion in the Asia Pacific region and $1.5 in sub-Saharan Africa (ILO, 2009). Even when health expenditures are not catastrophic, they can hold back economic development. Househol ds that can often save to prepare for emergency health expenditures (Dupas and Robinson, 2013; IPA, 2014). Their savings, while protective to the individual household, could have a detrimental effect on fina ncial growth, as money saved is withheld from basic expenditures, the transactions that grow the economy. Protecting households from out-of-pocket health expenses can allow them to direct their cash to increased economic activity, thereby supporting their nation's larger econom ic development (Frenk and de Ferranti, 2012). Out-of-pocket health spending enda ngers patients, and prepayment (a system of collecting for health expenses before an illness) is one way to protect them (Xu et al., 2007). Prepayment comes from taxes, insurance, or both, and poses an obstacle for poor countries. Not only is it logistically complicated to collect revenues from people working in informal arrangements or at subsiste nce level, but many people are too poor to pay taxes at all (Xu et al., 2007). The most vulnerable people are also the least likely to buy insura nce. Donors can help reduce their vulnerability by helping countries build effective prepayment systems. As the wealth in low- and middle- income countries increases, there are more potential revenue streams to dr aw from, but developing countries have little experience doing so effec tively. Donor countries can provide valuable guidance on how to identify and collect taxes from sustainable sources.

Health services in low- and middle-income countries often fail to reach people in rural and remote areas. There are organizational reasons for this. It is expensive, for example, to run teaching hospitals and tertiary care centers, so there are few of them, usually in cities, wh ere they serve a relatively affluent, politically-aware patient base (IFC, 2007). Urban hospitals absorb a high proportion of national budgets, cont ributing to a problem of unfair distribution of spending. In Mauritania, for instance, 72 percent of public spending on hospitals benefits the richest 40 percent of the population (IFC, 2007). Hospital spending may be especially discriminatory against the poor, but the pattern holds across a range of services (Akazili et al., 2012). Research in sub-Saharan Africa indicates that although the disease burden in heaviest among the poorest groups in society, the distribution of services benefits the richest (Mills et al., 2012). In India, government data indicates that about 9 percent of all public health spending benefits the poorest fifth of the population, while the richest fifth take about 40 percent (Chakraborty et al., 2013). Distance and cost pose barriers to the equitable delivery of health care, as does patient satisfaction with services (Mills et al., 2012). Nevertheless, people need health car e; when the public system cannot meet their needs, patients go elsewhere. In Liberia, for example, a 14 year civil war decimated the health system. By 2008, most licensed formal providers worked in barebones clinics (Kruk et al., 2011). People in rural areas then sought care from traditional healers and medicine sellers three times more often than from formal clinicians (Kruk et al., 2011). In other cases, people rely on nongovernmental organizations for healthcare. Faith-based organizations in particular provide up to 40 percent of all health care in developing countries, including a large portion of HIV and AIDS home care (Kagawa et al., 2012; Woldehanna et al., 2005). The private sector, a group that includes both for-profit and nonprofit providers, accounts for the majority of health services among the poor in developing countries (Berendes et al., 2011; Das et al., 2012). In Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda, more than 40 percent of the poorest fifth of society get health care from private, for-profit providers (IFC, 2007). Competition from the private sector could help improve the quality and efficiency of public health services, but it is difficult to create Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 45 market competition in health without extensive regulatory and enforcement capacity (Yip et al., 2012). As the relative importance of for-profit providers grows in developi ng countries, it will be important to build government capacity for oversight and regulation. Otherwise, there will be increased risk of waste and mo re money to be wasted as spending on health increases. The WHO estimates that ineffici ency causes the wasting of 20-40 percent of all health spending (WHO, 2010b). The key to reducing this waste lies in strengthening the basic building blocks of health systems. Table 2-1 shows the 10 leading sources of inefficiency in health and offers ways to improve them. Notably, all the main causes of waste are in failures of the health system. Efficient Health Spending Improves Productivity Making the most of financial contributions to the health system is one of the main challenges facing governments today. The potential payoffs for increasing efficiency are substantial. As described earlier, recent economic models indicate that a judiciously directed increase of $5 per person per year in the 74 countries that account for 95 percent of maternal and child deaths would yi eld a return of nine times that investment in terms of lives saved, disability averted, unplanned pregnancies avoided, greater workforc e participation, increased savings and investment (Stenberg et al., 2014). A 2 percent increase in health spending could underwrite the additi onal $5 per person per year needed to realize tremendous societal gains (Engstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Stenberg et al., 2014). The cost of failure to act, in contrast, is steep. Maternal deaths alone take $15 billion per year fro m the global economy, acting through both the loss of a healthy adult and th e vastly decreased prospects of her children (USAID, 2001). Historical case studies suggest that improved health and nutrition accounted for about one-quarter of th e GDP increase in Britain over from 1780-1979 (Fogel, 1997; Jamison et al., 2013). In the twentieth century, the effects appear to come more quick ly. In an analysis of 53 countries' data, Jamison and colleagues (2005) es timated that health improvements between 1965 and 1990 accounted for about 11 percent of national economic growth. In either case, the fu ll returns on investments in health become evident with a long time horizon (Belli et al., 2005).

American companies increasingly see their future in the emerging markets of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Improving the productivity and lifetime earning potential of workers and consumers in these markets will have far-reaching reverberations, improving prosperity abroad and in the United States. Advancing Global Security The return on investment in h ealth systems goes beyond economic gains. A strong health system allows for prompt and effective response to pandemic disease, natural and man-made disasters. When this response falters, there is an immediate health threat as well as a longer-term risk to political stability. One of the biggest pandemic threats to emerge in recent years is Ebola virus disease (called simply Ebola), emerging in West Africa in the spring of 2014 (CDC, 2014c; WHO, 2014a). A disease of uncommon virulence and high case-fatality, Ebola would tax any health system, but the West African countries affected have particular vulnerabilities (Ebola Key Findings The middle class is growing in developing countries overall, but prosperity in Latin America, East Asia, and Eastern Europe accounts for most of that growth. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, almost as many people have fallen into poverty over the past 20 years as have escaped it. The poor stay poor and the less poor fall back because of health expenses. For one-third of all households in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia health expenses pose a financial hardship. Households respond to hardship by selling assets in distress, taking on high-interest debt, or forfeiti ng their future earnings through debt bondage. All these practices sabotage emerging economies. Charging patients at the point of care prevents the poorest people from seeking care, or at best, encourages them to delay treatment until the condition worsens. Conclusions Governments can prevent people from falling into poverty by improving health financing, and building capacity for oversight and regulation. Efficient spending on health impr oves global productivity and is sound economic policy for all countries.

All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 51 virus: Liberia health system \"overtaxed,\" 2014; Gostin et al., 2014; WHO, 2014a). As of August 28, 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) records indicate 1,552 suspected deaths and 3,069 suspected and confirmed cases in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone (CDC, 2014a). The clinical presentation of Ebola is similar to many other endemic tropical diseases. Confirming cases, the first step to effectively quarantining and treating them, requires a laboratory testing system (Green, 2014). Ebola patients require inpatient treatment, stressing limited hospital infrastructure; five of the largest hospitals in the Liberian capital closed in response to the epidemic (Ebola virus: Liberia health system \"overtaxed,\" 2014; WHO, 2014a ). The countries affected are now in a state of emergency response, with new control measures curtailing social gatherings (Gostin et al., 2014; Nossiter, 2014). The burden of controlling pandemic spread, combined with the risks of treating patients, led Sierra Leone President Er nest Bai Koroma to conclude, \"the very essence of our nation is at stake\" (Nossiter, 2014). The Ebola crisis has drawn attention to the consequences of neglecting health systems developmen t in developing countries. Only 20 percent of the world's nations are prepared for pandemic response (Kerry et al., 2014). The tools that would enable this response\u2014a well-trained workforce, an information system to support surveillance and data sharing, a solid infrastructure for c linical care and laboratory analysis, and strong management of the health sector\u2014are essential pieces of the health system. For this reason, the Department of Health and Human Services' Global Health Strategy gives as one of its main objectives the comprehensive strengthening of health systems (HHS, 2011). Building the health system in developing countries will protect people around the world from pandemic threats and contribute to more politically stable societies. Health Infrastructure Supports Emergency Response Concern with developing countries' public health systems has grown over the past 10 years, partly because of the threat of emerging pandemic diseases such as Ebola. In 2004, David Heymann and Gu\u00e9na\u00ebl Rodier observed that the SARS epidemic \"made one lesson clear early in its course: inadequate surveillance and response capacity in a single country can endanger ... the entire world\" (Heymann and Rodier, 2004, p. 173). Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.52 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS Sometimes society controls this danger. During the SARS outbreak, international collaboration helped c ontain the disease within a few weeks (Grady and Altman, 2003). In only 4 months, all transmission was interrupted in 27 countries (Heymann and Rodier, 2004). Other times, meaningful collaboration is lacking a nd response suffers. Two years have passed and at least 209 6 people have died since the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus emerged, but the source of the virus is still unclear (PLOS Currents and PLOS Pathogens, 2014; McNabb et al., 2014; WHO, 2014e). There is similar doubt about Ebola's natural reservoir (CDC, 2014b). In any case, pandemic diseases disrupt people's lives and take a toll on the global economy long after the acute emergency response phase. SARS halted travel and hurt business in China and Southeast Asia, costing the region $50 billion (UN System Task Team, 2012). The World Bank estimates that Ebola will cost Guinea, an impoverished country hard hit by the epidemic, a full percentage point of annual econom ic growth (World Bank, 2014). Building a system for international cooperation during an outbreak is the goal of the International Health Regulations, a set of legally binding rules on the surveillance and response to outbreaks of potential international public health conse quence (WHO). The regulations are built around the premise that containing a disease while it is still local is the best way to prevent a global epidemic (Rodier et al., 2007). To comply with the regulations, countries need to develop the basic health infrastructure to detect and repor t potential threats and respond to national emergencies (Rodier et al., 2007). Although 196 countries have adopted the International Health Regulations, only about 20 percent of those countries had fully implemented them by 2013 (Fischer and Katz, 2013; WHO). Implementing the regulations requires strength in eight basic capacities (Katz et al., 2012). As Table 2-2 indicates, these eight strengths are essentially components of the health system. It will be impossible to implement the International Health Regulations without improving the health system foundation they draw on. Investments in the health system (such as laboratories, health information systems, communication, and human resource management) that improve daily functioning also strengthen the system's ability to respond to threats (Kruk, 2008a). The ability to respond to all diseases, even those that are not likely to b ecome global threats, builds the same 6 As of June 11, 2014.

Such was the logic behind the Global Health Security Agenda, a U.S. government program working in 30 partner countries to develop the capacity for outbreak response (HHS). One of the program's main targets for its partner countries over the next 5 years is to reach 90 percent of all one-year-olds with measles vaccine (H HS). This target recognizes that the groundwork necessary to prevent measles is the same as what would be needed for response to any epid emic threat (Frieden et al., 2014). Similarly, Box 2-4 describes how epidemic response in Uganda improved as part of the Global Health Security program. Developed health systems have an emergency response capacity built into their operations. Such res ponse capacity was evident after the Boston Marathon bombings. The city health system could absorb the shock of acute disaster response; \"not a single patient who made it to a hospital died\" (Farmer, 2013). Natural disasters and acts of violence are only more common in poor countries, so the need for resilience is even Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

When the health systems cannot respond to humanitarian emergencies, there is a risk of an acute problem growing into a protracted political crisis. Investments in health (such as laboratories, information systems, communication systems, and human resource management) improve ge neral functioning and the system's ability to respond to threats. BOX 2-4 Building Epidemic Response in Uganda Targeted investments in health infrastructure can improve emergency response relatively quickly. As part of the Global Health Security effort, the Uganda Ministry of Health and the CDC demonstrated how changes in labo ratory management, informatics, and logistics could improve outb reak response. The Ugandan ministry selected three pathogens (M DR-TB, cholera, and Ebola) that pose serious risk to their population , and 17 pilot districts where there is both a history of cholera and, because of PEPFAR, some infrastructure for specimen transp ort and tuberculosis detection. Over six months, the program pr ovided targeted training for laboratory staff, district surveillance officers, and coordinating logisticians. The collaborators developed protocols for packaging and shipping specimens safely on motorbikes and through the Ugandan post office. They stocked di agnostic kits at local hospitals, and developed a way to report suspected outbreaks using text messaging. They also updated th e ministry's online database to allow field workers to immediately notify Kampala of a suspected case. After 6 months, 14 of the 16 pilot laboratories had improved their systems for recognizing ou tbreaks, communicating to the ministry, and transporting specimens. The Ugandan government led the epidemic response pilot, a fact to which the CDC technical collaborators attribute much of its success. The program built on ex isting national informatics and surveillance systems. The system has been in regular use since the pilot program ended, leading to confirmation of cases of West Nile virus, Zika virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, hepatitis E, and MDR-tuberculosis. The ministry also used the new emergency response system twice in 2013: once a preventative measure at a large cultural event, and once to screen pilgrims returning from the Hajj for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

All rights reserved.THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN HEALTH SYSTEMS 55 Unsustainable Health Systems Are a Political Risk Financial sustainability in health means \"having enough reliable funding to maintain current health se rvices for a growing population and to cover the costs of raising quality and expanding availability to acceptable levels. Usually the financial sustainability goal also means achieving these funding levels with a country's own resources\" (Leighton, 1995, p. 2). Determining what constitute s an acceptable level of coverage is up to the leaders running a country's health sector. Mi scalculations in sustainable cost or coverage can have far-reaching political repercussions. Political stability allows health systems to function. There is no doubt that prolonged conflict destroys health infrastructure, decimates the health workforce, and causes governments to decrease health expenditures (Waters et al., 2007). It is also true that neglect of the health system can undermine the stability of governments. People need health services. As the middle class grows, demand for health care increases; failure to respond to this demand spurs unrest. An interesting example of this process comes from the Arab world, mostly upper-middle-income countries where health is not a high government priority (Coutts et al., 2013; UNDP, 2009). What money governments in the region do direct to health is generally spent on urban hospitals and the technology to supp ort them, while more basic needs like infant care are unavailable in rural areas or to the urban poor (UNDP, 2009). There is a great deal of inefficient spending. Medical tourism is common. Even in Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the region, which has a maternal mortality ratio of 270 deaths per 100,000 live births, 29 percent of all health spending is on curative treatment abroad (UNDP, 2009; WHO et al., 2014). Medical tourism among the relatively wealthy depletes hard currency reserves in their home countries and rewards governments for spending on tertiary care centers at the expense of basic pr eventative services (UNDP, 2009). At the same time, health costs in Arab countries are rising much faster than incomes (UNDP, 2009). High user fees (about 60 percent of total health spending in Egypt and Morocc o and about 50 percent in Syria and Lebanon) put a financial burden on the middle class and exclude the poor (WHO, 2014b). For these reasons , discontent with rising out-of- pocket health spending has been cited as a catalyst of the Arab Spring (Alami and Karshenas, 2012; Ec onomist Intelligence Unit, 2012). Excessive out-of-pocket spending alone is not enough to cause political upheaval, but it is always a political risk; governments do well to Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.56 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS control it. In China, for example, when out-of-pocket spending on health steadily rose from 20 percent in 1978 to about 60 percent in 2002, it ended in widespread protests (Yip and Hsiao, 2008). The government responded with a series of reforms that tripled health expenditures and made universal basic coverage a goal (Yip and Hsiao, 2008). High medical cost inflation could undermine this plan. The challenge facing the Chinese government now is to reform the payment system so the additional $25-$38 billion in health spending funds meaningful chan ges for the poor and is not captured in provider profits (Yip and Hsiao, 2008). Medical inflation threatens to undo the Chinese government's plan to expand insurance, because \"no health insurance ... can be adequate, affordable, and sustainable if cost inflation is unchecked\" (Yip and Hsiao, 2008, p. 464). Health reform, insurance expa nsion, and controlling medical inflation are topics of particular relevance to the United States as well. The U.S. government has an inte rest in understanding how different countries address these problems, and the best way to do that is to put American technical experts in pos itions of collaboration with their foreign counterparts. The United Stat es can learn a great deal from these collaborations. Low- and middle-income countries, having fewer resources available, are often responsible for the most innovative overhauls in health financing and management (Quick, 2014). Investment in health systems abroad will also make a statement about the U.S. government's development priorities, showing an interest in building a strong foundation for equitable, sustainable health services. Key Findings Efficient response to pandemic disease depends on surveillance and response capacity. The ability to respond to all disease threats builds the same technical depth that is required to respond to an outbreak. Now only 20 percent of countries have the health systems components to contain and control and emerging global epidemic. The emerging Ebola pandemic woul d tax any health system, but the West African countries affected have particular vulnerabilities. Neglect of health systems undermines governments, all of which have an interest in health reform and controlling medical inflation Conclusions The Ebola pandemic has drawn attention to the consequences of neglecting health systems develo pment in low- and middle-income countries. The U.S. government has an interest in understanding how countries control medical inflation and expand insurance. Putting American experts in positions of collaborati on with their foreign counterparts is an effective means to this end.

The United States' health aid has long favored the targeted solutions. The PEPFAR program was, at its outset, intended to address an immediate problem of HIV and AIDS in poor countries. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) had a similar mandate to reduce malaria mortality with four key interventions (PMI, 2014a). These programs have met with great success in recipient countries. Deaths from HIV and AIDS have declined in PEPFAR countries; child mortality has fallen in the 15 PMI countries (Bendavid and Bhattacharya, 2009; PMI, 2012, 2014a). Vertical health programs, because of their very success, may be approaching the point of diminishing returns. In the early 2000s, providing antiretroviral drugs to AIDS patients in poor countries removed the main obstacle to their survival. Smallpox eradication, perhaps the most successful vertical health program of all time, though immensely complicated logistically, depended on one, simple tool\u2014 immunization\u2014to end death and disability from a tragic disease. When a clear impediment, even if it is a large one, is ending lives, then removing that impediment can have immediate consequences. Such problems are less common now, and may soon disappear altogether. As the previous chapter explained, the future disease burden in low- and middle-income countries will be a complicated amalgam of chronic and infectious conditions, likely aggravated by climate change. A successful donor strategy in global health needs to respond to the epidemiological, political, economic, and demographic changes described earlier. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.58 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS Even as the health problems facing developing countries become more complicated, the goals we set become more ambitious. Ending transmission of HIV, eliminating malaria, and ending preventable maternal and child deaths are some of the next major targets in global health. There are no simple technical tools to help countries meet these goals. Stopping the spread of HIV will require, among other things, trained clinicians to oversee treatment and a laboratory infrastructure for patient monitoring. Similarly, eradicating malaria depends in part on building local capacity for the regulation and efficient distribution of medicines. Ending preventable maternal and child deaths means guaranteeing access to basic health services, especially among the poorest people on society's periphery. As a Lancet report observed, improving health is no longer about te chnical expertise or even money; \"the real struggle is in creating e fficient systems, working with local governments, and making sure that programs are fully implemented\" (Loewenberg, 2007, p. 1893). A functional health system is the foundation of all global health programs. The U.S. government could better support this foundation, thereby making its previous investment s in global health sustainable and bringing about meaningful, structural change. The committee believes that adjustments to the nature of development aid and the manner in which the aid is given could have profound effects on health around the world. The recommended broad strategy for health systems strengthening follows. Recommendation: Congress should respond to the social, economic, and epidemiological ch anges in developing countries by directing more health aid to health systems building. The committee sees three crucial components of this strategy. a) Future programing should emphasize technical cooperation and country ownership in health systems, making investments over a long time period, and giving more attention to measuring the outcomes of their contributions to health than the inputs. b) The United States should make good use of its comparative advantage in science and technology by investing more in global health research and professional training for students in developing countries. c) The United States should also invest in monitoring and management, and require rigorous, external impact Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

No one tool can improve health systems across all low- and middle- income countries. There is wide variation in the strategies countries use to improve their health systems and bring basic services to the poor (Gwatkin et al., 2005). With this in mind, the committee will describe in this section a broad donor strategy fo r health given the social, economic, and epidemiological changes of that past 25 years. First, it will describe changes in the manner in which aid is given, stressing the importance of country ownership, a long time horizon, and the outcomes (rather than the inputs) of development assistance. Next, it will outline what the United States can do to make its assistance for health most effective: investing in global public goods, supporting higher education and meaningful training, and making priorities of good management and monitoring in health programs. A TRANSITION IN HOW TO GIVE DEVELOPMENT AID FOR HEALTH From the mid-2000s on, the U.S. government's work in global health drew some criticism for \"disproportionate emphasis on singular causes and unsustainable approaches\" (Be ndavid and Miller, 2010, p. 792; Garrett, 2007). The Global Health Initiative was formed partly in response to that criticism, to shif t emphasis from emergency response to sustainable programs (Emanuel, 2012). From the start, the program identified problems with health sy stems as \"a binding constraint\" preventing further progress in global health (GHI, 2012, p. 3). Today, most of the U.S. government's support for health systems goes through vertical programs (GHI, 2012). Exposure to the logistics and ma nagement required to implement these large health programs can help build local capacity. This committee believes, however, that cap acity building is most valuable when it is intentional. Part of their reasoning is logistical. If capacity building is not intentional, then managers can neglect it in their daily work and quarterly reporting; they will not arrange for evaluation of the program's relative merits and weaknesses. Deliberate capacity building also makes a clear statement about donor priorities. When the U.S. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.60 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS government invests in the technical depth of its partner countries, it is showing a commitment to a future when countries run these programs independently. Donor funding influences local plan s and large cash influxes to poor countries create a power asymmetry. There is no reason to ignore this dynamic. But the influence that comes with large contributions should be directed in such a way that it supports host country governments and does not undermine them. Shifting the tone of U.S. action in global health from technical assistance to technical cooperation would be invaluable to supporting and empowering aid recipient countries. Emphasis on Technical Cooperation As the previous section explained, the past decades have seen tremendous economic growth in devel oping countries. Now most of the world, including 75 percent of world's poorest people, live in middle-income countries (UN System Task Team, 2012). These countries are gradually building their administrative capacity for core government functions, things like collecting tax es and providing basic education and public health services (Jamison et al., 2013; Khaleghian and Gupta, 2005). These improvements have brought an increasing self-sufficiency to many middle-income countries. The U.S. government should acknowledge these changes with a cha nge in its support strategy. One dimension of this change is to require that donor funding for health be additive with government funding. That is, donors should use their resources to complement their partners' national strategies, not to force new ones upon them. The 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness identified country ownership as one of the fundamental principles for making aid effective (OECD, 2005). The requirement puts an onus on recipient country governme nts to develop national strategies and to lead in carrying them out (OECD, 2005). At that point, the task for donors is to align their aid with the national priorities. An emphasis on country leadership is a departure from the recent practice of setting ambitious global targets for health. Targets like the Millennium Development Goals help build political will to tackle global health problems but are sometimes seen as owned by donors, not developing countries (Fehling et al., 2013; Haines and Cassels, 2004). The emerging post-2015 development agenda gives somewhat greater emphasis to local ownership, local leadership, and local co-design (OECD, 2013b). Universal health cove rage, an emerging cornerstone for Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.AN EFFECTIVE DONOR STRATEGY FOR HEALTH 61 the future of global health, depends on every country having a sense of its most pressing national needs and a strategy to respond to them. As countries work towards the free provision of a basic package of essential services, they will necessarily have to identify gaps in their systems. The task for the U.S. government and other donors is to work with countries to identify these structural gaps, and then tailor its development work to help close them. Country ownership builds \"mutua lly accountable partnerships\" between donors and recipients (Lucas, 2011, p. 3). The promotion of partnership alone sets a productive, collaborative tone that has sometimes been missing in previous projects (Biesma et al., 2009). Foreign funding can skew the government's priorities and cause neglect of other health programs (Atun et al., 2011). Extensive donor financing of health delivery can also be counterproductive, as such assistance is difficult to sustain. Attention to national leadership in health programming is not a new idea; it was central to the early 19 90s sector-wide approach to health programming (Peters et al., 2013b). Sector-wide programming depends on strong government oversight and donor discipline in supporting the priorities their partner governments identify (Peters et al., 2013b). As such the capacity and will of the recipient country government were a common stumbling block to country ownership (Peters et al., 2013b). The committee acknowledges that expectations of country leadership must be adjusted for fragile states. These politically volatile countries have, almost by definition, very li mited capacity to take ownership of their health programming. The Paris Declaration makes it clear that the principles of effective aid apply to all countries, but in fragile states, donors may find it impossible to support the government's strategy (OECD, 2005). In such cases, donors can work through regional networks in ways that build local institutions (OECD, 2005). Contracting and working with n ongovernmental organizations can help build local capacity in fragile states (Newbrander et al., 2014). Starting in 2003, the rebuilding of the Afghan health system made use of nongovernmental organizations to prov ide basic health services (Ameli and Newbrander, 2008; Newbrander et al., 2014). The Afghan government worked with the donors to make and monitor contracts, so managerial skills improved (Newbrande r et al., 2014). Now donors are in a position to make their contracts through the regular government budgeting process, evidence of fairly rapid improvement in government Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.62 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS capacity for oversight (Ameli and Newbrander, 2008; Newbrander et al., 2014; USAID, 2008). Even in stable, relatively prosperous countries, the principle of country ownership is difficult to execute. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S. government corporation that works in foreign aid, has made country ownership a central tenet of its strategy. Its policy papers acknowledge that, after 7 year s of work, the organization \"has a lot more humility about how demanding it is to live up to a commitment to country ownership and true part nership\" (Lucas, 2011, p. 30). They describe the challenging balance of donor and recipient interests that country ownership requires, concl uding that the effort was entirely worthwhile (Lucas, 2011). When countries own their health and development programs, and when their foreign partners set a standard of mutual transparency, citizens are able to hold their governments to account for how they are using resources (Lucas, 2011). People can then see the successes and failures of the health systems as their country's successes and failures, not the work of an amorphous foreign organization. Cooperative plans thereby encourage government accountability, and contribute to a virtuous cycle of sustainable development. A Longer Time Frame An annual funding cycle on development programs makes it difficult for USAID to appreciate the full effects of its programs. It is understandable that legislators take an interest in the immediate consequences of their spending. They need \"rapid and hard-hitting results to feed back to their cons tituencies\" (Victora et al., 2004, pp. 1543-44). But, when development funding for health is bound to short timelines, it leads donors to value vertical programs that deliver services to a large number of people quickly (Victora et al., 2004). Congress values rapid results and requires agencies to regularly re- apply for federal funding. When programs are in an emergency response stage, the short project cycle does little harm. The number of AIDS patients on antiretroviral medicines, for instance, is easy to count quickly. Now the initial emergency response phase for PEPFAR has passed; the future challenge will be integrating vertical programs with the health system. The integration of PEPFAR patient monitoring systems with national systems will be a longer process. Furthermore, the health problems now facing developing countries are complicated, Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.AN EFFECTIVE DONOR STRATEGY FOR HEALTH 63 structural ones. Solutions to these problems involve building a managerial workforce, improving pa yment and financing systems, and bringing health services to the periphery of society. The short donor timeline is the direct enemy of such programming. In development programming, the social benefits lag the costs, and the economic benefits lag even mo re acutely (Stenberg et al., 2014). When Stenberg and colleagues described the \"demographic dividend\" of child survival and reduced fertility, th ey explain that the most valuable economic and social gains are not evident until decades after the initial investment (Stenberg et al., 2014). When donors are overly concerned with their programs 5-year success ra tes, they risk ignoring the most effective, best value investments si mply because it takes too long to see them. Legislators might well maintain that annual funding cycles are a requirement of government appropr iations, that there are too many variables in both donor and recipient countries to predict what aid will be appropriate more than a few years out. The committee acknowledges that matching sustainable aid to political cycles is challenging, but the challenge can be overcome as it was with PEPFAR. In 2003, Congress made a decision to fund large-scale antiretroviral therapy in poor countries, knowing that the moral obligation to continue treatment would last as long as PEPFAR beneficiaries live. At the time, AIDS posed an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in much of the world. The president and legislators recognized that cont rolling the epidemic would require a long time horizon. More recently, the U.S. government reaffirmed its commitment to fight HIV and AIDS until there is an AIDS-free generation (PEPFAR, 2013b). These choices show a commendable support for meaningful, long-term cha nge. The challenge of translating the intellectual commitment into longer working project timelines remains. Outcomes Not Inputs Typically, donors measure the success of health programs by counting what their support buys: the number of patients on antiretroviral therapy or the number of children sleeping under bed nets, for instance. These indicators are essentially process indicators, valuable in so much as they show how the responsible agencies are spending taxpayer money. The point of foreign aid for health is not, however, to distribute pills or bed nets, but to improve people's liv es: making them longer, healthier, Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.64 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS and more productive (Emanuel, 2012). When donors' main concern is what they put into global health, they risk losing sight of what they get out of it. Table 3-1 gives examples of different indicators donors could use to measure the effect of the processes and materials they contribute to global health programs. Many of th e suggested outcomes are long-term ones. Over the shorter term, the pr oportion of the population receiving effective health interventions can be a useful measure of the reach of donor assistance. Integrating proven, effective interventions for child survival with primary care (sometim es called the diagonal approach to child survival) brought down child mo rtality in Mexico by almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2005 (Sep\u00fal veda et al., 2006). For reasons discussed later in this report, only those interventions shown to be effective in rigorous impact evaluati ons should be considered acceptable indicators of aid effectiveness. Public health services (things like vaccination, tuberculosis control, and child growth monitoring) are easy to measure; the effects of these services are not (Khaleghian and Gupta, 2005). It is conceptually important to separate the service from the outcome it aims to bring about. The goal of the President's Ma laria Initiative is not to distribute bed nets but to control and eventually eliminate malaria. Tracking progress TABLE 3-1 Moving from Inputs and Processes to Outcomes in Monitoring U.S. Assistance for Health: Illustrative Indicators Inputs and Processes Outcomes (short- and long-term) Malaria: number of insecticide-treated bednets distributed % of children receiving effective malaria treatment within 24 hours Malaria fraction of under-five mortality Maternal health: % deliveries attended by doctor, nurse, or midwife % women receiving active management of third stage of labor % women rating quality of delivery care as very good or excellent Facility maternal case-fatality rates HIV: Number of people enrolled in antiretroviral care Percent of adults and children known to be alive and on treatment 12 months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy % of patients on ART with low viral loads (to be defined) Health system: Doctors and nurses per 1000 population % of rural and urban populations able to obtain care when last needed (unmet need) % of adults and children with symptoms of pneumonia (malaria, TB, etc.) receiving appropriate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment SOURCE: Kruk, 2008. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.AN EFFECTIVE DONOR STRATEGY FOR HEALTH 65 towards that goal is more complicated, and tied to public health functions , things like disease surveillan ce, regulatory enforcement, professional training, and policy deve lopment (Khaleghian and Gupta, 2005). When health outcomes are a donor priority, the relative value of the health system increases. An investment in national laboratory infrastructure, for example, improves monitoring of HIV patients' viral load, but that is not the only benefit. The same improvements allow for diagnosis of asymptomatic malaria and response to pandemic threats. An emphasis on the volume of what donors put into health can impede recognition of the structural bottlenecks that prevent recipients from using it. The 67 million diagnostic kits PMI has supplied to its partner countries are of little use if malaria diagnosis only precedes treatment with a substandard medi cine (PMI, 2014b). Ending malaria transmission depends on active, respons ive surveillance systems to detect infections, even the asymptomatic on es, and laboratory infrastructure for the genotyping, serology, and dia gnosis of low-parasite-density infections (Feachem et al., 2010; Moonen et al., 2010). As long as the health systems in the 19 PMI countries cannot support these functions, the U.S. taxpayers' investment in malaria will not realize its full value. This does not mean that Congress should stop paying attention to what it puts into global health, or that PMI's essential interventions for malaria control are not valuable. Rath er, it is a reminder to keep as little room as possible between the things we track and the things we care about (Ord, 2013a). Even powerful population health indicators like maternal and child mortality do not capture the full dimensions of good health that donors aim to improve (Ord, 2013a). Improving health means ensuring that people seek care when th ey need it and are not driven to bankruptcy by medical bills, that clinicians are knowledgeable, give appropriate treatment, and behave re spectfully towards their patients. Measuring these and other outcomes of health care is at least as important to understanding the cons equences of a donor funding as counting the volume what the funding buys. Attention to the outcomes of global health programs can only drive better stewardship of taxpayer money. If the goal of investing in health is to improve people's lives, then there is an implied requirement to use donor funding efficiently, to help more people, not fewer, and to buy more health, not less (Ord, 2013b). An emphasis on what donors supply to recipient countries distorts this equation and forces agencies to give more attention to their contribution than to its product. Careful accounting for the outcome of development aid could prevent a Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.66 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS Conclusions Health systems limitations are the binding constraint preventing further progress in global health. Building capacity in aid recipient countries can help relieve this constraint, and would show the United States' commitment to a fu ture when countries run health programs independently. A transformative investment in gl obal health is one that supports recipient countries' priorities, under standing the gaps they identify in their health systems and tailoring development work to help close them. Short project timelines are not conducive to sustainable development programming. When donors emphasize their programs' shorter-term successes, they risk ignoring the most meaningful investments because it takes too long to realize their effects. When donors concentrate on what they put into to global health, they risk losing sight of what th ey get out of it. Attention to the volume of what donor funding bu ys impedes recognition of the structural bottlenecks that prev ent recipients from using it. misdirection of resources that, throu gh shortsightedness alone, endangers millions of lives (Ord, 2013b). A TRANSITION IN WHAT TO GIVE IN DEVELOPMENT AID FOR HEALTH It is important that Congress, as a steward of taxpayer money, get the best value possible for its contribution to global health. The question of value becomes more important as economic growth in poor countries decreases the proportionate weight of the donors' c ontributions. The aid strategy that the U.S. government has relied on in the past relies heavily on technical solutions and service provision. This type of suppor t may not be sustainable in the future. The most elegant interventions can be useless if they are not embedded in a functional health system (Atun and Coker, 2008). Furthermore, the problems facing low- and middle-income countries nowadays are not the sort that simple interventions can fix. A good donor strategy will acknowledge this, a nd support recipient countries to develop solutions suitable to the local disease burden and reflective of national priorities. The committee believes that through minor adjustments to what development funding supports, Congress could elicit a transformative shift in global health. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.AN EFFECTIVE DONOR STRATEGY FOR HEALTH 67 Development of Global Public Goods One of the best roles for the U.S. government's donor agencies is to invest in public goods, products that economists describe as nonrival (meaning that consumption by one person does not diminish consumption of the same good by ot hers) and nonexclusionary (meaning the benefits of consumption are available to all, not restricted to a discrete group) (Khaleghian and G upta, 2005; Woodward and Smith). Public goods are things that everyone needs, but few would pay for. If the production of public goods were left to the market alone, the amount produced would be less than is necessary, so providing them is one of the main responsibilities of governments (Smith and MacKellar, 2007). There is a special subset of public goods whose production is to the collective benefit of a group of nations. These gl obal public goods are produced for universal consumption; it benefits no one to exclude a nation from sharing in the good, rega rdless of whether that nation pays for the good's production (Smith and MacKellar, 2007). Disease surveillance is a global public good, as is the development of harmonized standards for quality control in the production of foods and medicines (Jamison et al., 2013). One of the most valuable global public goods that the United States produces is knowledge (IOM, 1997, 2009). American researchers produce some of the world' s best tools for improving health. Directing their skills to questions th at benefit the poor makes efficient use of the United States' compar ative advantage in science and technology. Funding Research The private sector has little reason to develop products intended for markets that have no ability to pay (UN System Task Team, 2013). The medicines and tools used to treated tropical disease are a good example this. It costs between $2 and $10 million and takes 3 to 5 years to bring a new diagnostic test to market; a new drug costs many times more, often over billion dollars spanning nearly a decade (Kaitin, 2010; Moran, 2011). Products for neglected diseases (a category which, for accounting purposes, includes HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria) accounted for $3.1 billion in 2008, or about 3 percent of global spending on pharmaceutical research and developmen t (Guevara et al., 2008; Moran, 2011). HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria products account for the vast majority of this spending; research on the 15 neglected tropical Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.68 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS diseases amounted to less than half of 1 percent of global pharmaceutical research and development funding (Moran, 2011). By 2011 estimates, controlling and eliminating neglected tropical diseases will require an increased $2-$3 billion in research costs over 5 years (Bush and Hopkins, 2011). Public-p rivate partnerships, which have the potential to align the interests of the private sector with those of patients in low- and middle-incom e countries, are one novel way to finance this research. Such partnerships lead to important technical breakthroughs, as with the control of onchocerciasis (Bush and Hopkins, 2011). They also draw the attention of very profitable corporations to global health problems, thereby s timulating drug donations and other partnerships (Bush and Hopkins, 20 11). Pharmaceutical companies are not the only private corporations working in private partnerships for global health. The international logistics company DHL Express, for example, has worked with government logisticians in sub-Saharan Africa to improve their warehousing and medicine distribution systems (Dalberg Global Development A dvisors and the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, 2008). Pharmaceutical development is only one area where the United States could use its comparative advantage in research to improve global health. The emerging field of implementation science 1 has great promise to improve health in developing countries by identifying the social, economic, and political factors that affect health programs (Peters et al., 2013a). Implementation research can explain why the essential interventions for maternal and child su rvival can fail in the real world. Understanding why programs succ eed or fail will be essential for bringing services to a majority of the world's people, as universal health coverage aims to do. Implementation research explains how contextual factors influence health; in global health, it requires extensive fieldwork and technical cooperation. This type of research is therefore an ideal target for donor support: it is collaborative and takes place in low- and middle-income countries. Collaborative research partne rships are the basis of scientific diplomacy; they also have the potential to produce tools suitable to poor countries. A partnership between Amer ican and Bengali scientists at the Cholera Research Laboratory (now the icddr,b 2) led to the development of oral rehydration solution, a simple mix of water, sugar, and salt that 1 Formerly called operations research. 2 Officially, the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.AN EFFECTIVE DONOR STRATEGY FOR HEALTH 69 restores electrolyte balance in patie nts with severe diarrhea (Yee, 2013). Oral rehydration therapy to treat child diarrhea is one of the most successful public health discoveries of the twentieth century. It has saved an estimated 50 million lives, most of them children (Yee, 2013). The technical collaborations that started at the Cholera Research Laboratory helped build a local cadre of researchers and managers. The icddr,b now has three main centers in rural and urban Bangladesh, and a network of field stations supporti ng surveillance and health systems research (icddr,b, 2014b). Over the past 50 years, icddr,b experts have developed tools for managing childhood illness and treating severe malnutrition; tested new vaccines and developed innovative ways of delivering them; and drafted legislation to prevent violence against women (icddr,b, 2014a). The prominence of health research in Bangladesh is often cited as an e xplanation for the country's lower fertility rate, longer life expectancy and lower infant and child mortality rates than any other country in South Asia (Balabanova et al., 2013). Catalyzing Innovative Changes Part of the value in investing in global public goods is that their worth is not constrained to any one country; Americans stand to benefit from this research as well (IOM, 1997). In low- and middle-income countries, there are obvious constraints on the ability of patients and governments to pay for health, and this constraint drives creative changes in service delivery. Rich countries can learn from these programs, especially as the pressure to control costs grows (Mulley, 2013). Some of the most innovative changes in global health have come from developing countries, and are now being adapted for other parts of the world. Task shifting, the delegation of appropriate tasks to workers with less specialized training, emerged as a response to a shortage of trained professionals in developing countries (WHO, 2006). Task shifting makes efficient use of the available workforce. Rolling out antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, required the training of community health workers in voluntary counselling and testing, monitoring treatment adherence, medicines storage and dispensing, and clinical administrative tasks (WHO, 2007b). When health workers took on these tasks they removed a time burden from nurses, who, in turn, absorbed some tasks traditionally assigned to doctors (WHO, 2007b). Although it requires a significant starting investment in training, task shifting can reduce costs and improve worker satisfaction (WHO, 2007b). Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.70 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS These are valuable ends in developed countries as well, where health systems struggle with rising costs. One novel strategy for dealing with these costs relies on task shifting to defray health expenses among the 5 percent of patients who account for almost half of health costs in the United States (Cohen and Yu, 2012; Gawande, 2011). An innovative program in New Jersey directed the management of these patients away from doctors in hospitals to a team that includes a nurse practitioner, a social worker, and a community health worker (RWJF, 2012). The use of task shifting, especially the efforts of the community health workers, greatly improved prognosis for these patients, and reduced their health costs by half (Gawande, 2011; RWJF, 2012). The use of mobile phones to support public health and clinical medicine is another innovation from developing countries with the potential to improve health in the Un ited States (Kahn et al., 2010). Bulk messaging of mobile subscribers is a commonly used health communication technique in sub-Saharan African and South Asia (Deglise et al., 2012). Americans use cheap mobile messaging for health far less. A recent survey of American cell phone owners found that, among the 80 percent of cell phone ow ners who send and receive text messages, only 9 percent have signed up for text health updates (Fox and Duggan, 2012). An analysis of the lessons learned from successful mobile messaging projects in poor countries could help adapt these tools for better use in rich ones. The United States has a research infrastructure and technical depth in its universities and private businesses to support health systems innovation in low- and middle-income countries. Developing tools and processes for solving global health problems builds a knowledge base that benefits people around the world. Another important way the United States can build the global knowledge base is by supporting higher education for professional students from low- and middle-income countries. This training will help redu ce the shortage of trained health workers, and build a cadre of professionals qualified to run their countries' health systems. Supporting Higher Education and Meaningful Training U.S. government agencies working in global health often emphasize training as an essential piece of their aid strategy. More than 2 million people a year take part in USAID trainings (USAID Bureau for Economic Growth Agriculture and Trade, 2012).

A study in Delhi found that, in 80 percent of cases, the average practitioner's advice is more likely to harm the patient than help (Das, 2006). Two-thirds of women presenting with pre-eclampsia, for exam ple, were given advice likely to lead to their or their child's death (Das, 2006). As Box 2-2 explained, health extension training brought an additional 30,000 health workers to rural Ethiopia in 5 years (Banteyerga et al., 2011). The training of higher-level health professionals is even more complicated and central to most national health strategies. The Chinese government, for example, aims to train 300,000 additional doctors over the next 10 years (Lancet, 2011; Yip et al., 2012). Donor countries set similarly ambitious target s. As part of the Global Health Security Agenda, the United States has committed to helping low- and middle-income countries develop a work force of doctors, veterinarians, basic scientists, and statisticians. Th e program highlights the need for one field epidemiologist for every 200,000 people\u2014more than 10,000 field epidemiologists for India and the African continent alone (HHS). Such figures do not even account for the increased need for social scientists, administrators, accountants, and logisticians. The need for professional education far outpaces the capacity of the university systems in low- and middle-income countries to provide it. In Ghana, for example, public nursing schools turn away 60 percent of qualified candidates (Conway et al., 2007). The United States could help alleviate this training crush by investing in the education of hea lth professionals in low- and middle- income countries. There are many different methods for improving health professionals' education, a nd the appropriate methods will be different in different countries. In a country where there are not sufficient university places or instructors to teach the qualified student pool, donors might help identify ways to use online education or tuition support for study in neighboring countries. If the quality of professional education is a limitation, then partnerships between universities in the United States and in developing countries might be more effective. The Purdue Kenya Partnership, for instance, brings North American and Kenyan pharmacists together for year-long clin ical residencies in western Kenya (Pastakia and Ogallo, 2014). The U.S. government has sponsored training programs for health professionals since the 1970s and 19 80s, roughly altern ating attention Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The manner of training has also changed over time. In an effort to avoid the so-called brain drain (the emigration of trained professionals from developing countries) the National Institutes of Health began the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) to improve health and medical education in sub-Saharan Africa (Glass et al., 2014; Kirby, 2014). The program has made grants to 13 African universiti es and recently expanded to include a somewhat greater emphasis on original investigation (Glass et al., 2014; Kirby, 2014; Saint Louis, 2014 ). These grants both encourage trained researchers to st ay at their home country institutions and support the new inquiry that improves their country's health services (Kirby, 2014). Through USAID, the U.S. government also funds the Higher Education for Development program, which aims to strengthen the universities and institutions that develop human potential in poor countries (Higher Education for Development, 2014). The program promotes collaboration between Amer ican and foreign universities, awarding the foreign institution grants and technical support to improve training (Higher Education for De velopment, 2014). In addition to supporting training, the U.S. government can provide valuable input as countries develop workforce strategi es, plans for how to efficiently manage the existing workforce and tr ain the next generation (JLI, 2004). Such programs require more atten tion and funding from donors. Despite resounding international consensus on the value of health professional training, it \"remains chronically underfunded in national budgets and cooperative development efforts\" (Frenk et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2011, p. 2349). A good workforce strategy helps make the best use of the trained staff in a country. India, for exampl e, has only one allopathic doctor for every 1,700 people, barely enough to staff secondary and tertiary care hospitals (Kumar, 2013; Mor and J ohar, 2012). There are many more people (roughly 750,000) qualified to practice traditional Indian medicine, who, because of constraints on their job market, are happy to work in rural areas (Jithendra and Johar, 2012; Mor a nd Johar, 2012).

All rights reserved.74 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS Healthcare recruit doctors of traditio nal Indian medicine to provide primary care in rural areas. The doctors take a 6-month bridging course on allopathic primary care, and ar e required to adhere to detailed treatment protocols (Jithendra and Johar, 2012; Mor and Johar, 2012). Donors could support programs like these that aim to improve the competency of primary care providers in rural areas. Training more primary care clinicians will help alleviate some of the strain on health systems, but the shor tage of health workers is only one dimension of the workforce problem. In many countries there are serious problems with the quality of the educat ion available; in rural India, there fifteen times as many unqualified providers as qualified ones (Das et al., 2012). Even knowledgeable providers often provide poor care (Das, 2006). The problem is not confined to India. In a review of 80 quality studies from a range of low- and middle-income countries, Berendes and colleagues (2011) found providers' technical competence and clinical skills averaging less than 50 percent on a standardized, 100-point scale. In much of the world, the vast vari ability in medical education, combined with poor incentives to give good quality care, puts patients at risk (Berendes et al., 2011; Das et al., 2012). Controlling this risk is the job of the administrators who run the health system, enforce its rules, and make its policies. The training of administrative professionals is at least as important to the functioning of the health system as the training of clinicians. Developing countries need administrative experts who can make strategic decisions about how to manage and integrate different components of the health system. One of the best investments donors can make is training the managerial core experts who steer the health system. Building Management Capacity Donor effort and research in global health has long given attention to developing clinical tools and programs to save lives. There has been considerably less attention paid to understanding if countries have core managers to deliver programs effec tively (Victora et al., 2004). Limited administrative capacity is a serious problem in most developing countries. Simple tasks like record keeping and paying suppliers are often neglected; managers cannot eas ily fire incompetent workers or even perform more basic tasks, such as releasing pay (Khaleghian and Gupta, 2005; Russell et al., 1999). The administrative system is weakest in the areas of finance, accounting, and human resource management, Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.AN EFFECTIVE DONOR STRATEGY FOR HEALTH 75 which tends to frustrate good manage rs and make it difficult to keep them in public service (Khaleghian and Gupta, 2005; Russell et al., 1999; Yip et al., 2012). Donor countries have good technical depth in public administration, and should make developing strong administrative systems in their partner countries a goal of developmen t. A training component will be an important part of this, but techni cal exchange will be as important. Health systems in particular depe nd on administrative competency; different services and functions need different kinds of management and different incentives (Khaleghian and Gupta, 2005). Universal health coverage will require a reliable reve nue stream, most of which countries will have to collect from taxes. Developed countries have systems for collecting taxes, and electronic tools that make tax collection more efficient. Helping low- and middl e-income countries develop similar skills would be a good use of donor countries' experience. Universal health coverage is going to make public administration and management a more prominent conc ern in low- and middle-income countries. It will require decision makers to balance competing priorities: the care of children and adults, prev entative services and curative ones, primary care and more complicated secondary and tertiary care programs. There is no one right way to balance these priorities, no perfect \"single blueprint for an ideal health care system\" (Mills, 2014, pp. 552-53). It is clear, however, that countries with accountable, transparent governments get more for their spending. Improvements to public administration and provider acco untability will be crucial for the success of universal coverage (M oreno-Serra and Smith, 2012). Training and technical exchanges can help build capacity for public administration, but donors could also encourage better management in their partner countries by requiring it of their own projects. Changing the way U.S. government authorities manage their health programming could build momentum for more efficient administration in low- and middle-income countries and improve all stakeholders' understanding of how health systems work. Making Monitoring and Management Priorities Governments and donors now struggl e to allocate resources wisely and to choose the best investment s in global health. The political tradeoffs involved in their decisions ar e only complicated by the fact that the data informing policy decisions is deficient. The G8 Health Experts Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.76 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS Group and UN General Assembly have publically commented on the need for accurate health statistic s on which to base their decisions; ministers of health and finance need the same (AbouZahr et al., 2010). Until developing countries can track births and deaths, including cause of death, the evidence base informing health and social policy will be lacking. The ability to measure under lies all public health surveillance and response. Developing the capacity to monitor vital statistics should be main priority for the United States and other donors. The committee acknowledges that building systems for civil registration is a long process; it took 300 years in Great Britain (Lopez et al., 2007). There is no reason that the process should be as onerous in developing countries. Modern in formation technology makes the collection, organization, and use of vital statistics vastly simpler (AbouZahr et al., 2007). South Africa, where the government facilitated the process, made excellent progress in a decade (Lopez et al., 2007; Statistics South Africa, 2007). Effective population monitoring depends on local political commitment and legislative mandate (AbouZahr et al., 2007). When high-level commitment is missing, donors often work around their partner countries' deficiencies, setti ng up parallel monitoring programs for their vertical health programs. Such systems can distort government priorities; the target condition can, simply by being extensively tracked, garner disproportionate attention (Lopez et al., 2007). Over time, the continued use of parallel monitoring systems only undermines the national system (Atun et al., 2011). Donors would do better to use their funding and influence to stimulate political will to create and maintain civil registration systems (Lopez et al., 2007). Monitoring in Donor Projects Accurate measurement of vital st atistics is one goal of building measurement capacity in developing countries. But routine monitoring and measurement in donor projects has value as well. Measurement drives action. One of the successes of the Millennium Development Goals was in naming obstacles to health and development, and setting clear targets to change them (World Vision, 2012). Collecting data and tracking progress towards national goal s will continue to be valuable after 2015. Donors can encourage the measurement of meaningful targets by requiring the same in their projects. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.AN EFFECTIVE DONOR STRATEGY FOR HEALTH 77 The information that donors and governments choose to track determines what lessons they learn. So, for example, when donors choose to measure the percentage of births attended by a skill provider, they can learn how to increase the nu mbers of skilled attendants at births, but not how to ensure those provide rs give good quality, evidence-based care. Donors should give as much attention to monitoring the consequences of their work as they do to the essential interventions they promote, because monitoring the qualit y and outcomes of health services \"is not an essential intervention\u2014it is simply essential\" (Fr\u00f8en and Temmerman, 2013, p. 1007). Monitoring is essential because it is the cornerstone of good public management. Good managers monitor their projects in a constant iterative feedback loop. But too often in health, this main purpose of monitoring for efficient management gets lost. Instead, monitoring becomes a means to generate national statistics for global epidemiological analysis (Atun et al., 2011). Donor projects should be subject to regular, detailed monitoring that accounts for all funding streams and li nks funding to end results. Such information allows all stakeholders to see how donor money is being spent and consider the trade-offs between different investments (Blanchet et al., 2013). Open sharing of this information helps donors and governments see the effectiveness of aid (Lozano et al., 2011). Evidence of this effectiveness is inva luable to everyone asked to make decisions about how to invest in health (Lozano et al., 2011). The monitoring of health system projects is particularly weak. Donors often account for health system s expenses in terms of equipment bought and buildings refurbished, the things they put into the health system, not the way the system operates (House of Commons, 2014). Neglect of appropriate monitoring in previous projects has created gaps in our understanding of how to improve health infrastructur e. As a result, the health systems literature provi des better evidence of what the problems are than of how to fix them (Mills, 2014). There are many possible ways to improve the quality of health care and make services available to the whole population with out introducing financial hardship. Policy makers need to experiment w ith different programs, monitor them carefully, and revise those that do not seem to work. Only after going through these steps in the program, can donors evaluate their investment in health and assess if the program offered an improvement on standard practice. Donors should insist on this, and require that the evaluation of their projects be kept separate from routine monitoring. Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.78 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS Evaluation Is Separate from Monitoring Program evaluation starts from the humble perspective that no one knows before doing a project how it will end. Programs can be based on other successful interventions and grou nded in good theory, but there is never any guarantee that interventions will work in settings other than those in which they have been tried (Gwatkin et al., 2004). Governments and donors need to understand if the program that they are spending money on is better than the standard of care. This question needs to be put to a disinterested evaluator, an organization not involved with the project's daily management. Previous expert committees have recommended rigorous evaluation of the impact of global health programs (IOM, 2009). USAID has responded to this suggestion; its cu rrent policies require that large projects 4 undergo a performance evaluation, an analysis that determines if the program has achieved its expected results (USAID Bureau for Policy Planning and Learning, 2011). An alternative and more rigorous analysis is an impact evaluation, which relies on a clear, credible counterfactual to establish if measu red changes in health (or other development outcomes) are attributable to the program (USAID Bureau for Policy Planning and Learning, 2011). The agency's evaluation policy acknowledges the superior value of im pact evaluations. Nevertheless, the agency allows implementing organizations considerable leeway, requiring impact evaluations only \"i f feasible\" (USAID Bureau for Policy Planning and Learning, 2011, p. 8). Its policy maintains that, in development work, some environments are \"so complex that standard linear [or] causal models may have little relevance\" (USAID Bureau for Policy Planning and Learning, 2011, p. 8). Understanding the full effects of programs and establishing the causal relationship between intervention s and changes in health is often complicated, but never irrelevant. Firs t, it is the government's obligation to the taxpayer to understand the eff ects of their investment. The need for impact evaluations also relates to donors' obligations to aid recipients. Any new health program has the potential to divert the partner country's attention, money, and staff from other activities. In places where resources are scarce, the opportunity cost of pursuing dead end programs is exceptionally high. 4 A large project is one that \"equals or exce eds in dollar value the mean ... project size for the operating unit\" (USAID Bureau for Po licy Planning and Learning, 2011, p. 8).

In an effort to improve the survival of mothers and infants and to increase hospital deliveries, the program paid the medical and travel expenses for expectant mothers below the poverty line, reimbursing a day's forgone wages for the person accompanying her (UNICEF, 2009). Initial evaluati ons based on before-and-after comparisons suggested that the progra m reduced maternal deaths by 90 percent, and neonatal deaths by 60 percent (Mohanan et al., 2014). Chiranjeevi Yojana won the Asian Innovations Award in 2006 (Ghosh, 2013). Later the same year, the government of Gujarat expanded the program throughout the state. The staggered roll out of Chiranjeevi Yojana allowed for a useful comparison between those districts that implemented the program in early 2006 and those that waited. This more rigorous, quasi-experimental design found that the program effect ed no change in the probability of hospital delivery, maternal survival, or household spending on delivery (Ghosh, 2013; Mohanan et al., 2014). The improvements suggested in the initial before-and-after studies were driven instead by wider, secular changes. The program's start coincided with a period of rapid economic growth in Gujarat. Initial analysis failed to account for reporting inaccuracy at the hospitals, the self-selection of participants, and a general increase in hospital births over time (Ghosh, 2013; Mohanan et al., 2014). Another study found that a similar cash incentive program, this one implemented throughout India, drove up fertility in some states, accounting for about 1.86 million additional births in the parts of the county most eager to encourage family planning (Nandi and Laxminarayan, 2012). Analyses of Chiranjeevi Yojana and similar programs give cautionary examples of the cost of neglecting formal impact evaluation. The committee acknowledges that the most rigorous evaluation designs are not always politically feasible. Random selection of program and control areas sets up funders for an objective analysis of program effectiveness. This method can be u sed more often and more creatively. There are many other ways to do constructive post-factor comparisons, however. U.S. government agencies should require such comparisons in the programs they fund, especially for programs introducing technical innovations or new ways to deliver services.

All rights reserved.80 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS When it comes to understanding the effects of health programs, the way an intervention is delivered wa rrants as rigorous an evaluation as the intervention itself (Victora et al ., 2004). The small African nation of Rwanda has given considerable a ttention to improving its service delivery system and has made rapid improvements in health, especially in use of health services among the poorest people (Sekabaraga et al., 2011). Between 2000 and 2007, the government invested in several novel health financing schemes to increase demand for and supply of health services. It also insisted on rigorous impact evaluation of these programs (Sekabaraga et al., 2011). This allowed them to establish that at least two of the new policies (micro-insurance and performance-based pay) had improved health outcomes and contro lled out-of-pocket spending beyond what would have been expected by chance (Sekabaraga et al., 2011). The government's effort to measure and ev aluate the effects of their programs allowed it, eventually, to direct more resources to the things that work, and avoid wasting effort on the things that do not. Donor agencies and governments need to be confident that the programs they spend on are better than the alternatives. Formal, independent, impact evaluations are an indispensable step in establishing the value of any development project . The results of these evaluations should be made available to the taxpayer. In the same away that the National Institutes of Health requires results of the trials it funds be publically available, so should all U.S. government development agencies be required to publish the results of impact evaluations.

Congress can direct scientific attention to questions that benefit the poor, especially research and development of medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics, and implementation science. Higher education and professional training for students from developing countries is a useful contribution to global development; short workshops and seminars are much less so. The United States can help alleviate the shortage of health professionals in developing countries by investing in their training. The training of experts in finance, accounting, and human resources management also requires significant attention. Donors can encourage an efficient management culture in their partner countries by modelling it in their own programs. Monitoring projects is part of everyday management and separate from formal evaluation.

The United States and other donors have contributed to this progress and ha ve an interest in sustaining it. Reducing premature mortality in developing countries will depend on improvements to the health syst em: the workforce, leadership, information system, service delivery, and financing of the health sector. Building the infrastructure that sup ports health will reduce disease and lengthen lives, fostering economic growth and global security. Every year, 150 million people fall into poverty because of health expenses. The threat of financial catastrophe keeps the poorest and most vulnerable people outside the formal health system. In an effort to mitigate their risks, countries are moving towards a universal health coverage system that would provide a basic package of essential services to the whole population. As low- and middle-income countries start to build universal coverage systems, w eaknesses in their health systems are becoming a binding constraint. Support for health systems will help protect the United States standing investments in malaria, HI V and AIDS, and child health. By building local capacity to manage th e health system the United States would help reduce dependence of forei gn aid. Capacity building is a long process, however. Success toward th is goal should be measured in a longer time frame than Congress has previously allowed for development projects. Taking a longer view of gl obal development and paying closer attention to the outcomes (rather than the inputs) of the United States' investment in health could do much to change the tone of foreign aid. An aid strategy that emphasizes research and training, global public goods, efficient management, and rigorous program evaluation would go Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Also called conventional, modern, or Western medicine. Bilateral aid: Assistance given by one government directly to the government of another country. It is often employed strategically and directed according to political cons iderations, not only humanitarian ones. Catastrophic health spending: Refers to health expenditure that is large relative to a patient's capacity to pay. The payment itself need not be large, and, conversely, even la rge payments may not be deemed catastrophic if there are resources available to pay. Such resources may be the patient's own or those availabl e through external sources, such as insurance coverage. There is no consensus around the threshold for defining catastrophic health spending, and it varies throughout the literature. This report uses a more conservative approach, defining catastrophic health spending as that which exceeds 40 percent of a household's income after basic subsistence needs are met. (Wyszewianski, 1986; Xu et al., 2003, 2007) Child mortality rate, or under-five mortality rate : The number of children who die by the age of 5 per thousand live births per year. Civil registration: The system by which a government records the vital events of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database is called civil register or registry, or population registry. The primary Investing in Global Health Systems: Sustaining Gains, Transforming Lives Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.104 INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH SYSTEMS purpose of civil registration is to crea te legal documents that are used to establish and protect the civil rights of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics.
