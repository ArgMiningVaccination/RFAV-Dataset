In this act adopted at Windsor, July 2,1777, Section 40 states in part that \"one grammar school in each county and one university in the state ought to be established by direction of the General Assembly.\" No action was taken by the Assembly to establish a University except that in granting charters to towns, it did require that one right of land be established for the endowment of a college or university. By 1785 there was a substantial amount of public sentiment in favor of establishing a college or university in Vermont. In that year Elijah Paine of Williamstown offered the General Assembly the sum of 2,000 pounds. Four years later Ira Allen offered the sum of 4,000 pounds. These and other offers caused the General Assembly to appoint a committee to study the matter and to canvass the state in order to determine where the university should be located. This committee reported to the session of 1791 at which time the General Assembly decided that a university was to be founded to serve the state. A ballot was taken on the question of location and a decision was made in favor of Burlington, presumably because of the substantial support offered by Ira Allen, the Rev. Samuel Williams, and their associates. The General Assembly further voted to create a committee to draft a charter of the University. The report of the committee was adopted with amendments on November 3, 1791, as the charter law of The Univer\u00ad sity of Vermont. The University became the twentieth college in the United States and the fifth in New England chartered to confer the bachelor's degree. It is of worthy note that the University is the second to be estab\u00ad lished by a state legislature after the formation of the United States. The ac\u00ad tion of the 1791 Legislature also makes The University of Vermont the oldest institution of higher education in the Green Mountain State. Thus did the founding Legislature of Vermont establish a university which was to develop like no other in the fledgling nation. While the enabling legislation provided for funding to come from rents, those were often fixed at \"$.25 per acre as long as grass is green and water runs,\" and in any event were not reliably collectable. One result is the tradition, born of necessity, which has seen The Univer\u00ad sity of Vermont develop in many of the same ways as the private institutions of the country have developed, with a substantial reliance on alumni and other private philanthropy. The first building was subscribed by citizens of Burlington and when fire destroyed that edifice in 1824, its successor, for which General Lafayette laid the cornerstone, was again made possible by the citizens of Burlington. That building, the Old Mill \u2014 still in use today \u2014 was only the first in a long line to be made possible by private philanthropy. The list includes all but one of the buildings on University Row: Ira Allen Chapel, Billings, Williams, Old Mill, and The Royall Tyler Theatre. Morrill Hall, the first UVM building to be provided by state funding, did not come until 1907. Other buildings made possible by private philanthropy include Waterman Memorial, Southwick, Fleming Museum, Converse, Dewey and Lafayette Halls. 3 4 | INTRODUCTION Medical alumni and other friends raised approximately $7,000,000 to match federal grants to make possible the Given Medical Building, its Medical Alumni Building wing, and the Dana Medical Library. In addition to a challenge grant from the Dana Foundation, the project attracted a $2,000,000 grant from the Given Foundation, the single largest building gift the University has received to date. Alumni and other friends also raised more than $1,000,000 of the $3,000,000 cost of the Patrick Gymnasium, Gutterson Field House, and For- bush Pool complex. The remainder is being paid by students, through retire\u00ad ment of a bond issue. In like fashion, student rents have made possible most of the campus residence halls, which currently house about 4,000 of the University's 7,600 undergraduates. Currently a $1,000,000 campaign for private support is being conducted for support of the $4,300,000 addition to Bailey Library. J. Warren and Lois H. McClure have pledged $500,000 in matching funds for the drive and the addition will be named for Mrs. McClure's father, David W. Howe, a 1914 alumnus and long time publisher of The Burlington Free Press. The University of Vermont was founded in a day when U.S. colleges and universities existed primarily to educate men for the professions, especially for the ministry. Yet, in studying University history, Professor Emeritus Betty Bandel discovered that \"this small institution located in a frontier community of New England became a pioneer in the kind of practical education which later became the basis for the establishment of the Land Grant universities \u2014 those institutions which made it possible for the sons and daughters of average citizens to aspire to a college education.\" For example, she noted that the University is believed to be the first non- military institution to have offered engineering courses, and early alumni of the University included men such as John Kasson who was instrumental in founding the international postal system; and Henry Raymond, a founder of The New York Times. Tucked in the northwest corner of the Ira Allen Chapel grounds is a memorial to a late 19th century graduate of this University, philosopher John Dewey, whose ideas about practical education are still debated with passionate vigor. Ten Academic Divisions By contemporary standards, The University of Vermont is a relatively small university. Its 7,600 undergraduates enrolling in eight colleges and schools \u2014 the Colleges of Agriculture; Arts and Sciences; Education and Social Services; and Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administration; and the Schools of-Allied Health Sciences; Home Economics; Natural Resources; and Nursing \u2014 share the 420 acre main campus with some 900 students enroll\u00ad ing in the Graduate College and another 320 in the College of Medicine. The Division of Continuing Education offers courses on campus and in many communities throughout the State of Vermont during the fall and spring semesters and during the Summer Session. The largest single share (about 30 per cent) of the University's current total operating budget of $77 million is obtained from student tuitions. INTRODUCTION | 5 Grants and contracts (the University is among the top 100 U.S. institutions of higher learning in competition for federal research, training and equip\u00ad ment grants) account for about 25 per cent of the budget. The state appropriation is currently about 17 per cent of the total budget. The remainder comes from a variety of sources, including alumni and other private philanthropy, endowment, sales and services and auxiliary enterprises. Endowed Chairs Since the establishment of the Williams Professorship in Mathematics in 1853, the University has been the recipient of a number of generous en\u00ad dowments intended to support teaching and research in various academic fields. Among them are: The Williams Professorship of Mathematics, 1853, honoring Azarias Williams of Concord, Vt., merchant and judge, native of Sheffield, England, who in 1839 deeded to the University extensive holdings in land, at that time valued at $25,000. In return he received a small annuity during the remain\u00ad ing ten years of his life. The Marsh Professorship of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, estab\u00ad lished in 1867 to honor James Marsh, distinguished UVM president and philosopher of the 1830's. Many alumni contributed to the fund which established this chair. The Pomeroy Professorship of Chemistry, established in 1878 by John N. Pomeroy, A.B., 1809, who lectured on chemistry and later, during his career as a lawyer in Burlington, served as trustee of the University. He was awarded the LL.D. in 1861. The Howard Professorship of Natural History and Zoology, established in 1881 by John Purple Howard, a Burlington resident who was a generous benefactor both of the University and of the City of Burlington. The Flint Professorship of Mathematics, Natural or Technic Science, fre\u00ad quently awarded in the field of civil engineering, established in 1895 by a bequest from Edwin Flint, A.B., 1836, lawyer and judge in Wisconsin and Iowa until his death in 1891 in Mason City, Iowa. The Converse Professorship in Commerce and Economics, established in 1899 as a result of an endowment made by John H. Converse, A.B., 1861, LL.D., 1897, Philadelphia railroad financier, who as a trustee of the Univer\u00ad sity proposed the teaching of Latin, modern languages, history, bookkeep\u00ad ing, penmanship, and other subjects necessary to men and women. The Thayer Professorship of Anatomy, established in 1910 to honor Dr. Samuel White Thayer, Dean of the College of Medicine from 1854-71 and 1880-82, from contributions made by alumni of the College of Medicine. The McCullough Professorship of Political Science, established in 1926 through grants made by Gov. and Mrs. John G. McCullough of Bennington, Vt. Gov. McCullough was a lawyer and attorney general in California during the mid-nineteenth century; later a railroad financier and benefactor of many educational and other enterprises during his long residence in Ver\u00ad mont. The Perkins Professorship of Zoology, established in 1931 to honor George H. Perkins, for sixty-four years as a teacher of science and dean of the Col\u00ad lege of Arts and Sciences for many years. Grant for this professorship was 6 | INTRODUCTION made by John E. Lynch of Boston, Mass. The Shipman Professorship of Ophthalmology, established in 1934 by a bequest from Dr. Elliot W. Shipman, M.D., 1885. After beginning his prac\u00ad tice in Vergennes, Vt., and studying ophthalmology in Berlin, Dr. Shipman practiced medicine in Richmond Hill, N.Y., for thirty-five years. The Corse Professorship of English Language and Literature, established in 1952 by Frederick M. and Fannie C.P. Corse. Mr. Corse, A.B., 1888, and registrar and teacher of mathematics and economics in the University dur\u00ad ing the 1890's, was general manager for Russia of the New York Life In\u00ad surance Company, with offices in Stalingrad (Petrograd) for seventeen years before the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Lawrence Forensic Professorship of Speech, established in 1965 by Edwin W. Lawrence, lawyer and financier of Rutland, Vt., A.B., 1901, generous patron of forensic activities at the University. The Sanders Professorship, established in 1968 as a chair endowed by the alumni, honoring the Rev. Daniel Clarke Sanders, first president of the University. Statement of Purpose THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT The University of Vermont is a community of scholars, and it exists to pro\u00ad mote the survival and enrichment of man and his environment by con\u00ad tributing to the improvement in the quality of life in Vermont and the larger society... broadly conceived to encompass the educational, cultural, social, medical, economic, and technological dimensions of human experience. The University aspires to contribute to the improvement in the quality of human experience and the conservation of the environment through the per\u00ad formance of three broad missions. These include transmission of knowledge and understanding through its education programs; Expansion and organization of knowledge and understanding through research and other creative endeavors; and Dissemination of knowledge and understanding and the application of such knowledge and understanding to solving problems of importance to Vermont, the region, and society at large. Together, these missions comprise the public service role of the Univer\u00ad sity of Vermont and they provide the basis for its general educational goals. The University Libraries In the Guy W. Bailey Library, the main unit of the University Libraries, are located the services and collections relating to the humanities, social sciences, and many of the sciences. This library holds the largest book and map collection in Vermont, and maintains a representative collection of the major periodicals, scholarly journals, indexes, and abstracting services. It is a depository for United States and Canadian government publications. The Special Collections Department includes the Wilbur Collection of Ver- montiana, rare books, literary and historical manuscripts, and the papers of many individuals associated with state and the federal government. Space will nearly double with the completion of the Howe addition to the Bailey INTRODUCTION | 7 Library, expected to open in the fall of 1979. A separate Physics and Chemistry Library is located in the Cook Physical Science Building. Collections in medicine and the health sciences are located in the Dana Medical Library. The University Archives in the Water\u00ad man Building contain the permanent, official records of the University. Conferences and Institutes An increasing number of groups hold educational conferences, institutes and seminars on the campus of the University, which is pleased to cooperate in making its facilities available for this purpose whenever it is possible to do so. Charges are made to cover costs to the Univ ersity. Further information may be obtained through the Office of Conferences and Institutes. VERMONT EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION Vermont Educational Television is the public television network owned and operated by the University of Vermont, serving the state. With studios and offices on the Fort Ethan Allen campus, the network pro\u00ad vides an instructional service to schools, college courses for credit, pro\u00ad grams for children out-of-school, and a broad spectrum of Eastern Educa\u00ad tional Network and Public Broadcasting Service programs for Vermonters. Locally produced programs address the concerns and issues. Programs are broadcast over WETK-TV, channel 33, Burlington; WVTB, channel 20, St. Johnsbury; WVER, channel 28, Rutland; WVTA, channel 41, Windsor; and on channels 74, 76, 79 at Manchester, Wilmington, and Benn\u00ad ington. Student Life STUDENT PERSONNEL SERVICES A STATEMENT OF MISSION antil recently, the student personnel function at most universities was thought to be a function of control of student behavior through rule en\u00ad forcement and strict discipline. As modern universities began to re-evaluate their missions they assessed the total educational experience on their cam\u00ad puses. This led to a concern about the quality of student life on campus and the impact of campus environments on students. Such was the beginning of Student Personnel Services as they are known today. As a result, student personnel educators began to develop programs to meet some specific developmental needs that were common to college age young adults. It should be recognized that students are going through a period of rapid personal growth while on the college campus. In addition to developing new academic skills, they are being challenged to pursue new ideas, evaluate their values systems, change existing attitudes, and investigate new life styles. They are exploring future career options and learning social and in\u00ad terpersonal skills. Therefore, the broad focus of the Student Personnel Services at the University of Vermont is to provide support services to students during this time of intense personal development and intellectual growth, in addition to playing a leadership role in developing experiences, policies, and programs to provide learning and leadership opportunities for students in concert with the formal instructional mission of the institution. To accomplish this mission the student life areas are divided into various functional departments and programs. Each of these provides or coor\u00ad dinates support services and educational experiences to meet student needs. COUNSELING AND TESTING CENTER The Counseling and Testing Center is a human resource center available on a no-fee basis to UVM matriculated students and on a limited basis to faculty and staff. The Center is concerned with increasing the power of in\u00ad dividuals and groups to live more effectively and more confidently through greater understanding of the self, others, and the nature of change. A pro\u00ad fessional staff offers confidential individual and group counseling for a wide range of concerns \u2014 educational, vocational, personal and social. The Center also provides a testing service ranging from vocational testing to na\u00ad tional exams. Also available is an outreach program with a variety of growth experiences; study skills workshops, women's groups, life style plan\u00ad ning, values clarification, and such. Referral to other appropriate specialties such as Psychiatric Services, Reading Center, and Career Plann\u00ad ing and Placement is also a vailable. 146 South Williams Street (802) 656-3340 8 STUDENT LIFE | 9 CAREER PLANNING AND PLACEMENT The Office of Career Planning and Placement is organized to provide all students with comprehensive assistance in exploring and implementing their career objectives. This function consists of two major efforts. The first is to provide direct assistance to students in clarifying career objectives based on their own skills, interests, needs and abilities. The primary em\u00ad phasis is through self- awareness, occupational awareness, skill develop\u00ad ment, and finally entry into the career areas which are complementary to their desired lifestyles. This process is accomplished through one-to-one counseling and/or small group workshops. Along with providing career counseling, students will find the information contained in the Career Resource Library helpful in developing their career goals. The library, which is located within this office, contains literature on various fields, oc\u00ad cupational outlooks,-salary surveys which are updated four times per year, government opportunities at all levels, as well as a variety of literature describing current career opportunities in both large and small corpora\u00ad tions in the private sector. For those students contemplating further graduate study, the library contains two complete guides to all graduate programs in the country and a variety of graduate school catalogues from other universities. This information is expanding and being updated con\u00ad tinuously in the belief that effective choices must be based on current and reliable information. After helping a student to develop some tentative goals the office can assist in his/her attempts to implement these goals. The office has a very ac\u00ad tive on-campus recruiting program which brings local and national employer representatives to campus for employment interviews. All part- time and summer employment opportunities are posted and made available to students attempting to offset a portion of their educational expenses or gain experience in a field of their interest. To assist students in their employment search, the staff will provide help in developing an effective resume, conducting employment interviews, developing a credential file, and assist in drafting an overall employment search program. Students are encouraged to make use of the Office of Career Planning and Placement early in their educational program. Having a goal or direction to his/her education will enable the student to make effective career-related decisions. 109 South Prospect Street (802) 656-3450 FINANCIAL AID In order to be eligible to apply for financial aid you must be a U.S. citizen or in the U.S. for other than a temporary purpose and intend to become a permanent resident. You must also be at least a half-time student enrolled in a degree program. Students enrolled (or planning to enroll) in at least six credit hours, who believe they are unable to meet college expenses, are urged to apply to the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in the form of grants, loans, and employment. Entering undergraduate students who wish to apply for aid may do so by: (1) indicating their intention on the Admissions Application Form, and (2) submitting the Family Financial Statement directly to the American College Testing Program in Iowa City, Iowa. The Family Financial Statement Forms may be obtained from local high 10 I STUDENT LIFE schools or by request to the Office of Financial Aid, 330 Waterman Building, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405. Forms should be submitted to American College Testing no later than March 1. Undergraduates seeking fellowships for graduate study, such as The Dan- forth Graduate Fellowship and The Rhodes Scholarship, should make initial inquiries in the The Dean's Office of The College of Arts and Sciences or in The Office of The Graduate College. ALL STUDENTS REQUESTING AID SHOULD ALSO APPLY TO THE FOLLOWING SOURCES: A. The Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program (BEOG). Check the appropriate section of the Family Financial Statement. B. State Agencies. 1. Vermonters: Vermont residents must apply to the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, 5 Burlington Square, Burlington, VT 05401. 2. Non-Vermonters: The University has very little scholar ship/grant aid for non-resident applicants; thus, aid usually is in the form of long-term loans and/or work-study assistance. Non-residents should explore scholarship opportunities available in their home states and communities. ALL STUDENTS MUST REAPPLY FOR AID EACH YEAR: Continuing students can obtain an Upperclass Financial Aid Application from the Office of Financial Aid. They must also submit the Family Financial State\u00ad ment to the American College Testing Program. Both forms are available early in the Spring semester from the Office of Financial Aid. Preference is given to those students who have complete applications on file by May 1. Applications received after that date will be processed in chronological order according to the date received, subject to the availability of funds. The aid programs administered by the Financial Aid Office fall into the general categories of federal and institutional grants, federal and institu\u00ad tional long-term loans, and the college work-study program. Specifically, the University participates in the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program, the National Direct Student Loan Program, the federal College Work-Study Program, both the Nursing Health Profession Grant and Nurs\u00ad ing Health Profession Loan Program and the Medical Health Profession Loan Program. On the basis of your Financial Aid Application and the finan\u00ad cial information accompanying it, you will be considered automatically for all such programs for which you are eligible. Aid is most often awarded in combinations or \"packages\" of the various types of aid. Almost all awards include some loan or work-study; the application lets you state a preference. Financial aid funds are limited. Accordingly, all assistance offered by the Financial Aid Office is based on a calculated determination of financial need which considers the following factors: 1. STUDENT BUDGET, comprised of tuition, required fees, room and board, books and supplies and moderate personal expenses. 2. EXPECTED PARENTAL SHARE of educational cost as determined by the financial aid application. 3. STUDENT SELF-HELP, usually from earnings or private loans or savings. STUDENT LIFE | 11 4. ASSISTANCE RECEIVED FROM OTHER SOURCES, such as private scholarships/grants, state agency awards, etc. Standard student budgets for the 1978-79 academic year are shown below. Actual costs for subsequent years may be higher if tuition, fees and/or housing increase. In-State SINGLE Out-of-State Tuition Fees Room Board** Personal Books/Supplies Totals 190 Totals $6,420 $8,855 * For dependent children the budget is increased by $800 for each of the first two children, $500 for each additional child. ** Average cost reflects additional allowance for meals above basic plan and is used for both on and off-campus students. The University of Vermont awards financial aid without consideration of sex, race, color or national origin. 330 Waterman Building (802) 656-3156 VETERAN AFFAIRS This office provides support, coordination of services, and advising to any veteran or dependent eligible for benefits under Federal Law, Chapters 31, 34, or 35. Those persons eligible for these benefits should contact the office at least one month prior to registration each semester. Those persons wishing to register for benefits should be prepared to present their cer\u00ad tificate of eligibility to the Veterans Coordinator. It is important that all veterans and dependents keep in contact with this office for the latest information with regard to benefits and requirements. 12 | STUDENT LIFE Also, those students involved in the Veterans Program should contact this office in the event of any change in credit load, dependency status, address, or major. 318 Waterman Building (802) 656-4220 READING CENTER The University Reading Center, located in the Waterman Building, pro\u00ad vides a free program for students who wish to improve their reading, vocabulary and study techniques. Some tutorial services are also available. The first semester classes are open primarily to freshmen whose college en\u00ad trance examinations indicate such a need. However, other students who are in need of improvement are urged to enroll in the reading program. Students who enroll are expected to attend regularly throughout the semester. 406 Waterman Building (802) 656-3838 SPEECH AND HEARING CENTER Services of the Speech and Hearing Center, located in Allen House, are free to students in the University who have problems of speech, language, voice, and hearing: for example, problems of articulation, dialect, stutter\u00ad ing, inefficient voice production, hearing loss, and those problems associated with such conditions as cleft palate and cerebral palsy. Allen House (802) 656-3861 CENTER FOR SERVICE-LEARNING The Center for Service-Learning assists students in participating in in\u00ad ternships and volunteer work as a part of their educational program at the University. The terms \"service\" and \"learning\" have been linked to emphasize that structured learning experiences, meeting personal, career, and academic needs simultaneously, can be developed in the context of a wide variety of community projects and tasks. Students may make significant contributions to an organization or project while deriving important educational value from the process of integrating service and learning. Through service-learning students have worked in education, administra\u00ad tion of justice, social services, health, economic development, environmen\u00ad tal action, governmental, recreation or business settings. Graduate, undergraduate and adult, \"transition\" students have utilized service-learning to achieve their goals. Students often become involved in\u00ad itially as volunteers, either through contract with a sponsoring agency or program or through a student project such as Big Brother/Big Sister, Coun\u00ad cil for Exceptional Children, Adopt-A- Grandparent, Vermont Special Olym\u00ad pics, GYST (Get Your Stuff Together), or coordinate a project as a part of the Student Community in Action (SCIA). SCIA is an organization of student project coordinators, funded by the Student Association, which works in \"partnership\" with CS-L to meet community needs. As volunteers, students gain valuable experience and explore personal and career interests as they perform community tasks. Students may choose to integrate some of their academic and community interests as they select courses and programs that allow for service to be STUDENT LIFE | 13 combined with study. CS-L assists students and faculty in designing ap\u00ad propriate service-learning assignments. The Service-Learning Internship Program is provided for students who want to become involved on a more extensive basis (for example, for a semester or half-time for a year). CS-L assists in project planning and contracting arrangements and provides a seminar for student participants. Interested students may apply for acceptance to the University Year for ACTION Program, which enables students to become totally involved in service-learning, full time, for a year. During the year prior to actual place\u00ad ment, students work with faculty and agencies to plan for involvement in UYA. The UYA Service-Learning design is tailored to meet the unique needs of each participant. During the actual UYA year, students work in agency projects under supervision of program staff while simultaneously fulfilling academic objectives and evaluation requirements with faculty. UYA's also receive a $2,500 stipend to cover living costs. Through the Volunteer program, the Service-Learning Internship Pro\u00ad gram and University Year for ACTION Program, CS-L assists students, faculty and agencies with information, project planning and technical assistance. CS-L also provides transportation, training, publicity, financial and personal support required to achieve student service-learning goals. Mansfield House 25 Colchester Avenue (802) 656-2062 PREMEDICAL/PREDENTAL ADVISING The Premedical/Predental Advising Office, located within the Dean of Students' Offices, exists to provide assistance and support to all students preparing for entry to medical and dental schools. The office provides general counseling, advising and referral services to students with academic and non-academic questions and concerns. Students are encouraged to use the office early in their careers in plann\u00ad ing their undergraduate experience to ensure that specific pre-professional requirements are met and that the background they are obtaining best fulfills their individual educational and personal goals, while simultane\u00ad ously meeting the requirements of medical/dental schools. Also, students not already assigned a premedical/predental academic advisor may request the assignment of an advisor through this office. Information and advice is provided to students who are in the process of applying to medical, dental, and other health professional schools. The Premedical/Predental Advisor works in coordination with the Premedical/ Predental Advisory Committee in preparing student letters of evaluation, as required by the majority of medical, dental, and health professional schools as part of the application process. Materials for registration for the required pre-professional examinations and application services are available. A resource library is also main\u00ad tained for the use of students, containing medical and dental school catalogues and catalogues for professional schools in related health fields, as well as miscellaneous health careers literature. Students are encouraged to explore their personal and career goals through participation in small group discussions organized by this office. 316 Waterman Building (802) 656-3380 14 | STUDENT LIFE Student Activities Participation in student activities is a vital part of any student's educa\u00ad tion at the University. The Student Activities office serves as a resource center for students seeking direction and support for the development of ex\u00ad periences and programs that offer recreation, learning, and leadership op\u00ad portunities. This office totally involves itself in working with students to ver\u00ad balize their needs and interests, determine their own goals and objectives, develop and produce their own programs, and evaluate their own ex\u00ad periences in terms of personal growth and future program direction. This is the kind of participation in university life that students have found to be a vital part of their total education. However, it is left up to the individual to contact the Student Activities Office to take advantage of these op\u00ad portunities. There are approximately 70 student organizations that exist on the UVM campus. These organizations develop out of a unique interest area common to a group of students.

FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES The Greek System is an active and viable part of student life. It has long been acknowledged as an integral part of the social and extracurricular life on campus. The governing body of the system is the Greek Coordinating Council. The GGC performs two vital functions for the collective. It serves as a vehicle for communication be tween houses and assumes responsibility for conveying Greek interests and concerns to the University. The Dean of Students, through the Office of Student Activities, works with fraternities and sororities to accomplish those goals established in the best interest of the Greek and University communities. The houses are private corporations and thus are treated so by the University excepting those situations having a direct effect on the University community as a whole. The Fraternity Managers Association, 656-2066, offers a professional fiscal management service to each of the Greek houses. The office is main\u00ad tained in Billings Center on the balcony level.

Admissions Criteria Qualification for admission is determined on the basis of the secondary school record, rank in graduating class, recommendations, and College En\u00ad trance Examination Board Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement Test results. Each application is carefully reviewed by the Admissions Office staff and in many cases by the College or School to which the student is applying. The candidate's record is thoroughly examined in order to deter\u00ad mine whether the-:student has adequately prepared for the academic pro\u00ad gram of his choice. Sons and daughters of alumni of the University of Vermont are encour\u00ad aged to apply and are given special consideration. Increasing competition means that the University must evaluate the application of each alumni son or daughter in terms of the total number of applications, their relative qualifications, and the limitation which must be placed on the number of applicants who may be offered admission to the various academic programs which are available. 24 ADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY | 25 Most prospective freshmen present at least 16 high school units, in\u00ad cluding a minimum of four years of English, two years of mathematics, two years of a foreign language, two years of science, and two years of social sciences.

In evaluating the secondary school record, careful attention is given to the course load a student has been carrying and any advanced work is given special consideration. A student planning to major in music must arrange for an audition and interview with the chairman of the department prior to the deadline for completion of the application. Interviews and Visits The University differs from a number of other colleges in not requiring a personal interview. Students are encouraged to visit the campus to form their own first-hand impressions about the University.

STUDENT EXPENSES | 35 Bill Adjustment Bills will be adjusted at the end of the drop period and at mid-semester and students will be held liable for the total number of credit hours enrolled in at those times. If a course is dropped after mid-semester, no refund will be made. At the end of the semester, an audit will again be made of each student's enrollment and if the number of courses, taken both for credit or audit, exceeds the number for which the student has been charged, a supplemental bill will be issued. Tuition Refunds CANCELLATIONS Returning students who notify their Academic Dean and the Registrar in writing before the semester begins that they will not be attending the University that semester, will receive a refund. The refund will include all monies paid to the University for that semester. WITHDRAWAL, MEDICAL WITHDRAWAL, SUSPENSION, DISMISSAL, CHANGES IN CREDIT HOUR LOAD A student who withdraws for personal or medical reasons, is suspended, is dis\u00ad missed, or changes enrollment will receive a refund of tuition and fees in accordance with the following schedule: \u2014 If the action occurs prior to the sixteenth day of classes, (end of add/drop period) the student will receive a 100% refund. \u2014 If the action occurs from the sixteenth day of classes through mid-semester (as defined in the Schedule of Courses) the student will receive a 50% refund. \u2014 No refund will be allowed after mid-semester. DEATH In the case of death of a student, tuition and fees paid for the semester during which the death occurs will be fully refunded.

Note: The effective date of any cancellation or withdrawal is the date your Dean/Direc\u00ad tor receives such notification in writing. Only in very extenuating circumstances, your Dean/Director may recommend to the Registrar an exception be made to this refund policy. In no case will a refund be made after the first day of classes of the following semester. All medical withdrawals must be approved by the University Physician. If a student receiving financial aid is eligible for a refund for any of the reasons listed, an appropriate portion of the refund will be returned to each aid source on a pro-rata basis according to the proportion each aid amount is to the student's financial aid budget for the period for which the refund is being made. STUDENTS RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID For students receiving financial aid, change in student status or credit hour load may result in revision or loss of that financial aid, depending on the regulations of the particular aid programs involved; and, except when aid program regulations specify otherwise, any such change which reduces the student's University charges will usually result in a matching reduction of the financial aid award, with that reduction pro-rated among all aid sources making up the award. Such reduction of aid will usually require immediate repayment of the aid so reduced. General Information This section offers a summary of regulations and procedures for registration, change of enrollment, grades and advisement. It also gives a brief explanation of withdrawal, leave of absence, readmission rule, undergraduate degree requirements, and residency rules. The importance of these regulations and procedures cannot be underestimated. REGISTRATION Students in attendance must pre-register for the next semester at the designated time. Unless excused in advance by the dean of the college concerned, students who do not pre-register will be considered as dropped and may apply for readmission after one semester. Specific directions are published for each semester.. Written approval of the student's Dean is required to pre-register for more than 18 credit hours. ACADEMIC ADVISING Effective academic advising involves an established rapport between student and teacher. Accordingly, each new student is assigned to a faculty advisor upon admis\u00ad sion to the University. The student remains under the guidance of this advisor until a major has been selected, usually during the sophomore year at which time a depart\u00ad mental advisor will be assigned. Students with questions about academic planning should consult their advisor throughout the year and especialy during the pre- registration period. To change academic advisors, students should contact the Dean of their college. Each academic unit within the University maintains its own system for advising students. ADVISING RESOURCES In addition to an assigned faculty advisor, there are a variety of other advising resources offices available to University undergraduates. They are: The Academic Advising Center: assists students who are undecided about their academic plans. The Center also helps students with complaints and grievances about course instructions, scheduling, and other academically related problems. Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Advisor: assists undergraduate students with the admis\u00ad sions requirements for dental and medical school. A library of resource materials is maintained which includes literature on alternative health careers, school catalogs, and pre- medical education journals. Pre-Law Advising: the UVM Pre-Law Committee assists students by providing meetings and panel discussions regarding career options in law. Advising also includes specific information on applying to law schools. A current collection of law school catalogs is maintained for interested students. Pre-Veterinary Advising; is available to discuss plans for graduate school and employment in animal science career areas. A selection of catalogs, pamphlets, and other related literature is maintained. International Students and Scholars Advising: verifies immigration status, interprets immigration laws and immigration forms to foreign students, faculty, and scholars. American students planning to study abroad should also make their plans through this office. Minority Student Advising: is an effort to meet the needs of students entering the University who demonstrate that additional support services are needed. Incoming freshman minority students may elect to take part in a \"Summer Enrichment Pro\u00ad gram\" held on campus for a month (3 credits). Career Planning and Placement: assists students who are exploring a variety of potential career options early in their academic careers. A library of career informa\u00ad 36 GENERAL INFORMATION | 37 tion and school catalogs is maintained. Veterans Affairs Advising: advises students of their G.I. Bill benefits in educations. Counseling and referral on academic matters are available to veterans. CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT A student may add courses during the first three weeks of classes and may drop courses without academic penalty during the first three weeks of classes. After the first week of classes, the instructor may refuse to allow the add if certain material may not be made up and the loss of this work would seriously affect the quality of educa\u00ad tional experience gained by the student in the course. Courses dropped after the third week (except if the student is enrolled by administrative error) will be included in the student's record on a \"Withdrawn passing\" or \"Withdrawn failing\" basis. Change of enrollment forms and complete details may be obtained from the Registrar's Office. PASS \u2014NO PASS PASS \u2014 NO PASS course enrollments were approved by the University Senate for implementation in September, 1968. The action was taken in two parts: FIRST, that any degree program student, not on academic trial, be permitted to take as many as six courses (three courses for two year students; or as many courses as he has semesters remaining for future transfer students) during his undergraduate career on a pass-no pass basis, beginning in his sophomore year (second semester of his/her first year for two year students). These courses may not include any required by the student's major department, either for the major or for the degree. Only free electives (without condition) may be taken as pass-no pass. This option may not be used for electives within the distribution requirements of a college or department. Students who have enrolled in ineligible distribution elective courses on a pass-no pass basis prior to September 1,1974, shall not be penalized. The student must complete all work normally required in these courses and he will receive full credit toward graduation for passing them. The instructor will NOT be informed of the student's status and the Registrar will record grades of \"D\" or higher as PASS and grades of \"F\" as NO PASS. Neither \"P\" nor \"NP\" grades will affect the student's grade- point average. SECOND, that the following addition was approved by the Faculty Senate in January, 1974: \"Physical education (activity) courses, whether taken to fulfill a re\u00ad quirement or as electives, will be available to students on a pass- no pass basis and shall not be counted as part of the six (6) standard courses described above.\" Procedure \u2014 1. Obtain a PASS \u2014 NO PASS Request Form from the Registrar's Office and consult your academic advisor. 2. Obtain your advisor's endorsement that the request conforms to the policy established by the University Senate. Any question about a course or courses being appropriately elected as pass-no pass for a student will be resolved by the student's college dean. 3. Submit your request to be placed on pass-no pass status at the Registrar's Office during the first week of the semester. Requests to be removed from that status must be filed during the same period. Note: Non-degree students cannot take courses on pass-no pass basis. AUDITING COURSES With the approval of the Dean and the instructor concerned, a regularly enrolled student carrying a normal program may audit a course. Others who do not wish to receive credit, or who have not met admission requirements, may also register as auditors. Auditors have no claim on the time or service of the instructor and no grade credit is given for the work. Tuition is charged at the applicable rate. Under no cir\u00ad cumstances will a change be made after the enrollment period to allow credit for courses audited. 38 | GENERAL INFORMATION The approval of the Director of Evening Division and Summer Session is necessary for auditing courses in those divisions. REPEATED COURSES A student who repeats a course loses any previous credit on record for that course. The previous grade remains on the student's permanent academic record and is in\u00ad cluded in computing his cumulative grade average. ATTENDANCE Class Attendance \u2014 Every student is expected to attend all regularly scheduled classes. This is a major responsibility of the student toward himself and toward the University. The primary penalty for non-attendance lies in the student's lessened grasp of the subject matter of the course. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor regarding reason for absence from class. Absence from Classes \u2014 Each department is to inform all students in its classes at the beginning of each semester of its policy for handling absences and the penalties that may be imposed. Failure to do any work for which a grade is given, if due to unexcused absence, may result in a failing grade for that particular work. TARDINESS A student not present at the beginning of an exercise may be marked absent. RIGHT OF APPEAL Any student who believes that he has been unfairly treated in regard to absences may appeal to his Academic Dean. PRIORITY OF UNIVERSITY EXERCISES University academic responsibilities have priority over other campus events. Atten\u00ad dance at: 1. regularly scheduled classes has priority over special scheduled common hour examinations. 2. common hour examinations has priority over attendance at other activities. FINAL EXAMINATIONS REGULATIONS 1. The examination period at the end of each semester is set by the official Univer\u00ad sity calendar. 2. Semester examinations shall be given only during the regular examination period except by permission of the Dean of the college on request of the chairman of the department. No examinations shall be given during the last week of the semester except lab exams given in courses with specific lab sections. 3. The time and place of each final examinations are determined by the Registrar and a schedule is circulated and posted. Any change in the scheduled time or place may be requested by the chairman of the department concerned, when con\u00ad ditions seem to warrant such special arrangement. Decision on such requests rests with the Registrar. 4. In every course in which a final examination is given, every student shall take the examination unless excused by the instructor. 5. A student who is absent from a final examination for any reason must report that fact and the reason, in person or in writing, to his instructor within twenty-four hours. If the absence is due to any situation beyond the reasonable control of the student, (e.g., illness or family tragedy) the instructor must provide the student with the opportunity to complete the course requirements. At the instructor's discretion, this may be an examination or some other suitable project. The in\u00ad structor may require evidence in support of the student's reason for absence. GENERAL INFORMATION | 39 6. If the absence is not reported as provided above, or is not excused by the instruc\u00ad tor, the examination is regarded as failed. GRADES Grades are reported and recorded as letter grades. Averages are calculated from quality point equivalents. A Excellent 4 points per semester hour B Good 3 points per semester hour C Fair 2 points per semester hour D Poor 1 point per semester hour F Failure 0 points per semester hour Other grades are: AU Audit. Inc. Incomplete. This grade applies to work of acceptable quality when the full amount is not completed because of illness or emergency. It can be awarded only with the permission of the student's college Dean. The Dean may set the limit of time when the work of the course is to be completed. In no case shall this time be set longer than the beginning of the corresponding semester of the next academic year. XC Extended Course. This grade is awarded at the end of the semester to a student who is enrolled in an identified course, the nature of which makes it unreasonable or impossible for the student to complete the required work within the regular semester. NP Not Passed, not used in grade point average computation. p Passed, not used in grade point average computation. WP Withdrawn, passing, not used in grade point average computation. WF Withdrawn, failing. This grade is weighted as an \"F\" in the computation of the grade point average. M Missing \u2014 Grade not turned in by the Instructor. CLASS STANDING The designation of a student's class shall be determined by the number of credits completed. The divisions are as follows: Freshman 0 \u2014 29.9 credit hours Sophomore 30.0 \u2014 59.9 credit hours Junior 60.0 \u2014 89.9 credit hours Senior 90.0 and over credit hours TRANSCRIPTS Currently enrolled, as well as former undergraduate and graduate students, may ob\u00ad tain an official transcript of their permanent academic record by writing or telephon\u00ad ing the Office of the Registrar, 363 Waterman Building (802) 656-2045. The charge is $2 for each transcript. Please allow a minimum of one week for normal processing, and three weeks follow\u00ad ing the end of a semester. The University reserves the right to withhold registration material and all informa\u00ad tion regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of fees or other charges, including student loans and dining and housing charges. ACCESS TO RECORDS Students have the right to review any of their educational records maintained by the University. Students also have the right to have all educational records maintained in a confidential manner. In appropriate situations, students may choose to waive some or all of these protections, but such waivers must be clearly stated in writing. If a student feels an educational record to be misleading, or containing information which is inac\u00ad curate, a hearing may be scheduled to seek appropriate modification. Requests for review of records should be made to the Registrar. 40 | GENERAL INFORMATION HONORS The Bachelor's and Associate's degrees may be conferred with honors, by vote of the Senate, in recognition of general high standing in scholarship. Three grades are distinguished and indicated by inscribing on the diploma the words cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude. Honors are determined in the following manner: Within the graduating class of each college or school, students in the top one percent will receive summa cum laude; the following three percent will receive magna cum laude; the next six percent will receive cum laude. The total number of honors awarded will not exceed ten percent of the graduating class of each school or college. Honors will be calculated on all grades received at this university. In order to be eligible for consideration, a student must have taken at least sixty hours (thirty hours for two year programs) at this university in which a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F has been awarded. DEAN'S LIST The deans of the undergraduate colleges publish at the beginning of each semester the names of those full-time students who stood in the top 20% of each class of their college during the preceding semester. Full-time enrollment in this case shall amount to a minimum of twelve-credit hours in courses in which grades of A, B, C, D or F have been given. STUDENT LEAVE OF ABSENCE POLICY A leave of absence means that a Student who is eligible for continued enrollment ceases to be enrolled while in good standing and is guaranteed readmission. This policy benefits both the student and the University, in that it enables a student to plan on readmission to the University and allows the University, by having records on the expected date of return of its students, to refine further the planning of the size of the student body. The following statements further define a leave of absence: a. Upon application to his or her academic Dean a student may be granted a leave of absence by that Dean when that application merits the commitment of the Univer\u00ad sity to insure the student's readmission. b. A leave of absence must be granted for a finite period of time. c. A leave of absence normally may not exceed four semesters. d. A leave of absence normally may not be granted for the current semester after the day on which courses can be dropped without penalty. e. A leave of absence may not be granted to students currently on academic trial or disciplinary probation. f. A leave of absence is distinct from withdrawing for medical reasons and is not granted for medical reasons. g. A leave of absence does not guarantee housing upon the student's return. h. A leave of absence guarantees readmission to the student's college in the Univer\u00ad sity, if the student confirms his or her intent to return by the closing date for a nor\u00ad mal readmission application (October 31 and March 31 preceding the appropriate semester). i. While on a leave of absence, an individual's student status is temporarily ter\u00ad minated. A leave of absence guarantees an individual's readmission only if he or she takes the appropriate action. j. Financial aid awarded but not used prior to a leave of absence will not be carried over. Reapplication for aid for the readmission period must be made according to normal Office of Financial Aid policies and procedures applicable to that period. k. A leave of absence should be confirmed by the appropriate form signed by both the student and the Dean of the college involved. WITHDRAWAL A student who wishes to withdraw from college must first notify his academic Dean in person or in writing. GENERAL INFORMATION | 41 READM1SSION Any degree student who has left school for one semester or more must write to their write to his/her Dean's office to request readmission. Students must apply for readmis- sion by October 31 or March 31 preceding the appropriate semester of return. LOW SCHOLARSHIP The information below describes the general University regulations for low scholar\u00ad ship standing. The Studies Committee of each college may determine additional or sup\u00ad plementary requirements. Students with questions regarding their academic standing should consult with their college Dean. 1. \"On Trial\" \u2014 a. \"On trial\" is an intermediate status between good standing and dismissal. The student remains enrolled according to stated academic conditions of his/her college. b. A student is placed \"on trial\" by the Dean or the designated committee of the col\u00ad lege concerned. Special academic conditions may be set in each case. Normally the period of' 'trial'' status is one semester. c. The circumstances under which a student is placed \"on trial\" are as follows: (1) Any student who is readmitted to the University after having been dismissed for low scholarship re-enters \"on trial.\" (2) Generally a student is placed \"on trial\" if in any semester he has failed half or more of the hours of his enrollment but has been permitted to continue in college. (3) A student whose record has been consistently below the graduating average or generally unsatisfactory in any semester may be placed \"on trial\" or con\u00ad tinued \"on trial\" even though he/she does not come within the provisions of Section (2). d. A student who has earned fewer than thirty semester hours of credit and is \"on trial\" is barred from participation in all athletic and other student activities. 2. Separation \u2014 a. A student is dismissed from the University if he/she receives grades below pass\u00ad ing in one-half or more of the semester hours of his enrollment in any semester unless he/she is allowed to continue by action of the designated committee. b. A student who fails to meet the condition of his trial or whose record has been un\u00ad satisfactory and consistently below the graduation average may be dismissed for low scholarship even though he/she does not come within the provision above. c. A student dismissed for low scholarship must address his/her application for readmission to the college taking the action. d. Any student dismissed for academic or disciplinary reasons must receive written approval from his/her previous Academic Dean [or the Dean of Students for disciplinary cases) before enrolling in any University course. INTERCOLLEGE TRANSFERS A student who is or has been a member of any college of this University may transfer to another college of the University only with the consent of the Deans of the two col\u00ad leges concerned. In the case of veterans receiving educational benefits through the Veterans Administration, the change must also be approved by the advisor to veterans in the Dean of Students Office. UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the colleges and specific re\u00ad quirements will be found in the sections devoted to the respective colleges. In addition to the course requirements of the curricula, students must also fulfill the general requirements in physical education. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a cumulative average sufficient to meet the minimum requirements for the college in which the student is 42 | GENERAL INFORMATION officially enrolled. Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are excluded in com\u00ad puting this average. Every candidate for a degree is required to have taken 30 of the last 42 semester hours of credit (15 of the last 21 for two year students) in residence at the University except that those who have completed three years of premedical study in the Univer\u00ad sity are awarded their degrees after successful completion of one year of study in any approved college of medicine. Other exceptions to this rule may be made only on recommendation of the Academic Council and in cases of undue hardship. To qualify for a second bachelor's degree the candidate must have fulfilled all the requirements for the degree and must have taken a full year of work, usually thirty hours, in addition to that taken to qualify for the first degree. PHYSICAL EDUCATION One year of physical education, normally completed during the freshman or sophomore years, is required of all undergraduate students in four-year programs. The two credits earned in activities classes will be included in the total number of hours required for graduation. Students may opt to take activities classes on a pass-no pass basis. (For further details see the pass- no pass heading under General Informa\u00ad tion). Medical examinations are required of all new students. Those with serious defects may be given restricted work or may be excused by the Director of Student Health. The Physical Education requirement for students pursuing two-year degree programs shall be one credit of course work earned in activities instruction. Students twenty-five years of age or older are exempt from physical education re\u00ad quirements. UNIVERSITY RESPONSIBILITY Many courses involve instruction in and the use of various types of power equip\u00ad ment, laboratory apparatus, and specialized facilities. The University takes every precaution to provide competent instruction and supervision of such courses. It is ex\u00ad pected that students will cooperate by following instructions and exercising precau\u00ad tion. In case an accident does occur resulting in personal injury, the University can assume no responsibility except for medical care that is provided by the Student Health Service. USE OF ENGLISH Correct English usage is demanded by all departments of the University. Written work of any kind which is unsatisfactory in manuscript form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, or effectiveness of expression may be penalized, regardless of contents. Students whose written work falls below the standard of correct usage may be re\u00ad ferred to the English department for additional instruction, even though the freshman course in English has been passed. Before they may be admitted to the University, foreign students must offer evidence that they are capable of reading and writing English on the college level. STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE Through an arrangement with a commercial insurance company, students are able to procure a student health insurance policy. Married students may procure coverage for their spouse and children. Further details may be obtained from the Infirmary. POLICY STATEMENT ON DISCRIMINATION It is the policy of the University of Vermont not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origins, sex or handicap. Students who feel they have been discriminated against, or wish to obtain additional information, should contact the Dean of Students or the Assistant to the President for Human Resources. GENERAL INFORMATION | 43 ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE The University expects each student to maintain high standards of personal conduct and social responsibility at all times both on and off campus. All students, as respon\u00ad sible citizens, are required to observe and to share in the support of all local, state and federal regulations. Any student who fails to uphold these standards is subject to disciplinary action by the University. The disciplinary authority of the University is vested in the President. In such cases as he considers proper, this authority may be delegated to the several Deans and to appropriate judicial bodies. The continuance of each student at the University, the receipt by him of academic credits, his graduation and the conferring of any degree or the granting of any certificate are strictly subject to the disciplinary powers of the University. The University is free to cancel his registration at any time on any grounds, if it considers such action to be for the welfare of the institution. University policy on the above matters is explained in detail in \"The Cat's Tale.\" Each student is held responsible for knowledge and observance of these rules and regulations. UNIVERSITY RESIDENCY REGULATIONS The Vermont Legislature has established a lower rate of tuition for students who are Vermont residents. Such a policy appears to have as its objective the attempt to more evenly distribute the cost of operating and supporting the University of Vermont be\u00ad tween Vermont residents whose taxes have previously supported the University and non-residents who have not done so. The Legislature has stated that enrollment at an institution for higher learning or presence within the state for purposes of attending an institution of higher learning shall not constitute residence for tuition purposes. IN-STATE STATUS REGULATIONS Adopted by the Board of Trustees December 14,1974 The following requirements must be met by a student prior to being granted resident status for the purpose of admission, tuition and other University charges: 1. The applicant shall be domiciled in Vermont, said domicile having been con\u00ad tinuous for one year prior to the date of application for a change in residency status. Changes in residency status shall become effective for the semester following the date of application. 2. Domicile shall mean a person's true, fixed and permanent home, to which he in\u00ad tends to return after absence. A residence established for the purpose of attend\u00ad ing an educational institution or qualifying for resident status for tuition purposes shall not of itself constitute domicile. Domicile shall not be determined by the applicant's marital status. 3. The applicant must demonstrate such attachment to the community as would be typical of a permanent resident of his age and education, 4. Receipt of financial support from the applicant's family will create a rebuttable presumption that the applicant's domicile is with his family. 5. An applicant becoming a student at an institution of higher learning in Vermont within one year of first moving to the state shall have created a rebuttable presumption of residence in Vermont for the purpose of attending an educational institution. 6. A student who is eligible for tuition purposes to enroll as a resident student in another state shall not be enrolled as a \"Vermont Resident.\" 7. A student enrolling at the University of Vermont shall be classified by the appropriate admissions officer (Director of Admissions, Dean of the Graduate College, Associate Dean of the College of Medicine) as a resident or non-resident for admission and tuition purposes. The decision by. the officer shall be based upon information furnished by the student and other relevant information. The 44 | GENERAL INFORMATION officer is authorized to require such written documents, affidavits, verifications or other evidence as he deems necessary. 8. The burden of proof shall in all cases rest upon the student claiming to be a Ver\u00ad mont resident and shall be met upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence. 9. The decision of the admissions officer on the classification of a student as a resi\u00ad dent or non-resident may be appealed in writing to the Committee on Residence whose decision shall be final. The College of Agriculture Agricultural Economics Agricultural Engineering Technology Animal Science Biochemical Science Biological Science Botany \u2014 Agriculture Dairy T echnology Environmental Studies General Studies Occupational & Extension Education Plant and Soil Science Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor Bachelor of Science of Science of Science of Science of Science of Science of Science of Science of Science of Science of Science The College of Agriculture performs four public functions: it teaches resident students, investigates problems, brings information to the peo\u00ad ple, and performs related services. These four areas of work are performed by the resident instruction division, the research division (Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station), the extension division (Vermont Cooperative Extension Service), and the Related Services Division. The curricula of the resident instruction division prepare students for professional careers. Upon receiving the bachelor's degree, students usually enter management, specialized services, education, or research \u2014 all these in areas related to agriculture, basic biological sciences, conserva\u00ad tion, and international service. The evolution of society necessitates continual progress and change. Thus the challenge of preparing students to excel now, yet adjust to future changes, is being met through programs designed to give a foundation both in the social sciences and the humanities plus a fundamental technical education. All programs in the College of Agriculture leading to the Bachelor of Science degree require 120 semester hours of prescribed and elective courses, plus two credit hours in physical education. The normal semester program includes fifteen to eighteen credit hours of courses. In each area of study certain courses are prescribed, with allowance made for the election of additional courses, to provide a well-balanced and integrated educational program and to insure reasonable concentration. Faculty advisers counsel students in the selection of elective courses and educational problems. PROGRAMS OF STUDY The College of Agriculture awards the degree of Bachelor of Science in each of the following programs: Agricultural Economics Botany Agricultural Engineering Dairy Technology Technology Environmental Studies Animal Sciences General Studies Biochemical Science Occupational and Extension Biological Science Education Plant and Soil Science 45 46 | COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE The programs are broad and flexible, with sufficient areas of concentration and electives to meet the specific needs and desires of the student. Therefore, responsible departmental advising is important in the development of each student's program. Every candidate for a degree, in consultation with his/her advisor, must choose one of the above programs upon entering the college. The candidate must then fulfill the re\u00ad quirements stated below. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS A. The successful completion of a minimum of 120 credit hours of course work plus two credit hours in physical education. B. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 (This is an increase from 1.70 and applies to all students admitted for Fall 1978 semester (Class of 1980 or new transfers). Students admitted prior to Fall 1978 are still under 1.70 minimum.) C. The successful completion of at least two courses in each of the following areas: 1. Writing, communication and public address 2. Science, mathematics and statistics 3. Fine arts, philosophy, language and literature 4. Social sciences a D. Courses as specified in individual programs. Applicability of courses to specific areas will rest with the advisor and if necessary, with the concurrence of the dean of the coEege. lt is further recommended that courses chosen to fulfill these requirements be taken outside the department in which the stu\u00ad dent's program of study is located. Students desiring to complete teacher education programs and teacher certification must enroll in appropriate courses in the College of Education and Social Services (see College of Education and Social Services Advisor \u2014 306 Waterman). PREPROFESSIONAL PREPARATION Students who are striving for admission to professional colleges such as dentistry, medicine and veterinary medicine can meet the undergraduate requirements for these programs through enrollment in the College of Agriculture. Those interested in human medical sciences usually enroll in biological sciences while individuals interested in veterinary medicine usually enroll in either animal sciences or biological sciences. Any student indicating a specific professional interest will be assigned a faculty advisor knowledgeable in that area. Competition for places in professional schools is very keen and a superior academic record throughout an undergraduate program is necessary to receive consideration * for admission. Due to this intense competition, all potential candidates are encouraged to also complete the requirements in an area of secondary interest. Students applying to the College of Agriculture, and expressing an interest in medicine or preveterinary medicine, should present evidence of high performance in high school level science and math courses, plus additional supporting documentation such as high SAT scores and strong letters of recommendation. BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES CORE Students initially interested in the broad area of biological sciences may enroll in this core curriculum for the freshman and sophomore years. The curriculum is designed to permit students to continue in basic biology or to transfer to one of the applied biology programs. In addition to the general college requirements listed, students should complete during the first two years the following courses or their equivalents: Biology 1, 2 or Zoology 9 and Botany 4; Math 19, 20 or Math 21; Chem 3, 16 or Chem 1, 2 and 16 or Chem 1, 2 and 131,132; Microbiology and Biochemistry 55 (Microbiology).

Animal Sciences Each student majoring in programs offered with this department shall successfully complete a minimum of eight semester courses in Animal Science, including at least five of advanced standing. Additional courses must be selected in consultation with the departmental advisers in order that the selected program can be individualized to more nearly meet the professional aims and goals of the student. DAIRY TECHNOLOGY This program has been designed to provide the scientific, technical, and practical instruction necessary to prepare the graduate for the numerous positions available in the dairy and food science field. The students who elect to place greater emphasis on the scientific aspect of Dairy Technology will find that they are prepared to work in quality control, research laboratories, and to do graduate study in dairy and food chemistry or bacteriology. The student who desires to place greater emphasis on business and the social sciences may become qualified for numerous supervisory and management positions in the dairy and food industry. BASIC ANIMAL SCIENCE This program has been designed specifically for those individuals who are interested in careers in industrial research and development or university positions. The students who elect this program will be provided with the strong science background that is necessary for advanced study in such areas as physiology, nutrition, genetics, and related biological fields. ANIMAL TECHNOLOGY This program provides formal training in the theories and practices of the animal sciences with special emphasis on management and technical competence. It prepares the student for employment as a farm owner, manager, or field work with state and federal extension services, breed associations, hatcheries, farm organizations, and various commercial companies. ANIMAL INDUSTRY This program is primarily for those students who are in\u00ad terested in business. It prepares them for supervisory and management positions in in\u00ad dustries related to Animal Science, such as those involved with the processing and sales of dairy, meat and poultry products; feed and fertilizer companies; farm equip\u00ad ment and supply agencies; advertising and public relations; and other areas of public service. Biological Science This program is designed to provide flexibility in developing a background in biological sciences. Students may fulfill their course requirements by selecting basic and applied courses from the several biologically oriented departments (Animal Science, Botany, Microbiology and Biochemistry, Plant and Soil Science, Zoology, and others). Graduates of the program may continue their education in graduate school or pro\u00ad fessional schools or they may obtain employment in a variety of areas. Possible job opportunities would include basic and applied research in educational institutions and 50 | COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE governmental agencies, technical writing, employment with environmental con\u00ad sultants, etc. The following courses are required of all students in the Biological Science program following completion of the core requirements: genetics (one semester), biochemistry (one semester), physics (two semester sequence), and statistics (one semester). In addi\u00ad tion, all students must take six additional courses in basic or applied biology. These courses should be selected to include at least one course in botany or applied plant science, one course in zoology or applied animal science, one course in the area of evolution and diversity of life, one course in ecology, and two courses in physiology or biochemistry. Of these, at least one or more courses at the 200 level should be in\u00ad cluded. These courses are selected in consultation with the adviser from the diverse offerings of the various colleges and departments. Botany Students in the Colleges of Agriculture or Arts and Sciences may major in Botany. Each undergraduate plans a program in consultation with a personal departmental ad\u00ad viser. The emphasis on flexibility permits a choice of electives when planning for each individual's career. Cross-disciplinary study is encouraged as Botany, a fundamental science, is the base upon which education, research, and careers in both applied and basic plant science is built. Many students aim specifically for careers that do not re\u00ad quire formal education beyond the Bachelor's degree, e.g., preparation for numerous positions in: agriculture, business, education, administration, government, industry, medicine, research, or their own businesses. Many other students prepare themselves for graduate education and professional careers requiring advanced degrees, e.g., careers in botany, biology, medicine, dentistry, agriculture, biochemistry, or en\u00ad vironmental sciences. In either case, close attention is given to increasing the student's choices after college. Students are also encouraged in their senior year to enrich their botanical experience through individualized, original research and study with faculty members. Areas of interest include: anatomy, cell botany, cytology, ecology, phycology, physiology, plant development, plant pathology, and taxonomy. Required course: Mathematics 21, 21; or Mathematics 21 and Statistics; or Mathematics 19, 20, and Statistics, Physics 15, 16; Chemistry 16 or preferably 131, 132; Biology 1, 2; Botany 101, 104, 107, 108, and 109 or 160; two additional semester courses in Botany, one at the 200 level.

Students may peti\u00ad tion the department to substitute other courses for certain requirements in the plan\u00ad ning of individual programs. Environmental Studies The College of Agriculture participates in the interdisciplinary University En\u00ad vironmental Program as described on page 123. Most students select the Coordinate Major Program and fulfill the requirements in one of the major programs available in the College. General Studies This program is designed for students seeking a general rather than a specialized knowledge in the field of agriculture and related subjects. Through the proper selec\u00ad tion of electives, a student may choose an area of concentration within the college and also select courses that contribute to a liberal education. Required: In addition to the basic College requirements each student must satisfac\u00ad torily complete forty credit hours in the College of Agriculture, twenty of which must COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE | 51 be at the 100 level or above. All additional courses must be selected in consultation with and have the approval of the student's advisor. Microbiology and Biochemistry BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCE Contemporary biology increasingly demands knowledge of events at the molecular level. Students who plan a career of research or teaching in biology are well-advised to concentrate on the principles and methods of biochemistry during their undergraduate years. To this end the program in \"Biochemical Science\" provides a coordinated sequence of study in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry. Depending on the student's future plans and capability, three areas of concentration are possible: (1} Cellular Biochemistry which emphasizes the physiological and metabolic reactions of organisms; (2) Molecular Biology which focuses on the chemical and physical structures of subcellular particles; and (3) Nutritional Biochemistry which emphasizes the synthesis and utilization of nutrients. Specialization in one of these concentrations normally commences in the Junior Year after completion of the Biological Sciences Core (p. 46). Students are required to complete a minimum of three hours of physical chemistry (or eight hours for the Molecular Biology option), twelve hours of biochemistry and three advanced biology courses, two of which would be in their specialty (e.g., Nutrition, Physiology, Genetics, etc.). Plant and Soil Science The Plant and Soil Science program is designed for students interested in hor\u00ad ticultural crops, agronomic crops, soils, and insect pest management as they relate to the science of food, feed, and fiber production or to recreation and the environment. The program is flexible and allows students to place their primary emphasis in either science or agri-business. Suggested groupings of courses have been developed by the department to be used as guides for students interested in General Plant and Soil Science, Soil Science, Plant Science, Ornamental Horticulture and Landscape Design, Horticultural Therapy, and Insect Pest Management. Specific courses, in addition to the core courses, are worked out between the student and the advisor. All students majoring in Plant and Soil Science must take Principles of Plant Science, Introductory Soil Science, Plant and Soil Career Orientation, Soil Fertility and Management, one semester of Seminar, two semesters of Chemistry (one semester of inorganic and one semester of organic), one semester of Mathematics or Statistics, Plant Pathology, and Insect Pest Management. A minimum of 6 additional courses in Plant and Soil Science at the 100 level or above are required, to be selected in the stu\u00ad dent's area of interest and approved by his or her advisor. Courses in related areas may be substituted for one or two of these 6 courses with the consent of the student's advisor.

The overall mission of the College of Arts and Sciences is to provide the highest possible caliber of undergraduate general education in the liberal arts and sciences. This ranges from the utilization of intellectual tools and skills (articulative, quantitative, scientific and creative) to the theoretical 54 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 55 exploration of man and his natural, social and cultural environment. It is accomplished through critical analysis, which the educated mind is trained to bring to bear upon that environment and interrelationships among elements of the environment and student's years on campus and thereafter. The core missions are: \u2014 To provide opportunities for undergraduates to concentrate in specific disciplinary approaches (i.e., majors), which may lead to pre-professional preparation, graduate studies, general education as a citizen who con\u00ad tributes to rather than draws upon the society, or a combination of these. \u2014 To provide through distribution requirements an awareness of how the diverse intellectual, cultural and creative aspects of the liberal arts and sciences approach the study of man and his environment: The humanities, through the study of the great individual creative geniuses of mankind, past and present, in literature, the arts and philosophy. The performing arts, by providing opportunities for self expression through active participation in fields such as music, art, theatre and creative writing. The social sciences, through their focus upon the human experience and behavior, individual and collective, via the application of analytical methods and their concern with the human species and its relationships with the various environments evolved through time, and with the diversity of the human conditions at any time. The natural sciences, through an understanding of the order of nature, the organization of the universe from the microcosm to the macrocosm, their relationship to man and his powers of observation, imagination, ratiocination and consequent understanding and appreciation of the scope, logic, precision and limitations of scientific methods, principles and challenges. \u2014 Further, to provide graduate training in selected areas in which local, regional or national needs coincide with and complement strengths of par\u00ad ticular undergraduate departments or programs, as well as in selected areas where our position as an institution of higher learning benefits in\u00ad tellectually and educationally from the presence of more specialized, rigorous and advanced study for the further development of educated mind. \u2014 To carry out quality scholarly activity and research as a continuing con\u00ad tribution to the world's knowledge and understanding of humanity and the universe. As a necessary prerequisite to the maintenance of the intellectual competence required of a faculty providing an environment for mutual in\u00ad tellectual stimulation, curiosity, and growth. It must be emphasized that the integrity of the whole College effort re\u00ad quires the continued emphasis on the excellence of each of the missions above.

Of the minimum 122 credits, Bachelor of Arts candidates may take no more than 45 credits in the major, and Bachelor of Science candidates may take no more than 50 in the major. The College of Arts and Sciences offers students, whose needs and interests are not met by currently offered major programs, the opportunity to initiate an in\u00ad dividually designed, non-departmental major. Students wisfiing to pursue this option should contact the Dean's Office, and will need to secure approval from the Committee on Honors and Individual Studies. Students may elect more than one major by consulting the Dean's Office, and the departments involved. By the date of graduation, the student must complete the major requirements of each department, although courses taken to satisfy the related field requirement may overlap when deemed appropriate. For specific major requirements, see the foEowing pages. IV. ELECTIVES Students will select elective courses in consideration of the foEowing limitations. Courses offered by other coEeges or schools at the University may be taken by Arts and Sciences students, but only 24 hours of such credit may be applied to the minimum 122 required. Courses offered by other coEeges or schools at the Univer\u00ad sity by departments which offer majors in the CoEege of Arts and Sciences, are excepted from the 24 credit Emitation. (At present, these include courses in Botany, Mathematics, and the Environmental Program.) MILITARY STUDIES courses may be taken by students in the CoEege of Arts and Sciences, but only 8 such credits may be appUed to the minimum 122 required. Military Studies credits wiE be counted as outside of the CoEege of Arts and Sciences. In general, the CoEege does not grant credit for Military Service. PHYSICAL EDUCATION courses, beyond the two required of aE students, may be taken as elective degree credit, and wiE be counted as outside of the CoEege of Arts and Sciences. READINGS AND RESEARCH or independent study credits, may be elected in any field including the major discipline.

V. TRANSFER Students wishing to transfer to the CoEege of Arts and Sciences from another col\u00ad lege or school at the University must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.50 or better. Applications may be filed in the Dean's Office, and wiE be acted upon at 58 | COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES the end of each term. All students receiving a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences must earn 30 of the last 42 credits in the College, therefore, students wishing to transfer should make application by no later than the end of the junior year. Transfer students from other institutions should note that 30 of the last 42 credits, and one half of the major credits must be earned at the University of Vermont, and as a student in the College of Arts and Sciences. Although the physical education re\u00ad quirement may be waived for transfer students, the minimum required number of credits remains 122. Transfer credit will be initially evaluated by the Registrar, although judgment as to the applicability of credit toward satisfaction of degree re\u00ad quirements rests with the Dean's Office, and the chairman of the major department. Transfer credit from other institutions is not used in the calculation of the University of Vermont grade point average. VI. SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING CREDIT Credit will not be given for the following combinations: Biology 1, 2 and Biology 3 Biology 1, 2 and Botany 4 Chemistry 1, 2 and Chemistry 11,12 Chemistry 1, 2 and Chemistry 3,4 Chemistry 141,142 and Chemistry 140 Mathematics 2 and Mathematics 10 Mathematics 9 and Mathematics 10 Mathematics 19 and Mathematics 21 Mathematics 20 and Mathematics 21 Music 5 and Music 9 Music 1, 2 and Music 10 Physics 11,12 and Physics 15,16 Zoology 5,6 and Zoology 104 Zoology 9 and Zoology 5,6 or Biology 1,2 Zoology 104 and Anatomy 9 and/or Physiology 10 VII.

Every student must take at least three courses in other disciplines related to anthropology. Consult the Department on this last point. AREA AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Entering students are invited to consider the option of concentrating in Area & International Studies. Courses in several academic disciplines can be combined so as to focus on a particular area of the world, thus providing an opportunity to test generalizations against the particular reality of a geographical area and its people. Undergraduates who major in Area Studies usually accumulate sufficient credit to enable them to also fulfill department requirements in one of the social sciences, humanities, or foreign languages. The four areas presently available for concentraiton are: CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, RUSSIA/EAST EUROPE, EUROPE (Western, Northern, Mediterranean). Courses in ASIAN Area Studies are available to interested students as indicated on the foEowing page. However, they are not currently being offered as a major field of concentration. This relatively novel method of undergraduate education combines exposure to the traditional disciplines with integrative knowledge and appreciation of a foreign culture and thus combines the broad liberal arts education with a more specific area competence. Students who plan on majoring in Area Studies should take during their freshman and/or sophomore years the required foreign language courses of the selected area, as weU as humanities, which are beginning courses in the social sciences and humanities which are prerequisites of subsequent required courses and do also meet the general distribution requirements. Students interested in concentrating in Area Studies are urged to contact the Direc\u00ad tor, Area & International Studies, Extension 4062. Specific requirements of the individual programs (with the exception of ASIAN) are as foEows: ASIAN STUDIES (currently not available as a major field) WESTERNASIA Anthropology 166 Peoples of the Middle East 60 | COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Anthropology 170 History 35 History 36 History 105 Religion 114 Religion 116 Religion 145 SOUTH AND SOUTHEASTASIA Anthropology 163 Anthropology 165 Geography 109 Religion 131 Religion 132 Religion 168 Religion 196 EAST ASIA Geography 108 History 131 History 132 Political Science 175 Religion 132 Religion 141 Religion 145 Religion 166 Pastoral Peoples The Rise of Islam Modem Middle East History of the Ancient Near East Hebrew Scriptures Judaism Primitive Christianity Peoples of Oceania Peoples of South Asia Southeast Asia and India Hindu T radition Buddhist Tradition (Religion 21, Introduction to Asian Religions, is recommended as a prerequisite.)

Bachelor of Music: This degree, with a concentration in performance of theory, is the initial pre-professional collegiate music degree, designed for students who wish to pursue a career in music as performers, scholars, or private teachers. Such students must develop the skills, concepts, and sensitivity essential to the professional life of a musician. To earn the degree they must demonstrate not only technical competence but also broad knowledge of music and musical literature, sensitivity to musical style, and an insight into the role of music in society. Candidates should possess a high degree of talent, well-developed musicianship, artistic sensibilities and a strong sense of commitment. Graduates will ordinarily continue their studies through post-graduate work before they are fully qualified as professionals.

Freprofessional Preparation Students who plan to enter professional colleges requiring previous coEegiate preparation wiE find the variety of courses offered in the CoUege of Arts and Sciences and the freedom of election in that coEege is such that aB the requirements for any pro\u00ad fessional school may be met. Many students wiE desire so to direct their four-year undergraduate courses as to provide, in addition to a sound general education, appropriate preprofessional training for later work in the medical sciences, law, or theology. Special advising is available in the CoEege for students preparing for careers in education, journaUsm, law, and medical sciences. BIOLOGY A major in Biology is offered to students enroBed in the CoEege of Arts and Sciences. It has been designed for the student who wished to concentrate in Biology whEe pursuing a Uberal arts education. It wiE also serve as a basis for pro\u00ad grams leading to graduate study in biological fields and as an appropriate major for students in premedical and predental programs. The concentration consists of a year of elementary biology and single- semester courses in genetics, ecology, cellular biology, animal structure and function, and plant structure and development. This core is followed by three elective courses selected from a wide range of offerings in biologicaEy oriented departments at the University. A year of chemistry, a year of physics, and mathematics (calculus or statistics) are also required. JOURNALISM Admission to schools of journaUsm is generaEy open to academi- caBy qualified students who hold the Bachelor of Arts degree with concentration in any discipline. Interested students should take a broad program in the liberal arts, in\u00ad cluding work in the social sciences, in mass communication, and in EngUsh. LAW American law schools, as a rule, require graduation from a four-year coEege with a Bachelor's degree prior to admission. There is no prescribed curriculum which is requisite for admission, but the student is advised to develop a command of the EngUsh language as weB as a comprehension of American poUtics, social, and COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 69 economic institutions. For further details, kindly consult: Professor D.N. Hoffman, Department of Political Science; (Department of Sociology); or Professor P.H. Hutton, Department of History. THEOLOGY Graduation from a four-year college is prerequisite for admission to most theological seminaries. Although no prescribed curriculum is demanded as preparation for such professional schools, the student is advised to elect substantially from the departments of languages (particularly classics), history, philosophy and religion, psychology, and social studies. OPTOMETRY The requirements for admission to schools of optometry vary, but typically they include courses in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry and zoology with a minimum of two years of college work. PHARMACY Under the Regional Plan (page 25) Vermont residents may prepare for pharmacy school at Connecticut or Rhode Island. This is a five-year program with two years of preprofessional work which includes English, mathematics, botany, chemistry, zoology, physics, social science, a course in fine arts, and orientation to pharmacy. MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY The prevailing requirements for admission to an accredited medical college include a minimum of three years of undergraduate work but most institutions recommend four years. It is strongly urged that a student desiring to enter medical college should during his sophomore year consult catalogues of col\u00ad leges to which he expects to apply, and arrange to include in his program courses re\u00ad quired by those schools. Each student, in consultation with his advisor, plans a four-year program of courses which will fulfill the requirements for a Bachelor's degree. To meet the minimum re\u00ad quirements of most medical colleges, the program should include the following: Mathematics, one of the following options: a) Mathematics 21,22 (recommended for able students) b) Mathematics 19, 20 (recommended) c) Mathematics 21 (adequate) d) Mathematics 9,19 (adequate) e) Mathematics 9, 2; 21 or 19, 20 (suggested for students not immediately prepared to enter calculus) f) Mathematics 7,8 (not acceptable) Chemistry, two years minimum, with laboratory Chemistry 1, 2 or 11,12 (recommended for potential Chemistry majors) Chemistry 131,132 (required) Physics, one year minimum, with laboratory Physics 15,16 or 24, 25 (recommended for students concentrating in the physical sciences or engineering) Biology, one year minimum, with laboratory Biology 1, 2 Students who enter an accredited medical college after three years (90 hours) of undergraduate work may, on application and after completing one year of medical study, qualify as candidates for a Bachelor of Science degree. The requirements for admission to colleges of dentistry vary, but in all cases include at least three years of college work. (The majority of applicants will have completed four years.) In general, the minimum requirements given above should be used in plan\u00ad ning a program leading to entrance into a dental school. A student should consult 70 | COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES catalogues of the dental colleges to which he expects to apply in order to make certain all requirements are met. In general, students should avoid taking courses at the undergraduate level in those areas taught at the professional level: i.e., human anatomy, human physiology, microbiology, biochemistry. Many medical colleges now strongly recommend or require that students enroll in courses in the humanities and social sciences. SECONDARY TEACHING Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may, upon application to the Dean of Education, be accepted into the teacher training program for secondary education. Application should be made before the end of the sophomore year. The prescribed courses in education, up to 24 credit hours, can count as elec- tives towards the Bachelor of Arts. Students completing this program are eligible for Secondary Teacher's Certification. College Honors The honors program at both the junior and senior level is designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity, and provides an opportunity to pursue a special project without the restrictions of classroom routine. Such a stu\u00ad dent enters a program of reading, research, or creation under the direction of the department of his choice. A student may take honors in either or both years. A student in the College of Arts and Sciences who, at the end of his junior year, has an average of 3.00 or above for the work of the sophomore and junior years may become an applicant for college honors in a particular subject. His program for the senior year must be approved not later than the end of the junior year by the depart\u00ad ment in which honors are sought and by the Committee on Honors, and he must present a satisfactory written report and pass an oral examination on the field of special study. A program called junior honors, which may be considered introductory to but distinct from college honors, is available to juniors who have a sophomore average of 3.00 or above and who have the permission of their department chairmen. The pro\u00ad gram for each junior honors candidate will be determined by the department chairman concerned. Departmental Honors A senior whose overall average is 2.50 or above, or who has been specially recom\u00ad mended by the department in which he is concentrating, is eligible to take a com\u00ad prehensive examination. Upon successfully completing the examination he will be granted his degree \"with Departmental Honors.\" Some departments have instituted seminars or other programs designed to help the student gain the requisite breadth and depth of knowledge. The Center for Area Studies The Center for Area and International Studies is an inter-department activity, with a director and five programs, each of which has its own director. The purposes of the Center are to encourage and coordinate interdisciplinary and comparative study and research for selected foreign areas. The Center also sponsors interdisciplinary seminars and guest lectures. The Center for Area Studies administers the program of concentration in Area Studies and offers the B.A. degree in the College of Arts and Sciences, based on the successful completion of courses in several academic disciplines with concentration in one of five foreign areas: Canada, Latin America, COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 71 Russia, and Eastern Europe and Western Europe. Requirements for concentration in\u00ad clude the general distribution requirements in the College of Arts and Sciences, the foreign language of the selected area usually through the intermediate level; several options of courses in the social sciences and humanities related to the selected area; and specialized area courses, reading and research, college honors, and area seminars based on team teaching and supervised research. Special courses offered for Area Studies include: The Government Research Center Social Science Research Center The Government Research Center provides research and informational services for students, state and local officials, members of civic groups, and the public. Activities include: developing opportunities for students to become acquainted with, and to gain practical experience in, the operation of government, maintaining liaison with state and local officials relative to the use of University resources in the study of problems in state and local government, and conducting research projects. The Social Science Research Center is operated by the political science department and the Academic Computing Center as data archives, a research facility, and a teaching resource. The Center is the depository of data sets made available to the University of Vermont by the Inter- University Consortium for Political and Social Research, and also holds several data sets from other sources (including UVM resear\u00ad chers). The Center's historical, social, economic, and political archives are available to any student or faculty member. Computer analysis may be done at the Research Center which contains three terminals and two keypunch machines. Advanced students provide assistance for faculty and student projects. The director of the Center will aid researchers using SPSS (Statistical Packet for the Social Sciences). Many students enrolled in social science courses learn data analysis and use of the computer at the Research Center. Anyone who feels that the Research Center's resources might be of use is urged to drop by or to contact the director.

THE RESPONSIVE TEACHER PROGRAM The Responsive Teacher Program is a two-year concentration for students majoring in elementary, secondary or physical education. This program trains regular classroom teachers with special education skills. The responsive teacher is trained to educate all children through individual teaching/learning procedures. Using a data- based individual model of instruction the responsive teacher learns to set goals for all students and assures that these goals are met by use of individualized instruction and the application of behavior analysis theory. Candidates for the Responsive Teacher Program are chosen at the end of their sophomore year and must meet specified entrance requirements. The competency based program begins in the fall of the junior year with a consecutive two-year schedule, in addition Jto the regular elementary or secondary program. Responsive Teachers-in-Training attain competencies in specifying minimum objectives in the basic skill areas, measurement systems, individualized instruction and learning theory. A Jutt-time commitment is expected of each Responsive Teacher-in-Training during the spring semester. Working with a partner, they spend each morning in a classroom where at least one child has been designated as eligible for special educa\u00ad tion services. Each afternoon students engage in course work and seminars designed to increase the rate of learning for Vermont's eligible children. During their senior year Responsive Teachers-in-Training will spend a full semester student teaching in a Ver\u00ad mont classroom that contains at least one child eligible for special educational serv\u00ad ices. Students who successfully complete this program will be recommended for certifica\u00ad tion as regular elementary or secondary teachers, with an endorsement for Teacher of the Handicapped.

INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION FIELD STUDY The College of Education and Social Services now offers a comparative education COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SCIENCES | 83 field experience in England and has plans to develop programs in other parts of the world. The purpose of these programs is two-fold: 1} to provide an in-depth experience in the educational system of another country; and 2) to give students an opportunity to live in a society different from their own. Traveling abroad has a number of advantages. First, it broadens the outlook of the person involved in the experience whether it be social, educational, or political. Second, it affords one an opportunity to observe people in their indigenous environ\u00ad ment. Third, it allows for an exchange of ideas and philosophies. Finally, it adds a new dimension to one's life in being able to share one's thoughts and feelings with others of a different culture. Specifically, the field experience in England is designed primarily to offer students something more than the usual \"study abroad\" program. In addition to the usual visits to places of local cultural interest, this program offers an opportunity for each student to relate his professional needs, interests, goals and aspirations to a specific educa\u00ad tional area. Students will have the opportunity to visit many areas of cultural and per\u00ad sonal interest but, in addition, will live with a family in the host country and work as a paraprofessional in one or more of the host nation's schools. For further information contact Coordinator, International Education Program, University of Vermont, College of Education and Social Services, Burlington, Vermont 05401. The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administration The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administration offers professional undergraduate programs in the following areas: A. business administration and management science B. engineering, and engineering science C. mathematical sciences Within each of these broad areas there are a variety of curricula, options, and concentrations designed to satisfy more specific interests. Each of the programs offered by the College provides a basis for professional practice and for further study in the same discipline or in other professional areas; business, law, or medicine, for example. The specific programs and degrees offered are: Business Administration B.S. in Business Administration (for specialty options see p. 89) Engineering and Engineering Science: General B.S. in Engineering (for specialty options see p. 89) Civil Engineering ' B.S. in Civil Engineering Electrical Engineering B.S. in Civil Engineering Manufacturing and Management Engineering B.S. in Manufacturing and Management Engineering Mechanical Engineering B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Engineering Science (for specialty options see p. 96) Mathematical Sciences (for specialty options see p. 97) Statistics B.S. in Mathematics Computer Science B.S. in Computer Science Professional Education Graduates of professional schools are expected to fulfill unique and significant roles in planning and directing the work of the world and in effecting and managing change. The primary objective of professional education is, therefore, to develop skill in the \"problem solving art.\" This in\u00ad cludes not only intellectual knowledge of complex and high order, but also the intelligent and intuitive application of that knowledge to the situations of life. Professional graduates must have the ability, the confidence, and the self- discipline to identify and define a problem, break it down into operable com\u00ad ponents, marshal the necessary resources from the natural and social sciences, mathematics and the humanities, and to employ these resources in a systematic, effective, and efficient fashion to derive a useful solution. To enhance and promote these qualities in students, the College's curricula all emphasize the balanced development of conceptual understanding and specific skills. 84 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION | 85 The professional graduate is also often required to act on the basis of in\u00ad complete knowledge and with limited time and resources. The College therefore requires that its students exhibit certain personal qualities in addition to the intellectual achievement expected of all university graduates. Foremost among these are integrity, acceptance of responsi\u00ad bility, and reliability in independent work. The College is also committed to the idea that learning is a life-long endeavor. Our undergraduate programs therefore provide a base upon which students may build as the demands of their professional careers in\u00ad crease and their personal interests broaden. General Requirements and Academic Regulations DIVISIONS The instructional programs of the College of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration are made up of a lower division (the Pre-Professional Pro- Professional Program) and a variety of upper divisions curricula (majors). Each upper division curriculum is administered by one of the College's departments or programs, or through the office of the Dean. Admission to the College as a freshman does not guarantee admission to an upper divi\u00ad sion program. In order to enter one of these programs the student must: (a) he in good academic standing in the Pre-Professional Program of the College or in another College of the University. Where appropriate, applicants for transfer from col\u00ad leges outside UVM will be considered for admission to an upper division program simultaneously with consideration of their application for admission to the University. (b) meet specific requirements established by the department or program respon\u00ad sible for the upper division curriculum to which they seek admission. These re\u00ad quirements include (1) the completion of specific prerequisite courses, and (2) a minimum grade-point average in these prerequisite courses. PRE-PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM All newly admitted freshmen are assigned to the College's Pre-Professional Pre gram. This College-wide activity is conducted by a staff of qualified advisor-counselors and faculty consultants representing the various upper division programs. The objec\u00ad tives of the Pre-Professional Program are not only to advise students with respect to curriculum requirements but also to help them in their adjustment to the college environment and to provide guidance in choosing an appropriate upper division pro\u00ad gram. ADMISSION TO UPPER DIVISION PROGRAMS Students admitted to the College as freshmen, and transfer students admitted with less than 30 credits that have been approved by the UVM Registrar for transfer, may apply for admission to an upper division program upon completion of the freshman year (or 30 credits). To be considered for admission, these students must have com\u00ad piled a grade-point average of 2.5 or better in the prerequisite first-year courses specified for the program of their choice. A list of these prerequisite courses may be obtained from the Dean's Office or the Pre-Professional Program Office. Students who are in good standing in the College, but have not satisfied the re\u00ad86 | COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION quirements for admission to an upper division program after completing 30 credits, may continue in the Pre-Professional Program up to a maximum of 60 credits. These students should apply for admission to an upper division program during the spring semester of their sophomore year (or after completing 45 credits). In order to be con\u00ad sidered for admission, they must meet the specific requirements for the program of their choice. Detailed statements of these requirements may be obtained from the Dean's Office, the Pre-Professional Program Office, or the appropriate department or program office. Students who have completed 60 or more credits (including transfer credits) in the Pre-Professional Program and have not been admitted to one of the upper division programs, will not be permitted to enroll further in the College. Transfer students from other divisions of UVM, or from other institutions, who have 30 or more transferable credits, should apply for admission to an upper division pre gram simultaneously with their application to admission to the College. The criteria for admission of these students are identical with those applying from the Pre-Professional Program. In any year, places in the several upper division programs may be limited by available resources (faculty, laboratory facilities, etc.). In such cases only the most qualified students will be accepted, and some students who have satisfied the minimum requirements (above) may not be admitted. CORE COURSES A group of fundamental, or \"core\", courses is identified in each of the three primary program areas: business, engineering, and mathematics. These courses provide the foundations needed, both for advanced work and for specialization within the respec\u00ad tive fields. Some core courses deal with essential concepts and skills and must be com\u00ad pleted during the first and second years. Others treat material which, though more ad\u00ad vanced, is common to all branches of the field. These courses are found primarily in the second and third years. ELlCnVES All curricula offered in the College provide elective choices, a part of which must be used to satisfy the College's requirement for a minimum of 18 credit hours in the humanities and social studies. Students are also encouraged to use elective courses to explore subject areas of latent or potential interest, to build a cross-disciplinary com\u00ad petence, or to undertake specialization within their major area of study. HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL STUDIES The objective of the requirements in humanities and social studies for all programs is to broaden the student's understanding of man and the relationships in human society. Students are encouraged to plan, in consultation with an advisor, an integrated sequence of humanities and social studies courses which will constitute a continuing program extending through at least three undergraduate years. No credit is given for a \"dash course\" unless the second semester is completed. Credit for elementary language courses is granted for degrees in the College only if the intermediate level course is also satisfactorily completed. The College has a minimum requirement of 18 credit hours of humanities and social studies courses for the B.S. degree but specific programs may require more than this minimum. PHYSICAL EDUCATION In addition to the course requirements listed for each curriculum, all students must satisfactorily complete two credits in physical education. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES EMBA students who wish to concentrate in Environmental Studies may arrange for a coordinate major (see p. 124) in conjunction with one of the College's regular degree COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION | 87 programs. An Environmental option is also available under the general engineering degree program (see p. 96). CREDIT FOR MILITARY STUDIES COURSES Army ROTC at the University of Vermont EMBA grants 8 credits for Military Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the category of humanistic social studies for all programs in the College. Normally other Military Studies courses may be utilized as free electives only. See your advisor. Air Force BOTC at St. Michael's College No academic credit is granted for the first two years of AFROTC courses at St. Michael's College. At the junior and senior level the following St. Michael's courses are approved: Military Studies 301-303 \u2014 A total of 6 credits (3 each semester) will be granted under the UVM elective category of \"Political Science.\" Military Studies 401-403 \u2014 6 credits will be granted under the UVM elective category of \"Business Administration.\" Credit will not be given for both the UVM course BS AD 170 and Military Studies 401 at St. Michael's. Credits from these courses will be treated as transfer credits, and they may be used as electives only, not as substitutes for required UVM courses. CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administration does not, in general, grant credit for Military Service. Credit for specific courses or other academic experience acquired during Military Service may be available through peti\u00ad tion to the Studies Committee. TRANSFER CREDIT Transfer credits from other institutions are not used in the calculations of the University of Vermont grade-point average (GPA). Students who wish transfer credit must obtain approval from their departments. ACADEMIC STANDARDS Students who receive a cumulative or semester GPA (grade-point average) of less than 2.0 will be placed on trial. Student who have failed half their course credits for any semester, or who have had two successive semesters with less than a 2.0 cumulative GPA, are eligible to be dismissed. Business Administration The Department of Business Administration offers a program leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. The curriculum is designed to provide the student with a broad background in the fields of knowledge useful for managerial decision making and additionally considerable exposure to the humanities and the social, physical and mathematical sciences. The core program required of all students provides: A.

COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS A ND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION | 91 ENGINEERING Engineering education at UVM combines the study of mathematics and the physical and engineering sciences with courses illustrating their application to the analysis and design of equipment, processes, and complete systems. In addition, students are en\u00ad couraged to avail themselves generously of the life science, social science, and humanities courses available throughout the University. The breadth and flexibility of the engineering programs provide a sound background for engineering practice in private or public domains, for graduate study in engineering or science, and for fur\u00ad ther professional study in such fields as business, law, or medicine. The required courses in each curriculum are normally arranged for a four-year pro\u00ad gram. These courses may be arranged in a five-year sequence if desired. Transfer from other curricula may be arranged also and co-op opportunities are available (see p. 101). Departments may require students to visit Northeastern industrial centers during their junior year. The expense for the trip of several days is borne by the student. Students enrolled in the civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering curricula may become affiliated with their respective national professional engineering societies, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, as each organization has authorized a student chapter at the University of Vermont.

THE CURRICULUM The curriculum consists of three parts: the Basic Science Core, the Clinical Core, and the Senior Major Program. Basic Science Core The forty-eight weeks of instruction in the Basic Science Core spans the first year and fall semester of the second year. During this period students are instructed in the basic sciences that undergird clinical medicine. Emphasis is placed on that body of knowledge common to all types of medical practice, avoiding the minute details rele\u00ad vant only to individual specialties. In addition, seminars in Environmental Health, Medical Sociology, Human Sexuality and Human Behavior provide the medical student with an awareness of social, cultural and psychological factors affecting health and illness. The Basic Clerkship introduces the student to one of the most fundamental of all medical skills: clinical observation. This involves learning to interview a patient and perform a physical examination. Clinical Science Core The Clinical Core extends from January of the second year until December of the third year. During this twelve-month period each student receives twelve weeks of in\u00ad struction in medicine, twelve weeks of instruction in surgery, eight weeks in pediatrics, eight weeks in obstetrics and gynecology, and eight weeks in psychiatry. There is a brief summer vacation. During this year the student works under the supervision of physicians in the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, the Champlain Valley Physi\u00ad cians Hospital in Plattsburgh, New York, and the offices of physicians in the commu\u00ad nity in providing primary care to patients. Senior Major Program The final portion of the curriculum, the Senior Major Program, extends through the DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES | 105 final one and one-half years prior to graduation. This period is divided into sixteen rotations of one month duration. The major program enables each student to select that course of study best suited to his career objectives. Majors are offered in each of the preclinical sciences, plus medicine, family practice, surgery and its subspecialties, medicine, family practice, surgery and its subspecialties, obstetrics \u2014 gynecology, pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, and rehabilitation medicine. An integral part of each clinical major includes a number of required clinical and laboratory experiences as well as elective rotations. These elective rotations are not restricted to the disciplines in which the student is majoring and may include approved learning experiences away from Burlington. Many students see this as an opportunity to work and study in a large urban setting, at another medical school or a foreign medical center. Students should anticipate spending variable periods of time away from Burlington in the course of pursuing their required training. A system of faculty advisors has been developed to counsel each student on a one-to-one basis throughout the planning and course of this major program and in anticipation of later graduate education. Although the majority of students elect to pursue a clinical major, students so desiring may commit their entire major program to study in one of the preclinical sciences. While these programs are individualized, it is expected that graduate study and research will form the basis for each. Qualified students may simultaneously enroll in the Graduate College of the University as candidates for the Master of Science degree while fulfilling the requirements for the M.D. degree within the College of Medicine.

They may have a coordinate ma\u00ad jor or major in environmental studies, but must complete general School requirements for graduation. Students should contact the Director's Office and become familiar with the general requirements. The Environmental Program Environmental Studies \u2014 Agriculture Bachelor of Science Environmental Studies \u2014 Arts and Sciences Bachelor of Arts Environmental Studies \u2014 Education and Social Service Bachelor of Science Environmental Studies \u2014 Engineering, Mathematics & Business Administration Bachelor of Science Environmental Studies \u2014 Home Economics Bachelor of Science Environmental Studies \u2014 Natural Resources Bachelor of Science The Environmental Program is a University-wide program of undergraduate education, research, and community service dedicated to the study of the cultural and biophysical environments essential to the quality of life on earth. It seeks to serve the needs of students for sound education and career preparation and the needs of society \u2014 two goals that strengthen one another in practice. The Environmental Program is an interdisciplinary venture involving students and faculty from throughout the University, as well as community professionals, recognizing that study of the environment involves all disciplines and professional fields. Thus, the Program is not a unit of any single college or school of the University, but works cooperatively with a wide range of academic programs and action organizations on campus and in the community. While the Environmental Program attempts to serve a wide array of en\u00ad vironmental interests, its primary focus is the individual student. A Director and interdisciplinary faculty assist students in planning an individualized program of studies which combines a broad, comprehensive understanding of the environment and depth in a specific discipline or profession leading to a future career. Program offices are located in The Bittersweet where students are invited to visit with the staff regarding their academic plans, to gain assistance with research or action projects, and to seek information about community internships and future employment. The Environmental Studies Curriculum The curriculum in Environmental Studies offers students several alternatives leading to an individualized program of studies: The Coordinate Major in Environmen\u00ad tal Studies combines study of the environment with a traditional disciplinary major or professional field. The Major in Environmental Studies provides a unique opportunity for the student seeking an individually-designed interdisciplinary major. Students entering the University may apply for admission to Environmental Studies through several of the undergraduate colleges and professional schools. Choice of the appropriate college or school will depend on the individual's interests and educational objectives or, in the case of the Coordinate Major program, on the major or profes\u00ad sional field to be coordinated with Environmental Studies. It is recommended that in\u00ad coming students consult with the Director of the Environmental Program before mak\u00ad ing application to the University. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Students must complete the distribution requirements and minimum credit-hour re\u00ad 123 124 | ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM quirements of their college of school, and one of the following major programs. Incom\u00ad ing students will be assigned an advisor in the Environmental Program who will assist the student in selecting a major program, usually during the sophomore year. COORDINATE MAJOR IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES For the majority of students this program offers the best combination of career opportunities and en\u00ad vironmental interests. In addition to the Environmental Studies Core Program, the stu\u00ad dent completes the departmental requirements of a related disciplinary or profes\u00ad sional major in his or her college or school, and an individualized program of studies and independent work which strenthens the environmental aspects of the major.

Each student's program is individually- designed, rather than shaped around an existing departmental major, and provides the opportunity to direct study toward newly-developing environmental careers and graduate study programs. It is especially suited to the student -seeking a broad liberal education with an en\u00ad vironmental thrust. The self-designed major is a highly selective major for honors students with well- conceived academic and career-oriented goals. Admission to this major requires approval of the Environmental Program and suc\u00ad cessful completion of Environmental Studies 51. In addition to course requirements, the major includes a required senior research thesis, internship, or practicum.

Courses of Instruction The University reserves the right to change these course offerings at any time. The departments and areas of instruction are arranged alphabetically, and the college in which each is located is indicated. A student who lacks the stated prerequisites for a course, but is other\u00ad wise qualified to take it, may be permitted to enroll by the department. Unless otherwise specified, the numbers of prerequisites refer to a course number within that department. Courses numbered from 1 through 99 are elementary and intermediate courses. Those numbered from 100 through 199 are advanced undergraduate courses. They usually have at least one year of prior work in that discipline as a prerequisite. They may be taken as minor courses, but in some depart\u00ad ments only a limited number may be taken as major courses. They are not ordinarily available for graduate credit. Courses numbered from 200 through 299 are relatively more advanced courses for undergraduates which may also be taken for graduate credit by graduate students. They usually require at least two years of prior work in that and related disciplines. To obtain graduate credit the graduate student generally is expected to meet higher qualitative or quantitative expecta\u00ad tions than the undergraduate student. Two numbers with a comma between (17, 18) indicate that the separate semester courses may be taken independently for credit Two hyphenated numbers (17-18) indicate that the semester courses may not be taken independently for credit and, unless otherwise stated, they must be taken in the sequence indicated. The number of credit hours per semester is stated in each course descrip\u00ad tion. Odd-numbered courses are generally offered the first semester; even- numbered courses are generally offered the second semester; variations from this arrangement may be indicated by the Roman numeral I for the first semester or II for the second semester.

The language sequences are designed specifi\u00ad cally to train students in the four skills of speaking, comprehension, reading, and writing. The total sequence in each language represents a continuum into which a student with previous experience in the language will be placed according to his level of achievement, regardless of how many or how few years he may have studied it. For placement in advanced language course {100 or above), first-year students should consult with this depart\u00ad ment. Those who have already taken courses here should simply follow the levels represented by the number sequences, 1-99, 100-199, etc. For conve\u00ad nience, we offer the following guidelines for placement in elementary and intermediate; in all cases of doubt students should seek the advice of this department.

Literature Courses in French and Spanish As the language courses offer a continuum for the learning of the four skills, the literature courses provide a sequential study of the development of French and Spanish literatures from the Middle Ages to the present. In ad\u00ad dition, they offer both practice and continued training in the four language skills. While the literature courses are divided into centuries, with sub\u00ad categories of genres, themes, and individual authors, it is not essential to adhere strictly to chronological order. IN GENERAL, A ONE HUNDRED- LEVEL LITERATURE COURSE OR ITS EQUIVALENT IS THE PREREQUISITE FOR ALL OTHER LITERATURE COURSES: EXCEPTIONS ARE REGULARLY MADE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT. Unless otherwise stated, all courses above the intermediate level will be conducted in the foreign language in question.
