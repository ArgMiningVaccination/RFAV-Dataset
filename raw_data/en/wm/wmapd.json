It is full of strength and diversity. But the ecosystem of the different life forms on our earth is highly sensitive. Keeping it in balance is important for maintaining the stability of all ecosystems. That is why we are putting so much energy into preserving, protecting and increasing biodiversity. This report tells you what we do exactly. For example, we value healthy and living soil and make sure we use it in our medi\u00ad cinal herb gardens and cultivation projects. This type of soil is alive, stores carbon and provides our plants with all the active ingredients they need to thrive. You can read more about this from page 22.

It has radically changed our human and social lives. One year on, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the pandemic is not only a major challenge but also a warning signal about our relationship with nature. The pandemic is a call for us to rethink this relationship and to follow up with actions that come from a deepened understanding of nature and human life on earth. I am very grateful to all our employees. Working together they have managed to keep Weleda on course. It has been a massive achievement! We have also been fortunate that our products have been available at all times in every one of the lockdowns and our customers have remained loyal. The company has a good bill of health. We also passed 2020 in good economic shape. This means we can tackle the projects we have committed ourselves to with confidence. You can see this in the figures at the back of the report. We very much regret having to postpone the events we had planned and prepared for 2021 as part of Weleda's 100 th anniversary to 2022. All these events come under the banner \"Preserving biodiversity\". Biodiversity and good soil are the keys to the future of life on our planet and also major factors in halting the process of ongoing global warm\u00ad ing and even reversing it. For us, biodiversity is not only about species diversity, but also the basis of all life and a prerequisite for the health and beauty of people and nature. That is why we have made biodiversity the main topic of this report. To make this topic more digestible, we have divided the report into five sub\u00adtopics. Each of these sub\u00adtopics is directly and indirectly related to biodiversity. The sub\u00adtopics are: climate protection, healthy soils, ethical sourcing of raw materials, health, and beauty. We have asked people to talk about each sub\u00adtopic. They have told us how they see things, what inspires them, what gives them hope, but also what they expect from companies like Weleda to shape the future sustainably and ecologically. We then report on what Weleda has done, is doing and will do in the respective area. Let our commitment to biodiversity help us become more and more empowered to achieve our mission: Unfold health and beauty in harmony with human and nature. Yours, Paul Mackay Chairman of the Board of Directors of Weleda AG The Board of Directors of Weleda AG \"Sustainability is a topic that all companies have to deal with today. Weleda started out on this journey 100 years ago, not yesterday.\" Monique Bourquin, Member of the Board of Directors \"Doing business means doing something for others, which is what motivates me. Profit gives a company room for manoeuvre and must never be an end in itself. Following this maxim is the way to sus\u00ad tainable business.\" Dr Andreas J\u00e4schke, Head of Organisational Culture at Arlesheim Clinic\"Fertile soil is, so to speak, where heaven and earth breathe. It is where the bio diversity that we perceive as beau\u00ad tiful and healthy is created. At Weleda, we promote diversity and obtain products from it for the health and beauty of lots of different people.\" Ueli Hurter, Co-head of the Section for Agriculture at the Goetheanum and Demeter farmer\"Joie de vivre, vitality and beauty come from spiritual, social and biological diversity. Weleda utilises and protects this diversity. Weleda products are made from natural sub\u00ad stances and promote health and beauty.\" Thomas Jorberg, Spokesman of the Management Board of GLS-Gemeinschaftsbank\"For beauty and health to constantly flourish, we must always remain true to the basic principles of thinking, feeling and willing, even after 100 years.\" Elfi Seiler, pharmacist and co-owner of the St Peter Pharmacy in Zurich\"Real beauty does not need a covering cosmetic, but a translucent and high lighting one. It helps people appear as nature meant them to appear.\" Paul Mackay, Chairman of the Board of Directors \"A pharmaceutical company like Weleda that is committed to health strengthens people as individuals and the diversity in nature and culture.\" Prof. Dr Harald Matthes, Senior Doctor at Havelh\u00f6he Community Hospital in Berlin 2 3 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 The Executive Board of Weleda AG \"Biodiversity is the prerequisite for the health and beauty of all living things. When every living thing has a space in which it can develop according to its inner nature, it will contribute to the health and beauty of the whole.\" Nataliya Yarmolenko, Chief Commercial Officer\"The health of people and nature is closely linked to sustainability and biodiversity. Medicines should not only be produced in an ecologically responsible way, but must also have a sustainable therapeutic effect.\" Aldo Ammendola, Chief Research and Development Officer \"At Weleda we farm biodynamically and give more back to the soil than we take out. That's what healthy business is to us.\" Alois Mayer, Chief Operations Officer \"For me, real sustainability means taking responsibility. Making a significant positive contribution to the common good and the environment is enshrined in our articles of association and therefore Weleda's purpose.\" Michael Brenner, Chief Financial OfficerWeleda's sustainability programme Our sustainability programme 2018 to 2022, which applies to the entire Weleda Group worldwide, is in its fourth year. We are still pursuing our goals with the same rigour as we did in previous years, and are approaching the end point, which also represents a new beginning. We are already working on the follow\u00adup programme for 2022 to 2025, which will focus even more on the most important impact areas. Attractive and sustainable packaging Two years ago, Weleda set itself a new, long\u00adterm packaging vision: \"Zero Waste. Zero Harm. 100 % Consumer Relevance.\" Weleda packaging should not cause any problems in the world, but at the same time it should be attractive and easy to use. We made great progress on the primary packaging for our natural cosmetics in 2020. Thanks to green glass and plastics with a high proportion of post\u00adconsumer recycled material, we have now achieved a figure of around 40 per cent. The measures we took in 2020 include switch\u00ad ing the bottles for Calendula Milk and Calendula Oil to 97 per cent recycled material (the other 3 per cent are dyes ), and making Skin Food Body Butter available in green glass pots. This year, we will make further switches to glass and recycled plastic. Another major milestone is our \"unpacked\" pilot project. For the first time, selected shower gels and body oils will be available in stores for self\u00adfilling. Weleda joins B-Corp When this report was published, Weleda was in the home stretch of the verification process. B\u00adCorp is an international sustainability certification at corporate level and a community of corporations that want to do business in a meaningful way to align financial and ethical value creation. At the core of a B\u00adCorp is its \"mission lock\". Since 2020, Weleda's articles of association have enshrined what has been the default position for us for 100 years: \"The purpose of the company is to make a materially positive impact on the com\u00ad mon good and environment through its business activities.\" Biodiversity and soil health We support soil resilience, biodiversity and local ecosystems worldwide through our eight biodynamically managed Weleda me\u00ad dicinal herb gardens and around 50 raw materials projects. In the Weleda medicinal herb gardens, our gardeners cultivate a resilient ecosystem rich in species. Weleda promotes biodynamic and organ\u00ad ic cultivation around the globe. We obtain our plant\u00adderived raw materials from a land area of about 250 square kilometres. This is where we lay the foundations for healthy soils. They are the key to intact ecosystems, healthy people, a healthy climate and therefore our health in general.Transparent climate protection Last year, we prepared for the first time a very comprehensive climate assessment of our business activities. This includes any significant indirect impact that would otherwise be invisible. The results and further details can be found on the next pages and in the separate climate section - including an outlook on our ambi\u00ad tious measures and targets. New impact models In the future, we will be placing even greater emphasis on two prin\u00ad ciples in our commitment: as a first step, the overall impact. This is the holistic, long\u00adterm and indirect impact that facilitates particu\u00ad larly powerful positive development overall. In the second step, we will find partnerships with like\u00adminded people who can achieve outcomes together that no one can alone. Two examples: LIVING SOIL JOURNEY The Weleda Living Soil Camp was originally planned for the summer of 2021. 60 people will meet up for a week and look 100 years into the future. Two questions they will look at are: What will humans and nature need in the year 2121? And how can we set new incentives from today, especially for biodiver\u00ad sity and healthy soil? We have had to postpone the camp for a year due to the pandemic. Instead, we are working together with Project Together on their Farm Food Climate Challenge this year. This challenge consists of online events where a large group of people work together to develop new ideas and business models for soil, health and agriculture. The most promising solutions will be invited to the Living Soil Camp and be given further support. MUNDI - Educational Initiative for Sustainable Development Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd In January 2021, Weleda teamed up with the city of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd to set up a new centre of excellence for education for sus\u00ad tainable development. The goals: tangible on\u00adsite educational work on sustainability issues, networking of regional actors and initiatives, and communication. MUNDI is based on the Latin term \"gamundia\" which is the name of our largest production site. MUNDI is a German acronym which stands for the initiatives' main areas of activity: people, environment, nature, diversity, in\u00ad clusion. The first proposals are being developed and are expected to be announced in spring 2021. 4 5 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020Weleda's climate footprint The climate footprint is classified into three scopes. Scope 1 and Scope 2 refer to the company's energy footprint, Scope 3 to everything else. Weleda's energy footprint is only a very small part (less than 1 per cent) of its total climate footprint. This comprises around 1,240,000 tonnes of CO equivalent (2019). The purpose of the climate balance sheet which this data is based on was to collect rapid, robust and decision\u00ad relevant climate data for all key areas. This balance sheet has not been externally validated yet. The figures for Scope 3 are also based on empirical and approximate values; we have assumed a fluctuation range of \u00b1 20 per cent for the entire Scope 3. But even with this fluctuation range, the orders of magnitude are still the same and therefore useful as a basis for taking action. From 2021, we will regularly prepare externally validated carbon footprints that also address the problem of complex Scope 3 data collection. ~1% Energy footprint Weleda's energy footprint is about 10,000 tonnes of CO equivalent (2019 ). This is our impact on the climate through our own en\u00ad ergy consumption. It corresponds to Scope 1 and Scope 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Proto\u00ad col. Weleda will be arithmetically climate\u00ad neutral at this corporate level from 2021. We are already reducing these energy\u00adre\u00ad lated emissions by more than 30 per cent through the use of renewable energy.~8% Products ~100,000 t CO e Besides the company's climate footprint, this also includes packaging, raw materials, advertising materials and the transporta\u00ad tion of goods. We want to give our custom\u00ad ers the opportunity to actively protect the climate by purchasing Weleda products. That is why all Weleda products will be arithmetically climate\u00adneutral from 2022. To accomplish this, we will have to offset about 100,000 tonnes of CO equivalent annually. We will do this through efficiency improvements, renewable energy and, most importantly, initiatives in our own supply chains (insetting ) and beyond (offsetting ). ~3% Last mile ~33,000 t CO e Combined together, the impact on the cli\u00ad mate from trips to the shops for shopping and all online order deliveries is more than three times greater than the corporate footprint. ~8% Taxes and duties ~102,000 t CO e Weleda naturally pays taxes and duties. Unfortunately, these also have a big impact on the climate, for example when the state invests in road construction or in conven\u00ad tional energy production.~14% Finances ~175,000 t Weleda Pen\u00ad sion Foundation's (in Switzerland ) assets and investments have a big impact on the climate. In the years ahead, we want to make even greater use of climate\u00adfriendly property and investment opportunities. ~9% Employees ~107,000 t CO e Weleda's workforce of over 2,500 world\u00ad wide receive money from the company in the form of wages and salaries. Many very environmentally conscious people work at Weleda. However, the way they use their money has a big overall impact on the cli\u00ad mate, especially in the areas of housing, food and mobility. That is why an important pillar of our climate protection is raising em\u00ad ployees' awareness and motivation. ~58% Use of the products ~773,000 t CO e Weleda produces a lot of popular products for showering and bathing. The energy con\u00ad sumed by our users to heat the water for showering and bathing has by far the great\u00ad est impact on the climate. Detergents are known to have the same impact. That is why raising awareness and motivating consum\u00ad ers is also very important.3%9% Employees8% Products 8% Taxes and duties Last mile1%14% Finances 58% Use of the products 6 7 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020CLIMATE PROTECTION For some time now, the talk has been of a climate crisis rather than climate change. It is the great challenge of our times but sadly not the only existential crisis we are having to face in the 21st century. There are, though, reasons to be hopeful. People all over the world are join\u00ad ing forces and getting involved.FUTURE /// CLIMATEMs Boetius, what exactly attracted you to the deep sea? My curiosity. We know only a fraction of the deep sea, which covers almost 70 per cent of the earth's surface, which therefore means we only know about a fraction of life on earth. We're still a long way from exploring all the mountains to the extent we have done on land, taking samples from the ground every hundred square kilo\u00ad metres and documenting life there. Because we have cameras in the deep sea and are moving around there with submarines, we know that the landscape under water is different every 50 to 100 kilometres - just as it is on land. You have been a regular part of Arctic expeditions since 1993. What changes have you noticed? In 1993, it took the icebreaker Polarstern weeks to reach the Siberian seas as the ice was so thick. Almost 20 years later I led a large international expedition that nearly reached the North Pole. It was the year with the largest ice minimum ever. We have been witnessing sea ice loss for many years. That summer we could actually see the ice vanish before our eyes. In 1993, the ice was on average four to five metres thick. Today, it is less than one metre. It's said the Arctic is like an early warning system for climate change. Did your observa- tions in the Arctic Ocean draw you to the topic of the climate? No, it started earlier when I was involved in a re\u00ad search project on gas hydrates, i. e. frozen methane in the sea. The biggest sources of methane - \"We're the problem when it comes to climate change and it's very difficult to portray ourselves as the enemy.\" Marine biologist Antje Boetius conducts research on Arctic expeditions in the polar ice and travels in a submarine in the deep sea. She deals with the consequences of man\u00admade climate change, while also calling for quick solutions. \"Humanity must stand together in this crisis. We only have one earth.\" Antje Boetius is a marine researcher, a director of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, a professor at the University of Bremen and a member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Apart from the deep sea, she is researching the effects of climate change on polar ice and therefore on life on earth. She has received a number of awards, including the Federal Cross of Merit, the German Environment Prize and the Leibniz Ring.a greenhouse gas that is 22 times more potent than CO in terms of greenhouse effect per mole\u00ad cule - are stored under water, but it breaks down more quickly. What's incredible is that, despite this, hardly any of it escapes from the sea. So what happens to it? We've discovered there are micro\u00ad organisms on the seabeds all over the world that eat and break down the methane. If these micro\u00ad organisms didn't exist, we would have a com\u00ad pletely different climate, indeed a completely dif\u00ad ferent earth. For a long time, we scientists have been conducting research in our disciplines in iso\u00ad lation. This earth system research, which I'm interested in, doesn't just deal with the earth as a whole, but also looks at it as a system, with humans and nature interacting with each other - this also includes climate change. On talk shows, you regularly criticise poli- ticians and their reluctance to protect the climate. When did you realise it wasn't enough to do research and provide data, that you had to get involved in the political debate? After giving lectures or on talk shows, I was being asked for my opinion as a marine researcher about overfishing or climate change. And this was happening more and more. Of course, I also do a lot of research into the climate in all its facets. Most people live with their backs to the sea and don't think about how their actions on land, for example, the plastic they consume, affect the oceans. Over the past 20 years, I've therefore shifted my research more in this direction. 11 10FUTURE /// CLIMATE /// THOUGHT LEADERPoliticians talk a lot about the climate, but every year we conclude that not enough is being done about it. Do you sometimes think about giving up? No, because that would serve nothing. I some\u00ad times feel sad and even angry when terrible things happen like the littering of the oceans and we don't think enough about the future. Political tar\u00ad gets have been agreed, but we should have been much more ambitious long before that. The 1.5 degree target was ambitious, but there is no real sign that we are on track to achieving it. And the coronavirus crisis ultimately came about be\u00ad cause we have been treating nature wrongly. It's sad that we didn't use the knowledge that we have much earlier. For example, there's more log\u00ad ging going on than ever before in the rainforests. We're slowing down the process of transforming the energy system that powers the global econ\u00ad omy, which we so urgently need. What does this transformation involve exactly? We need to cut back enormously on the use of fossil fuels. They are only cheap because the dam\u00ad age they cause is not priced in. We absolutely must stop subsidising non\u00adsustainable production and get out of coal. Renewable energy must become cheaper instead. Before the coronavirus crisis, the Fridays for Future movement brought climate change to our attention in a way that politics and science had failed to do before. What can we learn from this movement? Of course we are touched when children and young people go out into the streets and say to the adults: \"You're stealing our future, shame on you!\" Fridays for Future looks for scientific ad\u00ad vice and collects facts, but it communicates through different channels and in a different lan\u00ad guage than science does, and with a much wider reach. Children and young people think in different time frames to adults, which is an important con\u00ad sideration. The coronavirus lockdown was hailed as good news for the climate. Rightly so? The lockdown is proof that CO emissions and air pollution will decrease if we travel, work and con\u00ad sume energy differently. But it's not a solution of course. Around the world, we have almost stopped flying, industrial production has nosedived by 20 to 30 per cent, traffic has plummeted, and yet, according to projections, we only saved six per cent CO in the first two months. We can learn a lot from this. Flying less and eating less meat are not enough. We need a major transformation, an en\u00ad ergy transition and the complete replacement of fossil fuels in all areas, in transport, industry, construction, heating and agriculture. Flying is part of it, but only a small part. The short\u00adterm un\u00ad planned, even chaotic savings as a result of coro\u00ad navirus are not the climate protection we need. What lessons from the coronavirus crisis can we draw for the climate crisis? Both are global problems that require interna\u00ad tional cooperation and transparency - you have to be able to trust each other to implement solutions quickly. With climate change, too, science identified problems early on and collected and analysed data. The whole world has prioritised the virus since the pandemic started. Climate change has never been prioritised in this way. Why is that? From the get\u00adgo, the message from politicians and the industry was that climate protection is expensive and we still have time. Science has also treated climate change as a protracted problem. Unfortunately, this is wrong. Climate change has been around for a long time. Disasters are happen\u00ad ing everywhere you look: deaths from heat waves, storms and flood and massive damage. Mild winters and dry springs are on the increase. Bangladesh suffered a shocking storm and a tsunami of almost five metres. Researchers have been warning about the increase for years. The suffering that is being caused by man\u00admade cli\u00ad mate change is simply mind\u00adboggling. Will the crisis push climate protection off the agenda or lead us to a rethink? The coronavirus crisis has superseded every\u00ad thing else for now. Slowing down the spread is the number one priority at the moment. The virus is seen as alien life, an external enemy. For us, it's easy to band together and fight against it. But with climate change, we're the problem - and it's very difficult to portray ourselves as the enemy. But we must stop blaming future gen\u00ad erations for the problems caused by the way we exploit nature.\"The 1.5 degree target was ambitious, but there is no real sign that we are on track to achieving it. \" Antje Boetius has taken part in a total of 49 research trips during which she dived more than three kilometres deep with submarines. 12FUTURE /// CLIMATE /// THOUGHT LEADERSOPHIA KIANNI \"Seven years ago, I decided to become an advocate after witnessing the severe effects of environmental degradation in Iran. When I brought up my concerns with my relatives, I was disheartened when they informed me that they knew nothing about climate change. Determined to educate my Iranian family, I began to pore over climate research; however, I quickly realised that there was no information available in Farsi, their native language. I worked diligently with my mom to translate climate research to help them understand the severity of the climate crisis, and then decided to start my nonprofit, Climate Cardinals, to continue making climate education more accessible. To solve climate change, we need everyone, everywhere to take action. Con\u00ad sumers want to shop from ethical companies that align with their values; corporations must innovate to become more sustainable and equitable in order to ensure we are making progress on climate commitments.\" Sophia Kianni is a climate activist and founder of Climate Cardinals.

Even in the name of this movement there is, in a sense, a colonial amnesia.\" Imeh Ituen researches global climate policy at the University of Hamburg. 14FUTURE /// CLIMATE /// THOUGHT LEADERMr Hopkins, you are constantly dealing with the dangers of climate change and peak oil. How do you remain an optimist? Of course there are also days when I feel things are hopeless, but at the same time I have a very privileged place within the Transition Town move\u00ad ment. I'm right at the hub, so to speak, where all the stories of initiatives from all over the world come in, and hardly a day goes by where I'm not thinking: Wow, look what's happening and what people are getting up to! If you believe the majority of climate researchers, there's almost no time left to turn the tide. When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change announced in its last climate report that we needed immediate, far\u00adreaching change in all parts of society, we should have been euphoric in our response: \"Fantastic, we can rethink every\u00ad thing and let our imaginations run wild!\" Instead, as a society we have tended to respond with frustration and lethargy. \"I can see and feel the change and then draw new motivation and inspiration from it.\" People everywhere are actively working against climate change and for a future without fossil fuels. What motivates Rob Hopkins, the founder of the worldwide Transition Town movement? Rob Hopkins is an environ\u00ad mentalist and founder of the worldwide Transition Town movement. The 51\u00adyear\u00adold is a lecturer, researcher and author of The Power of Just Doing Stuff: How Local Action Can Change the World, (Green Books, 2013 ).Where does this lethargy about the future come from? Right now I'm working on a book about the imagin\u00ad ation. One of the most fascinating aspects is the neuroscientific evidence that shows that when we are stressed, scared or traumatised, the hippo\u00ad campus, which is sort of memory and imagin ation centre in the brain, visibly shrinks in size. How should we counter the damage? The crucial piece of the puzzle in the middle has been missing for a long time: what I can achieve together with the people around me. This is pre\u00ad cisely where the most potential lies. I can walk through Totnes today and see the hundreds of trees that we've planted. I see hundreds of solar panels on the roofs that weren't there before. I can see and feel the change and then draw new motivation and inspiration from it. What skills do we need to equip ourselves for a future without fossil fuels? In French, there is the wonderful word \"bricolage\", which comes from the verb \"bricoler\" (\"to tinker\" ) and describes the ability to make the best of what one has at hand. For me, this is one of the most important skills we need to cultivate our imagin\u00ad ation more again. We need to reduce our CO emissions by ten per cent every year? Fantastic, let's think about all the great things we could do to make this come about. This is exactly the mentality we need. We must all become masters of bricolage. \"We need to reduce our CO\u00b2 emis- sions by ten per cent every year?

Treesisters sup\u00ad ports reforestation projects around the globe. Besides their positive impact on the climate, trees prevent flooding and erosion and protect natural habitats for humans and animals.

Year after year, we are losing valuable soil because of deforest\u00ad ation, erosion and sealing, soil that we actually urgently need - for biodiversity, climate protection and the cultivation of food.FUTURE /// SOILSMr Holmgren, permaculture and the Fridays for Future movement basically want the same things: sustainable living and economic activity to protect nature. While Fridays for Future has grown bigger and bigger in recent years, permaculture has been less promi- nent. What can permaculture learn from the current environmental movement? The climate strikes are more radical than the idea of permaculture. While radical environmentalism tries to stop other people or systems from doing certain things, permaculture focuses on the positive in the private sphere, in the household. The advantage of radical environmental move\u00ad ments is the solidarity that is created. Is interest in permaculture growing again thanks to Fridays for Future? I observe again and again that people who fight passionately to change the world eventually get burnt out because the change doesn't happen fast enough for them. Some of them find their way to permaculture because they can implement their ideas there in private. Permaculture technol\u00ad ogies are indeed used in demonstrations and activist camps, also by Fridays for Future. For ex\u00ad ample, composting toilets are often installed in the sleeping quarters at camps. You once said that a permaculture farmer spends 80 per cent of his time trying to understand nature. What do you learn from observing the environment? I like comparing it to body language. We can read body language and thus other people. Some people are even particularly good at it. It is simi\u00ad lar to nature. You can \"read\" whether a tree is healthy, whether it will one day grow so big that it takes the light away from the other plants around it. Just as one learns to understand the meaning of body language through experience, reading nature comes with experience. Modern \"We have to start using more natural processes again.\" People are moving further and further away from nature, yet they are part of it and only need to be able to decipher it. David Holmgren, the founder of permaculture, believes that we can learn to live differently when the need arises. David Holmgren is the co\u00ad founder of the permaculture concept first published in 1978. It is based on observing ecosystems and cycles in nature and mimicking them for agriculture and horticulture. He has been living on his per\u00ad maculture farm Melliodora in Australia since the eighties. His latest book: RetroSuburbia: The Downshifter's Guide to a Resilient Future (Melliodora Publishing, 2018 ).people, however, have forgotten this. They rely on someone else to explain things to them, they have to read it in books. When did we start to move away from nature? The development of modern agriculture and grain cultivation began 10,000 years ago. Since then, agriculture has developed further and further away from nature - and so have we. Today, agriculture is a high-tech industry. On the one hand, yes. On the other hand, an ecological, local food production has emerged in parallel, in which traditional, old plant varieties are being cultivated again. I am convinced that we need to use more natural processes again instead of pushing the boundaries further and further. For example, through genetic engineering, which manipulates nature to the highest degree. We have to make amends, ultimately nature is in con\u00ad trol. The depletion of fossil fuels means the end of our power over nature. \"We have to make amends, ulti - mately nature is in control. The depletion of fossil fuels means the end of our power over nature.\" 24FUTURE /// SOILS /// THOUGHT LEADERPermaculture is most often associated with small home gardens. Can permaculture feed humanity? Permaculture cannot feed cities with ten million inhabitants, it is not designed for that. It is pos\u00ad sible, but for this to happen, large areas of land taken over by industrial agriculture would have to be converted to permaculture and many people would have to leave the cities and move to rural areas. There are studies that show that permacul\u00ad ture produces excellent yields; higher yields are possible than in conventional fruit and vegetable cultivation. The only thing is that conventional agriculture cannot imagine doing without fertil\u00ad isers and sprays. But the fact is that the current form of agriculture will not be able to feed the world for much longer, precisely because it is not sustainable. What do you mean by that? In order to produce cheap food, industrial agri\u00ad culture destroys soils, is demonstrably responsible for the loss of species, and depletes resources. To feed the world, we need to design a new sys\u00ad tem, and permaculture can contribute a lot. At the moment, however, small farms that feed fam\u00ad ilies and supply local markets still have a very big part to play in how the world is fed. They don't call what they do permaculture, but they apply elements of it. Much more of that is possible to achieve. Does permaculture also work in cities? Since the early beginnings of permaculture, there has been a great interest in how permaculture can be applied in cities. Margrit and Declan Kennedy, two architects, took one of the first courses with Bill Mollison and worked on greening residential buildings in Berlin in the 1970s. When they heard about the permaculture idea, they adopted our prin\u00ad ciples for their work. This is one way we can change and adapt cities to apply permaculture. In cities, interpersonal issues are also involved, which are dis\u00ad connected from agriculture. For example, how we organise our community in a sustainable way. Where do you see the greatest responsibility for climate protection - in the political arena, with companies or with each individual? There are two opposing views on the subject: firstly, that everyone is a consumer and supports a system with every purchase. And there is the view that a handful of companies are responsible for all the pollution. Of course, companies make products for the roughly two billion people who belong to the middle class worldwide, and pol\u00adlute the planet in the process. But they wouldn't sell anything if people didn't want it. Many are calling for a sustainable new beginning in the post-pandemic world. Is the crisis an opportunity for positive change and a turnaround? Absolutely, and partly because people are stuck at home due to social distancing and isolation. Many people have realised how poor their homes are - not necessarily in financial terms. But poor in terms of how little they can take care of them\u00ad selves, how little creativity they have when it comes to managing everyday life. For people prac\u00ad tising permaculture, growing their own food in a strong home community and organising things rather than just being part of the overall econ\u00ad omy, restrictions on where they can go are not such a big problem. The idea of humanism has been part of the permaculture concept from the beginning. How does this philosophy still inspire you today? The idea that humans are the problem and de\u00ad stroy nature is rooted in environmental thinking. In the humanist idea, the human being can be part of the solution and not just part of the prob\u00ad lem. A positive and motivating thought. I am firmly convinced of this to this day. \"The fact is that the current form of agriculture cannot feed the world for much longer, precisely because it is not sustainable.\" David Holmgren's farm Melliodora is regarded a prime example of permaculture and attracts interested people from all over the world. 27 26FUTURE /// SOILS /// THOUGHT LEADERANA DE LIMA \"A diverse and living soil is the basis of a healthy ecosystem.

By promoting the symbiotic relationship be\u00ad tween plants and soil life. Soil life acts as the plant's living nutrient pool - when it needs minerals, they are always available. And this in turn leads to a healthy plant with a high nutrient density. We try to support this million\u00adyear\u00adold symbiosis by keeping the soil covered with living plants as much as possible, with green manure and mixed cultivation, but also with \"weeds\", which achieve the same effect if they are not cleared out. What is \"constructive\" in this method? Today, many natural resources such as soil, bio diversity or groundwater are degraded and heavily overexploited. To leave a healthy earth - in both senses - for future generations, we need to rebuild resources: plant trees, provide food and habitat for insects and birds, build up the soil, increase water infiltration into the soil and thus also counteract flooding and replenish ground\u00ad water supplies. Why can carbon dioxide be stored in the soil by building up humus? Plants absorb CO from the air and convert it into carbon. They pump much of it into the soil to nourish the soil life. This in turn is also made up of carbon and additional minerals. Bacteria can multiply rapidly - when they die, organic matter builds up in the soil: humus. If the roots of harvest\u00ad ed plants are left in the soil, it remains as stored biomass. Soil organisms compost them and work them further into the soil. You can also feed organ\u00ad ic matter from above: mulch material such as straw, hay, leaves, wood chips, organic waste or compost. \"Diversity means stability.\" Geographer Stefan Schwarzer wants to use regenerative agriculture to try to save the climate. In the ecovillage Tempelhof in Germany, he demonstrates what the agriculture of the future could look like. Stefan Schwarzer is a phys\u00ad ical geographer and perma\u00ad culture designer living in the ecovillage Tempelhof. He works for the United Nations Environment Programme in Geneva, where he deals with global environ mental issues. His main objective is to link global goals with local actions.Can regenerative agriculture also be used in the home allotment garden? Of course, for example, by covering the soil with mulch and adding good compost that feeds the soil life. And by deliberately promoting the diver\u00ad sity of plants. Diversity means stability in the system: a voracious insect that loves carrots will not be able to spread as far if its natural enemies are around. Beneficial organisms can be supported by planting hedges, shrubs or insect hotels. \"Today, many natural resources such as soil, biodiversity or groundwater are degraded and heavily overexploited.\" 30FUTURE /// SOILS /// THOUGHT LEADER Figures from the Weleda world 7 billion living beings are found on average in one kilo of soil. Among them are lots of protozoa, bacteria and fungi, but also worms, isopods and arthropods. 50 % CO is bound in our soils worldwide. Soils are climate protectors - after the oceans, they are the largest CO reservoir. 2,000 years are needed for ten centimetres of healthy soil to emerge naturally. 24 billion tonnes of soil is lost to erosion every year.HOW WE IMPROVE THE SOIL The soil is the start and the finish of everything that happens in the garden. In our medicinal plant gardens we experiment and learn every day how to make the soil healthier and more fertile. We pass on this knowledge to our cultivation partners all over the world. We compost plant residues and cow dung and give the soil its own nutrients back. Bushes and shrubs protect against erosion. Our garden in the Netherlands, for example, was full of clay soil at the begin\u00ad ning and nothing would grow on it. Since the treatment with biody\u00ad namic preparations, we have been growing healthy plants here. Because the plants of tomorrow grow in the soil of today.PIERRE KAPPLER Head Gardener Switzerland/ France The ground beneath our feet unfortu\u00ad nately does not yet get the attention it deserves. Every year, we lose an area of around 14 million football pitches of soil through deforestation, slash\u00adand\u00adburn and sealing, among other things. Conven\u00ad tional agriculture is further depleting the soils, the humus and nutrient content is declining. According to estimates, we will soon no longer be able to grow food on a large part of our soils. Biodynamic agriculture, as practised by Weleda in its eight medicinal plant gardens, has been counteracting this with its regenerative methods for almost 100 years. We don't poison the soil. Instead, we foster humus formation and increase soil fertility in a natural way. 32FUTURE /// SOILS /// WELEDA'S RESPONSIBILITYTHE KINGFISHER IS BACK Not only plants feel good on our healthy soils, but so do animals. After we established native fish in the ponds of our German medicinal herb garden, it did not take long for the kingfisher to return. The bird with its unmistakable bright blue colour is dependent on natural waters and their banks and feeds on small native fish. The kingfisher has also been spotted in our garden at our headquarters in Arlesheim. For us, this is further proof of ecological linkages. We protect biodiversity by restoring the natural cycles. BIODYNAMIC FARMING Everything that grows and thrives on our own plots and fields we cultivate biodynamically. With various natural methods we try to keep the soil healthy and alive and to strengthen it. For example, by using green manure. As a catch crop, legumes such as red clover bridge the time that lies between two crops. They absorb nitrogen from the air, convert it into food for soil organisms and protect against sun, wind and rain. In this way, they naturally prevent the soil from eroding. 34 35FUTURE /// SOILS /// WELEDA'S RESPONSIBILITYETHICAL SOURCING Global supply chains are complex and often not transparent. For outsiders, it is almost impossible to track them: compliance with social and ecological standards is still rare. But with our supply chains, we can make an enormous contribution to people and nature.FUTURE /// SOURCINGMs Shiva, you are calling for civil dis- obedience. Does this give expression to your deep inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi? That is absolutely correct. Gandhi coined and gave life to the term satyagraha for this. In my activist life, satyagraha is the central theme. This means fighting against untruths with civil disobedience. Lies like the one that agrochemicals can feed the world or that pesticides, i. e. agricultural poisons, are necessary and safe. What are the current satyagrahas? In this time of extreme destruction of bio\u00ad diversity and climate catastrophe, we need an all\u00adunifying Satyagraha for Life. The Fridays for Future movement is currently extremely im\u00ad portant. The young generation is practising civil disobedience worldwide with an impact we could hardly have imagined. What is the relationship between bio- diversity and agriculture? Sustainable agriculture not only preserves but also creates biodiversity, which provides us with a diverse range of food. Our body needs more than just calories. We also need minerals, trace elements and vitamins, i. e. the greatest possible diversity of cultivated and also wild plants to ensure food for a healthy diet. We do not need toxic pesticides if the diversity of flora and fauna is in balance. This creates the basis for healthy and fertile soils that do not need artificial fertilisers from chemical factories. By using agri\u00ad cultural chemicals and monocultures, we are not only destroying plant diversity, but also destroy\u00ad ing the livelihood of pollinating insects. \"We need an economic model that is oriented towards the limits of the earth's capacity and towards justice and the common good.\" For Vandana Shiva, the principles of biodiversity are the basis of true democracy. The charismatic Indian physicist and activist is highly concerned and is calling for civil disobedience. Vandana Shiva holds a PhD in quantum physics and has been an activist for environ\u00ad mental and civil rights and eco feminism since the 1970s. In 1982, she founded the Nav danya (Nine Seeds ) Foun\u00ad dation and was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize, among other honours.Why are healthy seeds so important? Seeds are biodiversity. But it is now an unfortu\u00ad nate fact that the agrochemical industry, with its drive to control agriculture, is destroying the enormous diversity of our seeds. For example, thousands of maize varieties were bred from the wild plant teosinte by the indigenous peoples of Latin America, and farmers even developed over 200,000 varieties from an Indian native form of rice. Seeds are designed for diversity, which forms the basis of our healthy diet. What are the crises to be solved besides the Corona pandemic? We face three other major crises: climate chaos with peak oil, staggering biodiversity loss and the food crisis, all of which are linked. The key mes\u00ad sage, \"Soil not Oil\", demonstrates this: a crucial way to solve these crises is to practise agriculture that works with healthy soil, and not based on oil. \"The young generation is prac - tising civil disobedience worldwide with an impact we could hardly have imagined.\" 39FUTURE /// SOURCING /// THOUGHT LEADERDoes the \"obsolete agriculture\" serve as a saviour for these crises? The solutions are indeed not to be found on Wall Street or in corporate headquarters, but above all in the countryside. Agriculture is a forward\u00adlook\u00ad ing economic model and a central solution factor, but only if it is practised in a sustainable and ecological manner. More people will have to work in agriculture again, even in rich countries. We need to return to real world economics and we should build new models of mutual support. If we do not prepare now, we will not only have fierce conflicts, but a struggle pitting everyone against everyone. So the solution is in the hands of the farmers? I see my role as honouring the hard work of smallholder farmers. If we don't, no one will want to do this work anymore. The global trend and the rural exodus are proof of this. But who will produce our food in the future? Industrial agricul\u00ad ture destroys food, we waste up to 90 per cent of available calories by feeding grain to livestock. Sustainable agriculture is not possible without a combination of animals, crops and trees. So what is the most important thing to achieve the changes that are needed? A new way of thinking. Thinking changes as a result of education. The best kind of education is practical experience. When you use your hands and have contact with the earth and with animals, the brain is activated in a certain way. I recom\u00ad mend gardening as a school subject for all children. Let them choose their own path, but we should at least give them gardens. Your goal is to rid the world of pesticides by 2050. A crazy dream? The idea to fight for a pesticide\u00adfree world with a clear timeline was born in 2017. We organised a Bhoomi festival for Mother Earth. The communi\u00ad ties of our Navdanya Movement of the whole Himalayan region came together. Even Prime Min\u00ad ister Chamling, who converted the Indian state of Sikkim to \"100 per cent organic\", and the mayor of the South Tyrolean municipality of Mals, who successfully banned pesticides from his apple\u00ad growing region by referendum. That doesn't sound like a crazy dream. What does society have to do to achieve this? We need to communicate that the same pesti\u00ad cides that are killing bees and butterflies are also making farmers and consumers sick. We need to start calculating and internalising the costs of these diseases for society and also for individu\u00ad als. Then it will quickly become apparent that we can no longer afford or allow chemical agricul\u00ad ture and the wrong kind of food. A rapid and con\u00ad sistent shift to organic farming has become a matter of survival. And what can we do ourselves? Our global community is the sum of all individuals. When each individual changes, society is changed. All paradigm shifts start very small before they turn into a big wave. This also applies to biodiver\u00ad sity, climate protection and, above all, the much\u00ad needed radical agrarian reform. What is your vision for the future? Well, I see two very controversial futures. Either we continue on the destructive path that poses a massive threat to human and planetary health, including to the 200 or so species we lose every day. So it can happen to us that we disappear from the planet. Or we protect the earth, the en\u00ad vironment, biodiversity and ecological processes so that ecosystems can regenerate. What message do you want to share? Most importantly, that we are not masters or even owners, but part of nature. We must not only take, but also give back and work not against, but with nature for the benefit of all. We must stop exploiting the unlimited natural wealth of the earth for unlimited economic growth. We need to make peace with nature by creating toxin\u00adfree systems of production and consumption.

What conclusion were you able to reach? That it can't go on like this. Industrial agriculture is responsible for deforestation, depleted soils, drained rivers and lakes, species extinction on a small and large scale, the list could go on endless\u00ad ly. Pesticides destroy the soil, poison the ground\u00ad water and destroy biodiversity. If we don't change something now, we will soon no longer be able to grow food. Can locally produced food feed the growing world population? Absolutely. Indeed, local food production is key to feeding the world's growing population. Why? It is important to understand the structural link between local food production and biodiversity in agriculture. In contrast to the global market, which demands huge quantities of uniform goods, local markets require a large variety of different products. By prioritising production for local needs, local food production promotes biodiversity. \"We need to respect natural diversity and emulate it.\" Industrial agriculture no longer has a future: its impact on people, the climate and biodiversity is too dramatic. Helena Norberg\u00adHodge explains how we can solve the problem in harmony with people and nature. Helena Norberg-Hodge, 75, is a leading globalisation re\u00ad searcher and founder of Local Futures, an organisation that promotes cultural and biologic\u00ad al diversity worldwide. She is the author of the best\u00adsell\u00ad ing books Ancient Futures, The Economics of Happiness and Local Is Our Future.What do you say to critics who justify monocultures in view of the gigantic demand for food? Our common sense tells us that industrial mono\u00ad cultures do not work in the long run. We achieve high yields in the short term, but this is dispro\u00ad portionate to the ecological damage. Agriculture must work with nature, not against it. And nature strives for diversity. If we respect and emulate this diversity, we benefit doubly. How can this be achieved? It's simple: diversity instead of uniformity in cultivation. A farm can, for example, enhance grain fields with fruit trees or vegetables and at the same time practice species\u00adappropriate animal hus\u00ad bandry. These types of farms produce far more food than industrial monocultures, in some cases up to 20 times more, according to some scientif\u00ad ic studies. This is achieved by using every ecolog\u00ad ical niche instead of squeezing agricultural ecosys\u00ad tems into a uniform and unnatural culture. And what impact does this have on bio- diversity and the climate in concrete terms? A positive one! Intercropping not only prevents the worst effects of globalised and industrial ag\u00ad riculture, but reverses them. Organic farms mimic natural ecosystems and strengthen the cycles and processes within the system. They also provide jobs and food security. We are addressing three major problems: the climate crisis, the loss of bio\u00ad diversity and the food shortage. \"Local food production is key to feeding the world's growing population.\" 45FUTURE /// SOURCING /// THOUGHT LEADER Figures from the Weleda world 47 audits were carried out in 2020.

The initial results offer hope: bitter oranges from Egypt, which we use for neroli oil, have a benefit of 3.30 euros per kilogram and 600 euros per hec\u00ad tare of cultivated land. This is because more CO is bound than emitted by the compost incorporated into the soil. By way of comparison: conven\u00ad tionally grown bitter oranges generate a loss of 4.50 euros per kilogram.BAS SCHNEIDERS Head of International Strategic Sourcing We take the sourcing of our raw mate r\u00ad ials around the globe very seriously. We don't only pay attention to social and economic standards along the entire sup\u00ad ply chain. Because biodiversity in the cultivation areas is particularly close to our hearts. We support small\u00adscale farm\u00ad ing structures, promote soil improve\u00ad ment and respect biodiversity. We are the only European company to be certified with the UEBT (Union for Ethical BioTrade ) seal of quality. In 2020, we started even more new cultivation projects, such as the beeswax project in Cameroon, and continuously improved existing ones. 46 47FUTURE /// SOURCING /// WELEDA'S RESPONSIBILITYWE PROTECT WHAT with (Borneo Orangutan Sur\u00ad vival ) is ongoing.

That is why we use extracts of it in our ratanhia toothpaste and ratanhia mouthwash. Demand is continuously increasing, and their population is under threat. For many years, Weleda has been promoting organic wild harvest\u00ad ing in the barren, rocky landscapes of Peru, where the inconspicuous shrub with its many roots is at home. The love of nature is the top priority here. Where we harvest a root, we immediately sow again. Biologists check the population regularly in the process. 49FUTURE /// SOURCING /// WELEDA'S RESPONSIBILITYHEALTH What does it actually mean to be healthy? Humans are not just made up of a body, they also have a soul and an individual personality. Besides taking care of ourselves, we should be mindful of the health of nature. For only when human and nature are in harmony with each other can we use the powerful healing forces of nature.FUTURE /// HEALTHMs Rasche, when asked whether it should be a girl or a boy, most parents answer: \"The main thing is healthy!\" As a midwife, how do you deal with being allowed access to the most intimate moments and at the same time with this responsibility? There is a very big responsibility, and I am always aware of that. As a midwife, you can't have a bad day. When you are assisting a birth, you have to leave everything that you are experiencing in your own life outside. Then the door opens and I try to handle each birth as if it were the first or only birth for that woman. Good care is the be\u00adall and end\u00adall. If it's a home birth, I also say: I prefer to do too much once rather than too little. I don't have to prove anything to myself, but my big goal is to guide woman and child safely through a birth. What is your philosophy? For me, my philosophy as a midwife is to provide holistic care. That is why I decided directly after my training to care for women holistically: during pregnancy, during birth and in the post\u00adpartum period. An intensive accompaniment where you get to know each other and share this path together. Because I am convinced that if a woman is not left alone some place where she doesn't know any\u00ad one and doesn't feel comfortable, many complica\u00ad tions that could arise during childbirth can al\u00ad ready be remedied. That is why for me the com\u00ad prehensive package is my dream job. This is not always easy due to the difficult situation mid\u00ad wives are in, because the financial aspect plays such a big role. \"Care is not only daily hygiene, care should always be celebrated as well.\" Midwife Sissi Rasche's ambition is to facilitate a beautiful birth in which both the baby and the mother feel comfortable and secure. How she connects her philosophy with sustainability and why changing nappies can also be something beautiful. Sissi Rasche works as a freelance midwife in Berlin and knew from the age of 15 that this was her dream job. Together with her col\u00ad league Kareen Dannhauer, the 35\u00adyear\u00adold has launched the podcast Midwife Salon - to offer women even more holistic care.Weleda has committed itself to anthropo- sophical medicine: to view the organism as a whole when healing and to activate the body's own defences. Is there a common ground with the way you approach things? Absolutely! As a midwife, you already are ex\u00ad posed to Weleda during your training, it ac com\u00ad pan ies you, I always think it's good when you see the whole picture and don't just pick one thing, and instead look at how you can support women in their holistic well\u00adbeing. In this way, it creates a better environment for the mother\u00adchild rela\u00ad tionship, but also for the whole family situation. After all, a birth is a momentous experience. How important is mental health in addition to physical health? I pay great attention to that. Some women who have had a caesarean section, for example, are often afraid that they have failed. My constant companionship enables me to provide much better support for women. Also in the post\u00adpartum pe\u00ad riod, which is a tightrope walk, especially for the psyche. You have given birth to a child and your hormones are in a state of flux. This is a very intense period for most women and the whole family. It is then important to simply be there, \"I don't have to prove anything to myself, but my big goal is to guide woman and child safely through a birth.\" 52FUTURE /// HEALTH /// THOUGHT LEADERto be someone to talk to. And to observe at an early stage if mental health is suffering as a result. How can the woman and the families be supported so that a good balance is restored? Because if the mother is not well, the rest of the family is not well either. That is why the skilled interaction and collaboration of psychologists, ma\u00ad ternity nurses and paediatricians is also very important. Many women feel that their problems are not taken seriously. It is a code of honour in my work to simply listen to the women and in this way establish a rapport. What role does sustainability play in your work? Unfortunately, sustainability is not so easy when it comes to maternity care. A lot of waste is pro\u00ad duced in the clinic because there is no other way to maintain hygiene. However, when I accom\u00ad pany families on the path to parenthood as a mid\u00ad wife, I see it as my job to educate parents, limit consumption and shop more consciously. Especial\u00ad ly if they already have many things at home. Pregnant women and parents in particular are very vul nerable and think they need certain things to be a better mother or a better parent. Of course, for babies, for example, you need good clothes, but even there you should choose companies that take up the idea of sustainability, where the whole supply chain is sound, from production to the end consumer. That doesn't mean you should have an entire wardrobe full of clothes. Better ask yourself: Do I really need that? You can also borrow various things if you only need them for a short time. Or test them first before using them. What do you look for in ingredients and what practical tips do you have for care? I want natural ingredients, preferably organic natural cosmetics. I make sure that there are as few fragrances as possible. What you shouldn't compromise on in baby care is a high\u00adquality, pure and mild oil. This can be used in many ways: for massaging babies, for intimate care or for taking care of skin wrinkles. It is important to use good products already during pregnancy. Weleda's preg\u00ad nancy oil is also great for this! It's not just about taking care of your body, but about connecting with the child. When you massage their belly, you are already building an emotional bond. Care is not only daily hygiene, the care of a pregnant woman or her baby should always be celebrated as well. In units you make time for. You can also combine nappy changing with communication with the child, because it fosters a beautiful physical and emotional bond.When we talk about sustainability, social sustainability is also part of it. The mid- wifery crisis is a big problem. More and more are giving up their profession because they are so badly paid. What motivates you not to quit? Midwives love their profession. No midwife gives up because of a lack of passion. The pay is a dis\u00ad aster. I perform a good and skilled job and I want to be paid appropriately for it. Of course, one could say: I'm only accepting private patients or self\u00ad pay patients now, because then I get a more appro\u00ad priate payment. And that's what I am about to do. But then there is the bad conscience, because then only a fraction of people can afford our care, and that doesn't feel good. What needs to change most urgently in health policy? Midwives must be paid more fairly and the profession must become more attractive again. It is scientifically proven that births go more smoothly when the mother receives comprehen\u00ad sive care from a midwife. Every woman is enti\u00ad tled to competent care from a midwife. After all, nothing less than our children, indeed our future, is at stake. \"Midwives love their profession. No midwife gives up because of a lack of passion. The pay is a disaster.\" Sissi Rasche is the mother of three children. 55 54FUTURE /// HEALTH /// THOUGHT LEADERANDREA FREUND \"Four hundred years ago, Galileo Galilei was able to prove against all odds that the earth revolves around the sun - and not the other way around.

About ten years ago, I was working for a cer\u00ad tification agency when the demand for organic agriculture and for organic raw materials was growing rapidly. That's when I became an activist. Because it was clear to us: if organic farming in Africa and here in Zanzibar is to be successful, we cannot simply copy the European way. That's why I said: Let's found an umbrella organisation that bundles many initiatives from all over East Africa. We have received a lot of support from all over the world along the way. On the one hand, of course, it's about operating in harmony with na\u00ad ture. Equally important to us is to strengthen a new image of organic farming: not primitive, as the agrochemical companies portray it, but intelligent and self\u00adconfident. That's how the movement started. Now we have about 100 members and are also very politically involved. What goals do you pursue with your work? I am wholeheartedly committed to our vision: we envision a vibrant, sustainable and mutually beneficial organic sector in Tanzania. So it's about much more than farming and trading organic raw materials. It's about a way of life and about truly enabling everyone to participate in it, because it's better for everyone. \"It's about a way of life.\" She is driving the conversion to organic farming in Tanzania. But Mwatima Juma is concerned with much more, namely a new, more natural relationship between people and nature. Mwatima Juma holds a PhD in agriculture and crop pro\u00ad duction and is the founder of Tanzania Organic Agricul\u00ad ture Movement, an organisa\u00ad tion committed to organic and smallholder agriculture.What resistance do you have to overcome? Of course, the biggest resistance comes from those who make profit from the sale of agrochem\u00ad icals. The companies and lobby groups finance campaigns, they unsettle and disinform the farm\u00ad ers, the political leadership and the administra\u00ad tion. The biggest victims are the many farmers. They often don't even know what chemicals they are using, and that's why they can't protect themselves. What is your source of inspiration? My first degree in agriculture was conventional: I learned how to use chemicals. But on my father's farm, we never used aggressive chemicals and in hindsight maybe they were not available and our soils were fertile. I realised there that it just made more sense. I share that understanding now, because having knowledge means protection. Here in Tanzania, if farmers are to adopt conven\u00ad tional farming practices, it means they are ex\u00ad posed to poison. Only public information can help against this. Since then, I have had a dream: what if we had 100 per cent organic agriculture in Zanzibar and throughout Tanzania? That is a good goal, and it is realistic. \"Equally important to us is to strengthen a new image of organic farming: not primitive, as the agrochemical companies portray it, but intelligent and self-confident.\" 59FUTURE /// HEALTH /// THOUGHT LEADER Figures from the Weleda world 108 is the average number of employees participating in the APCC's continuing education modules. 429 Swiss medicinal product approvals are subject to new regulatory requirements.

We think something is beautiful if it is good for us on the one hand and does not harm nature on the other. Because we believe that the life processes of nature and those of humans are interconnected.FUTURE /// BEAUTYMs Sewalski, in the sustainability discourse there is often talk of the \"brave new world\" in the sense of a future utopia. What will this look like from your point of view? It's nice to put some thought into it. Because if we direct our energy towards the beautiful, we will also get there. I envision a world where we all live together in fairness. In which there are enough resources for everyone and there is no more social inequality. I would like to see global thinking. What I consume or produce has global consequenc\u00ad es and consumes natural resources. Our food, cos\u00ad metics, and even our mobile phones cause prob\u00ad lems in other countries, such as deforestation and mining. Perhaps globalisation could be scaled back a bit and more local production could take place again. Do I really need a \"made in China\" product? The Dobbiaco Colloquia is a traditional meeting of the environmental movement in support of a sustainable life. As early as 1998, they declared beauty to be one of the basic needs of human beings. How do you define beauty yourself? For me, beauty is something holistic. It's no use to me if something is beautiful from the outside, but not what's behind it. A product can be beau\u00ad tiful in price, design and quality, but if it is not pro\u00ad duced in a fair way, it is not beautiful for me. This already starts with the original idea: how can I bring wholeness into my product? It's not just the packaging that's part of it. Where do I get my raw materials? How do I treat everyone involved from the farmer to the transporter? It is not enough to say: \"We have 1,000 products, now let's make a green range with five products.\" The cor\u00ad rect - or more beautiful - approach would be to say: \"Where can we take the first steps in the company? What is our objective in terms of work\u00ad \"I find it nice to feel that I am not harming the planet by buying a product.\" As managing director of the green online shop Avocadostore, Mimi Sewalski believes that a sustainable approach makes beautiful things even more beautiful. Why sustainability doesn't have to be perfect - and what that has to do with Goethe. Mimi Sewalski studied soci\u00ad ology and criminology. She has been running Avocado store, Germany's largest online mar\u00ad ketplace for sustainable life\u00ad style, since 2011. As a consult\u00ad ant, she specialises in sustain\u00ad able consumption, fair trade and green entrepreneurship - and gives tips on how to im\u00ad prove. This is also the case in her book Nachhaltig leben jetzt! (Knesebeck, 2020 ).ing in a holistically sustainable way?\" That would be beauty in the whole manufacturing process. The destruction of ecosystems, terrible conditions in factory farming, the blighting of landscapes - all this contradicts our under- standing of beauty. What role does percep- tion play in getting more people to support sustainability? When we founded the Avocadostore in 2010, we wanted to open up a niche that didn't exist before: an online shop for sustainable products. We still had to explain to people what vegan is. When I used the word \"eco\", many people thought of ugly jute clothes and ran away screaming. So we put a lot of emphasis on appealing aesthetics and high\u00adquality product photos. We pretended to be a normal online shop, only with a sustain\u00ad able touch. And not the other way round. \"There's no social business without business.\" This was the only way we could familiarise enough people with the topic of sustainability who might have been overwhelmed at first. That is still our mission today. To tell them: \"Hey, it's not hard to shop in a sustainable way anymore, and by the way, it's really fun.\" And we also lead by example. The beauty of it is: there are more and more people who are really motivated to tackle the issue. How do you select the products? Every one of our products must meet at least one sustainability criterion. We don't just put a green label on it, but always show transparent\u00ad ly why we think something is sustainable. To give our customers the opportunity to question things. Sustainability is not so easy to answer with yes or no. There are already many labels where you can be sure that a certain standard is in place. But there are always products that cannot 67 66FUTURE /// BEAUTY /// THOUGHT LEADERafford these labels. They may be smaller pro\u00ad ducers, but they are more sustainable. Or they are just starting out, but have a great idea. We want to give these products a chance. No one can switch to sustainability overnight, be it privately or in a company. It has to be okay that it's a process. This also generates the most creativity among brands and start\u00adups. Just start small and think of alternatives. If I were to start pointing fingers right away, it would stifle creativity. Does the sustainable aspect make beautiful things even more beautiful? For me personally, yes. When I need something privately, the first thing I always do is see if I can find a sustainable option. Sustainability is more important to me because I find it nice to feel that I am not harming the planet by buying a product. But I can imagine that there are people who are more focused on the brand. But if instead of asking: \"Why is organic so expensive?\" You ask: \"Why is conventional so cheap?\", then you automatically find sustainable things more beautiful. Goethe once said: \"Beauty is a welcome guest everywhere.\" Beauty as a vehicle through which one can trans\u00ad port a lot of content. So if you manage to produce beautiful, sustainable products, that attracts people all the more. What inspired your commitment to the environment? I love nature. There is nothing more beautiful than looking at a flower, leaf shapes or landscapes. Nothing moves me as much as beautiful nature. That's why, for me, sustainability is always about protecting nature. My grandfather was an amateur hunter and I often went with him to the forest. I learned a lot about nature there, but I also saw animals being shot. It does something to you. I knew then that I didn't like that and that it was important to me to protect animals. These cycles in pristine nature, that has something very beauti\u00ad ful for me as a trained sociologist who thinks in systems. The ugly thing is that we humans unfor\u00ad tunately often destroy everything.In your book you give sustainability tips for everyday life. You write that up to 120 in- gredients affect us in skin care. What should we look out for? True beauty comes from within - what sounds like a clich\u00e9, however, is often not self\u00adevident, especially for women. How we look always tells us something about our lives, so we should be kinder to ourselves. But the skin is also our largest organ, and what we put on our skin goes into our body. It's like with food. People say: \"You are what you eat.\" I also think: \"You are what you put on your skin.\" Many people do not know that sub\u00ad stances are absorbed through the skin. That's why it's even more important to know which ingre\u00ad dients are really good for you. Many brands are rather neutral or inconspicuous in their branding and then unfortunately full of microplastics or silicones. For me, it's a nightmare to rub something like that on my face, plus there's the damage to the oceans and the soil. The paradox is: people buy these products because they want to do some\u00ad thing good for themselves - and don't even know what the consequences of some of the listed ingredients are. Do you see a change in the cosmetics industry? A lot has happened in recent years in terms of the aesthetics of packaging. It has become more modern, fresher and appeals to more young people. Many companies are concerned about sus\u00ad tainable packaging. But I also know that it is not that easy. It always depends on the product. Some people can't stand certain materials, glass tends to be heavy, plastic lighter. Things that weigh a lot, however, produce more CO emissions during transport. Sustainability is complicated. The second change I see is this: customers are be\u00ad coming more critical, asking more questions and not just blindly buying something with a green label on it. The demands are increasing. Companies that communicate this well and offer this trans\u00ad parency will be the winners. Because the more customers scrutinise, the more closely they read the packaging and the more the truly sustainable companies benefit.\"These cycles in pristine nature, that has something very beau- tiful for me as a trained sociologist who thinks in systems.

With sustainability comes deceleration, a return to the roots and often the idea that \"less is more\". In the industry I work in, things often have to be higher, faster, further - in every respect. So for me, I very deliber\u00ad ately seek balance in the origins, to realise that you often need almost nothing to be happy, and that the most beautiful moments arise sponta\u00ad neously and by chance, and without excessive lux\u00ad ury. You can apply this to all areas of life. When I harvest food from my own garden, then prepare and enjoy it, it is beautiful and sustainable for me at the same time. Or when I spend the night in the forest and wake up in the morning to birdsong. Is sustainability only possible by absten- tion, or is there such a thing as sustainable consumption? I also enjoy sleeping in a luxury hotel once in a while. For me, however, sustainability definitely entails sacrifice, but above all it simply means conscious consumption. For me, that means asking myself over and over: do I really need that, or am I trying to compensate for other areas with it? Or do I just want to be part of a society that keeps trying to create needs that I don't actually \"I often find that you need almost nothing to be happy.\" Her industry is fast\u00admoving and designed for short\u00adterm success. How does the actress Lena Klenke nevertheless manage to make informed and sustainable decisions in everyday life? Lena Klenke is an actress. She is best known for the Netflix series How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast ).have? For me, sustainability also has to do with cycles, closed cycles. That means not throwing everything away, but also repairing things or find\u00ad ing someone who can still use them, and then thinking about whether you need to replace the product at all. Companies that want to do business in a sustainable manner are in a bind these days. They need to grow and sell more to survive in the market. But they also want to leave the world a better place. Does one rule out the other? Credibility and authenticity are the first things that come to mind. As a customer, I trust brands that stay true to themselves over a long period of time and don't force themselves to keep up with every trend. That's what I appreciate most about Weleda. Since my childhood, I have asso\u00ad ciated a certain scent with these products, and it triggers a certain feeling of security in me. What advice do you have for companies like Weleda? I expect Weleda to remain true to itself, to not forget its values. I expect it to constantly question itself and pay attention to what happens to its products when they are used up. Can I reuse pack\u00ad aging in another way, where can I reduce pack\u00ad aging? The same goes for the ingredients. Cos\u00ad metics and sustainability are definitely areas I can still work on further. I love good cosmetics, and at the same time I know less is more and in the end the skin doesn't need much. \"Do I just want to be part of a society that keeps trying to create needs that I don't actually have?\" 73FUTURE /// BEAUTY /// THOUGHT LEADER Figures from the Weleda world 2,700,000 is how many times we sold our Skin Food in 2020. 97 % recycled plastic is in the new rPET bottles, which are used for our baby products, lotions and the Prickly Pear range.

We thus aim to continuously reduce the use of resources and the volume of waste generated so as to protect the environment and save on costs. Intensity is strongly affected by the capacity utilisation of our facilities: the more products the facilities produce within the operating times, the lower the intensity (improved efficiency ). Capacity utilisation depends primarily on the order situation, over which we have only limited influence. We do have a direct influence on the technical facilities (energy\u00adefficient production facilities ), process control in production (lean workflows and smooth operation ), formulations (cold or hot production of prod\u00ad uct content ) and the avoidance of waste during production and distribution.The following environmental indicators are essential for Weleda: the consumption of potable water and energy as well as the amount of waste in relation to the production volume of finished products and product content. The charts below show the suc\u00ad cesses to date, the current status and our targets up to 2022. The key figures relate to the manufacturing countries of France, Germany and Switzerland. The largest quantities are produced at these locations. Water intensity Potable water consumption in relation to production volume (product content ).

In this way sustainable value added is created that can be distributed to our employees (income ), to pro viders of capital (distribution, interest ), to non\u00adprofit insti\u00ad tutions (donations ) and to the public (taxes ).The value added statement (inside cover page ) illustrates how the economic activities of our company generate value for society: unlike the income statement, which is based on the viewpoint of the owners, the value added statement sets out the contribution made by the Weleda Group to private and public income. The value added statement shows the expenditure with which Weleda achieved its company performance and how the added value generated was distributed.

This means that the growth trend initiated in 2019 was maintained despite the Corona pandemic. All three markets performed very well, with Austria showing particularly dynamic growth of 5.7 per cent. Switzerland With a currency\u00adadjusted increase in sales of 2.5 per cent, the sustained successful performance of Weleda natural and organic cosmetics in Switzerland continues. Growth in all channels exceeded the market. Germany In Germany, we were able to increase our sales of natural and organic cosmetics by a good 1 per cent to around EUR 135 million. Compared to the unusually strong previ\u00ad ous year with growth of 2.5 per cent, the chemist and pharmacy channels showed weaker performance due to the pandemic (declining frequency of shoppers ). Never\u00ad theless, Weleda's growth exceeded the mar\u00ad ket in all channels and we were able to maintain or increase market share. Austria In Austria, we were able to reap the rewards of increased media investments and successful distribution expansion with a 5.7 per cent growth in sales. Sales grew significantly stronger than the market (+1.1 per cent ) with an increase of 4.2 per cent.all our employees, we continue to manage this crisis effectively. In April 2020, we supported health workers in our region by donating masks and other products. Spain Weleda Birch Cellulite Oil is the No. 1 in the anti\u00adcellulite market, with growth of 28 per cent compared to the previous year. The market is losing credibility and is down 9 per cent. This means that we are the only brand that is growing, that has cus\u00ad tomers' trust and that is gaining market share. We also attribute this positive devel\u00ad opment to a 360\u00addegree brand campaign, which enabled us to increase sales and brand awareness. Italy Despite the particularly big challenges in Italy resulting from the pandemic, we man\u00ad aged to achieve double\u00addigit growth in natural cosmetics. Our market success was essentially supported by online campaigns and parallel activities in our sales channels and by the birch, prickly pear, skin food and Christmas campaigns. Supporting the local medical staff of hospitals and associa\u00ad tions with our products (hand creams, body showers, facial care ) generated great appreciation and gratitude.Baby care Boosted by the design relaunch, TV support and the No. 1 midwife recommen\u00ad dation, Weleda Baby 2020 became the fastest\u00adgrowing baby care brand in the German food retail sector with sales growth of 18 per cent (sell\u00adout ). Growth was 2.3 per cent in chemists. We were able to increase our market share in both channels to 21.7 per cent (+0.6 percent \u00ad age points ).The North America region North America Despite the challenges caused by the pandemic, we were able to achieve double\u00ad digit growth for the third year in a row. Customer footfall at Whole Foods, our larg\u00ad est brick\u00adand\u00admortar customer, declined by 30 to 40 per cent from March, leading to sales declines in this channel. However, the restructured e\u00adcommerce team managed an online growth of 31 per cent. Additional growth came from expansion in the retail sector. Northern Europe region United Kingdom We usually come into contact with thou\u00ad sands of people during the year by distrib\u00ad uting samples at events. In view of the pandemic restrictions and the cancellation of events, we decided to refocus our usual consumer outreach and support crit\u00ad ical care workers instead. In the past few months, we donated more than 65,000 products to intensive care units, including Pharma D - A - CH Pharma sales in the D - A - CH region declined by 7 per cent. The coronavirus regulations resulted in a slowdown of the cold season and thus a decrease in cold medicines. Instead, other medicines came into focus. Having products in various fields of com\u00ad petence paid off. For example, Arnica oint\u00ad ment and Calendula wound ointment were more in demand - obviously because of the demand for care due to the use of dis\u00ad infectants and masks. Ophthalmic prepara\u00ad tions did well in Switzerland throughout the year. This resulted in a slight increase in sales there. Southern Europe region France Weleda France was heavily affected by the pandemic in spring 2020. With the dis\u00ad continuation of reimbursement for homoe\u00ad opathic medicinal products and the sub\u00ad sequent reorganisation of our pharmaceu\u00ad tical activities, we had to face additional challenges. Thanks to the commitment of about 45,000 units of Skin Food cream. Our Calendula skin ointment was particu\u00ad larly popular as it soothes the abrasions and bruises caused by FFP3 masks. #1 Weleda Birch Cellulite Oil is the market leader in Spain.Weleda - the fastest\u00adgrowing brand in the German food retail sector +18 % increase in baby care sales in German food retail. Product donations for caregivers in the UK (above ) and Italy (below ) were received with gratitude. Weleda in the markets Our markets performed positively in 2020 despite the coronavirus pandemic. Our products could still be sold in chemists, supermarkets, pharmacies and online. More detailed figures can be found on pages 89 and 94. In their short reports, the countries focused on different priorities. 90 91MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT REPORTBenelux In the Netherlands, Weleda is growing faster than the market year after year and is a pioneer in sustainability. We have consistently relied on solar energy and are now climate\u00adneutral. We underpin our social responsibility through partnerships with several sustainability organisations. In Bel\u00ad gium, we continued to position Weleda as a premium brand, for example by increas\u00ad ing our presence in pharmacies. Highlight Belgium: cooperation on biodi\u00ad versity with the Meise Botanical Garden in Brussels. Scandinavia We were able to significantly increase sales in pharmacies in 2020. The biggest increase in sales was in Norway, where most new online and pharmacy customers were added, but Denmark also showed stable and remarkable growth. Sales repre\u00ad sentatives successfully started visiting shops digitally instead of physically, and on\u00ad line training for consumers and customers has been very successful.Ukraine Weleda Ukraine recorded the highest annual growth in the history of the branch. The strong performance in online trading, supported by various marketing measures, led to an increase in sales in all product categories. Export Central and Eastern Europe We also saw renewed sales growth in our export markets, mainly through our entry into the Gulf region. We are pleased with the stable sales performance in the exist\u00ad ing markets in Central and Eastern Europe. The Baltic states are particularly note\u00ad worthy here.Central and Eastern Europe region Russia In Russia, we were able to increase sales by quickly adapting to the changed and challenging environment caused by the pan\u00ad demic. We saw a strong performance in the online business. We supported this with successful digital marketing activities including social media marketing and collab \u00ad oration with influencers. In addition, there were activities such as Green Friday, where we donated 20 per cent of the day's sales to an eco\u00adfund, or the creation of the Weleda Garden in the snowy ski resort of Rosa Khutor. Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland We were able to react quickly to the closure of retail stores by expanding our online trade. The result is growth of over 40 per cent. In the Polish market, we succeeded in setting the course in the right direction, both in sales and market\u00ad ing, which enabled us to increase sales significantly. As part of the preparations for the 100th anniversary, we gave a new coat of paint to the cars of our sales representatives and to a tram that travels all over Prague. South America region Brazil A highlight was the Sleep flash campaign for Ansiodoron. The aim of the campaign was to provide information about the importance of sleep and to promote our product Ansiodoron.Asia / Pacific region Australia Weleda products have been in the Price\u00ad line pharmacy chain since 2020. Weleda Australia can look back on a brilliant year with around 35 per cent growth in natural and organic cosmetics. During the first wave of the pandemic, Weleda Australia supplied skin food to several hospitals. Skin food was also supplied to fire brigades during the bushfires.New Zealand Sales through our online shop grew very strongly due to the impact of the pan\u00ad demic. At the peak of the lockdown, we had over 1,000 visitors a day. South Korea In May 2020, we succeeded in listing Weleda at Olive Young in the Myeong\u00ad dong shopping district in Seoul - this is the flagship store of the largest chemis chain in Korea with 1,240 branches. In April 2020, Weleda Birch Cellulite Oil was selected as the best eco brand product in the Body category in Marie Claire magazine and won the annual Prix d'Excellence.Increased sales in online retail were a success factor in many markets in 2020. We have had a partnership with the Meise Botanical Garden in Belgium since 2020. The partnership is a good fit for Weleda. It is an organisation with a high profile that shares the same values with us.As part of the preparations for the 100th anniversary, we gave a new coat of paint to a tram that travels all over Prague.Weleda is now available in the flagship store of Olive Young, the largest chemist chain in South Korea. +35 % Weleda Australia can look back on a brilliant business year. 92 93MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT REPORTThird\u00adparty sales per companyStructure of third\u00adparty sales per companyEmployees (Full\u00adtime employees ) as at December 31st Currency in 1,0002020 Change from previous year in local currencyPharma\u00ad ceuticalsNatural and organic cosmetics2020 2019 Switzerland CHF 40,268 + 0.9 % 36 % 64 % 336 339 Weleda AG, Arlesheim EUR 37,617 Germany EUR 175,267 - 1.4 % 18 % 82 % 762 776 Weleda AG, Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd France EUR 78,152 - 12.6 % 33 % 67 % 361 379 Weleda S.

Business performance Financial year 2020 was heavily impacted by the uncertainties of the Covid\u00ad19 pandemic. The total sales of the Weleda Group decreased last year from EUR 429 million to EUR 424 million. The natural and organic cosmetics and the pharmaceuticals busi\u00ad ness segments had di vergent performances. Total sales of natural and organic cosmetics increased by around two per cent com\u00ad pared to last year. However, the total sales of pharmaceuticals decreased by 11 per cent. The distribution of growth in natural and organic cosmetics shows that the internationalisation strategy continues to work, as all regions contributed to growth. Only France saw a decline in sales. In the pharmaceuticals business segment, all regions except Switzerland, South America and Asia / Pacific recorded declines in sales. The City Spas that opened last year in the Netherlands and Germany were closed most of the time due to the pandemic and the associated lockdown. The operating result was increased by EUR six million to EUR 22 million in 2020 due to cost savings. However, due to higher exchange rate losses and higher tax expenses, the con\u00ad solidated annual result decreased by EUR five million compared to 2019. The profit generated, combined with stable net working capital, enabled both the equity ratio and the net financial assets, and thus the company's resilience, to be further increased. Pio\u00ad neering decisions about the future are only possible on the solid basis which was steadily established in recent years. The most important decisions for the coming years include the renewal of our infrastructure with the core element of a new logistics building in Germany as well as the modernisation and expansion of the production facilities, investments in research and devel op\u00ad ment both for natural and organic cosmetics and increasingly for pharmaceutical products, the expansion of our service offerings, digital transformation, and the further development of our sus\u00ad tainability programme. Employees In 2020 the Weleda Group employed 2,177 full\u00adtime equivalents on average for the year (previous year: 2,168 ) Weleda AG had an average for of 1,105 full\u00adtime equivalents (previous year: 1,103 ). Risk assessment Risks are an integral part of business operations. A risk manage\u00ad ment system that enables the identification, analysis, control and monitoring of significant risks in the corporate environment is therefore particularly important for Weleda. In order to identi\u00ad fy risks in good time and determine the appropriate action, our management regularly assesses, at Group level and at the level of Weleda AG, any significant internal and external risks that may impact the entire corporate environment. The Board of Directors discusses and approves the results of the risk assessment and associated measures each year. Development of sales The net sales of the Weleda Group for the 2020 financial year amount to EUR 424.1 million (previous year: EUR 429.3 million ). This corresponds to a change of - 1.2 per cent, or EUR - 5.2 million, compared with the previous year (adjusted for exchange rate ef\u00ad fects: - 0.2 per cent, or EUR - 0.7 million ). As a result, Weleda was able to hold its own in 2020 in a highly competitive market that was strongly affected by the pandemic and its consequences. The net sales of the individual company Weleda AG decreased by 3.7 per cent (CHF 11.3 million ) compared to the previous year, mainly driven by the translation of the German branch into CHF.

Sales in this region dropped slightly by 0.5 per cent to EUR 210.6 million (previous year: EUR 211.8 million ). Sales in France decreased by 12.6 per cent and amounted to EUR 78.2 million (previous year: EUR 89.4 million ). Sales in the other regions in\u00ad creased by a total of 5.6 per cent to EUR 135.3 million (previous year: EUR 128.1 million ). The exchange rate effect on sales was negative and amounted to EUR 5.5 million.Result for the year The consolidated result for the year, at EUR 7.7 million, was 40.8 per cent below the previous year's. At EUR - 3.4 million, the financial result was below the previous year's level (previous year: EUR - 0.5 million ). The main reasons are unrealised exchange losses, especially due to the weakening of the US dollar and the Brazilian real against the euro. Income taxes increased to EUR 11.3 million (previous year: EUR 2.5 million ), mainly due to the better result in Weleda AG and a one\u00adoff tax correction in Ger\u00ad many in connection with the harmonisation of the transfer pric\u00ad ing model. In the separate financial statements of Weleda AG a profit for the year of CHF 10.6 million was recorded (previous year: profit of CHF 0.2 million ).Financial and assets situation As a consequence of the net result, the equity ratio of the Weleda Group increased again, by 0.9 percentage points to 53.8 per cent (previous year: 52.9 per cent ). Consolidated cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 38.0 million (previous year: EUR 26.6 million ). Cash flow from investing activities decreased by EUR 3.0 million year\u00adon\u00ad year to EUR 11.3 million (2011: EUR 14.3 million ). Of the gross investments of EUR 11.6 million, EUR 1.6 million was invested in intangible assets and EUR 10.0 million in property, plant and equipment. Around two thirds of the investments in property, plant and equipment or intangible assets were made at the two main production sites in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd and Arlesheim. Cash flow after investing activities amounted to EUR 26.7 million (previous year: EUR 12.3 million ). Cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 25.6 million to EUR 73.3 million at the end of the year. This resulted in a net financial credit balance of EUR 73.3 million (previous year: EUR 47.7 million ). Cash flow from operating activities for Weleda AG amounted to CHF 18.7 million (previous year: CHF 26.0 million ) in the year under review and, after the deduction of net investments of CHF 8.1 million (previous year: CHF 16.5 million ), still came to CHF 10.6 million (previous year: CHF 9.5 million ). Weleda AG did not repay any interest\u00adbearing liabilities in the year under review (previous year: CHF 2.7 million ). Operating result The consolidated operating result (EBIT ) of the Weleda Group in\u00ad creased by EUR 6.4 million or 40.3 per cent to EUR 22.3 million (previous year: EUR 15.9 million ). This is mainly due to the sharp decrease in expenditure due to the uncertainties surrounding the Covid\u00ad19 pandemic. The operating result in the separate financial statements of Weleda AG increased by CHF 19.4 million to CHF 23.0 million com\u00ad pared to the previous year.remedies in the basic insurance. In the other markets sales fell by 6.2 per cent year on year after adjustment for exchange rates. Global sales in the natural and organic cosmetics business seg\u00ad ment increased by a total of 1.9 per cent despite the challenges posed by the Covid\u00ad19 pandemic. However, growth flattened out (pre vious year: increase of 6.3 per cent ). Sales increased by 2.0 per cent in the D - A - CH region. Eastern Europe increased by 5.1 per cent. The USA also performed well, with an 11.3 per cent increase in sales compared to the previous year. France, on the other hand, suffered a decline in sales of 9.0 per cent, mainly due to the general performance of the natural and organic cos\u00ad metics market in France. Sales growth in all other countries to\u00ad talled 7.4 per cent. Development of sales in the business segments Natural and organic cosmetics accounted for EUR 333.2 million or 78.6 per cent of global sales (previous year: EUR 327.0 mil\u00ad lion or 76.2 per cent ). The sales generated by pharmaceuticals decreased to EUR 90.9 million (previous year: EUR 102.3 million ), corresponding to 21.4 per cent of global sales (previous year: 23.8 per cent ). Global sales of the pharmaceuticals business segment de\u00ad creased by 11.2 per cent in 2020 (previous year: decrease of 2.3 per cent ). In the D - A - CH region, which accounted for around 51 per cent of sales, the sales figure fell by around 7.1 per cent compared to the previous year. The lack of a flu outbreak is pri\u00ad marily responsible for the slump in sales. The growth impetus came from the South America region. Here sales rose by 19.6 per cent after adjustment for exchange rates. In France, sales de\u00ad clined by 19.2 per cent compared to the previous year, mainly due to the discontinuation of the reimbursement of homeopathic Market performance of the Weleda Group by region in million EUR (exchange rate\u00adadjusted changes from the previous year ) Total: EUR 424.1 millionD - A - CH Germany, Austria, Switzerland210.6 (- 1.1 %) Central and Eastern Europe with Middle East and Africa Russia, Czech Republic, Ukraine, CEE, MEA22.7 (+ 11.6 %) Northern Europe Benelux, United Kingdom, Scandinavia41.0 (+ 6.8 %) Southern Europe France, Italy, Spain97.7 (- 9.2 %) North America 21.7 (+ 13.3 %) South America 15.1 (+ 18.3 %) Asia / Pacific 15.3 (+ 12.7 %) Operating result (EBIT ) in million EUR 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 23.921.1 18.715.922.3Result attributable to shareholders in million EUR 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 11.214.3 12.913.07.8 Investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in million EUR 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 7.610.9 12.914.512.4Natural and organic cosmetics and pharmaceuticals Weleda Group Total: EUR 424.1 millionWeleda natural and organic cosmetics78.6 % Weleda pharmaceuticals 21.4 % 96 97MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT REPORT Consolidated Annual Financial Report 2020 Weleda Group BALANCE SHEET OF THE WELEDA GROUP 100 INCOME STATEMENT OF THE WELEDA GROUP 101 CASH FLOW STATEMENT OF THE WELEDA GROUP 102 STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY OF THE WELEDA GROUP 103 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE WELEDA GROUP 104 REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITOR 116 Statutory auditor Ernst & Young AG Basel, Switzerland Corporate headquarters Weleda AG Dychweg 14, 4144 Arlesheim, Switzerland Tel. +41 www.weleda.com, www.weleda.ch Branch in AG Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd Germany Tel. +49 7171 91 90 www.weleda.deContact person for shareholders Paul Mackay, Chairman of the Board of Directors Secretariat and share register Sabine Lexen Tel. +41 61 705 22 02Extraordinary events In the year under review there were no significant extraordinary events. Research and development activities The growth of natural and organic cosmetics was mainly driven by market expansion and innovation. Weleda is continuing to build up its expertise in pharmaceutical research. For both seg\u00ad ments together, Weleda again invested double\u00addigit millions in research and development this year. Outlook for 2021 For 2021, we are confident that due to the current market situ\u00ad ation, the planned innovations, the market presence and the brand strength of Weleda in many countries, good growth oppor\u00ad tunities still exist for natural and organic cosmetics, despite the ongoing uncertainties caused by the pandemic. For the pharma\u00ad ceuticals we expect stable sales at Group level. Overall, we ex\u00ad pect that the decisions taken for the future, such as investments in research and development, the implementation of the pharma\u00ad ceutical strategy, the product range strategy for natural and organ\u00ad ic cosmetics and the further expansion of markets in and outside Europe, will lead to higher costs in 2021, but that these invest\u00ad ments will be reflected in a better operating result in the medium and long term. In summary, we therefore expect a slightly higher total sales with a slightly lower operating result and a constant net result compared to the past year. 98MANAGEMENT REPORT 99Balance sheet of the Weleda Group Assets in 1,000 EUR Notes 31.12.2020 31.12.2019 Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 73,277 47,689 Trade receivables 1 61,002 66,536 Other current receivables 2 5,850 11,135 Inventories 3 62,512 68,241 Prepaid expenses and 4,143 5,428 Total current assets 206,784 199,029 Non\u00adcurrent assets Financial 1,506 1,677 Investments in non\u00adcontrolling interests 4 1,261 1,019 Property, plant and equipment 4 71,274 72,599 4 3,999 Total assets 284,824 and shareholders' equity in 1,000 EUR Notes 31.12.2020 31.12.2019 Liabilities Current liabilities Trade payables 5 18,181 20,176 Other current liabilities 6 12,374 11,552 Current provisions 7 6,199 3,362 Accrued expenses and income 20,147 21,580 Total current liabilities 56,901 56,670 Non\u00adcurrent Shareholders' equity Share capital 3,800 3,800 Non\u00advoting share capital 7,600 7,600 Capital reserves 8,716 8,716 Retained earnings 133,222 126,715 Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares 8 -

Key figures and changes are calculated based on the exact amount and not the reported rounded amount. Consolidation principles Accounting principles This Annual Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with uniform accounting standards (Weleda Accounting Manual ). These accounting standards comply with the provisions on commercial accounting of the Swiss Code of Obligations (article 957 - 963 b OR ). The consolidated financial statements of the Weleda Group comply with the law and the articles of incorporation. Certain items of the balance sheet as well as the income statement are summarised in order to provide the reader with a better overview. These items are explained in detail in the notes. Scope of consolidation In addition to Weleda AG Arlesheim and its branch Weleda AG Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 24 subsidiaries are fully consolidated within the Weleda Group statements. These companies are, without exception, Group com panies and controlled by Weleda AG Arlesheim. Weleda AG has direct or indirect investments of more than 50 per cent in these companies. In the year under review Weleda Immobilien GmbH was incorporated and added to the scope of consolidation. The non\u00adcontrolling interest in Japan is consolidated using the equity method. The consolidated companies are listed in the notes. Consolidation method The consolidated financial statements are based on the annual statements of the Group companies as at December 31st 2020, which are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Weleda Accounting Manual. The consolidation period is the calendar year. Capital consolidation is carried out in accordance with the Anglo\u00adSaxon purchase method. For the fully consolidated companies, assets, liabilities, expens\u00ad es and income are stated at 100 per cent. Non\u00adcontrolling interests in consolidated shareholders' equity and profit / loss for the year are disclosed separately. The carrying amounts of the parent company's investment are offset against the current shareholders' equity of the subsidiary companies. In accordance with the full consolidation method, assets and liabil\u00ad ities as well as expenses and income also of those companies in which a third party is involved are in\u00ad cluded in full in the Group accounts. Third\u00adparty shares of shareholders' equity and of the results of consolidated companies are disclosed separately. Currency translation The financial statements of consolidated companies in foreign currencies are translated as follows: current assets, non\u00adcurrent assets and liabilities are translated at year\u00adend rates (rate on balance sheet date ), shareholders' equity at historical rates. The income statement and the cash flow statement are translated using average rates for the year. The resulting currency translation effects are booked directly in retained earnings without impacting profit and loss. The following currency exchange rates are applied:Intragroup transactions, balances and intercompany profits All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated, as were all intercompany profits stated in the balance sheet. Balance sheet and valuation principles In general, assets and liabilities are valued on an individual basis in so far as they are material and cannot be treated together as a group as is customary due to their similarity. Sales recognition Sales are recognised on the transfer of risks and benefits to customers or upon provision of the service. This generally corresponds to delivery of the products. Current assets Receivables and other current assets are reported at their nominal values. The general risk of loss and individual credit risk have been accounted for on the basis of value adjustments. The valuation of inven\u00ad tories is conducted on the basis of acquisition or production cost while observing the principle of lower of cost or market. Non\u00adcurrent assets Acquired intangible assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition, less amortisation. Property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition or production cost minus depreciation. Small\u00advalue intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a value of less than EUR 1,000 are depreciated in full in the year they are added. Financial assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition. Equity holdings are consolidated using the equity method. Where there are indications of non\u00adcurrent assets being overvalued, carrying values have been reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted. Liabilities Liabilities are recognised based on their nominal value. Provisions for pension plans and similar obli\u00ad gations are determined based on actuarial principles. The remaining provisions cover all recognisable risks for un determined obligations. Liabilities are recognised at the respective amount at which they are to be repaid.YEAR-END RATES in EUR 2020 Rates on balance sheet date2020 Average rates2019 Rates on balance sheet date2019 Average CHF (Swiss franc ) 105 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT WELEDA GROUP ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2020 /// WELEDA GROUPNotes to the balance sheet and the income statement 1 Trade receivables 2 Other current receivables 3 Inventoriesin 1,000 EUR 31.12.2020 31.12.2019 From third parties 60,307 65,862 From companies in which a non\u00adcontrolling interest is held 521 511 From shareholders 174 163 Total trade receivables 61,002 66,536 in 1,000 EUR 31.12.2020 31.12.2019 From third parties 5,843 11,128 From companies in which a non\u00adcontrolling interest is held 7 7 Total other current receivables 5,850 11,135 in 1,000 EUR 31.12.2020 31.12.2019 Raw, auxiliary and operating materials 16,655 17,862 Unfinished products 8,790 11,201 Finished products and trade goods 41,021 41,506 Value adjustments on inventories - 3,954 - 2,328 Total inventories 62,512 68,241Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares are recognised at cost at the time of acquisition.

Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the consoli\u00ad dation and valuation principles as set out in the notes. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further respon\u00ad sible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are rea\u00ad sonable in the circumstances. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these con\u00ad solidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable as\u00ad surance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures se\u00ad lected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the consolidated financial state\u00ad ments in order to design audit procedures that are ap\u00ad propriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2020 comply with Swiss law and the consolidation and valuation principles as set out in the notes. Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licens\u00ad ing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA ) and in\u00ad dependence (article 728 CO ) and that there are no circum\u00ad stances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728 a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We recommend that the consolidated financial state\u00ad ments submitted to you be approved.

Key figures and changes are calculated based on the exact amount and not the reported rounded amount. Accounting principles This Annual Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with uniform accounting standards (Weleda Accounting Manual ). These accounting standards comply with the provisions on commercial accounting of the Swiss Code of Obligations (article 957 - 963 b OR ). The Annual Financial Report of Weleda AG complies with the law and the articles of incorporation. Certain items of the balance sheet as well as the income statement are summarised in order to provide the reader with a better overview. These items are explained in detail in the notes. Currency translation The accounts of the German business establishment are stated in euro and translated at year\u00adend as follows: current assets, non\u00adcurrent assets and liabilities are translated at year\u00adend rate (rate on balance sheet date ), shareholders' equity at historical rate. The income statement and the cash flow statement are translated using the average rate for the year. The resulting currency translation effects are booked directly in the income statement. The following currency exchange rates are applied: Balance sheet and valuation principles In general, assets and liabilities are valued on an individual basis in so far as they are material and cannot be treated together as a group as is customary due to their similarity. Sales recognition Sales are recognised on the transfer of risks and benefits to customers or upon provision of the service. This generally corresponds to delivery of the products. Current assets Receivables and other current assets are reported at their nominal values. The general risk of loss and individual credit risk have been accounted for on the basis of value adjustments. The valuation of inven\u00ad tories is conducted on the basis of acquisition or production cost while observing the prin ciple of lower of cost or market.YEAR-END RATE in CHF 2020 Rate on balance sheet date2020 Average rate2019 Rate on balance sheet date2019 Average rate 1 EUR (euro ) 1.082 1.070 1.087 1.112Non\u00adcurrent assets Acquired intangible assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition, less amortisation. Property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition or production cost minus depreciation. Small\u00advalue intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a value of less than CHF 1,080 / EUR 1,000 are depreci\u00ad ated in full in the year they are added. Financial assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition. Equity investments are also recognised at acquisition values and depreciated over five years. Additions to equity investments of less than CHF 100,000 are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition. Where there are indications of non\u00adcurrent assets being overvalued, carrying values have been reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted. Liabilities Liabilities are recognised on the basis of nominal value. Provisions for pension plans and similar obli\u00ad gations are determined based on actuarial principles. The remaining provisions covered all recognisable risks for un determined obligations. Liabilities are recognised at the respective amount at which they are to be repaid. Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares are recognised at cost at the time of acquisition. The holding of treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares is disclosed as a negative item in equity. Upon resale, the profit or loss is allocated directly to the voluntary retained earnings.

Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the re\u00ad quirements of Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, im\u00ad plementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further respon\u00ad sible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are rea\u00ad sonable in the circumstances. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these finan\u00ad cial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and per\u00ad form the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material mis\u00ad statement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial state\u00ad ments, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal con\u00ad trol system relevant to the entity's preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also in\u00ad cludes evaluating the appropriateness of the account\u00ad ing policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall pres\u00ad entation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appro\u00ad priate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2020 comply with Swiss law and the com\u00ad pany's articles of incorporation. Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licens\u00ad ing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA ) and in\u00ad dependence (article 728 CO ) and that there are no circum\u00ad stances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728 a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the com\u00ad pany's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

The non\u00adprofit association promotes the respectful procurement of natural raw materials. The ambitious standard for ethical procurement promotes sus\u00ad tainable economic growth, local development and the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity. In accordance with our purpose \"unfold health and beauty in harmony with human and nature\", we have implemented the UEBT standard as a sustainability management system along all our natural raw material supply chains. In 2018, UEBT offered a certification programme for ethical pro\u00ad curement. UEBT certifies procurement systems of companies that respect people and biodiversity. As a UEBT member, we are committed to innovation and procure\u00ad ment practices that contribute to a world in which people and bio\u00ad diversity can thrive. With this in mind, and as part of our sustain\u00ad ability strategy, we have decided to go one step further in our com\u00ad mitment and introduce the certification of our Ethical Sourcing System (ESS ) for all our natural raw materials used in our natural and organic cosmetics products. A subsequent risk analysis will help us to identify the need for lasting improvements and to determine what measures must be taken. As a next step, and as part of the certification programme, we are committed to taking further action along defined, so\u00adcalled priori\u00ad tised supply chains. This will allow us to reach even more actors and areas for cultivation and wild collection to improve ethical sourcing wherever necessary. We achieved the first certification in 2018 and had a second successful audit in June 2019. In 2020, no further ESS certification audit was carried out due to the pandemic, but we nevertheless continued to implement all the necessary measures within the framework of the legal measures.Certification scope in figures 2020 We had 657 approved supply chains, which means that 100 per cent of the raw materials used were evaluated. In 2020 we purchased 245 natural raw materials from 150 sup\u00ad pliers for natural and organic cosmetics. 133 of our supply chains are defined as prioritised for verifica\u00ad tion. Verification means that we confirm the information we have received from our suppliers for evaluation through on\u00adsite audits. Due to pandemic restrictions, only six audits were conducted in 2020. With the audits already carried out in previous years, the current status is as follows: - 47 audits conducted - 3 desktop assessments (in 2021 ) - 14 audits planned (in 2021 ) - 22 at planning stage - 47 under review to determine whether audit is required Of the 47 audits carried out - 12 suppliers have already implemented their measures - 29 suppliers have planned the implementation of the necessary measures - 6 suppliers still have to prepare action plans. The measures mentioned are defined by the audits carried out at suppliers and include improvements in the social and environ\u00ad mental areas. The follow\u00adup of the implementation of measures is carried out by our employees, a final check and approval are car\u00ad ried out by UEBT and Weleda in accordance with the dual control principle. This is how we ensure our positive influence on people and nature. 2021 target Verification of all remaining prioritised supply chains Follow\u00adup of supplier measures and completion of verification audits The corrective measures from last year's audit are mainly adjust\u00ad ments in our process descriptions and internal training. These measures were implemented in 2020, but will need to be further adjusted in 2021. This is primarily due to process improvements, such as the introduction of an online tool at UEBT, which will be used to evaluate all data from 2021 onwards. Further internal training, revision of communication guidelinesObservation In 2020, not all audits were carried out as planned, mainly due to travel restrictions. New supply chains are also added every year, so that the number of supply chains to be verified is constantly increasing. Internal training measures with all relevant departments were carried out in 2020 too, in order to better explain the requirements of the certification and their importance in day\u00adto\u00adday work. This training was conducted for research and development, marketing and project management, and may be repeated regularly. The current certification is valid until June 2021. We have noticed a strong interest in UEBT and the contents of the standard on the part of our suppliers. As a result of the audits, a number of suppliers have now decided to become members themselves.What are the guiding principles of the UEBT standard? Biodiversity conservation Sustainable use of biodiversity Sharing of benefits between companies and communities through the use of biodiversity Traceability to identify the origins of the natural ingredients Compliance with national and international regulations Adequate working conditions for employees and ensuring local food security No \"land grabbing\", instead measures to prevent illegal use What is the UEBT? The Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT ) provides a globally recog\u00ad nised standard for ethical trade in natural resources. The non\u00adprofit organisation is an offshoot of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD ) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development ). 138 139NOTES /// UEBT CERTIFICATION NOTES /// UEBT CERTIFICATION Transparent and solid business management Weleda places great value on a transparent management structure and an open communication culture.
