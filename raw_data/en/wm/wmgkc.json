In addition she intents to share her knowledge of understanding vibrations in the human energy field, the impact of thought forms, transmutation of negative energy/vibrations, and healing the physical, mental, and emotional (PME) bodies with those who have an interest in spiritual healing, and other energy healing modalities. [Back to top]() UNIVERSAL ENERGY HEALING / SPIRITUAL HEALING Universal energy healing or spiritual healing is the act of using God's Divine Healing Energy for healing. The healer acts as a tool for this energy to flow through. This act of healing can be done in person or at a distance. Since Universal Energy is so powerful, the healer can treat severe and minor ailments remotely. Most distant healing is done en masse, but people with severe illnesses are treated individually. This ministry does not advocate the absence of medical treatment. If you are ill, please see a doctor. Remember that all healing through this ministry is of God, not of man. FAITH Haven\\\\\\\\'t you wondered what your minister meant when he/she taught on this: \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.\" To believe in what you cannot see, touch, or smell. This is an act of faith. This act shows your obedience to God. Imagine, if you may, your faith manifesting your desires on earth. No matter what your desires are, faith can make it happen. I know faith works. I am a witness to the manifestation that faith can bring. Faith showed me that physical problems can disappear as fast as they appeared. This sounds easier than it is, because faith requires patience, dedication, positive confession, and a constant reminder to yourself that you have what you have asked God for, when everything around you says, you don\\\\\\\\'t. Miracles do happen everyday, everywhere, and they can happen to anyone whose belief is strong enough. [Back to top]() LETTER TO THE CHURCH Reverend Starlene Joyner Burns is a Universal Energy Healer and a Spiritual Healer. She was called into the healing ministry through a dream. Since that time she has trained in spiritual healing, universal energy healing, and Spiritual Science. In her dream, she saw herself laying on of hands to invoke the healing power of God. Later Reverend Burns discovered that the laying on of hands (alone) did not activate the divine powers of God. So she prepared herself for this responsibility through studying the theory and practice of energy medicine, and by healing her own physical, mental, and emotional (PME) bodies. Now she is ready to share this knowledge of spiritual healing, through energy application, with those in need of self-transformation and healing. Reverend Burns continues to seek God\\\\\\\\'s divine guidance through dreams, visions, and prophesies. This gift that God is sending through her is only a catalyst of things to come into this world. Many of us have forgotten the powers that Jesus the Christ channeled while walking the earth. Don\\\\\\\\'t think for a second that when Reverend Burns began to obey God that she was embraced by the church. She has encountered many opposing forces, but it is her mission to be obedient; it is not her call to be accepted by those who cannot accept one of God\\\\\\\\'s chosen. Reverend Burns is a person that follows the divine law of love, in which, she makes a conscience effort every day not to allow any negativity to interfere with her mission and lifestyle. She is not one who only speaks of these things, but one who faithfully and fearfully abides by this law. If you are interested in Reverend Burns performing a spiritual healing service in your church, kindly send a letter of invitation to the address above or send a list of those in need of healing with the following information: name, illness, and date of birth (this distinguishes like names). Until then, may God continue uplifting your church through the spiritual gifts of the people in your congregation. \"The gifts of the spirit are alive and active in this world today.\" Sincerely, [Back to top]() FREE DISTANT HEALING REQUEST Healing must be requested. Your healing request will be processed in turn. The maximum amount of time for distant healing is three months, after which, your name will be removed from our healing list.

FREE HEALING CROSS Jesus, Paul, Elijah, and Elisha were able to transfer the healing power of God into cloth (aprons, handkerchiefs, and their garments). As the power flowed through them, the energy would be absorbed into whatever their bodies came in contact with. We believe that the healing power of God is not only transferable at a distance and directly to people, but it can also be transferred into objects. This ministry believes that crystals store energy, and we have transfer this divine healing energy of God into these mineral crosses. These crosses are offered to you free of cost. Nothing is free, you say; but God\\\\\\\\'s power is always free. If you would like a free cross, submit your request to the address below with a self-addressed (first-class) stamped envelope. The cross is approximately 1\" x 5/8\", and only one cross will be sent per self-address stamped envelope, and limited to 1 cross per household. If you send more that one self-address envelop, you will only get 1 cross and all unused envelopes will be returned to you. Since I do not sell my healing services, I will not allow anyone else to use my products for financial gain. Therefore, I will use discernment regarding any request for more than one cross.
