Also Etowa, Jesty, & Vukic (2011), indicated that Aboriginal people have a holistic definition of health that involves a balance of emotional, mental, spiritual and emotional health which has its origins in the medicine wheel and that cultural traditions such as sweat lodges, talking circles, drumming circles, and smudging are crucial elements of healing and empowerment. The medicine wheel is used as a tool to emphasize the need for bal\u00acance between these dimensions of life, as well as the holistic In the book, The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, Anne Fadiman explores the cultural collision between the Hmong Lee family and their American doctors. Along with the culture clash, the social stigma against the Hmong family brings to light a lot of the systematic, moral, and ethical issues that can arise in our healthcare. Ultimately, the combination of the cultural clash in medical perspectives, the underlying social stigma, the inadequate treatment, and the miscommunication hindered the proper diagnosis and recovery of led to the demise of the Hmong child. However, many of the problems could have been easily avoided or resolved with more patience, objectivity, and most importantly, cultural competence. Cross-cultural methods and approaches should be taken to accommodate for the diverse patient population in our communities. It is a story about a family who shows so much loyalty to their traditions and cultures, but it clashes with the strict American \"norm\" and creates conflict for their most prized possession, their daughter. Young Lia's health is at risk when the doctors are trying to treat her epilepsy, but the culture barrier between them and her parents put her at risk. Lia's parents, Nao Kao and Foua Lee believe that their ancient traditions and healing is what Lia needs in order to get better, but Lia's doctors prescribe her with many prescriptions to help with the seizures and her parent's inability to read or speak English to communicate Family is the fundamental building block of all societies. It is all inclusive across generations and cultures. Based on the epic poem The Odyssey and current families today, we see that family is where we learn to love ourselves and each other, to bear one another's burdens, to find meaning in our life and to give purpose to other's lives, and to feel the value of being part of something greater than ourselves. Family is where we experience our biggest triumphs, deepest vulnerabilities, and where we have the greatest potential to do good. Family is key. In the book, The Other Wes Moore by Wes Moore, it is about two boys that grew up in the same area with the same name. The book talks about how one boy becomes a Rhode Scholar and the other is serving life in prison from an armed robbery shooting. The events happen are because of their family and how they influence them. In the book, The Other Wes Moore, the author explores the idea of family to develop the theme of having a supportive family is the difference between being successful and failing your goals. The split horn took place many years ago in the 19th century. The journey was where Hmong took his family and travel to Wisconsin. When Hmong and the minster Paja the had many different thoughts on the physical need of the spiritual. A common theme that has been discussed regarding the adversities that immigrants experience when arriving to the America are the social and cultural clashes between immigrants and citizens. What I find interesting is the conflicts pertaining to the health care system. Based on previous lectures, immigrants tend to mistrust the American healthcare system due to difference in medical remedies and the language spoken. I know first hand that my mother would perfer to have a Ghanaian physician, as opposed to the general white American doctor. Anne Fadiman wrote a successful award-winning book called, The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, which highlights how the cultural differences between the Hmong culture and American medicine jeopardized the health of a little girl named Lia Lee. The story brings into light the topic of Medical anthropology, which is the study of medical systems, healing practices, and views on health from different cultures. How did you notice culture impacting the health and illness course of Lia Lee and her family in these beginning chapters? Although often used interchangeably, disease and illness differ fundamentally in their meanings and implications. Disease is the commonly thought of concept in which a person suffers due to a physiological or psychological ailment, while illness refers to a culmination of physical, emotional and social suffering of a person. Disease is perceived as the phenomena that affects an organism, while illness affects not only the patient but also their loved ones and community. This distinction is vividly apparent in The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, in which Anne Fadiman relays the approaches to a Hmong child named Lia's epilepsy by her family and her doctors as well as the tumultuous interaction between these caregivers. It is interesting to understand how Hmong culture and a doctor's The spirit catches you and you fall down: A Hmong child, her American doctors, and the collision of two cultures by Anne Fadiman illuminates the dilemmas, as well as barriers, persons of various cultural backgrounds can encounter daily, specifically when residing in a foreign habitation of different practices, perspectives and beliefs. This book highlights the difficulties one family must face during a clash between Hmong family cultural beliefs and western medicine. Fadiman (1997) brings our attention to these harsh realties that one can encounter when persons are unintentionally culturally incompetent through sharing the story of the Lia Lee and her parents, Nao Kao and Foua, who look for guidance from western doctors to assist their spiritual For more than three decades Hmongs have migrated to America, longing for a new enhanced life. Even if it meant they would have to learn a new culture, values, and language. Hmongs left their past, and journeyed on to develop a new future. The religion in North Asia will be discussed as well as the reason why some no longer practice the religion. Three main points that will be addressed will be when they first arrived to America. The consequences that were faced, and the conflicts they have experienced because of the change in religion. It isn 't always simple leaving traditions that have been in cultures for centuries, but the Hmong Americans overcame their obstacle and here we will learn how and why it happened. The document \"Altered States of Consciousness in North American Indian Ceremonials\" by Wolfgang G. Jilek, explores the theme of religion as a mode of knowledge by examining two rituals of the Native American Sioux and Salish Tribes, the Sun Dance, and the Spirit Dance. In this document, beginning with the Salish Spirit Dance, Jilek analyzes the significance of each dance, arguing that the Native Americans perform these dances to experience sensations from religious ecstasy, or from spirits, ancestors, or deities (Jilek, 326). Essentially, the Native Americans believed that by performing these dances, after undergoing several trials, they would receive a dream or message from these entities (335). One example of this is when Jilek examines In Native American tradition, the peyote plant is used for healing. Native to Mexico and southwestern Texas, the small and spineless cactus has been used in spiritual ceremonies performed by Native Americans for thousands of years. In the 1930's it was introduced to the Navajo Tribe, who are native people located in the southwestern United States. In Joy Harjo's memoir, Crazy Brave, the plant was used by a Navajo man as an act of prayer. On the receiving end was Joy who was struggling with the demons of fear and panic. The plant serves as a false healing and comfort for Joy's actual fear and panic. Joy is chasing an identity within love and looking for a person to define her rather than defining herself. She doesn't realize her fear and Being close to your family help you feel safe and secure. Family members experience good times and bad times together, making them stronger. Family is characterized with common aspects such as parents, grandparents, and siblings but there are so many other ways to distinct family. The word family is commonly defined as a group of individuals that have the same ancestors, and gather for holidays and other special events. This particular definition is true in so many ways, but everyone goes through life with situations that are brought up that bring together or break apart families. When I think about the word family and my experiences I have gone through and I would consider family to have crazy moments, lots of laughter, and unconditional love. "}
