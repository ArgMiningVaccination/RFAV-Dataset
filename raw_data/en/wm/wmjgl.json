Acute pyelonephritis DESCRIPTION Inflammation of the kidney occurring mainly in the interstitial tissue and renal pelvis and occasionally in the renal tubules Affecting one or both kidneys Good prognosis; extensive permanent damage rare Also called acute infective tubulointerstitial nephritis PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Infection spreads from the bladder to the ureters to the kidneys, common-ly through vesicoureteral reflux. Vesicoureteral reflux may result from congenital weakness at the junctionof the ureter and bladder. Bacteria refluxed to intrarenal tissues may create colonies of infectionwithin 24 to 48 hours. Female anatomy allows for higher incidence of infection. CAUSES Bacterial infection of the kidneys ASSESSMENT FINDINGS History of urinary urgency and frequency Burning during urination Dysuria, nocturia, hematuria Anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea Fatigue Symptoms that develop rapidly over a few hours or a few days4 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 4Pain on flank palpation Cloudy urine Ammonia-like or fishy odor to urine Fever of 102\u00b0 F (38.9\u00b0 C) or higher, shaking chills TEST RESULTS Urinalysis and culture and sensitivity testing reveal pyuria, significant bacteriuria, low specific gravity and urinepH, or proteinuria, glycosuria, and ketonuria White blood cell count, neutrophil count, and erythrocyte sedimentationrate are elevated. Kidney-ureter-bladder Excretory urography reveals asymmetrical kidneys, possibly indicating ahigh frequency of infection. TREATMENT Identification and correction of predisposing factors to infection, such asobstruction or calculi Short courses of therapy for uncomplicated infections Increased fluid intake Antibiotics Urinary analgesics such as phenazopyridine (Prodium) KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain fluid balance maintain urine specific gravity within the designated limits identify risk factors that exacerbate decreased tissue perfusion and modi-fy lifestyle appropriately report increased comfort. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Give prescribed medication. Check vital signs, intake and output, and daily weight. Monitor characteristics of urine and the pattern of urination. Monitor renal function studies. PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover:ACUTE PYELONEPHRITIS 5897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 5the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment avoidance of bacterial contamination by following hygienic toileting prac- tices (wiping the perineum from front to back after bowel movements forwomen) proper technique for collecting a clean-catch urine specimen medication administration, dosage, and possible adverse effects routine checkup with a history of urinary tract infections signs and symptoms of recurrent infection. Acute tubular necrosis DESCRIPTION Injury to the nephron's tubular segment resulting from ischemic ornephrotoxic injury and causing renal failure and uremic syndrome Also known as acute tubulointerstitial nephritis PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Ischemic , circulatory collapse, severe dehydration, cardiogenic or septic shock, surgery , anesthetics, andreactions to transfusions may cause disruption of blood flow to the kid-neys. Nephrotoxic injury may follow ingestion of certain chemical agents, suchas contrast medium or antibiotics, or result from a hypersensitive reac-tion of the kidneys. CAUSES Diseased tubular epithelium Ischemic injury to glomerular epithelial cells or vascular endothelium Obstructed urine flow ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Diagnosis usually delayed until condition has progressed to an advancedstage History of ischemic or nephrotoxic injury Low urine output (less than 400 ml/24 hours) Evidence of bleeding abnormalities, such as petechiae and ecchymosis Dry , pruritic skin ALERT Fever and chills may signal the onset of an infection, the leading cause of death in acute tubular necrosis.6 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 if hyperkalemic Muscle weakness TEST RESULTS Urinary sediment testing reveals red blood cells (RBCs) and casts. Urine specific gravity is 1.010. Urine osmolality is less than 400 mOsm/kg. Urine sodium level is 40 to 60 mEq/L. Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels are elevated. Anemia is evident. Platelet adherence is defective. Metabolic acidosis is revealed. Hyperkalemia is shown. Electrocardiogram may show arrhythmias and, with hyperkalemia, a widening QRS complex, disappearing P waves, and tall, peaked T waves. TREATMENT Acute phase Vigorous supportive measures until normal kidney function resumes Long-term management Daily replacement of projected and calculated fluid loss (including insen-sible loss) Peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis if the patient is catabolic or if hyper-kalemia and fluid volume overload aren't controlled by other measures Fluid restriction Low-sodium, low-potassium diet Rest periods when fatigued Diuretics Transfusion of packed RBCs Epoetin alfa Antibiotics Emergency I.V . administration of 50% glucose, regular insulin, and sodi-um bicarbonate (for hyperkalemia) Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) with NECROSIS 7897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 7KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain fluid balance maintain hemodynamic stability maintain urine specific gravity within the designated limits have improved kidney function. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Give prescribed medication and blood products. Restrict food containing high sodium and potassium levels. Use aseptic technique, particularly when handling catheters. Perform passive range-of-motion exercises. Provide good skin care. Check vital signs and intake and output. Monitor laboratory studies. Monitor for complications. PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment signs of infection and when to report them to the physician dietary restrictions how to set goals that are realistic for the patient's prognosis appropriate supportive services or social service. Adrenal hypofunction Primary adrenal of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens Secondary adrenal hypofunction the crisis), a critical deficiency of mineralocorti-coids and glucocorticoids generally following acute stress, sepsis, trauma,surgery , or the omission of steroid therapy in patients who have chronicadrenal insufficiency ALERT Adrenal crisis is a medical emergency that needs im- mediate, vigorous treatment. 8 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 8PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The disorder results from the partial or complete destruction of the adren- al cortex. The disorder is a clinical syndrome in which the symptoms are associatedwith deficient production of the adrenocortical hormones cortisol, aldos-terone, and androgen. Corticotropin and corticotropin-releasing hormone levels are high. Addison's disease involves all zones of the cortex, adrenocortical secretions, (the formationof glucose from molecules that aren't carbohydrates), resulting in lowblood glucose levels that can become dangerously low in patients whotake insulin routinely . Aldosterone deficiency causes increased renal sodium loss and enhancespotassium reabsorption. Hypotension develops from sodium excretion. Increased production of angiotensin II results from low plasma volumeand arteriolar pressure. Androgen deficiency may decrease hair growth in axillary and pubic areas(less noticeable in men) as well as on the extremities of women. CAUSES Primary hypofunction Autoimmune process in which circulating antibodies react specificallyagainst the adrenal tissue Bilateral adrenalectomy Family history of autoimmune disease (may predispose the patient to Ad-dison's disease and other endocrinopathies) Hemorrhage into the adrenal gland Infections (histoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus) Neoplasms Tuberculosis (the chief cause in the past; now responsible for less than20% of adult cases) Secondary hypofunction Abrupt withdrawal of long-term corticosteroid therapy Page 9Adrenal crisis stores of glucocorticoids in a patient with adrenal hypo- function after trauma, surgery , or other physiologic stress ASSESSMENT FINDINGS History of synthetic steroid use, adrenal surgery , or recent infection Muscle weakness, poor coordination Fatigue W eight loss, dehydration Craving for salty food Decreased tolerance for stress GI disturbances Amenorrhea (in women) Impotence (in men) Decreased axillary and pubic hair (in women) Bronze coloration of the skin, darkening of scars Areas of vitiligo Increased pigmentation of mucous membranes W eak, irregular pulse Hypotension TEST RESULTS In the rapid corticotropin stimulation test, a low corticotropin level indi-cates a secondary disorder; an elevated level indicates a primary disorder. Plasma cortisol level declines (less than 10 mcg/dl in the morning; lowerin the evening). Serum sodium and fasting blood glucose levels decline. Serum potassium, calcium, and blood urea nitrogen levels increase. Hematocrit and lymphocyte and eosinophil counts increase. Chest X-ray shows a small heart in severe disease. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen shows adrenal calcificationif the cause is infectious. TREATMENT I.V . fluids Periods of rest Small, frequent, high-protein meals Lifelong corticosteroid replacement, usually PM Page 10KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain stable vital signs maintain an adequate fluid balance remain free from signs and symptoms of infection develop adequate coping skills. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Until onset of mineralocorticoid effect, encourage fluids to replace exces- sive fluid loss. Arrange for a diet that maintains sodium and potassium balances; if thepatient is anorexic, suggest six small meals per day to increase caloric in-take. Observe for cushingoid signs such as fluid retention around the eyes andface. Check for petechiae. If the patient receives glucocorticoids alone, observe for orthostatic hy-potension or electrolyte abnormalities. Check vital signs, intake and output, and daily weight. Watch for signs of shock (decreased level of consciousness and urine out-put). Observe for hyperkalemia before treatment and hypokalemia after treat-ment. Monitor cardiac rhythm. Check blood glucose levels. Refer the patient to the National Adrenal Diseases Foundation for supportand information. PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: life-long steroid therapy requirement symptoms of steroid overdose (swelling, weight gain) and steroid under-dose (lethargy , weakness) that dosage may need to be increased during times of stress or illness(when the patient has a cold, for example) that infection, injury , or profuse sweating in hot weather may precipitateadrenal crisis importance of carrying a medical identification card that states the pa-tient is on steroid therapy (name of the medication and its dosage shouldbe included on the card) how to give a hydrocortisone injection and the need to keep an emer-ADRENAL HYPOFUNCTION 11897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 11gency kit containing hydrocortisone in a prepared syringe available for use in times of stress stress management techniques. Alzheimer's disease DESCRIPTION Degenerative disorder of the cerebral cortex (especially the frontal lobe),characterized by progressive dementia Accounts for more than 50% of all cases of dementia Poor prognosis No cure or definitive treatment Gradual loss of recent and remote memory PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Chromosome 21 shows a genetic abnormality . Brain damage is caused by a genetic substance, amyloid. Three distinguishing features of brain tissue are neurofibrillary tangles,neuritic plaques, and granulovacuolar degeneration. CAUSES Unknown ASSESSMENT FINDINGS History obtained from a family member or caregiver Insidious onset Initial changes almost imperceptible Forgetfulness and subtle memory loss Recent memory loss Difficulty learning and remembering new information General deterioration in personal hygiene Inability to concentrate Tendency to perform repetitive actions and to be restless Negative personality changes (irritability , depression, paranoia, hostility) Nocturnal awakening Disorientation Suspicious and fearful of imaginary people and situations Misperceives own environment Misidentifies objects and people Complains of stolen or misplaced objects12 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 12Emotions may be described as labile Mood swings, sudden angry outbursts, and sleep disturbances Impaired sense of smell (usually an early symptom) Impaired stereognosis Gait disorders Tremors Loss of recent memory Positive snout reflex Organic brain disease in adults Urinary or fecal incontinence Seizures TEST RESULTS Diagnosis is made by exclusion. Positive diagnosis is made on autopsy . Positron emission tomography reveals metabolic activity of the cerebral cortex. Computed tomography scan reveals excessive and progressive brain atrophy . Magnetic resonance imaging rules out intracranial lesions. Cerebral blood flow studies reveals abnormalities in blood flow to thebrain. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals chronic neurologic infection. EEG shows slowing of the brain waves in late stages of the disease. Neuropsychologic test results show impaired cognitive ability and reason-ing. TREATMENT COLLABORATION Consult with a neuropsychiatrist, psychol- ogist, social worker, dietitian, and occupational therapist to evaluate the patient's strengths and weaknesses and teach the pa-tient and his family behavioral strategies to improve quality of life.

Life-threatening disorder Anaphylaxis DESCRIPTION Dramatic, acute atopic reaction to an allergen Marked by sudden onset of rapidly progressive urticaria and respiratory distress More severe the sooner signs and symptoms appear after exposure to theantigen Severe reactions possibly initiating vascular collapse, leading to systemicshock and, possibly , deathANAPHYLAXIS 17 MODIFYING THE HOME FOR A PATIENT WITH ALS To help the patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) live safely at home, follow these guidelines: /H18546Explain basic safety precautions, such as keeping stairs and pathways free from c lutter; using nonskid mats in the bathroom and in place of loose throw rugs; keeping stairs well lit; installing handrails in stairwells and the shower,tub, and toilet areas; and removing electrical and telephone cords from trafcareas. /H18546Discuss the need for rearranging the furniture, moving items in or out of thepa tient's care area, and obtaining a hospital bed, a commode, or oxygen equipment. /H18546Recommend devices to ease the patient's and caregiver's work, such asextra pillo ws or a wedge pillow to help the patient sit up, a draw sheet to help him move up in bed, a lap tray for eating, or a bell for calling the care-giver. /H18546Help the patient adjust to changes in the environment. Encourage indepen-dence. /H18546Advise the patient to keep a suction machine handy to reduce the fear ofchoking due to secretion accumula tion and dysphagia. Teach him how to suction himself when necessary.897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 17PATHOPHYSIOLOGY After initial exposure to an antigen, the immune system produces specific immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies in the lymph nodes. Helper T cells en-hance the process. The antibodies (IgE) then bind to membrane receptors located on mastcells and basophils. After the body re-encounters the antigen, the IgE antibodies, or cross-linked IgE receptors, recognize the antigen as foreign; this activates the re-lease of powerful chemical mediators. IgG or IgM enters into the reaction and activates the release of comple-ment factors. CAUSES Systemic exposure to sensitizing drugs, foods, insect venom, or other spe-cific antigens ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Immediately after exposure, complaints of a feeling of impending doomor fright and exhibiting apprehension, restlessness, in the throat caused by angioedema Complaints of chest tightness Hoarseness or stridor and wheezing Severe abdominal cramps, nausea, and diarrhea Urinary urgency and incontinence Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and seizures Hypotension and shock; sometimes, angina and cardiac arrhythmias TEST RESULTS No tests are required to identify anaphylaxis because the patient's historyand signs and symptoms establish the diagnosis. Skin testing may help to identify a specific allergen. TREATMENT Establishing and maintaining a patent airway Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if cardiac arrest occurs Nothing by mouth, until stable Bed rest, until stable18 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 Volume expander infusions as needed Vasopressors to support blood pressure Norepinephrine (Levophed) to restore blood pressure, if needed Dopamine (Dobutrex) to support blood pressure Aminophylline bronchi Antihistamines reaction KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain a patent airway maintain adequate ventilation express feelings of increased comfort and decreased pain maintain normal cardiac output and normal heart rate identify causative allergen. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Provide supplemental oxygen and prepare to assist with insertion of anendotracheal tube, if needed. Insert a peripheral I.V . line. Continually reassure the patient, and explain all tests and treatments. If the patient undergoes skin or scratch testing, monitor for signs of a seri-ous allergic response. Keep emergency resuscitation equipment readilyavailable. ALERT If a patient must receive a medication to which he's allergic, prevent a severe reaction by making sure he receives careful desensitization with gradually increasing doses of the anti-gen or with advance administration of corticosteroids. Closely mon-itor the patient during testing, and have resusci tation equipmentand epinephrine readily available. Check vital signs. Observe for adverse reactions from radiographic contrast media. Monitor respiratory and neurologic status and the degree of edema. Observe for serious allergic response after skin or scratch testing. Evaluate response to treatment. Assess for complications.ANAPHYLAXIS 19897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 19PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: risk for delayed symptoms and importance of reporting them immediate- ly avoidance of exposure to known allergens importance of carrying and becoming familiar with an anaphylaxis kitand learning to use it before the need arises need for medical identification jewelry to identify allergy . Anemia, aplastic DESCRIPTION Potentially fatal marrow failure syndrome resulting from injury to or de-struction of stem cells in bone marrow or the bone marrow matrix Causes pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) and bonemarrow hypoplasia PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The disorder usually develops when damaged or destroyed stem cells in-hibit red blood cell (RBC) production. The disorder less commonly develops when damaged bone marrow mi-crovasculature creates an unfavorable environment for cell growth andmaturation CAUSES Congenital hypoplastic anemia, also known as Blackfan-Diamond anemia, which develops between ages 2 and 3 months, and Fanconi's syndrome,developing between birth and age 10 Immunologic factors; severe disease, especially hepatitis; viral infection,especially in children; preleukemic and neoplastic infiltration of bonemarrow May be idiopathic Result of adverse drug reaction ASSESSMENT FINDINGS W eight loss Dizziness Syncope Bruising20 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 ecchymosis, petechiae, or retinal hemorrhage Alterations in level of consciousness W eakness, fatigue Bibasilar crackles, tachycardia, and a gallop murmur Fever Oral and rectal ulcers and sore throat Nausea Decreased hair and skin quality TEST RESULTS RBC count is 1 million/mm3or less, usually with normochromic and normocytic cells; absolute reticulocyte count is very low . Serum iron levels are elevated (unless bleeding occurs), but total iron- binding capacity is normal or slightly reduced. Serum platelet and white blood cell counts are decreased. Bone marrow biopsies performed at several sites may reveal a dry tap orshowing severely hypocellular or aplastic marrow , with a varying amountof fat, tissue, or gelatinous replacement; absence of tagged ironand megakaryocytes; and depression of erythroid elements. TREATMENT Treatment of underlying cause Vigorous supportive measures, such as packed RBCs, platelets, and exper-imental histocompatibility antigen-matched leukocyte transfusions Respiratory support with oxygen Prevention of infection ranging from frequent hand washing to filteredairflow W ell-balanced diet Neutropenic precautions, if appropriate Antibiotics erythropoietic-stimulating factor Bone marrow transplantation (for severe aplasia and patients who needconstant RBC transfusions)ANEMIA, APLASTIC 21897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 PM Page 21KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: state the need to increase activity level gradually maintain vital signs within prescribed limits during activity maintain normal cardiac output exhibit adequate ventilation express feelings of increased comfort and decreased pain. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Help the patient to prevent or manage hemorrhage, infection, adverse ef- fects of medication therapy , and blood transfusion reaction. If the patient's platelet count is low (less than 20,000/mm3), prevent he- morrhage by avoiding I.M. injections and by suggesting the use of an elec-tric razor and a soft toothbrush. Apply pressure to venipuncture sites un-til bleeding stops. Follow neutropenic precautions. Make sure throat, urine, nasal, stool, and blood cultures are done regular-ly and correctly to check for infection. Schedule frequent rest periods. Administer oxygen therapy . Ensure a comfortable environmental temperature. If blood transfusions are necessary , administer according to facility policyand assess for transfusion reactions. Monitor blood studies with patients receiving anemia-inducing drugs.

Transferrin, which binds with and transports iron, also decreases. Insufficient body stores of iron lead to a depleted red blood cell (RBC)mass and to a decreased hemoglobin concentration. The result is decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. (See Iron absorption and storage .) CAUSES Blood loss secondary to drug-induced GI bleeding or due to heavymenses, hemorrhage from trauma, GI ulcers, malignant tumors, andvarices Can be related to lead poisoning in children Inadequate dietary intake of iron Intravascular hemolysis-induced hemoglobinuria or paroxysmal noctur-nal hemoglobinuria Iron malabsorptionANEMIA, IRON DEFICIENCY 23 FOCUS IN IRON ABSORPTION AND STORAGE Found in abundance throughout the body, iron is needed for erythropoiesis. Two- thirds of total-body iron is found in hemoglobin; the other third, mostly in thereticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, and bone marrow), with small amountsin muscle, serum, and body cells. Adequate iron in the diet and recirculation of iron released from disintegrat- ing red blood cells maintain iron supplies. The duodenum and upper part of thesmall intestine absorb dietary iron. Such absorption depends on gastric acidcontent, the amount of reducing substances (ascorbic acid, for example) presentin the alimentary canal, and amount of iron intake. If iron intake is decient, thebody gradually depletes its iron stores, causing decreased hemoglobin levelsand, eventually, signs and symptoms of iron deciency anemia.897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 23Mechanical erythrocyte trauma caused by a prosthetic heart valve or vena cava filter Pregnancy ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Can persist for years without signs and symptoms Fatigue Inability to concentrate Headache, shortness of breath (especially on exertion) Increased frequency of infections Pica, an uncontrollable urge to eat strange things, such as clay , starch, iceand, in children, lead Menorrhagia Dysphagia Vasomotor disturbances Numbness and tingling of the extremities Neuralgic pain Red, swollen, smooth, shiny , and tender tongue (glossitis) Corners of the mouth may be eroded, tender, and swollen (angular stom-atitis) Spoon-shaped, brittle nails Tachycardia TEST RESULTS Serum hemoglobin level decreases (males, less than 12 g/dl; females, lessthan 10 g/dl) or mean corpuscular hemoglobin level decreases in severeanemia. Serum hematocrit decreases (males, less than 47 ml/dl; females, less than42 ml/dl). Level of serum iron with high binding capacity decreases. Serum ferritin level decreases. Serum RBC count decreases (in early stages, RBC count may be normal,except in infants and children) with increased microcytic and hypo -chromic cells.

Anemia, sickle cell DESCRIPTION Congenital hemolytic disease that results from a defective hemoglobin(Hb) molecule (HbS) that causes red blood cells (RBCs) to become sickleshaped Sickle-shaped cells impairing circulation, resulting in chronic ill health(fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, swollen joints), periodic crises, long-termcomplications, and premature death Forms of crisis including painful crisis (most common crisis and the hall-mark of the disease; usually appears periodically after age 5), aplastic cri-sis, acute sequestration crisis (occurs in infants 8 months to 2 years), andhemolytic crisis No cure26 DISORDERS RECOGNIZING IRON OVERDOSE Excessive iron replacement may produce such signs and symptoms as diarrhea, fever, severe stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. When these signs and symptoms occur, notify the physician and give pre- scribed treatment, which may include chelation therapy, vigorous I.V. lavage, RBCs becomes insoluble when- ever hypoxia occurs. RBCs become rough, and elongated, forming a crescent or sickleshape. Sickling can produce hemolysis (cell destruction). The altered cells accumulate in capillaries and smaller blood vessels, making the blood more viscous. Normal circulation is impaired, causing pain, tissue infarctions, andswelling. CAUSES Homozygous inheritance of the HbS-producing gene (defective Hb genefrom each parent) ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Signs and symptoms usually absent before age 6 months Chronic fatigue Unexplained dyspnea, or dyspnea on exertion Joint swelling; aching bones Chest pain Ischemic leg ulcers Increased susceptibility to infection Pulmonary infarctions and cardiomegaly Jaundice or pallor May appear small in stature for age Delayed growth and puberty Spiderlike body build (narrow shoulders and hips, long extremities,curved spine, and barrel chest) in adult Tachycardia Hepatomegaly and, in children, splenomegaly Systolic and diastolic murmurs Sleepiness with difficulty awakening Hematuria Pale lips, tongue, palms, and nail beds Body temperature over 104\u00ba F (40\u00ba C) or a temperature of 100\u00ba F(37.8\u00ba C) that persists for 2 or more days In painful crisis Severe abdominal, thoracic, muscle, or bone pain Increased jaundiceANEMIA, SICKLE CELL 27897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 27Dark fever In aplastic crisis Pallor Lethargy Sleepiness Dyspnea Possible coma Markedly decreased bone marrow activity RBC hemolysis In acute sequestration crisis Lethargy Pallor Progression to hypovolemic shock and death, if untreated In hemolytic crisis Liver congestion Hepatomegaly TEST RESULTS Stained blood smear shows sickle cells, and hemoglobin electrophoresis shows HbS.

NURSING INTERVENTIONS In a nonacute situation Allow the patient to express his fears and concerns, and identify effective coping strategies. Offer the patient and his family psychological support. Before elective surgery , weigh the patient, insert an indwelling urinarycatheter and an I.V . line, and assist with insertion of the arterial line andpulmonary artery catheter to monitor hemodynamic balance. Give prescribed preventive antibiotics.ANEURYSM, ABDOMINAL AORTIC 33 ENDOVASCULAR GRAFTING FOR REPAIR OF AAA Endovascular grafting is a minimally invasive procedure for the patient who re - quires repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Endovascular grafting rein-forces the walls of the aorta to prevent rupture and prevents expansion of thesize of the aneurysm. The procedure is performed with fluo- roscopic guidance, whereby a deliverycatheter with an attached compressedgraft is inserted through a small incisioninto the femoral or iliac artery over aguidewire. The delivery catheter is ad -vanced into the aorta, where it's posi-tioned across the aneurysm. A balloon onthe catheter expands the graft and afx-es it to the vessel wall. The procedureusually takes 2 to 3 hours to perform.Patients are instructed to walk the rstday after surgery and are dischargedfrom the hospital in 1 to 3 days. 897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 33In an acute situation Insert an I.V . line with at least a 14G needle to facilitate blood replace- ment. Obtain blood samples for la boratory tests, as ordered. Give prescribed medication. ALERT Be alert for signs of rupture, which may be immedi- ately fatal. If rupture does occur, surgery needs to be imme- diate. Medical antishock trousers may be used while transportingthe patient to surgery. After surgery Assess peripheral pulses for graft failure or occlusion. Watch for signs of bleeding retroperitoneally from the graft site. Maintain blood pressure in the prescribed range with fluids and medica-tions. ALERT Assess the patient for severe back pain, which can indicate that the graft is tearing. Have the patient cough, or suction the endotracheal tube, as needed. Provide frequent turning, and assist with ambulation as soon as the pa-tient is able. Monitor cardiac rhythm and hemodynamics. Assess vital signs, intake and output hourly , neurologic status, and pulseoximetry . Check respirations and breath sounds at least every hour. Monitor arterial blood gas values as ordered.

Asthma DESCRIPTION A chronic reactive airway disorder involving episodic, reversible airwayobstruction resulting from bronchospasms, increased mucus secretions,and mucosal edema May begin dramatically simultaneous onset of severe, multiplesymptoms, or insidiously , with gradually increasing respiratory distress Signs and symptoms that range from mild wheezing and dyspnea to life-threatening respiratory failure Signs and symptoms of bronchial airway obstruction that may persist be-tween acute 1:44 PM Page 45PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Tracheal bronchial linings overreact to various stimuli, causing episodic smooth-muscle spasms that severely constrict the airways. Mucosal edema and thickened secretions further block the airways. Immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies, attached to histamine-containing mastcells and receptors on cell membranes, initiate intrinsic asthma attacks. When exposed to an antigen such as pollen, the IgE antibody combineswith the antigen. On subsequent exposure to the antigen, mast cells de-granulate and release mediators. The mediators cause the bronchoconstriction and edema of an asthma attack. During an asthma attack, expiratory airflow decreases, trapping gas in theairways and causing alveolar hyperinflation. Atelectasis may develop in some lung regions. The increased airway resistance initiates labored breathing. CAUSES Animal dander Bronchoconstriction Cold air Drugs, such as aspirin, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs Emotional stress Exercise Food additives containing sulfites and any other sensitizing substance Genetic factors Hereditary predisposition House dust mites or mold Kapok or feather pillows Pollen Psychological stress Sensitivity to allergens or irritants such as pollutants (extrinsic or atopicasthma) Internal, nonallergenic factors (intrinsic or nonatopic asthma) Tartrazine dye, a common coloring agent in some foods and drugs Viral infections ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Intrinsic asthma typically preceded by severe respiratory tract infections,especially in adults; may be aggravated by irritants, emotional stress, fa-tigue, endocrine changes and temperature and humidity variations46 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 46Exposure to a particular allergen followed by sudden onset of dyspnea and wheezing and by tightness in the chest accompanied by a cough thatproduces thick, clear, or yellow sputum Visibly dyspneic Ability to speak only a few words before pausing for breath Use of accessory respiratory muscles Diaphoresis Increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter (if phase of respiration Diminished breath sounds Cyanosis, confusion, and lethargy indicating the onset of life-threateningstatus asthmaticus and respiratory failure TEST RESULTS Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals hypoxemia.

Bladder cancer DESCRIPTION Malignant tumor that develops on the bladder wall surface or grows with-in the wall and quickly invades underlying muscles Less common bladder tumors include adenocarcinomas, epidermoid car-cinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, sarcomas, tumors in bladder diver-ticula, and carcinoma in situ Most common cancer of the urinary tract PATHOPHYSIOLOGY About 90% of bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas, arisingfrom the transitional epithelium of mucous membranes. (They may re-sult from malignant transformation of benign papillomas.) CAUSES Exact cause unknown Associated with chronic bladder irritation and infection in people with re-nal calculi, indwelling urinary catheters, chemical cystitis caused by cy-clophosphamide, or pelvic irradiation ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Gross, painless, intermittent hematuria, usually with clots Suprapubic pain after voiding, which , urinary frequency , nocturia, and dribbling Flank pain and tenderness that may indicate an obstructed ureter TEST RESULTS Complete blood count may reveal anemia. Urinalysis detects blood and malignant cells in the urine. Excretory urography may identify a large, early-stage tumor 7/12/13 1:44 PM upper urinary tract; and shows hydronephrosis and rigid deformity of the bladder wall. Retrograde cystography evaluates bladder structure and integrity forfunctional or anatomical abnormalities; it also helps confirm bladder can-cer diagnosis. Bone scan may reveal metastasis. Computed tomography scan reveals thickness of the involved bladderwall and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Ultrasonography reveals metastases in tissues beyond the bladder anddistinguishes a bladder cyst from a bladder tumor. Cystoscopy and biopsy confirm bladder cancer diagnosis. (If the test re-sults show cancer cells, further studies determine the cancer stage andtreatment.) Bimanual examination (during a cystoscopy , if the patient has received ananesthetic) helps to determine whether the bladder is fixed to the pelvicwall. TREATMENT Influenced by cancer's stage and patient's lifestyle, other health problems,and mental outlook Initially postoperatively , avoid heavy lifting and contact sports; after re-covery , no activity restrictions PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain adequate fluid balance express feelings of increased comfort and decreased pain exhibit adequate coping mechanisms express feelings about potential or actual changes in sexual activity .BLADDER CANCER 55897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 55NURSING INTERVENTIONS Provide support and encourage verbalization.

Life-threatening disorder Blood transfusion reaction DESCRIPTION A hemolytic reaction following the transfusion of mismatched blood Accompanies or follows I.V . administration of blood components Mediated by immune or nonimmune factors Severity varying from mild to severe PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Recipient's antibodies, immunoglobulin (Ig) G or IgM, attach to donor redblood cells (RBCs), leading to widespread clumping and destruction of re-cipient's RBCs. Transfusion with Rh-incompatible blood triggers a less serious reaction,known as Rh isoimmunization, within several days to 2 weeks. (See Un- derstanding the Rh system 56A febrile nonhemolytic reaction \u2014 the most common type of re ac - tion \u2014 develops when cytotoxic or agglutinating antibodies in plasma attack antigens on transfused lymphocytes, granulocytes, orplasma cells. CAUSES Transfusion with incompatible blood ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Chills Nausea Vomiting Chest tightness Chest and back pain Mild to severe fever within the first 15 minutes of transfusion or within2 hours after its completion Tachycardia and hypotensionBLOOD TRANSFUSION REACTION 57 FOCUS IN UNDERSTANDING THE Rh SYSTEM The Rh system contains more than 30 antibodies and antigens. Of the world's population, about 85% are Rh positive, which means that their red blood cellscarry the D or Rh antigen. The rest of the population are Rh negative and don'thave this antigen. Effects of sensitization When an Rh-negative person receives Rh-positive blood for the rst time, hebecomes sensitized to the D antigen but shows no immediate reaction to it. If hereceives Rh-positive blood a second time, he experiences a massive hemolyticreaction. For example, an Rh-negative mother who delivers an Rh-positive baby is sensitized by the baby's Rh-positive blood. During her next Rh-positive pregnan-cy, her sensitized blood will cause a hemolytic reaction in the fetal circulation. Preventing sensitization To prevent the formation of antibodies against Rh-positive blood, an Rh-negativemother should receive Rh o(D) immune globulin (human) (RhoGAM) I.M. 72 hours delivering an Rh-positive baby.897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 1:44 PM Page 57Dyspnea and apprehension Urticaria and angioedema Wheezing In a surgical patient, blood oozing from mucous membranes or the inci- sion site In a hemolytic reaction, fever, an unexpected decrease in serum hemoglo-bin level, frank blood in urine, and jaundice TEST RESULTS Serum hemoglobin level decreases.

Colorectal cancer DESCRIPTION Malignant tumors of colon or rectum almost always adenocarcinomas(About one-half are sessile lesions of rectosigmoid area; all others arepolyp oid lesions.) Slow progression Five-year survival rate of 50%; potentially curable in 75% of patients ifearly diagnosis allows resection before nodal involvement Second most common visceral neoplasm in United States and Europe PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Most lesions of the large bowel are moderately differentiated adenocarci-nomas. Tumors tend to grow slowly and remain asymptomatic for long periods. Tumors in the sigmoid and descending colon undergo circumferentialgrowth and constrict the intestinal lumen. Tumors in the ascending colon are usually large at diagnosis and are pal-pable on physical examination.82 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 82CAUSES Unknown Risk factors: intake of excessive saturated animal fat, diseases of the di- gestive tract, age older than 40, history of ulcerative colitis, and familialpolyposis ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Right colon tumors: no signs and symptoms in early stages because stoolis liquid in that part of colon History of black, tarry stools Abdominal aching, pressure, or dull cramps W eakness Diarrhea, anorexia, obstipation, weight loss, and vomiting Rectal bleeding Intermittent abdominal fullness Rectal pressure Urgent need to defecate on awakening Abdominal distention or visible masses Enlarged abdominal veins Enlarged inguinal and supraclavicular nodes Abnormal bowel sounds Abdominal masses (right-side tumors that usually feel bulky; tumors oftransverse portion more easily detected) Generalized abdominal tenderness TEST RESULTS Fecal occult blood test may show blood in stools, a warning sign of rectalcancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen measurement stages and monitors the treat-ment. Excretory urography verifies bilateral renal function and allows inspec-tion for displacement of the kidneys, ureters, or bladder by a tumor press-ing against these structures. Barium enema studies reveal location of lesions that aren't detectablemanually or visually . ALERT Barium copy or excretory because barium sulfate interferes with these tests. Computed tomography scan allows better visualization if a barium ene-ma yields inconclusive results or if metastasis to the pelvic lymph nodesis suspected.COLORECTAL CANCER 83897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 83Proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy permits visualization of the lower GI tract (can detect up to 66% of colorectal cancers). Colonoscopy permits visual inspection and photography of the colon upto the ileocecal valve and provides access for polypectomies and biopsiesof suspected lesions. Digital rectal examination detects colorectal cancers (specifically , rectaland perianal lesions). TREATMENT Radiation preoperatively and postoperatively to induce tumor regression High-fiber diet After surgery , avoidance of heavy lifting and contact sports Chemotherapy for metastasis, residual disease, or recurrent inoperabletumor Analgesics Resection or right hemicolectomy for advanced disease (Surgery may in-clude resection of the terminal segment of the ileum, cecum, ascendingcolon, and right half of the transverse colon with corresponding mesen-tery .)

Coronary artery disease DESCRIPTION Heart disease that results from narrowing of coronary arteries over timeas a result of atherosclerosis Primary effect: loss of oxygen and nutrients to myocardial tissue becauseof diminished coronary blood flow PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Increased blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) irritate or damagethe inner layer of coronary vessels. After damaging the protective barrier, LDL enters the vessel, accumulates,and forms a fatty streak. Smooth-muscle cells move to the inner layer to engulf the fatty sub-stance, produce fibrous tissue, and stimulate calcium deposition. The cycle continues, resulting in transformation of the fatty streak into fi-brous plaque; eventually , a coronary artery disease (CAD) lesion evolves. Oxygen deprivation forces the myocardium to shift from aerobic to anaer-obic metabolism, leading to accumulation of lactic acid and reduction ofcellular pH. The combination of hypoxia, reduced energy availability , and acidosisrapidly impairs left ventricular CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE 85897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 85The strength of contractions in the affected myocardial region is reduced as the fibers shorten inadequately , resulting in less force and velocity . Wall motion is abnormal in the ischemic area, resulting in less blood be-ing ejected from the heart with each contraction. CAUSES Atherosclerosis Congenital defects Coronary artery spasm Dissecting aneurysm Infectious vasculitis Syphilis ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Angina that may radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw , or shoulder blade - Commonly occurs after physical exertion but may also follow emo- tional excitement, exposure to cold, or a large meal - May develop during sleep, with symptoms awakening the patient Angina -Stable (predictable and relieved by rest or nitrates) -Unstable (increases in frequency and duration, is more easily induced, and generally indicates extensive or worsening disease; untreated, mayprogress to myocardial infarction) -Prinzmetal's or variant (severe non-effort-produced pain occurring at rest without provocation) Nausea and vomiting Fainting Sweating Cool extremities Xanthoma Arteriovenous nicking of the eye Obesity Hypertension Positive Levine sign (holding fist to chest) Decreased or absent peripheral pulses TEST RESULTS Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium 201 during treadmill exer-cise with stenosis re-veals a decrease in blood flow proportional to the percentage of occlusion.86 DISORDERS897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 86Multiple-gated acquisition scanning reveals cardiac wall motion and re- flects injury to cardiac tissue. Electrocardiography shows ischemic changes during angina (may be nor-mal between anginal episodes). Exercise testing reveals ST-segment changes during exercise, indicating ischemia, and allows determination of a safe exercise prescription. Coronary angiography reveals the location and degree of coronary arterystenosis or obstruction, collateral circulation, and the condition of theartery beyond the narrowing. Stress echocardiography may reveal abnormal wall motion. TREATMENT Stress-reduction techniques essential, especially if known stressors pre-cipitate pain Lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation and maintaining idealbody weight (see Preventing coronary artery disease ) Low-fat, low-sodium diet Activity restrictions possible Regular blockers Calcium channel blockers Antiplatelets Antilipemics Antihypertensives Coronary artery bypass graftCORONARY ARTERY DISEASE 87 PREVENTING CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Because coronary artery disease is so widespread, prevention is important. Dietary restrictions aimed at reducing the intake of calories (in obesity) and ofsalt, fats, and cholesterol minimize the risk, especially when supplemented withregular exercise. Abstention from smoking and reduction of stress are alsoessential. Other preventive actions include control of hypertension (with diuretics or sympathetic beta-adrenergic blockers), control of elevated serum danger of blood clots(with aspirin, for example).897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 stent placement Laser Atherectomy ALERT Advise patient that stopping nitrates abruptly caus- es coronary artery spasm.

Elevated levels of cortisol don't suppress hypothalamic and anterior pitu-itary secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenal corti-cotropic hormone (ACTH). The result is excessive levels of circulating cortisol. CAUSES Chronic use of synthetic glucocorticoids or corticotropin Corticotropin-producing tumor in another organ Cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor Excess production of corticotropin Pituitary microadenoma ASSESSMENT FINDINGS History revealing use of synthetic steroids Complaints of fatigue, muscle weakness, and sleep disturbances Polyuria, thirst, and other symptoms resembling those of hyperglycemia Frequent infections Water retention Amenorrhea Decreased libido and impotence Irritability and emotional instability Headache Alopecia of scalp hair in women and hirsutism of the face Moon-shaped face Buffalo-humplike back Central obesity Thin extremities and muscle wasting and weakness Petechiae, ecchymoses, and purplish striae 1:44 PM Page 89Swollen ankles Hypertension Acne TEST RESULTS Free cortisol level in the saliva and in urine is elevated. ACTH level decreases and excess pituitary or ectopic secretion of ACTH increases in adrenal disease. Blood chemistry may show hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia,and elevated blood glucose level. Serum cortisol the morning. Glycosuria develops. Ultrasonography , computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonanceimaging of a pituitary or adrenal tumor. Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test shows failure of plasma corti-sol levels to be suppressed. TREATMENT Management to restore hormone balance and reverse Cushing's syn-drome, including radiation, drug therapy , or surgery Diuretics Glucocorticoids ALERT Glucocorticoid administration on the morning of surgery can help prevent acute adrenal insufficiency during surgery. Cortisol therapy is essential during and after surgery tohelp the patient tolerate the physi ologic stress caused by removal of the pituitary or adrenal glands.

Diabetes insipidus DESCRIPTION Disorder of water balance regulation characterized by excessive fluid in- take and hypotonic polyuria Two types: primary and secondary May occur transiently during pregnancy , usually after the 5th or 6thmonth of gestation Impaired or absent thirst mechanism increases risk of complications If uncomplicated, prognosis good If complicated by underlying disorder, such as cancer, prognosis variable Also referred to as DI PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) is synthesized in the hypothalamusand stored by the posterior pituitary gland. Following release into the general circulation, vasopressin acts on the dis-tal and collecting tubules of the kidneys. Vasopressin increases the water permeability of the tubules and causeswater reabsorption. The absence of vasopressin allows filtered water to be excreted in theurine instead of being reabsorbed. CAUSES Certain medications such as lithium Congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) Damage to hypothalamus or pituitary gland Failure of the kidneys to respond to vasopressin (called nephrogenic DI ) Failure of vasopressin secretion Idiopathic Infection Neurosurgery , skull fracture, or head trauma Pregnancy (called gestational DI ) Psychogenic Trauma Tumors Vascular lesions ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Abrupt onset of extreme polyuria; nocturia Extreme thirst, extraordinarily large oral fluid intake W eight loss Dizziness, weakness, and fatigue Constipation Signs of dehydration, poor skin turgor Fever Dyspnea Pale, voluminous urine Tachycardia Decreased muscle strength Hypotension TEST RESULTS Urinalysis shows colorless urine with low osmolality and specific gravity . Serum sodium is increased. Serum osmolality is increased. Serum vasopressin is decreased. 24-hour urine test shows decreased specific gravity and increased vol- ume. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels increase. Dehydration test or water deprivation test shows an increase in urine os-molality after vasopressin administration exceeding 9%. TREATMENT Identification and treatment of underlying cause Control of fluid balance Dehydration prevention Free access to oral fluids With nephrogenic DI, low-sodium 5% dextrose in water- If serum sodium less than 150 mEq/L: normal saline solution Surgery not indicated, unless required to treat underlying cause such as atumor KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: demonstrate balanced fluid volume display adaptive coping behaviors avoid complications demonstrate normal laboratory values. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Administer medications as ordered. ALERT Use caution when administering vasopressin to a patient with coronary artery disease because it can cause coronary artery constriction. Provide meticulous skin and mouth care. Encourage verbalization of feelings. Offer encouragement while providing a realistic assessment of the situa-tion. Help the patient develop effective coping strategies. Check vital signs, intake and output, and daily weight. Monitor urine specific gravity , serum electrolytes, and BUN.

Diabetes mellitus DESCRIPTION Chronic disease of absolute or relative insulin deficiency or resistance Characterized by disturbances in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabo- lism Two primary forms:- Type 1, characterized by absolute insufficiency- Type 2, characterized by insulin resistance with varying degrees of in- sulin secretory defects PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The effects of diabetes mellitus (DM) result from insulin deficiency or re-sistance to endogenous insulin. (See Understanding diabetes mellitus, page 96.) Insulin allows glucose transport into the cells for use as energy or storageas glycogen. Insulin also stimulates protein synthesis and free fatty acid storage in theadipose tissues. Insulin deficiency compromises the body tissues' access to essential nu-trients for fuel and storage. CAUSES Autoimmune disease (type 1) Genetic factors ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Type 1 Rapidly developing symptoms Polyuria, nocturia Dehydration Polydipsia Dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor W eight loss and hunger; muscle wasting and loss subcutaneous fat MELLITUS 95897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 9596 DISORDERS FOCUS IN UNDERSTANDING DIABETES MELLITUS Diabetes affects the way the body uses food to make the energy for life. Type 1 diabetes /H18546The pancreas makes little or no insulin. /H18546In genetically susceptible patients, a triggering event (possibly a viral infec- tion) causes production of autoantibodies a gainst the beta cells of the pan- creas. /H18546The resultant destruction of beta cells leads to a decline in and ultimate lackof insulin secretion. /H18546Insulin deciency leads to hyperglycemia, enhanced proteinca tabolism. These occur when more than 90% of the beta cells have been destroyed. Type 2 diabetes /H18546Genetic factors are signicant, and onset is accelerated by obesity and asedentar y lifestyle. The pancreas produces some insulin, but it's either too little or ineffective. /H18546Factors that contribute to type 2 diabetes development include:- impaired insulin secretion - inappropriate hepatic glucose production- peripheral insulin receptor insensitivity.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation DESCRIPTION Syndrome of activated coagulation characterized by bleeding or thrombo-sis Complicates diseases and conditions that accelerate clotting, causing oc-clusion of small blood vessels, organ necrosis, depletion of circulatingclotting factors and platelets, and activation of the fibrinolytic system Also known as DIC, consumption coagulopathy, and defibrination syn- drome PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Typical accelerated clotting results in generalized activation of prothrom-bin and a consequent excess of thrombin. Excess to fibrin, producing fibrin process consumes exorbitant factors (espe-cially platelets, factor V , prothrombin, fibrinogen, and VIII), degradation products (FDPs). The hemorrhage occurs may be caused by the anticoagulant activityof FDPs and depletion of plasma coagulation factors. CAUSES Acute respiratory distress syndrome Cardiac arrest Diabetic ketoacidosis Disorders that produce necrosis, such as extensive burns and trauma Drug reactions Heatstroke Incompatible blood transfusion Infection, sepsis Neoplastic disease Obstetric complications Pulmonary embolism Sickle cell anemia Shock Surgery necessitating cardiopulmonary bypass ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Abnormal bleeding without a history of a serious hemorrhagic disorder, from any body orifice Signs of bleeding into the skin, such as cutaneous oozing, petechiae, ecchymoses, and hematomas Bleeding from surgical or invasive procedure sites, such as incisions orvenipuncture sites Nausea and vomiting, epistaxis, or GI bleeding Severe muscle, back, chest, or abdominal pain Hematuria or oliguria Acrocyanosis Dyspnea, tachypnea, and possible hemoptysis changes, including confusion; seizures TEST RESULTS Serum platelet count is less than 150,000/mm3. Serum fibrinogen level is less than 170 mg/dl. Prothrombin time is longer than 19 seconds. Partial thromboplastin time is longer than 40 seconds.DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION 101897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 1:44 PM Page 101FDPs are 45 mcg/ml or positive at less than 1:100 dilution.

Diverticular disease DESCRIPTION Bulging pouches (diverticula) in GI wall pushing the mucosal liningthrough surrounding muscle Sigmoid colon most common site but may develop anywhere, from proxi-mal end of the pharynx to the anus Other typical sites:- Duodenum, near border or the GI tract Diverticulosis: present but don't causing compli- cations PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Pressure in the intestinal lumen is exerted on weak areas, such as pointswhere blood vessels enter the intestine, causing a break in the muscularcontinuity of the GI wall, creating a diverticulum. (See How diverticular disease develops, page 104.)DIVERTICULAR DISEASE 103897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 103Inflammation follows bacterial infection, causing abdominal pain. Diverticulitis occurs when retained undigested food mixed with bacteria accumulates in the diverticulum, forming a hard mass (fecalith). This sub-stance cuts off the blood supply to the diverticulum's thin walls, increas-ing its susceptibility to attack by colonic bacteria. CAUSES Defects in colon wall strength Diminished colonic motility and increased intraluminal pressure ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Diverticulosis May be asymptomatic Occasional intermittent pain in the left lower abdominal quadrant, whichmay be relieved by defecation or the passage of flatus Alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea104 DISORDERS FOCUS IN HOW DIVERTICULAR DISEASE DEVELOPS Diverticula probably result from high intraluminal pressure on an area of weak- ness in the GI wall, where blood vessels enter. In diverticulitis, retained undigested food and bacteria accumulate in the diverticular sac. This hard mass cuts off the blood supply to the thin walls of thesac, making them more susceptible to attack by colonic bacteria. Inflammationfollows and may lead to perforation, PM Page 104Diverticulitis History of diverticulosis Low fiber consumption Complaints of moderate dull or steady pain in the left lower abdominal quadrant, aggravated by straining, lifting, or coughing; tenderness in thearea; palpable mass Mild nausea, gas, diarrhea, or intermittent bouts of constipation, some-times accompanied by rectal bleeding Low-grade fever Guarding and rebound tenderness (signs of peritoneal irritation, if acute) TEST RESULTS Complete blood count reveals leukocytosis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated in diverticulitis. Stool test result is positive for occult blood in 25% of patients with diver-ticulitis. Barium studies reveal barium-filled diverticula or outlines (doesn't fill diverticula blocked by impacted stools). ALERT Barium studies aren't performed for acute diverti - culitis because of the risk of rupture. Radiography may show colonic spasm, if irritable bowel syndrome ac-companies diverticular disease. Abdominal X-rays rule out perforation. Colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy reveals diverticula or inflamedmucosa (not usually performed in the acute phase). Biopsy rules out cancer. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen checks for the presence ofan abscess. TREATMENT No treatment required for asymptomatic diverticulosisIf mild diverticulosis or diverticulitis (without fever, elevated white count, or signs of peritonitis or bleeding): Liquid diet for 2 days of bowel rest, followed by high-fiber diet (if patientexperiencing pain) Stool softeners and fiber laxatives, if required Possible oral antibioticsIf severe diverticulitis: Nothing by mouth Colon or cases refractory to treatment Temporary colostomy possibly , to drain abscesses and rest the colon 6 to 8 weeks KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: express feelings of increased comfort maintain normal fluid volume have bowel movements that return to normal verbalize understanding of the disease process and treatment regimen.

Endocarditis DESCRIPTION Infection of prosthesisENDOCARDITIS 109897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 109PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Fibrin and platelets cluster on valve tissue and engulf circulating bacteria or fungi. (See Degenerative changes in endocarditis .) This produces vegetation, which in turn may cover the valve surfaces,causing deformities and destruction of valvular tissue that may extend tothe chordae tendineae, causing them to rupture, leading to valvular insuf-ficiency . Vegetative growth on the heart valves, endocardial lining of a heart cham-ber, or endothelium of a blood vessel may embolize to the spleen, kid-neys, central nervous system, and lungs.

White blood cell count with differential is normal or elevated. Complete blood count and anemia panel show normocytic, normo -chromic elevated. Serum rheumatoid factor is positive in about one-half of all patients withendocarditis after the disease is present for 6 weeks. Urinalysis shows proteinuria and microscopic hematuria.ENDOCARDITIS 111897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM 111Echocardiography may reveal valvular damage in up to 80% of patients with native valve disease. Electrocardiogram may show atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmiasthat accompany valvular disease. TREATMENT Selection of anti-infective based on type of infecting organism and sensi-tivity studies start promptly and continue for 4 to 6 weeks If blood cultures negative (10% to 20% of subacute cases), possible I.V .antibiotic therapy (usually for 4 to 6 weeks) against probable infecting organism Adequate hydration Bed rest Aspirin With severe valvular damage, especially aortic insufficiency or infectionof a cardiac prosthesis, possible corrective surgery if refractory heart fail-ure develops or if an infected prosthetic valve must be replaced KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: carry out activities of daily living without weakness or fatigue maintain hemodynamic stability with adequate cardiac output exhibit no arrhythmias maintain adequate ventilation express feelings about diminished capacity to perform usual roles.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease DESCRIPTION Backflow of gastric or duodenal contents, or both, into the esophagus andpast the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), without associated belching orvomiting Reflux of gastric acid, causing acute epigastric pain, usually after a meal Popularly called heartburn Also called GERD PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Reflux occurs when LES pressure is deficient or when pressure in thestomach exceeds LES pressure. The LES relaxes, and gastric contents re-gurgitate into the esophagus. The degree of mucosal injury is based on the amount and concentrationof refluxed gastric acid, proteolytic enzymes, and bile acids. CAUSES Any condition or position that increases intra-abdominal pressure Hiatal hernia with incompetent sphincter Pyloric surgery (alteration or removal of the pylorus), which allows refluxof bile or pancreatic juice ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Minimal or no symptoms in one-third of patients Heartburn that typically occurs 112to 2 hours after eating GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE 113897301.qxd:9781582558974_01 7/12/13 1:44 PM Page 113Heartburn that worsens with vigorous exercise, bending, lying down, wearing tight clothing, coughing, constipation, and obesity Reported relief by using antacids or sitting upright Regurgitation without associated nausea or belching Feeling of fluid accumulation in the throat without a sour or bitter taste Chronic pain radiating to the neck, jaws, and arms that may mimic anginapectoris Nocturnal hypersalivation and wheezing Odynophagia (sharp substernal pain on swallowing), possibly followed bya dull substernal ache Bright red or dark brown blood in vomitus Laryngitis and morning hoarseness Chronic cough TEST RESULTS Barium swallow with fluoroscopy reveals evidence of recurrent reflux. Esophageal acidity test reveals degree of gastroesophageal reflux. Gastroesophageal scintillation test reveals reflux. Esophageal manometry reveals abnormal LES pressure and sphincter in-competence. Acid perfusion (Bernstein) test confirms esophagitis. Esophagoscopy and biopsy confirm pathologic changes in the mucosa. TREATMENT Modification of lifestyle Positional therapy Removal of cause W eight reduction, if appropriate Avoidance of dietary causes Avoidance of eating 2 hours before sleep (see Factors affecting LES pres-sure) Parenteral nutrition or tube feeding Lifting restrictions for surgical treatment (no activity restrictions for med-ical treatment) Antacids Cholinergics Histamine-2 receptor 114KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: state and demonstrate understanding of the disorder and its treatment express feelings of increased comfort show no signs of aspiration have minimal or no complications.

Glomerulonephritis DESCRIPTION Bilateral inflammation of the glomeruli, typically following a streptococ-cal infection Also called acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Epithelial or podocyte layer of the glomerular membrane is disturbed, re-sulting in a loss of negative charge. Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis results from the entrapmentand collection of antigen-antibody complexes in the glomerular capillarymembranes, after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Antigens stimulate the formation of antibodies. Circulating antigen-antibody complexes become lodged in the glom erularcapillaries. Complexes initiate complement activation and the release of immunolog-ic substances that lyse cells and increase membrane permeability . Antibody damage to basement membranes causes crescent formation. Antibody or antigen-antibody complexes in the glomerular capillary wallactivate biochemical mediators of \u2014 Activated complement attracts neutrophils and monocytes, which releaselysosomal enzymes that damage the glomerular cell walls and cause aproliferation of the extracellular matrix, affecting glomerular blood flow . Membrane permeability increases, causing a loss of negative chargeacross the glomerular membrane as well as enhanced protein filtration. Membrane damage leads to platelet aggregation, and platelet degranula-tion nephrosis ALERT The presenting features of glomerulonephritis in children may be encephalopathy with seizures and local neu- rologic deficits. An elderly patient wi th glomeru lonephr itis may re- port vague, nonspecific symptoms, such as nausea, malaise, and arthralgia. ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Complaints of decreased urination History of recent streptococcal infection of the respiratory tract Smoky or coffee-colored urine Dyspnea Periorbital edema Increased blood pressure TEST RESULTS Throat culture reveals group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels are elevated. Serum protein level decreases. Hemoglobin level decreases in chronic glomerulonephritis. Antistreptolysin-O titer is elevated. Streptozyme and anti-DNase B levels are elevated. Serum complement level is low .

Blood backs up into the left atrium and lungs, causing pulmonary conges-tion. Right-sided heart failure Ineffective contractile function of the right ventricle leads to blood back-ing up into the right atrium and the peripheral circulation, which resultsin peripheral edema and engorgement of the kidneys and other organs. CAUSES Anemia Arrhythmias Cardiomyopathy Constrictive pericarditis Coronary artery disease Emotional stress Hypertension Increased salt or water intake Infections Mitral or aortic insufficiency Mitral Symptoms of any underlying disorder as precipitant Dyspnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Peripheral edema Fatigue W eakness Insomnia Anorexia Nausea Sense of abdominal fullness (particularly in right-sided heart failure) Reduced cardiac output Cough that produces pink, frothy sputum Cyanosis of the lips and nail beds Pale, cool, clammy skin Diaphoresis Jugular vein distention Ascites Tachycardia Pulsus and pulse oximetry Decreased urinary output Anxiety Orthopnea Substance abuse (alcohol, drugs, tobacco) TEST RESULTS B-type natriuretic peptide immunoassay is elevated. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are elevated. Chest X-rays show increased pulmonary vascular interstitial or left ventricular hypertrophy .

Hepatitis, viral DESCRIPTION Infection and inflammation of the liver caused by a virus Six types recognized (A, B, C, D, E, and G), and a seventh suspected Marked by hepatic cell destruction, necrosis, and autolysis, leading patients, eventual regeneration of hepatic cells with little or no residual damage, allowing recovery Complications more likely with old age and serious underlying disorders Prognosis poor if edema and hepatic encephalopathy develop PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Hepatic inflammation caused by a virus leads to diffuse injury and necro-sis of hepatocytes. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of Kupffer cells and sinusoidal lining cellsoccur. Bile obstruction may occur. CAUSES Infection with the causative viruses for each of six major forms of viralhepatitis Type A Ingestion of contaminated food, milk, or water Transmittal by the fecal-oral or parenteral route Type B Transmittal by contact with contaminated human blood, secretions (suchas saliva, tears, semen, or vaginal mucus), and stool Type C Transmittal primarily by sharing of needles by I.V . drug users or throughblood transfusions or tattoo needles Type D Found only in patients with an acute or a chronic episode of hepatitis B Type E Transmittal by parenteral route and commonly water-borne Type G Thought to be blood-borne, with transmission similar to that of hepatitisB and C ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Prodromal stage Patient easily fatigued, with generalized malaise Anorexia, mild weight loss DepressionHEPATITIS, VIRAL 123897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 Arthralgia, myalgia (hepatitis B) Nausea or vomiting Changes in the senses of taste and smell Fever (100\u00b0 to 102\u00b0 F [37.8\u00b0 Clinical jaundice stage Pruritus Abdominal pain or tenderness in right upper quadrant Indigestion Anorexia Possible jaundice of sclerae, mucous membranes, and skin Rashes, erythematous patches, or hives Enlarged and tender liver (see Effect of viral hepatitis on the liver ) Splenomegaly Cervical adenopathy Posticteric stage Most symptoms decreasing or subsided Decrease in liver enlargement TEST RESULTS Routine hepatitis profile identifies antibodies specific to the causative virus and establishes the type of hepatitis: - Type A: detection of presence of an antibody to hepatitis A - Type B: detection of presence of hepatitis B surface antigens and he- patitis B antibodies confirming the diagnosis - Type C: diagnosis dependent upon serologic testing for the specific an- tibody one or more months after the onset of acute illness; until then,diagnosis principally established by obtaining negative test results forhepatitis A, B, and D - Type D: detection of intrahepatic delta antigens or immunoglobulin (Ig) M antidelta antigens in acute disease (or IgM and IgG in chronicdisease) - Type E: detection of hepatitis E antigens supporting the diagnosis; however, diagnosis possibly also ruling out hepatitis C - Type G: detection of hepatitis G ribonucleic acid supporting 124Additional findings from aspartate aminotransferase and are increased in the prodromal stage of acute viral hepatitis. - Serum alkaline phosphatase level is slightly increased.- Serum bilirubin level is elevated; level may stay elevated late in the disease, especially with severe disease. - Prothrombin time (PT) is prolonged (PT more than 3 seconds longer than normal indicates severe liver damage). - White blood cell count commonly reveals transient neutropenia and lymphopenia, followed by lymphocytosis. Liver biopsy shows chronic hepatitis. TREATMENT No specific drug therapy exists for hepatitis, except for hepatitis C.HEPATITIS, VIRAL 125 FOCUS IN EFFECT OF VIRAL HEPATITIS ON THE LIVER On entering the body, the virus either kills hepatocytes directly or activates inflammatory and immune reactions that injure or destroy the hepatocytes bylysing the infected or neighboring cells. Later, direct antibody attack against theviral antigens causes further destruction of the infected cells. Edema andswelling of the interstitium lead to collapse of capillaries and decreased bloodflow, tissue hypoxia, and scarring and brosis.

Hernia, inguinal DESCRIPTION Part of an internal organ that protrudes through an abnormal opening inthe wall of the cavity that surrounds it (see Common sites of hernia, pages 128 and 129) The most common type of hernia Two types: direct and indirect- Direct: occurs more commonly in middle-age and elderly people- Indirect: more common, may develop at any age, three times more common in males, and especially prevalent in infants Also called ruptures PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In an inguinal hernia, the large or small intestine, omentum, or bladderprotrudes into the inguinal canal. In a direct inguinal hernia, instead of entering the canal through the inter-nal ring, the hernia passes through the posterior inguinal wall, protrudesdirectly through the transverse fascia of the canal (in an area known asHesselbach's triangle ), and comes out at the external ring. In an indirect hernia, abdominal viscera leave the abdomen through theinguinal ring and follow the spermatic cord (in males) or round ligament(in females); they emerge at the external ring and extend down into theinguinal canal, often into the scrotum or labia. In strangulated hernia, part of the herniated intestine becomes twisted oredematous, interfering with normal blood flow and peristalsis, and possi-bly leading to obstruction and necrosis. CAUSES Direct \u2014 weakness in fascial floor of inguinal canal Indirect \u2014 weakness in fascial margin of internal inguinal ring Either \u2014 weak abdominal muscles (caused by congenital malformation,HERNIA, INGUINAL 127897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:47 PM Page 127128 DISORDERS COMMON SITES OF HERNIA There are four common sites of hernia: umbilical, incisional, inguinal, and femoral. Here are descriptions of each type with an illustration demonstratingwhere each type is located. Umbilical Umbilical hernia results from abnormal muscular structures around the umbilicalcord. This hernia is quite common in neonates but also occurs in women whoare obese or who have had several pregnancies. Because most umbilical herniasin infants close spontaneously, surgery is warranted only if the hernia persistsfor more than 4 or 5 years. Taping or binding the affected area or supporting itwith a truss may relieve symptoms until the hernia closes. A severe congenitalumbilical hernia, which allows the abdominal viscera to protrude must be repaired immediately. Incisional Incisional (ventral) hernia develops at the site of previous surgery, usually alongvertical incisions. This hernia may result from a weakness in the abdominal wall,caused by an infection, impaired wound healing, inadequate nutrition, extremeabdominal distention, or obesity. Palpation of an incisional hernia may revealseveral defects in the surgical scar. Effective repair requires pulling the layers ofthe abdominal wall together without creating tension or, if this isn't possible, theuse of Teflon, Marlex mesh, or tantalum mesh to close the opening. Umbilical Incisional Inguinal Femoral897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:47 PM Page 128trauma, or aging) or increased intra-abdominal pressure (caused by heavy lifting, pregnancy , ascites, obesity , or straining) ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Sharp or \"catching\" pain when lifting or straining (see Identifying a her- nia, page 130) Obvious swelling or lump in the inguinal area (large hernia) TEST RESULTS White blood cell count is elevated with intestinal obstruction. TREATMENT Manual reduction Truss Activity , as tolerated, avoiding lifting and straining Nothing by mouth if surgery is necessary Analgesics Antibiotics Electrolyte replacement Herniorrhaphy Hernioplasty Bowel resection (with strangulation SITES OF HERNIA (continued) Inguinal Inguinal hernia can be direct or indirect. An indirect inguinal hernia causes the abdominal viscera to protrude through the inguinal ring and follow the spermaticcord (in males) or round ligament (in females). A direct inguinal hernia resultsfrom a weakness in the fascial floor of inguinal canal. Femoral Femoral hernia occurs where the femoral artery passes into the femoral canal.Typically, a fatty deposit within the femoral canal enlarges and eventually createsa hole big enough to accommodate part of the peritoneum and bladder. A femoralhernia appears as a swelling or bulge at the pulse point of the large femoralartery. It's usually a soft, pliable, reducible, nontender mass incarcerated or strangulated.897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 PM Page 129KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: express feelings of increased comfort have normal bowel function avoid complications. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Apply a truss after a hernia has been reduced. Give all prescribed medications for pain. Encourage coughing and deep breathing, while you splint the incision with a pillow . Monitor vital signs. Assess pain control. Observe for signs of strangulation or incarceration. PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: avoiding lifting heavy objects or straining during bowel movements signs and symptoms of infection (oozing, tenderness, warmth, and red-ness) at the incision site wound care after surgery , not resuming normal activity or returning to work withoutthe surgeon's permission.130 DISORDERS IDENTIFYING A HERNIA Palpation of the inguinal area while the patient is performing Valsalva's maneu- ver conrms the diagnosis of inguinal hernia. To detect a hernia in a malepatient, ask the patient to stand with his ipsilateral leg slightly flexed and hisweight resting on the other leg. Insert an index nger into the lower part of thescrotum and invaginate the scrotal skin so the nger advances through theexternal inguinal ring to the internal ring (about 1/2/H11033to 2/H11033 [1 to 5 cm] through the inguinal canal). Tell the patient to cough. If pressure is felt against the nger-tip, an indirect hernia exists; if pressure is felt against side of adirect hernia exists.897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 Rupture of fibrocartilaginous material that surrounds the intervertebral disk, allowing protrusion of the nucleus pulposus Results in pressure on spinal nerve roots or spinal cord that causes backpain and other symptoms of nerve root irritation Most common site for herniation: L4-L5 sites C5-C6 Clinical manifestations determined by:- location and size of the herniation into the spinal canal- amount of space that exists inside the spinal canal About 90% affecting lumbar (L) Lumbar herniation more common in people ages 20 to 45 Cervical herniation more common in people ages 45 and older Herniated disks more common in men than in women Also known as herniated nucleus pulposus, slipped disk, or ruptured disk PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The ligament and posterior capsule of the disk are usually torn, allowingthe nucleus pulposus to extrude, compressing the nerve root. Occasionally , the injury tears the entire disk loose, causing protrusiononto the nerve root or compression of the spinal cord. Large amounts of extruded nucleus pulposus or complete disk herniationof the capsule and nucleus pulposus may compress the spinal cord. (SeeHow a herniated disk develops, page 132.) CAUSES Degenerative disk disease Direct injury Improper lifting or twisting ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Previous traumatic injury or back strain Unilateral, lower back pain Pain that may radiate to the buttocks, legs, and feet Pain that may begin suddenly , subside in a few days, and then recur atshorter intervals with progressive intensity HERNIATED INTERVERTEBRAL DISK 131897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:47 PM Page 131Sciatic pain beginning as a dull ache in the buttocks, worsening with Val- salva's maneuver, coughing, sneezing, or bending Pain that may subside with rest Muscle spasms Chronic repetitive injury Limited ability to bend forward Posture favoring the affected side Muscle atrophy , in later stages Tenderness over the affected region Radicular pain with straight leg raising in lumbar herniation Increased pain with neck movement in cervical herniation Referred upper trunk pain with cervical neck compression TEST RESULTS X-rays of the spine show degenerative changes.

Hip fracture DESCRIPTION Break in the head or neck of the femur (usually the head) Most common fall-related injury resulting in hospitalization Leading cause of disability among older adults May permanently change level of functioning and independence Almost 25% of patients die within 1 year following hip fracture Affects more than 200,000 people each year Occurs in one of five women by age 80, and is more common in females than in males PATHOPHYSIOLOGY With bone fracture, the periosteum and blood vessels in the marrow , cor-tex, and surrounding soft tissues are disrupted. Disruption of the periosteum and blood vessels results in bleeding fromthe damaged ends of the bone and from the neighboring soft tissue. Clot formation occurs within the medullary canal, between the fracturedbone ends, and beneath the periosteum. Bone tissue immediately adjacent to the fracture dies, and the necrotictissue causes an intense inflammatory response. Vascular tissue invades the fracture area from surrounding soft tissue andmarrow cavity within 48 hours, increasing blood flow to the entire bone. Bone-forming cells in the periosteum, endosteum, and marrow are acti-vated to produce subperiosteal procallus along the outer surface of theshaft and over the broken ends of the bone. Collagen and matrix, which become mineralized to form callus, are syn-thesized by osteoblasts within the procallus. During the repair process, remodeling occurs; unnecessary callus is re-sorbed, and trabeculae are formed along stress lines. New bone, not scar tissue, is formed over the healed fracture.HIP FRACTURE 135897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:47 PM Page 135CAUSES Cancer metastasis Falls Osteoporosis Skeletal disease Trauma ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Falls or trauma to the bones Pain in the affected hip and leg Pain exacerbated by movement Outward rotation of affected extremity Affected extremity possibly appearing shorter Limited or abnormal range of motion (ROM) Edema and discoloration of the surrounding tissue In an open fracture, bone protruding through the skin TEST RESULTS X-rays show the location of the fracture.

Human immunodeciency virus infection DESCRIPTION Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1; retrovirus causing ac- quired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Causes patients to become susceptible to opportunistic infections, unusu-al cancers, and other abnormalities Marked by progressive failure of the immune system Transmitted by contact with infected blood or body fluids and associatedwith identifiable high-risk behaviors PATHOPHYSIOLOGY HIV strikes helper T cells bearing the CD4 antigen. The antigen serves as a receptor for the retrovirus and lets it enter thecell. After invading a cell, HIV replicates, leading to cell death, or becomes la-tent. HIV infection leads to profound pathology , either directly , through de-struction of CD4 +cells, cells, and neuroglial cells, or indi- rectly , through the secondary sultant immunosuppression.138 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 138CAUSES Infection with HIV , a retrovirus ASSESSMENT FINDINGS A high-risk exposure and inoculation, followed by a mononucleosis-like syndrome (patient then possibly asymptomatic for years) In the latent stage, la boratory evidence of seroconversion the only sign of HIV infection Persistent generalized adenopathy Nonspecific symptoms (weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, fevers) Neurologic symptoms resulting from HIV encephalopathy Opportunistic infection or cancer (Kaposi's sarcoma) TEST RESULTS CD4+T-cell count is at least 200 Screening test enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmatorytest (W estern blot) detect the presence of HIV antibodies.

Calcium helps to maintain cell structure and function by playing a role incell membrane permeability and impulse transmission. It affects the contraction of cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and skeletalmuscle and participates in the blood-clotting process. Increased resorption of calcium from bone leads to increased rate of calci-um entry into extracellular fluid. Calcium in extracellular fluid becomes greater than calcium excretion bythe kidneys. (See Clinical effects of hypercalcemia .)

Hypertension DESCRIPTION Intermittent or sustained elevation of diastolic or systolic blood pressure Usually begins as benign disease, slowly progressing to accelerated or ma-lignant state Two major types: essential (also called primary or idiopathic) hyperten- sion and secondary hypertension, which results from renal disease or an-other identifiable causeHYPERTENSION 149897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:47 PM Page form and a medical emer- gency; commonly arises from both types PATHOPHYSIOLOGY There are several theories on how hypertension develops. (See Under- standing hypertension .)150 DISORDERS FOCUS IN UNDERSTANDING HYPERTENSION Arterial blood pressure is a product of total peripheral resistance (TPR) and car- diac output (CO). CO is increased by conditions that increase heart rate, strokevolume, or both. TPR is increased by factors that increase blood viscosity orreduce the lumen size of vessels, especially the arterioles. Several theories help explain how hypertensiondevelops, including: /H18546changes in the arteriolar arteriole andincreases blood volume. Increased blood volume Increasedcardiac output Increased blood flow Increased O 2 Decreased P CO2 Compensatory vasoconstriction Decreased blood flow Increased TPR897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 alcohol intake ASSESSMENT FINDINGS In many cases, no symptoms, and disorder revealed incidentally duringevaluation for another disorder or during a routine blood pressure screen-ing program Symptoms that reflect the effect of hypertension on the organ systems Awakening with a headache in the occipital region, which subsides spon-taneously after a few hours Dizziness, fatigue, and confusion Palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea Epistaxis Hematuria Blurred vision Bounding pulse Peripheral edema in late stages Hemorrhages, exudates, and papilledema of the eye in late stages Pulsating abdominal mass, suggesting an abdominal aneurysm Elevated blood pressure on at least two consecutive occasions after initialscreenings Serial blood pressure measurements:- prehypertension: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 80 to 89 mm Hg - stage 1: SBP 140 to 159 mm Hg or DBP 90 to 99 mm Hg- stage 2: SBP greater than 160 mm Hg or DBP greater than 100 mm Hg Bruits over the abdominal aorta and femoral arteries or the carotids TEST RESULTS Urinalysis may show protein, red blood cells, or white blood cells, sug-gesting renal disease, or glucose, suggesting diabetes mellitus.

Hypothyroidism DESCRIPTION Clinical condition characterized by either decreased circulating levels ofor resistance to free thyroid hormone (TH) Classified as primary or secondary Severe hypothyroidism known as myxedema PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In primary hypothyroidism, a decrease in TH production is a result of theloss of thyroid tissue. Loss of thyroid tissue results in an increased secretion of thyroid-stimu-lating hormone (TSH) that leads to a goiter. In secondary hypothyroidism, the pituitary typically fails to synthesizeor secrete adequate amounts of TSH, or target tissues fail to respond tonormal blood levels of TH. Either type may progress to myxedema, which is clinically more severeand considered a medical emergency 160 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 (Hashimoto's) (most common cause) Congenital defects Endemic iodine deficiency External radiation to the neck Hypothalamic failure to produce thyrotropin-releasing hormone Idiopathic Inflammatory conditions Medications, such as iodides and lithium Pituitary failure to produce TSH Pituitary tumor Postpartum pituitary necrosis Radioactive iodine therapy Sarcoidosis Thyroid gland surgery ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Vague and varied symptoms that developed slowly over time Energy loss, fatigue Forgetfulness Sensitivity to cold Unexplained weight gain Constipation Anorexia Decreased libido Menorrhagia Paresthesia Joint stiffness Muscle cramping Slight mental slowing to severe obtundation Thick, dry tongue Hoarseness; slow , slurred speech Dry , flaky , Puffy face, hands, and feet Periorbital edema; drooping upper eyelids Dry , sparse hair with patchy hair loss Loss of outer third of eyebrow Thick, brittle nails with transverse and longitudinal grooves Ataxia, intention tremor, nystagmusHYPOTHYROIDISM 161897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 161Doughy skin that feels cool W eak pulse and bradycardia Muscle weakness Sacral or peripheral edema Delayed reflex relaxation time Possible goiter Absent or decreased bowel sounds Hypotension A gallop or distant heart sounds Adventitious breath sounds Abdominal distention or ascites TEST RESULTS Radioimmunoassay shows decreased serum levels of T3and T4. Serum TSH level is increased or pituitary insufficiency show low serum sodium levels in myxedema coma. Arterial blood gases show decreased pH and increased partial pressure ofcarbon dioxide in myxedema coma. Skull X-rays, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imag-ing may show pituitary or hypothalamic lesions.

Monitor the patient's bowel sounds, abdominal distention, and frequency of bowel movements. Monitor the patient's mental and neurologic status. Observe for signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment prescribed medications and possible adverse effects when to notify the physician physical and mental changes signs and symptoms of myxedema need for life-long hormone replacement therapy need to wear a medical identification bracelet importance of keeping accurate records of daily weight need to adhere to a well-balanced, high-fiber, low-sodium obstruction DESCRIPTION Partial or complete blockage of the lumen of the small or large bowel Commonly a medical emergency Most likely after abdominal surgery or with congenital bowel deformities Without treatment, may cause death within hours from shock and vascu- lar collapse PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Mechanical or nonmechanical (neurogenic) blockage of the lumen occurs. Fluid, air, or gas collects near the site. Peristalsis increases temporarily in an attempt to break through the block-age. Intestinal mucosa is injured, and distention at and above the site of ob-struction occurs. Venous blood flow is impaired, and normal absorptive processes cease. Water, sodium, and potassium are secreted by the bowel into the fluidpooled in the lumen. CAUSES Mechanical obstruction Adhesions Carcinomas Compression of the bowel wall from stenosis, intussusception, volvulusof the sigmoid of vessels Toxicity , such as that associated with uremia or generalized infection ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Recent change in bowel habits Hiccups164 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 164Mechanical obstruction Colicky pain Nausea, vomiting Constipation Distended abdomen Borborygmi and rushes (occasionally loud enough to be heard without a stethoscope) Abdominal tenderness Rebound tenderness Nonmechanical obstruction Diffuse abdominal discomfort Frequent vomiting Severe abdominal pain (if obstruction results from vascular insufficiencyor infarction) Abdominal distention Decreased bowel sounds (early), then absent bowel sounds TEST RESULTS Serum sodium, chloride, and potassium levels are decreased. White blood cell count is elevated. Serum amylase level is increased if pancreas is irritated by a bowel loop. Blood urea nitrogen is increased with dehydration. Abdominal X-rays reveal the presence and location of intestinal gas or flu-id. (In small-bowel obstruction, a typical \"stepladder\" pattern emerges,with alternating fluid and gas levels apparent in 3 to 4 hours.) Barium enema reveals a distended, air-filled colon or a closed loop of sig-moid with extreme distention (in sigmoid volvulus). TREATMENT Correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances Decompression of the bowel to relieve vomiting and distention Treatment of shock and peritonitis Nothing by mouth if surgery scheduled Parenteral nutrition until bowel is functioning High-fiber diet when obstruction is relieved and peristalsis returns Bed rest during acute phase Postoperatively , avoidance of lifting and contact sports Broad-spectrum antibiotics AnalgesicsINTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 165897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 165Blood replacement Surgery is usually the treatment of choice (exception is paralytic ileus in which nonoperative therapy usually attempted first) Type of surgery dependent on cause of blockage KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: express feelings of increased comfort maintain normal fluid volume return to normal bowel function maintain caloric requirement maintain stable vital signs. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Insert a nasogastric (NG) tube and attach to low-pressure, intermittentsuction. Maintain the patient in semi-Fowler's position. Provide mouth and nose care. Begin and maintain I.V . therapy , as ordered. Administer prescribed medications. Monitor vital signs. Assess for signs and symptoms of shock. Assess bowel sounds and signs of returning peristalsis.

Latex allergy DESCRIPTION An immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reac-tion to products that contain natural latex Can range from local dermatitis to life-threatening anaphylactic reaction Present in 1% to 5% of population of the United States Affects 10% to 30% of health care workers Most prevalent (20% to 68%) in patients with spina bifida and urogenitalabnormalities Affects males and females equally PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Mast cells release histamine and other secretory products. Vascular permeability increases and vasodilation and bronchoconstric-tion occur. Chemical sensitivity dermatitis is a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reac-tion to the chemicals used in processing rather than the latex itself. In a cell-mediated allergic reaction, sensitized T lymphocytes are trig-gered, stimulating the proliferation of other lymphocytes and mononu-clear cells, resulting in tissue inflammation and contact dermatitis. CAUSES Frequent contact with latex-containing products ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Exposure to latex Signs of anaphylaxis Rash Angioedema and urticaria Page 167TEST RESULTS Radioallergosorbent test shows specific IgE antibodies to latex (safest for use in patients with history of type I hypersensitivity). Patch test results in hives with itching or redness as a positive response. TREATMENT Prevention of exposure, including use of latex-free products to decreasepossible exacerbation of hypersensitivity (Proventil) KEY PATIENT The patient will: maintain a patent airway remain hemodynamically stable identify latex products in order to avoid exposure. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Maintain airway , breathing, and circulation. Administer prescribed medications. ALERT When adding medication to an I.V . bag, inject the drug through the spike port, not the rubber latex port. Monitor vital signs. Assess and continue to monitor respiratory status. Keep the patient's environment latex free.

The immature, nonfunctioning WBCs spill into the bloodstream and over-whelm red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets; from there, they infiltrate oth-er tissues. (See Understanding leukemia, page 170.) CAUSES Unknown Risk factors: radiation exposure, drugs, genetic abnormalities, toxins, andviruses ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Sudden onset of high fever Abnormal bleeding or bruising Fatigue and night sweats W eakness, lassitude, recurrent infections, and chills Abdominal or bone pain in patients with ALL, AML, or acute monoblasticleukemia Tachycardia, palpitations, and a systolic ejection murmur Decreased ventilation Pallor Lymph node enlargement Liver or spleen enlargementLEUKEMIA, ACUTE 169897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 169TEST RESULTS and neutropenia, and a WBC dif- ferential shows the cell type. Computed tomography scan shows the affected organs, and cerebrospinalfluid analysis shows abnormal WBC invasion of the central nervous sys-tem. Bone marrow aspiration shows a proliferation of immature WBCs (con-firming acute leukemia). ALERT If aspirate is dry or free from leukemic cells but the patient has other typical signs of leukemia, a bone marrow biopsy, usually of the posterior superior iliac spine, must be per-formed. Lumbar puncture detects meningeal involvement.170 DISORDERS FOCUS IN UNDERSTANDING LEUKEMIA Leukemias cause an abnormal proliferation of white blood cells (WBC) and sup- pression of other blood components. A rapidly progressing disease, acuteleukemia is characterized by the malignant proliferation of WBC precursors(blasts) in bone marrow or lymph tissue and by their accumulation in peripheralblood, bone marrow, and body tissues. In chronic forms of leukemia, diseaseonset occurs more insidiously, commonly with no symptoms.

Control mouth ulceration by checking often for obvious ulcers and gumswelling and by providing frequent mouth care and saline rinses. Observe for complications from treatment. Assess the patient's hydration and nutritional status. Test urine pH (should be above 7.5). Monitor vital signs. Observe for signs and symptoms of bleeding. The patient and family should be referred to community support groupsand services. PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment medication administration, dosage, and possible adverse effects use of a soft toothbrush and avoidance of hot, spicy foods and commer-cial mouthwashes signs and symptoms of infection signs and symptoms of abnormal bleeding planned rest periods during the day . Leukemia, chronic lymphocytic DESCRIPTION Most benign and slowly progressive form of leukemia Prognosis poor if anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, bulky 172Most common in elderly people; nearly all afflicted are men older than age 50 Accounts for almost one-third of new leukemia cases annually Higher incidence recorded within families Typically , can be an incidental finding of other miscellaneous blood tests PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a generalized, progressive diseasemarked by an uncontrollable spread of abnormal, small lymphocytes inlymphoid tissue, blood, and bone marrow . Once these cells infiltrate bone marrow , lymphoid tissue, and organ sys-tems, clinical signs begin to appear. Gross bone marrow replacement by abnormal lymphocytes is the mostcommon cause of death, usually within 4 to 5 years of diagnosis. CAUSES Exact cause unknown ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Fatigue, malaise, fever, weight loss, and frequent infections W eakness, palpitations Macular or nodular eruptions and evidence of skin infiltration Enlarged lymph nodes, liver, and spleen Bone tenderness and edema from lymph node obstruction Pallor, dyspnea, tachycardia, bleeding, and infection from bone marrowinvolvement Signs of opportunistic fungal, viral, or bacterial infections TEST RESULTS A complete blood count reveals numerous abnormal lymphocytes.- In the early stages, white blood cell (WBC) count is mildly but persis- tently elevated; granulocytopenia is the rule, although WBC countclimbs as disease progresses. - Hemoglobin level is under 11g/dl.- WBC differential shows neutropenia (less than 1,500/\u00b5l) or (more than electrophoresis shows hypogammaglobulinemia.

Others originate in the intrahepatic bile (cholan-giomas). Approximately 30% to 70% of patients with hepatomas also have cirrho-sis. Rare tumors include a mixed-cell type, Kupffer cell sarcoma, and hepato-blastoma. The liver is one of the most common sites of metastasis from other pri-mary cancers. Cells metastasize to gallbladder, mesentery , peritoneum,and diaphragm by direct extension. CAUSES Immediate cause unknown Environmental exposure to carcinogens Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis C virus Hepatitis D virus Possibly androgens and oral estrogens ASSESSMENT FINDINGS W eight loss W eakness, fatigue, and fever Initially , dull aching abdominal pain Severe pain in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant Jaundice Dependent edema Abdominal bruit, hum, or rubbing sound Tender, nodular, enlarged liver Ascites Palpable mass in the right upper quadrantLIVER CANCER levels are greater than 500 mcg/ml. Electrolyte results indicate retention of sodium, causing functional renalfailure. Liver scan may show filling defects and lesions in the liver. Arteriography may define large tumors. Ultrasound and computed tomography scans may reveal lesions in theliver. Liver biopsy by needle or open biopsy reveals cancerous cells. TREATMENT Radiation therapy (alone or with chemotherapy) High-calorie, low-protein diet Frequent rest periods Postoperative avoidance of heavy lifting and contact sports Chemotherapeutic drugs Liver transplantation Resection (lobectomy or partial hepatectomy) KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain hemodynamic stability maintain adequate cardiac output exhibit adequate coping behaviors maintain normal fluid volume express feelings of increased comfort.

Lung cancer DESCRIPTION Malignant tumors arising from the respiratory epithelium Most common types: epidermoid (squamous cell), adenocarcinoma,small-cell (oat common site: wall or epithelium of bronchial tree For most patients, poor prognosis, depending on extent of cancer when di-agnosed and cells' growth rate (13% of patients survive 5 years after diag-nosis) PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Individuals with lung cancer demonstrate bronchial epithelial changesprogressing from squamous cell alteration or metaplasia to carcinoma insitu. Tumors originating in the bronchi are thought to be more mucus produc-ing. Partial or complete obstruction of the airway occurs with tumor growth,resulting in lobar collapse distal to the tumor. Early metastasis occurs to other thoracic structures, such as hilar lymphnodes or the mediastinum. Distant metastasis occurs to the brain, liver, bone, and adrenal glands.(See How lung cancer develops, page 178.) CAUSES Exact cause unknown Risk factors: tobacco smoking, exposure to carcinogens, genetic predispo-sitionLUNG CANCER 177897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 177ASSESSMENT Possibly no symptoms Exposure to carcinogens Coughing Hemoptysis Hoarseness178 DISORDERS FOCUS IN HOW LUNG CANCER DEVELOPS Lung cancer usually begins with the transformation of one epithelial cell within the patient's airway. Although the exact cause of such change remains unclear,some lung cancers originating in the bronchi may be more vulnerable to injuriesfrom carcinogens. As the tumor grows, it can partially or completely obstruct the airway, result- ing in lobar collapse distal to the tumor. Early metastasis may occur to other tho-racic structures as well. Trachea Metastasis to hilar lymph nodes Tumor projecting into bronchi Metastasis to carinal lymph nodes Tumor Page 178Fatigue Dyspnea on exertion Finger clubbing Edema of the face, neck, and upper torso Dilated chest and abdominal veins (superior vena cava syndrome) W eight loss Enlarged lymph nodes Enlarged liver Decreased breath sounds Wheezing Pleural friction rub Recurrent bronchitis or pneumonia TEST RESULTS Cytologic sputum analysis shows diagnostic evidence of pulmonary ma- lignancy . Liver function test results are abnormal, especially with metastasis. Chest X-rays may show size and location of advanced lesions (possibly asold as 2 years). Contrast studies of the bronchial tree (chest tomography , bronchography)demonstrate size, location, and lesion. Bone scan detects metastasis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest detects of the brain detects metastasis. Positron emission tomography aids in the diagnosis of primary andmetastatic sites. Bronchoscopy identifies tumor site (bronchoscopic washings provide ma-terial for cytologic and histologic study). Needle of the lungs (relies on biplanar fluoroscopic visual controlto locate peripheral tumors before withdrawing a tissue specimen foranalysis) allows firm diagnosis in 80% of patients. Tissue biopsy of metastatic sites, including supraclavicular and mediasti-nal nodes and pleura, is used to assess disease extent (based on histologicfindings; staging describes disease's extent and prognosis and is used todirect treatment). Thoracentesis allows chemical and cytologic examination of pleural fluid. Gallium scans of the liver and spleen detect metastasis. Exploratory thoracotomy is used to obtain a biopsy specimen.LUNG CANCER 179897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 179TREATMENT Various combinations of surgery , radiation therapy , and chemotherapy to improve prognosis Palliative (most treatments) Preoperative and postoperative radiation therapy Laser therapy (experimental) W ell-balanced diet Activity , as tolerated per breathing capacity Chemotherapy drug combinations Immunotherapy (investigational) Partial removal of lung (wedge resection, segmental resection, lobectomy ,radical lobectomy) , radical pneumonectomy) COLLABORATION Optimal management of the lung cancer patient will include consultation with a radiatio n onc ologist, social worker, dietitian, and physical therapist.

Lyme disease DESCRIPTION A multisystem disorder caused by a spirochete PATHOPHYSIOLOGY A tick injects spirochete laden saliva into the bloodstream or deposits fe- cal matter on the skin. After incubating for 3 to 32 days, the spirochetes migrate outward on theskin, causing a rash, and disseminate to other skin sites or organs throughthe bloodstream or lymph system. Spirochetes may survive for years in the joints or die after triggering aninflammatory response in the host. CAUSES The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, carried by the minute tick Ixodes dammini (also called I. scapularis ) or another tick in the Ixodidae family ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Recent exposure to ticks Onset of symptoms in warmer months Severe headache and stiff neck with rash eruption Fever (up to 104\u00ba F [40\u00ba C]) and chills Regional lymphadenopathy Tenderness in the skin lesion site or the posterior cervical area Tachycardia or irregular heartbeat Mild dyspnea Erythema 181Arthralgia Neurologic signs and symptoms, such as memory impairment and myelitis Bell's palsy Intermittent arthritis (see Differentiating Lyme disease ) Cardiac symptoms, such as heart failure, pericarditis, and dyspnea Fibromyalgia Ocular signs such as conjunctivitis TEST RESULTS Assays for anti-B. burgdorferi (anti-B) show evidence of previous or rent Enzyme-linked immunosorbent technology or indirect immunofluores-cence microscopy shows immunoglobulin (Ig) M levels that peak 3 to 6weeks after infection; IgG antibodies detected several weeks after infec-tion may continue to develop for several months and generally persist foryears. Positive W estern blot assay shows serologic evidence of past or currentinfection with B. burgdorferi. ALERT Serolog ic testing isn't useful early in the course of Lyme disease because of its low sensitivity. However, it may be more useful in later disease stages, when sensitivity and speci-ficity of the test are improved. Lumbar puncture with analysis of cerebrospinal fluid may show antibod-ies to B. burgdorferi. Skin biopsy may detect B. burgdorferi. TREATMENT Prompt tick removal using proper technique Rest periods when needed I.V . or oral antibiotics (initiated as soon as possible after infection)182 DISORDERS DIFFERENTIATING LYME DISEASE Lyme disease, or chronic neuroborreliosis, needs to be differentiated from chronic fatigue syndrome or bromyalgia, which is difcult late in the disease because of chronic pain and fatigue. The other diseases produce more general-ized and disabling symptoms; also, patients lack evidence of joint inflammation,have normal neurologic tests, and have a greater degree of anxiety and depres-sion than patients with Lyme disease.897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 182COLLABORATION Consult with a de rmatologi st, neur ologist, car diologist, an d infectious disease specialist to obtain the best functional outcome for the patient.

Lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's DESCRIPTION Heterogeneous group of malignant diseases that originate in lymphglands and other lymphoid tissue Usually classified 183897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 National Cancer Institute (Rappaport his- tologic and Lukes and Collins classifications also used in some facilities) New categories of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, called mantle zone lym- phoma and marginal zone lymphoma, identified recently Also called malignant lymphoma and lymphosarcoma Three times more common than Hodgkin's disease Incidence increasing, especially in patients with autoimmune disordersand those receiving immunosuppressant treatment or those with ac-quired immunodeficiency syndrome Uses same staging system as Hodgkin's disease PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma seems to be similar to Hodgkin's disease, butReed-Sternberg cells aren't present, and the lymph node destruction isdifferent. Lymphoid tissue is defined by the pattern of infiltration as diffuse ornodular. Nodular lymphomas yield a better prognosis than the diffuseform, but in both the prognosis is less hopeful than in Hodgkin's disease. CAUSES Exact cause unknown ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Symptoms mimic those of Hodgkin's disease Painless, swollen lymph glands (swelling may have appeared and disap-peared over several months) Complaints of fatigue, malaise, weight loss, fever, and night sweats Difficulty breathing, cough (usually children) Enlarged tonsils and adenoids Rubbery nodes in the cervical and supraclavicular areas TEST RESULTS Complete blood count shows anemia. Uric acid level is normal or elevated. Calcium level is elevated because of bone lesions. Miscellaneous scans (chest X-rays; lymphangiography; liver, bone, andspleen scans; the abdomen; and excreto-ry urography) show disease progression. Biopsies of lymph nodes; of tonsils, bone marrow , liver, bowel, or skin; or,as needed, of tissue removed during exploratory laparotomy lymphoma 1:48 PM Page 184TREATMENT Radiation therapy mainly during the localized stage of the disease Total nodal irradiation usually effective in nodular and diffuse lym- phomas W ell-balanced, high-calorie, high-protein diet Increased fluid intake Small, frequent meals Limited activity Frequent rest periods Chemotherapy in combinations Perforation (common in patients with gastric lymphomas) usually neces-sitates debulking procedure (such as subtotal or, in some cases, total gas-trectomy) before chemotherapy KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: have no further weight loss demonstrate effective coping mechanisms express feelings of increased comfort and decreased pain.

Mitral stenosis DESCRIPTION Narrowing of the mitral valve orifice, which is normally 3 to 6 cm Mild mitral stenosis: valve orifice of 2 cm Severe mitral stenosis: valve orifice of 1 cm PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Valve thevalvular cusps become rigid, and the valve's apex becomes narrowed. The narrowing of the apex obstructs blood flow from the left atrium tothe left ventricle, resulting in incomplete emptying. Left atrial volume and pressure increase, and the atrial chamber dilates. Increased resistance to blood flow causes pulmonary hypertension, rightventricular hypertrophy and, eventually , right-sided heart failure and phentermine (Fen-phen) diet-drug combination (Fen-phen was removed from the market in 1997.) ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Mild mitral stenosis Asymptomatic Moderate to severe mitral stenosis Gradual tolerance Dyspnea on exertion; of breathMITRAL STENOSIS 191 FOCUS IN UNDERSTANDING MITRAL STENOSIS Narrowing of the valve by valvular abnormalities, brosis, or calcication ob - structs blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Left atrial volume andpressure rise and the chamber dilates. Greater resistance to blood flow causespulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right-sided heart fail-ure. Inadequate lling of the left ventricle results in low cardiac output. Enlarged left atrium Stenosed distention or opening snap Diastolic (see Identifying the murmur of mitral steno- sis) Crackles over lung fields Right ventricular lift Resting tachycardia; irregularly irregular heart rhythm TEST RESULTS Chest X-rays show left atrial and ventricular enlargement (in severe mi-tral stenosis), straightening of the left border of the cardiac silhouette, en-larged pulmonary arteries, dilation of the upper valve discloses thickened atrialenlargement.192 DISORDERS IDENTIFYING THE MURMUR OF MITRAL STENOSIS A low, shows a diastolic pressure gradient across the valve, elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure (greater than 15 mmHg), and pulmonary artery pressure in the left atrium with severe pul-monary hypertension.

PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment need to plan for periodic rest in daily routine how to check the pulse dietary restrictions prescribed medications and potential adverse effects signs and symptoms to report importance of consistent follow-up care when to notify the physician use of prophylactic antibiotics for procedures. Mitral valve prolapse DESCRIPTION Prolapse of a portion of the mitral valve into the left atrium during ven-tricular contraction (systole) PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve leaflets with redundant tissueleads to prolapse of the mitral valve into the left atrium during systole. In some patients, this results in leakage of blood into the left atrium fromthe left ventricle. CAUSES Acquired heart disease, such as coronary artery disease and rheumaticheart disease Congenital heart disease Connective tissue disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus andMarfan syndrome ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Usually asymptomatic Possible pain, mitral insufficiency Electrocardiography may atrial or ven-tricular arrhythmia. Signal-averaged ECG may show ventricular and supraventricular arrhyth-mias. Holter monitor worn for 24 hours may show an arrhythmia.

Multiple sclerosis DESCRIPTION Progressive demyelination of white matter of brain and spinal cord Characterized by exacerbations and remissions Y ears of testing and observation possibly required for diagnosis Prognosis varied (70% of patients with multiple sclerosis lead active liveswith prolonged remissions), but may progress rapidly , causing death with-in months Also known as MS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Sporadic patches of demyelination occur in the central nervous system,resulting in widespread and varied neurologic dysfunction. (See Howmyelin breaks down .) CAUSES Exact cause unknown Allergic response Autoimmune response of the nervous system Events preceding onset:- Acute respiratory tract infections- Emotional stress- Fatigue- Overwork- Pregnancy factors possibly viral infection196 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 196ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Symptoms related to extent and site of myelin destruction, extent of re- myelination, and adequacy of subsequent restored synaptic transmission Symptoms possibly transient or last for hours or weeks Symptoms unpredictable and difficult to describe Visual problems and sensory impairment (the first signs) Blurred vision or diplopia Urinary problemsMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 197 FOCUS IN HOW MYELIN BREAKS DOWN Myelin speeds electrical impulses to the brain for interpretation. This lipoprotein complex (formed of glial cells or oligodendrocytes) protects the neuron's axonmuch like the insulation on an electrical wire. Its high electrical resistance andlow capacitance allow the myelin to conduct nerve impulses from one node ofRanvier to the next. Myelin is susceptible to injury (for example, by hypox-emia, toxic chemicals, vascularinsufciencies, or autoimmuneresponses). The sheathbecomes sheath can't conduct normally.The partial loss or dispersionof the potential Bowel disturbances (involuntary evacuation or constipation) Fatigue (typically the most disabling symptom) Poor articulation Muscle weakness of the involved area Spasticity; hyperreflexia Intention tremor Gait ataxia Paralysis, Nystagmus; scotoma mononuclear cell pleocytosis, an ele- vation in the level of total immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and presence of oligo-clonal Ig. Magnetic resonance imaging detects multiple sclerosis focal lesions. EEG abnormalities occur in one-third of patients with MS. Evoked potential studies show slowed conduction of nerve impulses. TREATMENT Symptomatic treatment for acute exacerbations and related signs andsymptoms High fluid and fiber intake in case of constipation Frequent rest periods I.V . steroids followed by oral steroids Immunosuppressants Antimetabolites Alkylating drugs Biological response modifiers COLLABORATION A physical therapy program that includes active resistive and stretching exercises helps maintain mus- cle tone and joint mobility, decrease spasticity, and improve coordi-nation.

Life-threatening disorder Myocardial infarction DESCRIPTION Reduced blood flow through one or more coronary arteries causing my-ocardial ischemia and necrosis MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION 199897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 199Infarction site dependent on the vessels involved Also called MI and heart attack PATHOPHYSIOLOGY One or more coronary arteries become occluded. If coronary occlusion causes ischemia lasting longer than 30 to 45 min- utes, irreversible myocardial cell damage and muscle death occur. Every MI has a central area of necrosis surrounded by an area of hypoxicinjury . This injured tissue is potentially viable and may be salvaged if cir-culation is restored, or it may progress to necrosis. CAUSES Atherosclerosis Coronary artery stenosis or spasm Platelet aggregation Thrombosis ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Possible disease with increasing anginal frequency , sever-ity , or duration Cardinal symptom of MI: persistent, crushing substernal pain or pressurepossibly radiating to the left arm, jaw , neck, and shoulder blades, and pos-sibly persisting for 12 or more hours In elderly patient or patient with diabetes, pain possibly absent; in others,pain possibly mild and confused with indigestion A feeling of impending doom Sudden death (may be the first and only indication of MI) Extreme anxiety and restlessness Dyspnea Diaphoresis Tachycardia Hypertension Bradycardia and hypotension, in inferior MI An S4, an S3, and paradoxical transmural MI or pericarditis Low-grade fever during the next few days Fatigue Shortness of breath Nausea and vomiting200 the CK-MB of CK, lactate dehydrogenase (LD) level is elevated; LD1isoenzyme (found in cardiac tissue) is higher than LD2isoenzyme (found in serum). White blood cell count is elevated usually starting on the second day andlasting 1 week. Myoglobin, the hemoprotein in cardiac and skeletal muscle that's re-leased with muscle damage, is detected as soon as 2 hours after MI. Troponin I, a structural protein found in cardiac muscle, is elevated withonly cardiac muscle damage; more specific than the CK-MB level. (Tro-ponin levels increase within 4 to 6 hours of myocardial injury and mayremain elevated for 5 to 11 days.) Nuclear medicine scans, using I.V . technetium 99m pertechnetate, identi-fy acutely damaged muscle by accumulations of radioactivenucleotide, which appear as a \"hot spot\" on the film. Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium 201 reveals a \"cold spot\" inmost patients during first few hours after a transmural MI. Echocardiography shows ventricular wall dyskinesia with a transmuralMI and helps to evaluate the ejection fraction. Serial 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) readings are normal or incon-clusive during the first few hours after an MI. Characteristic 12-lead ECG abnormalities include serial ST-segment de-pression in subendocardial MI and ST-segment elevation and Q waves,representing scarring and necrosis, in transmural MI. Pulmonary artery catheterization may be performed to detect left- orright-sided heart failure and to monitor response to treatment.

Pressure ulcers DESCRIPTION Localized areas of ischemic tissue caused by pressure, shearing, or fric-tion Most common over bony prominences, especially the sacrum, ischialtuberosities, greater trochanter, heels, malleoli, and elbows May be superficial, caused by localized skin irritation (with subsequentsurface maceration), or deep, arising in underlying tissue (Deep lesionsmay go undetected until they penetrate the skin.) Also called decubitus ulcers, pressure sores, or bedsores PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Impaired skin capillary pressure results in local tissue anoxia. Anoxia leads to edema and multiple capillary thromboses. An inflammatory reaction results in ulceration and necrosis of ischemiccells.218 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 218CAUSES Friction Local tissue compression Shearing force ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Shiny , erythematous superficial lesion (early) Small blisters or erosions with progression of superficial erythema Possible necrosis and ulceration with deeper erosions and ulcerations purulent discharge (suggesting secondary bacterial infec- tion) Black eschar around and over the lesion (see Four stages of pressure ulcers,page 220) TEST RESULTS Wound culture and sensitivity testing of exudate identifies infecting or-ganism.

PRESSURE ULCERS 219897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 219220 DISORDERS FOUR STAGES OF PRESSURE ULCERS The most widely used system for staging pressure ulcers is the classication system developed by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel. This stagingsystem reflects the depth and extent of tissue involvement. Stage I An area of skin that develops observ-able, pressure-related changes thatinclude persistent redness in patientswith light skin or persistent red, blue, orpurple in patients with darker skin.Other indicators include pain, itching,warmth, edema or hardness at the site. Stage II Supercial partial-thickness wound thatappears as an abrasion, blister, or shal-low crater involving the epidermis, der-mis, or both. Stage III Full-thickness wound with tissue dam-age or necrosis of subcutaneous tissuethat can extend down to, but notthrough, underlying fasciae. The woundappears as a deep crater that may ormay not undermine to neighboring tis-sue. Stage IV Full-thickness wound with extensivedamage, tissue necrosis, or damage tomuscle, bone, or structures, such asjoints and tendons. The wound mayundermine to neighboring tissues anddevelop sinus tracts. 897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 220KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: exhibit improved or healed lesions or wounds maintain adequate daily caloric intake maintain joint mobility and ROM avoid infection and other complications.

Typically , when a primary prostatic lesion spreads beyond the prostategland, it invades the prostatic capsule and spreads along ejaculatory ductsin the space between the seminal vesicles or perivesicular fascia. (SeeHow prostate cancer develops .) Endocrine factors may play a role, leading researchers to suspect that an-drogens speed tumor growth. Malignant prostatic tumors seldom result from the benign hyperplasticenlargement that commonly develops around the prostatic urethra in old-er men. CAUSES Unknown ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Urinary problems, such as difficulty initiating a urinary stream, drib-bling, painless hematuria, and urine retention Nonraised, firm, nodular mass with a sharp edge In advanced disease: edema of the scrotum or leg; a hard lump in theprostate region TEST RESULTS Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is elevated, indicating possiblecancer with or without metastases. Transrectal prostatic ultrasonography shows prostate size and presence ofabnormal growths. Bone scan and excretory urography determine the extent of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan define theextent of the tumor.222 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 222Standard screening tests to identify prostate cancer include digital rectal examination and PSA test (recommended yearly by the American CancerSociety for men older than age 40).

Psoriasis DESCRIPTION Hereditary chronic skin disease marked by epidermal proliferation Causes lesions of erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales that vary widely in severity and distribution Involves recurring remissions and exacerbations Exacerbations unpredictable, but usually controllable with therapy Affects about 2% of the U.S. population Two periods of onset: early (young adulthood) and late (middle adult-hood) PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Psoriatic skin cells have a shortened maturation time as they migratefrom the basal membrane to the surface or stratum corneum. As a result, the stratum corneum develops thick, scaly plaques (the cardi-nal streptococci infection Genetic predisposition Physical trauma Possible autoimmune process ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Family history of psoriasis Pruritus and burning Arthritic symptoms such as morning joint stiffness Remissions and exacerbations Erythematous, well-demarcated papules and plaques covered with silver scales, typically appearing on the scalp, chest, elbows, knees, back, andbuttocks In mild psoriasis: plaques scattered over a small skin area In moderate psoriasis: plaques more numerous and larger (up to severalcentimeters in diameter) In severe psoriasis: plaques covering at least half the body Friable or adherent scales Fine bleeding points or Auspitz sign after attempts to remove scales Thin, erythematous guttate lesions, alone or with plaques, and with fewscales (see Identifying types of psoriasis, page 226) Small indentations or pits, and yellow or brown discoloration of finger-nails or toenails ALERT In severe cases of psoriasis, the nail may separate from the nail bed. TEST RESULTS Serum uric acid level is Skin biopsy rules out other diseases. TREATMENT Depends on the psoriasis type, extent, and effect on the patient's qualityof life Lesion management Lukewarm baths Ultraviolet B light or natural sunlight Topical corticosteroid creams and Occlusive ointment bases Urea or salicylic acid preparations Coal tar preparations Vitamin D analogs Emollients Keratolytics Methotrexate for severe, unresponsive psoriasis Potent retinoic acid derivative for resistant psoriasis Cyclosporine for severe, widespread psoriasis 226 DISORDERS IDENTIFYING TYPES OF PSORIASIS Psoriasis occurs in various forms, ranging from one or two localized plaques that seldom require long-term medical attention to widespread lesions and cripplingarthritis. Erythrodermic psoriasis This type is marked by extensive flushing all over the body, which may result inscaling. The rash may develop rapidly, signaling new psoriasis or gradually inchronic psoriasis. Sometimes the rash occurs as an adverse drug reaction. Guttate psoriasis This type typically affects children and young adults. Erupting in drop-sizedplaques over the trunk, arms, legs and, sometimes, the scalp, this rash general-izes in several days. It's commonly associated with upper respiratory streptococ-cal infections. Inverse psoriasis Smooth, dry, bright red plaques characterize inverse psoriasis. Located in skinfolds (armpits and groin, for example), the plaques ssure easily. Psoriasis vulgaris This psoriasis type is the most common. It begins with red, dotlike lesions thatgradually enlarge and produce dry, silvery scales. The plaques usually appearsymmetrically on the knees, elbows, extremities, genitalia, scalp, and nails. Pustular psoriasis This type features an eruption of local or extensive small, raised, pus-lledplaques. Possible triggers include emotional stress, sweating, infections, andadverse drug reactions.897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 226Surgical nail removal to treat severely disfigured or damaged nails caused by psoriasis KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: exhibit improved or healed lesions report feelings of increased comfort verbalize feelings about changed body image demonstrate understanding of proper skin care express an understanding of the condition and its treatment.

Electrons are removed from atoms. Charged atoms or ions form and reactwith other atoms to cause cell damage. Rapidly dividing cells are the most susceptible to radiation damage. High-ly differentiated cells are more resistant to radiation. CAUSES Exposure to radiation through inhalation, ingestion, or direct contact ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Acute hematopoietic radiation toxicity Petechiae Pallor W eakness Oropharyngeal abscesses Bleeding from the skin, genitourinary tract, and GI tract Nosebleeds Hemorrhage Increased susceptibility to infection GI radiation toxicity Mouth and throat ulcers and infection Intractable nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Circulatory collapse and death Cardiovascular radiation toxicity Hypotension, shock, and cardiac arrhythmias228 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 228Cerebral radiation toxicity Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Lethargy Tremors Seizures Confusion Coma and death Generalized radiation exposure Signs of hypothyroidism Cataracts Skin dryness, erythema, pruritus, atrophy , and malignant lesions Alopecia Brittle nails TEST RESULTS White blood cell, platelet, and lymphocyte counts are decreased. Serum potassium and chloride levels are decreased. X-rays may show bone necrosis. Bone marrow studies may reveal blood dyscrasia. Geiger counter determines if radioactive material was ingested or inhaled and evaluates the amount of radiation in open wounds. TREATMENT Based on the type and extent of radiation injury Management of life-threatening injuries ALERT Hematologic, dig estive, nervous, and inte gu mentary systems are most affected after radiation exposure. W atch for signs of shock, infection, and respiratory difficulties.

Renal failure, acute DESCRIPTION Results from sudden interruption of renal function resulting from ob-struction, reduced circulation, or renal pa renchymal disease Classified as prerenal failure, intrarenal failure (also called intrinsic or parenchymal failure), or postrenal failure Usually reversible with medical treatment If not treated, may progress to end-stage renal disease, uremia, and death Seen in 5% of hospitalized patients Normally occurs in three distinct phases: diuretic, and recovery230 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 230Oliguric phase This phase may last a few days or several weeks. A patient's urine output may drop below 400 ml/day . Fluid volume excess, azotemia, and electrolyte imbalance mediators are released, causing intrarenal vasoconstriction. Medullary hypoxia causes cellular swelling and adherence of neutrophils to capillaries and venules. Hypoperfusion occurs in this phase. Cellular injury and necrosis occur. Reperfusion causes reactive oxygen species to form, leading to furthercellular injury . Diuretic phase Renal function is recovered. Urine output gradually increases. Glomerular filtration rate improves, although tubular transport systemsremain abnormal. Recovery phase This phase may last 3 to 12 months, or longer. The patient gradually returns to normal or near-normal renal function. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Prerenal failure Prerenal failure is caused by impaired blood flow . Decrease in filtration pressure causes decline in glomerular filtration rate. Failure to restore blood volume or blood pressure may cause acute tubu-lar necrosis (ATN) or acute cortical necrosis. Intrarenal failure A severe episode of hypotension, commonly associated with hypov-olemia, is often a significant contributing event. Cell swelling, injury , and necrosis \u2014 a form of reperfusion injury thatmay also be caused by nephrotoxins \u2014 results ischemia-generatedtoxic oxygen-free radicals and anti-inflammatory mediators. Postrenal failure Postrenal failure usually occurs with urinary tract obstruction that affectsthe kidneys bilaterally such as prostatic FAILURE, Hypotension or hypoperfusion Hypovolemia Loss of plasma volume Water and electrolyte losses Intrarenal failure ATN Coagulation defects Glomerulopathies Malignant hypertension Postrenal failure Bladder neck obstruction Obstructive uropathies, usually bilateral Ureteral destruction ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Oliguria or anuria, depending on renal failure phase Tachycardia Bibasilar crackles Irritability , drowsiness, or confusion Altered level of abnormalities Dry , pruritic skin Dry mucous membranes Uremic breath odor TEST RESULTS Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and potassium levels are elevated. Hematocrit and blood pH, bicarbonate, and hemoglobin levels are de- creased. Urine casts and cellular debris are present, and specific gravity is de-creased. In glomerular disease, proteinuria and urine osmolality are close toserum osmolality level. Urine sodium level is normal, decreased (below 20 mEq/L, caused by de-creased perfusion in oliguria), or increased (above 40 mEq/L, problem 232Urine creatinine measures glomerular filtration rate and esti- mates reveal tall, peaked T waves; a widening QRS com-plex; and disappearing P waves if hyperkalemia is present. TREATMENT Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (if appropriate) High-calorie, low-protein, low-sodium, and low-potassium diet Fluid restriction Rest periods fatigued Supplemental vitamins Diuretics In hyperkalemia, hypertonic glucose-and-insulin infusions, sodium Creation of vascular access for hemodialysis KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: avoid complications maintain fluid balance maintain hemodynamic stability verbalize risk factors for decreased tissue perfusion and modify lifestyleappropriately demonstrate the ability to manage urinary elimination problems verbalize diet and medication rationales and regimen.

Rhabdomyolysis DESCRIPTION Breakdown of muscle tissue, causing myoglobinuria Usually follows major muscle trauma, especially a muscle crush injury Good prognosis if contributing causes are stopped or disease is checkedbefore damage is irreversible PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Muscle trauma that compresses tissue causes ischemia and necrosis. The ensuing local edema further increases compartment pressure andtamponade; pressure from severe swelling causes blood vessels to col-lapse, leading to tissue hypoxia, muscle infarction, neural damage in thearea, and release of necrotic muscle fibers into thecirculation.236 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Anesthetics that cause intraoperative rigidity Cardiac arrhythmias Electrolyte disturbances Excessive muscular activity associated with status epilepticus, electro- convulsive therapy , or high-voltage electrical shock Familial tendency Heat stroke Infection, especially severe infection Prescription and nonprescription drugs Strenuous exertion such as long-distance running Traumatic injury ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Muscle trauma or breakdown Muscle pain Presence of any risk factors Dark, reddish-brown urine Tense, tender muscle compartment (compartment syndrome) TEST RESULTS Urine myoglobin level exceeds 0.5 mg/dl (evident with only 200 g ofmuscle damage). Creatine kinase level is elevated (0.5 to 0.95 from muscle dam-age. Serum potassium, phosphate, creatinine, levels elevated. Hypocalcemia in early stages; hypercalcemia, in later stages. Intracompartmental venous pressure measurements (using a wickcatheter, needle, or slit catheter inserted into the muscle) are elevated.

Rheumatoid arthritis DESCRIPTION Chronic, systemic, symmetrical inflammatory disease Primarily attacks peripheral joints and surrounding muscles, tendons,ligaments, and blood vessels Marked by spontaneous remissions and unpredictable exacerbations Potentially crippling Strikes three times as many women as men Can occur at any age; peak onset between ages 35 and 50 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Cartilage damage resulting from inflammation triggers further immuneresponses, including complement activation. Complement, in turn, attracts polymorphonuclear leukocytes and stimu-lates release of inflammatory mediators, which exacerbates destruc-tion. (See Understanding rheumatoid arthritis .)238 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 238RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS 239 FOCUS IN UNDERSTANDING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS A potentially crippling disease, rheumatoid arthritis primarily attacks peripheral joints and surrounding tissues through chronic inflammation. If not arrested, theinflammatory process occurs in four stages: /H18546Synovitis develops from congestion and edema of the synovial membrane and joint ca psule. Inltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils continues the local inflammatory response. These cells, as well as broblast-like synovial cells, produce enzymes that help degrade bone and cartilage. /H18546Pannus (thickened layers of granulation tissue) covers and invades cartilage,eventually destro ying the joint capsule and bone. /H18546Fibrous ankylosis (brous invasion of the pannus and scar formation)occ ludes the joint space. Bone atrophy and misalignment cause visible defor- mities and disrupt the articulation of opposing bones, resulting in muscleatrophy and imbalance and, possibly, partial dislocations (subluxations). /H18546Fibrous tissue calcies, resulting in bony ankylosis and total immobility. Joint capsule Pannus SwellingJoint space narrowing Erosion of bone Erosion of bone897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 239CAUSES Unknown Possible influence of infection (viral or bacterial), hormonal factors, and lifestyle ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Insidious onset of nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue, malaise,anorexia, persistent low-grade fever, weight loss, and vague articularsymptoms Later, more specific localized articular symptoms, commonly in the fin-gers Bilateral and symmetrical symptoms, which may extend to the wrists, el-bows, knees, and ankles Stiff joints Numbness or tingling in the feet or weakness or loss of sensation in thefingers Pain on inspiration Shortness of breath Joint deformities and contractures Painful, red, swollen arms Foreshortened hands Boggy wrists Rheumatoid nodules Leg ulcers Eye redness Joints that are warm to the touch Pericardial friction rub Positive Babinski's sign Stiff, weak, or painful muscles TEST RESULTS Rheumatoid factor test is positive in 75% to 80% of patients, as indicatedby a titer of 1:160 or higher. Synovial fluid analysis shows increased volume and turbidity but de-creased viscosity and complement (C3 and C4) levels, with white bloodcell count possibly exceeding 10,000/\u00b5l. Serum globulin levels are elevated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated. Complete blood count shows moderate anemia and slight leukocytosis.(See Classifying rheumatoid arthritis .)240 DISORDERS897302.qxd:9781582558974_02 7/12/13 1:48 PM Page 240In early stages, X-rays show bone demineralization and soft-tissue swelling. Later, they help determine the extent of cartilage and bone de-struction, erosion, subluxations, and deformities and show the character-istic pattern of these abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan may pro-vide information about the extent of damage. Synovial tissue biopsy shows inflammation.

Life-threatening disorder Shock, cardiogenic DESCRIPTION A condition of diminished cardiac output that severely impairs tissue per-fusion (myocardial damage of more than 40% of the left ventricle mostcommon) Failure of the heart to pump blood adequately to meet oxygenation needsof the body Most lethal form of shock PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Left ventricular dysfunction initiates a series of compensatory mecha-nisms that attempt to increase cardiac output. (See What happens in car- diogenic shock.) As cardiac output decreases, aortic and carotid baroreceptors activatesympathetic nervous responses. Responses increase heart rate, left ventricular filling pressure, and periph-eral resistance to flow to enhance venous return to the heart. This action initially stabilizes the patient but later causes deteriorationwith increasing oxygen demands on the already-compromised myo -cardium. These events consist of a cycle of low cardiac output, sympathetic com-pensation, myocardial ischemia, and even PM Page 246SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC 247 FOCUS WHAT HAPPENS IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK When the myocardium can't contract sufciently to maintain adequate cardiac output, stroke volume decreases and the heart can't eject an adequate volumeof blood with each contraction. The blood backs up behind the weakened leftventricle, increasing preload and causing pulmonary congestion. In addition, tocompensate for the drop in stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintaincardiac output. As a result of the diminished stroke volume, coronary artery per-fusion and collateral blood flow decrease. All of these mechanisms increase theheart's workload and enhance left-sided heart failure. The result is myocardialhypoxia, further decreased cardiac output, and a triggering of compensatorymechanisms to prevent decompensation and death. Initial insult Decreased left ventricular emptying Increased heart rateDecreased myocardial contractility Left ventricular dilation and backup of bloodDecreased perfusion and collateral blood flow Increased preload Myocardial hypoxia Pulmonary congestion Decreased cardiac output Compensation stroke volume897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 Ventricular septal defect ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Determination of existing disorder, such as MI or cardiomyopathy thatseverely decreases left ventricular function Anginal pain Urine output less than 20 ml/hour Pale, cold, clammy skin Decreased sensorium Rapid, shallow respirations Rapid, thready pulse Mean arterial pressure of less than 60 mm Hg in adults Gallop rhythm, faint heart sounds, and, possibly , a holosystolic murmur Jugular vein distention Severe anxiety Decreased level of consciousness (LOC) Pulmonary crackles TEST RESULTS Serum enzyme measurements show and Cardiac catheterization and echocardiography may reveal other condi-tions that can lead to pump dysfunction and failure, such as cardiac tam-ponade, papillary muscle infarct and hypovolemia. Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring reveals increased pulmonaryartery pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, reflecting an in-crease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload) and heightenedresistance to left ventricular emptying (afterload) caused by and increased peripheral 248 DISORDERS897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 Page 248Invasive arterial pressure monitoring shows systolic arterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg, caused by impaired ventricular ejection.

Plan your care to allow frequent rest periods, and provide as much priva-cy as possible. Allow the patient's family to visit and comfort him asmuch as possible. Provide explanations and reassurance for the patient and his family as ap-propriate. Prepare the patient and his family for a possibly fatal outcome, and helpthem find effective coping strategies. Monitor the patient for possible multiple organ dysfunction. PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: disorder, diagnosis, and treatment explanations and reassurance for patient and his family possible fatal outcome. Life-threatening disorder Shock, hypovolemic DESCRIPTION Reduced intravascular blood volume causing circulatory dysfunction andinadequate tissue perfusion resulting from loss of blood, plasma, or fluids Potentially life-threatening PATHOPHYSIOLOGY When fluid is lost from the intravascular space, venous return to theheart is reduced. This decreases ventricular filling, which leads to a drop in stroke volume. Cardiac output falls, causing reduced perfusion to tissues and organs. Tissue anoxia prompts a shift in cellular metabolism from aerobic toanaerobic pathways. 250 DISORDERS897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page 250This of lactic acid, resulting in metabolic aci- dosis.

Serum potassium, sodium, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, and bloodurea nitrogen levels are elevated. Urine specific gravity (greater than 1.020) and urine osmolality are in-creased.SHOCK, HYPOVOLEMIC 251897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 Page 251pH and partial pressure of arterial oxygen are decreased, and partial pres- sure of arterial carbon dioxide is increased. Aspiration of gastric contents through a nasogastric tube shows internalbleeding. Occult blood tests are positive. Coagulation studies show coagulopathy from disseminated intravascularcoagulation. Chest or abdominal X-rays help to identify internal bleeding sites. Gastroscopy helps to identify internal bleeding sites. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring shows reduced central venous pres-sure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary arterywedge pressure, and cardiac output. TREATMENT In severe cases, an intra-aortic balloon pump, ventricular assist device, orpneumatic antishock garment (rare, only when unstable fractures in-volved) Oxygen administration Bleeding control by direct application of pressure and related measures Possible parenteral nutrition or tube feedings Bed rest Prompt and vigorous blood and fluid replacement Positive inotropes Possibly diuretics Possible surgery to correct underlying problem 252 DISORDERS CHECKING FOR EARLY HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK Orthostatic vital signs and tilt test results can help in assessing for the possibility of impending hypovolemic shock. Orthostatic vital signs Measure the patient's blood pressure and pulse rate while he's lying in a supineposition, sitting, and standing. Wait at least 1 minute between each positionchange. A systolic blood pressure decrease of 10 mm Hg or more between posi-tions or a pulse rate increase of 10 beats/minute or more is a sign of volumedepletion and impending hypovolemic shock. Tilt test With the patient in a supine position, raise his legs above heart level. If his bloodpressure increases signicantly, the test result is positive, indicating volumedepletion and impending hypovolemic shock.897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page 252KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain adequate cardiac output maintain hemodynamic stability maintain adequate ventilation express feelings and develop adequate coping mechanisms regain adequate fluid volume.

It most commonly occurs at valve sites. Abdominal vena cava valve cusps because venous stasis encourages ac- cumulation and adherence of platelet and fibrin PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Changes in epithelial lining cause platelet aggregation and fibrin entrap-ment of red blood cells, white blood cells, and additional platelets. The thrombus starts a chemical inflammatory process in the vessel ep-ithelium, leading to fibrosis, which may occlude the vessel lumen or em-bolize. CAUSES Fracture of the spine, pelvis, femur, or tibia Hormonal contraceptives such as estrogens May be idiopathic Neoplasms Pregnancy and childbirth Prolonged bed rest Surgery Trauma Use of subclavian vein catheters Venous stasis Venulitis ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Up to 50% of patients with deep vein thrombophlebitis may be asympto-matic Possible tenderness, aching, or severe pain in the affected leg or arm;fever, chills, and malaise Redness, swelling, and tenderness of the affected leg or arm Possible positive Homans' sign Positive cuff sign Possible warm feeling in affected leg or arm Lymphadenitis in case of extensive vein involvement TEST RESULTS Doppler ultrasonography shows reduced blood flow to specific areas andany obstruction to venous flow , particularly in iliofemoral deep veinthrombophlebitis. Plethysmography shows decreased circulation distal to the affected areaand is more sensitive than ultrasonography in detecting deep vein throm-bo phlebitis.270 DISORDERS897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page 270Phlebography confirms the diagnosis and shows filling defects and divert- ed blood flow. TREATMENT Application of warm, moist compresses to the affected area Antiembolism stockings Bed rest, with elevation of the affected extremity Anticoagulants Thrombolytics Analgesics Surgery , interruption with transvenous placement of a vena cava filter KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain collateral circulation express feelings of increased comfort and decreased pain maintain tissue perfusion and cellular oxygenation develop no signs or symptoms of infection. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Enforce bed rest and elevate the patient's affected arm or leg, but avoidcompressing the popliteal space. Apply warm compresses or a covered aquathermia pad. Administer prescribed analgesics. Mark, measure, and record the circumference of the affected arm or legdaily , and compare this measurement with that of the other arm or leg. Administer prescribed anticoagulants. Perform or encourage range-of-motion exercises. Use pneumatic compression devices. Apply antiembolism stockings. Encourage early ambulation. Monitor: - response to treatment- vital signs- partial thromboplastin time for patient receiving heparin (Calciparin)- prothrombin time for patient receiving warfarin (Coumadin)- for signs and symptoms of bleeding- for signs and symptoms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia- for signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism.THROMBOPHLEBITIS 271897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page 271PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment importance of follow-up blood studies to monitor anticoagulant therapy how to give injections (if the patient is being discharged on subcutaneous anticoagulation therapy) need to avoid prolonged sitting or standing to help prevent a recurrence proper application and use of antiembolism stockings importance of adequate hydration use of an electric razor avoidance of aspirin-containing products. Thyroid cancer DESCRIPTION Proliferation of cancer cells in the thyroid gland Most common endocrine malignancy Papillary cancer: 50% of all Medullary cancer: may be linked to pheochromocytoma; curable whendetected before it causes symptoms PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Papillary cancer is usually multifocal and bilateral. It metastasizes slowlyinto regional nodes of the neck, mediastinum, lungs, and other distant or-gans. It's the least virulent form of thyroid cancer. Follicular cancer is less common but is more likely to recur and metasta-size to the regional lymph nodes and spread through blood vessels intothe bones, liver, and lungs. Medullary , or solid, cancer originates in the parafollicular cells derivedfrom the last branchial pouch and contains amyloid corticotropin, commonly metas- tasizing to bones, liver, and kidneys. Anaplastic cancer, or giant and spindly cell cancer, resists radiation and isalmost never curable by resection. This cancer metastasizes rapidly , caus-ing death by invading the trachea and compressing adjacent structures. CAUSES Chronic goiter Familial inherited 1:51 PM Page 272Previous exposure to radiation treatment in the neck area Prolonged secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Possible history of: - Sensitivity to cold and mental apathy (hypothyroidism)- Sensitivity heat, restlessness, and overactivity Irritability- in an enlarged thyroid gland or palpable lymphnodes with thyroid enlargement Hoarseness and vocal stridor Disfiguring thyroid mass Bruits TEST RESULTS Elevated fasting calcitonin level and an abnormal response to calciumstimulation identify \"silent\" medullary carcinoma. Thyroid scan differentiates functional nodes, which are rarely malignant, from hypofunctional nodes, which are usually malignant. Ultrasonography shows changes in the size of thyroid nodules after thy-roxine suppression therapy and detects recurrent disease. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans show theextent of disease in the thyroid and surrounding structures. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy differentiates benign from malignant thy-roid nodules. Histologic analysis stages the disease and thereby guides treatment plans. TREATMENT Radioisotope, or 131I, therapy with external radiation or alone Soft diet with small, frequent meals if dysphagia occurs Suppressive thyroid hormone therapy Chemotherapy Total or subtotal thyroidectomy with modified node dissection, either bi-lateral or unilateral, on the side of the primary cancer in the case of papil-lary or follicular cancer Total thyroidectomy and radical neck excision in the case of medullary oranaplastic cancerTHYROID CANCER 273897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 OUTCOMES The patient will: not aspirate maintain current weight without further loss express positive feelings about self express feelings of increased comfort and decreased pain. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Encourage verbalization and provide support. Before surgery: - Prepare the patient for scheduled surgery .- Establish a way to communicate postoperatively . After surgery:- Keep the patient in semi-Fowler's position, with adequate neck sup- port. - Keep a tracheotomy set and oxygen equipment nearby in case of respi- ratory obstruction. - Monitor the patient's vital signs, wound site, pain control, serum calci- um levels, hydration and nutritional status and for complications Refer the patient to available resource and support services, including theAmerican Cancer Society . PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment before surgery , the operation and postoperative procedures and position-ing treatments and home care medication administration, dosage, and possible adverse effects. Toxoplasmosis DESCRIPTION One of the most common parasitic infectious diseases Usually causes localized infection May produce significant generalized infection, especially in an immuno -deficient patient Once infected, organism carried for life and acute infection can reactivate Congenital type characterized by lesions in the central nervous system(CNS); may result in stillbirth or serious birth defects274 DISORDERS897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page 274PATHOPHYSIOLOGY After ingestion, parasites are released from latent cysts by the digestive process; they then invade the GI tract and multiply . Parasites disseminate to various organs, especially lymphatic tissue,skeletal retina, The infects host cells, replicates, and then invades adjoining cells,resulting in cell death and focal necrosis surrounded by an acute inflam-matory response. CAUSES Congenital toxoplasmosis from transplacental transmission The protozoan T oxoplasma gondii ,which exists in trophozoite forms in the acute stages of infection and in cystic forms in latent stages Transmitted by ingestion of tissue cysts in raw or undercooked meat orby fecal-oral contamination from infected cats ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Predisposing factors, such as immunocompromised state, exposure to catfeces, and ingestion of poorly cooked meat Assess patient for history of symptoms, such as headache, fatigue,malaise, myalgia, sore throat, and vomiting Fever (if generalized, [41.5\u00b0 rash (except scalp) TOXOPLASMOSIS 275 OCULAR TOXOPLASMOSIS focal necrotizing retinitis. It accounts for about 25% of all cases of granulomatous uveitis.Although usually the result of a congenital infection, it may not appear until ado-lescence or young adulthood, when infection is reactivated. Symptoms include blurred vision, scotoma, pain, photophobia, and impair- ment or loss of central vision. Vision improves as inflammation subsides, butusually without recovery of lost visual acuity. as bronchoalveolar lavage material from immunocom-promised patients or lymph node biopsy , contain parasites. Intraperitoneal inoculation with blood or other body fluids into mice ortissue cultures show isolation of parasites. Polymerase chain reaction detects parasite's genetic material. TREATMENT No treatment in otherwise healthy patient who isn't pregnant Rest periods when fatigued Seizure precautions Pyrimethamine (Daraprim) plus sulfadiazine with leucovorin (W ellco -vorin) COLLABORATION A neurologist or infectious disease special- ist may be consulted. KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: have normal vital signs have an adequate fluid volume report an increased energy level develop no complications maintain respiratory rate within 5 breaths/minute of baseline. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Administer tepid sponge baths to decrease fever. Administer drug therapy . Provide chest physiotherapy and administer oxygen, as needed. Assistventilations if needed. Institute seizure precautions. ALERT Don't palpate the patient's abdomen vigorously; this could lead to a ruptured spleen.

Monitor the patient's neurologic status and response to treatment. Monitor the patient for potential complications, including seizure disor- der, vision loss, mental retardation, deafness, generalized infection, still-birth, and congenital toxoplasmosis. PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment necessary drugs, including the need for frequent blood tests importance of regularly scheduled follow-up care ways to prevent the spread of toxoplasmosis, including washing hands af-ter working with soil, cooking meat thoroughly and freezing promptly ,covering children's sandboxes, and keeping flies away from food need for pregnant women to avoid cleaning and handling cat litter boxes,or to wear gloves when doing so. Tuberculosis DESCRIPTION Acute or chronic lung infection characterized by pulmonary infiltratesand the formation of granulomas with caseation, fibrosis, and cavitation Can occur in other organs, bone, or lymph nodes Prognosis excellent with proper treatment and compliance except in cas-es of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Also known as TB PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Multiplication of the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes an in- flammatory process where deposited. A cell-mediated immune response follows, usually containing the infec-tion within 4 to 6 weeks. The T-cell response causes granulomas to form around the bacilli, makingthem go dormant. This confers immunity to subsequent infection. Bacilli within granulomas may remain viable for many years, causing apositive result for the purified protein derivative or other skin test for TB. Active disease develops in 5% to 15% of those infected. Transmission occurs when an infected person coughs, sneezes, shouts, orsings.TUBERCULOSIS 277897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page 277CAUSES Exposure to M. tuberculosis Exposure to other strains of mycobacteria (sometimes) ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Patients at high risk: - Those having close contact with newly diagnosed TB patient- Those with a history of TB exposure- Those with multiple sexual partners- Recent immigrants from Africa, Asia, Mexico, or South America- Those who have had a gastrectomy - Those with a history of silicosis, diabetes, malnutrition, cancer, Hodgkin's disease, or leukemia - Those with drug or alcohol abuse problems- Residents in nursing home, mental health facility , or prison- Immunosuppressed patients and those who use corticosteroids- Homeless patients- Those in crowded, poorly ven tilated, unsanitary living conditions - Health care workers Signs and symptoms of primary infection:- May be asymptomatic after a 4- to 8-week sweats Signs and symptoms of reactivated infection:- Chest pain- Productive cough for blood, or mucopurulent or blood-tinged sputum- Low-grade fever Other possible signs area- Crepitant Wheezes- Whispered pectoriloquy Tuberculin skin test result is positive for induration in both active and in-active tuberculosis. Stains and cultures of sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, lesions, patchy infiltrates, cavity formation, scar tissue, and calcium deposits. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging shows presenceand extent of lung damage. Bronchoscopy specimens show heat-sensitive, nonmotile, aerobic, acid-fast bacilli in specimens. TREATMENT W ell-balanced, high-calorie diet Rest, initially; then, activity as tolerated Antitubercular therapy for at least 6 months, with a prescribed scheduleof oral doses of four of these drugs initially:- ethambutol (EMB), until drug sensitivity tests show no drug resistance (about 2 weeks) for certain complications KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: express an understanding of the illness maintain adequate ventilation use support systems to assist with coping identify measures to prevent or reduce fatigue comply with treatment regimen resume normal activities after 2- to 4-week infectious period, while con-tinuing to take medication.

Before discharge, tell him that he must take precautions to preventspreading the disease, such as wearing a mask around others, until his physi-cian tells him he's no longer contagious. He should tell all health care providershe sees, including his dentist and optometrist, that he has TB so that they caninstitute infection-control precautions. Teach the patient other specic precautions to avoid spreading the infection. Tell him to cough and sneeze into tissues and to dispose of the tissues properly.Stress the importance of washing his hands thoroughly in hot, soapy water afterhandling his own secretions. Also instruct him to utensils water.897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page NILE ENCEPHALITIS 281 PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment medication and potential adverse effects where to obtain free medication locally when to notify the physician need for isolation postural drainage and chest percussion coughing and deep-breathing exercises regular follow-up examinations signs and symptoms of recurring TB possible decreased hormonal contraceptive effectiveness during rifampin therapy need for a high-calorie, high-protein, balanced diet. West Nile encephalitis DESCRIPTION An infectious disease, part of a family of vector-borne diseases that alsoincludes malaria, yellow fever, and Lyme disease Mortality from 3% to 15%; higher in elderly patients Ticks infected with the virus found in Africa and Asia only; role of ticks intransmission and maintenance of the virus uncertain Also called W est Nile virus PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The incubation period is 5 to 15 days after exposure. Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on birds contaminated with thevirus. (See T ransmission routes of W est Nile encephalitis, page 282.) The virus is transmitted to a human by the bite of an infected mosquito(mostly the Culex species). Disease primarily causes encephalitis. CAUSES A flavivirus commonly found in humans, birds, and other vertebrates inAfrica, W est Asia, and the Middle East Greatest risk in those older than age 50 and those with compromised im-mune systems 897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page 281ASSESSMENT FINDINGS History of recent exposure to bodies of water, dead birds, or mosquitoes Symptoms: - Headache- Myalgia- Neck stiffness- Decreased appetite- Nausea and vomiting- Diarrhea Signs:-F e v e r- Rash- Swollen lymph glands282 DISORDERS TRANSMISSION ROUTES OF WEST NILE ENCEPHALITIS Birds harbor the virus that causes West Nile encephalitis, but they can't spread it. Mosquitoes serve as the vectors, spreading it from bird to bird and from birdto human. Humans are thought to be \"dead-end hosts\" because the virus canlive and cause illness in humans, but a feeding mosquito can't acquire the virusfrom an infected person. Mosquitoes (vector) Human (dead-end host) VirusBrain897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 PM Page 282- Stupor and disorientation - Decreased neck motion- Change in mental status TEST RESULTS White blood cell (WBC) count is normal or increased. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicates a recent infec-tion, thus allowing for a rapid and definitive diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis is possible only when serum or cerebrospinal fluidspecimens are obtained while the patient is hospitalized with acute ill-ness and they show elevated WBC count and protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging may show inflammation. TREATMENT No specific treatment Respiratory support Increased fluid intake Rest periods when fatigued Antipyretics COLLABORATION Appropriate medical treatment may be guided by an infectious disease specialist. KEY PATIENT OUTCOMES The patient will: maintain collateral circulation maintain hemodynamic stability have adequate cardiac output remain afebrile have an adequate fluid volume. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Maintain adequate hydration with I.V . fluids. Administer prescribed medications. Provide respiratory support measures when needed. Follow standard precautions when handling blood or other body fluids. Report any suspected cases of W est Nile encephalitis to the state depart-ment of health. Monitor:- 283PATIENT TEACHING Be sure to cover: the disorder, diagnosis, and treatment proper use of insect repellants, which can irritate the eyes and mouth, and to avoid applying repellant to the hands of children (shouldn't be applied to children younger than age 3) (see Preventing W est Nile en-cephalitis) expected course and outcomes of the illness need to drink fluids to avoid dehydration how to stop mosquitoes from breeding by:- cleaning out birdbaths and wading pools at least once per week- cleaning roof gutters and downspout screens - eliminating any standing water- not allowing water to collect in trash cans- turning over or removing containers in yards where rainwater collects, such as toys and old tires.284 DISORDERS PREVENTING WEST NILE ENCEPHALITIS To reduce the risk of infection with West Nile encephalitis, advise patients to do the following: /H18546Stay indoors at dawn and dusk and in early evening when mosquitoes are biting. /H18546Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. /H18546Apply insect repellent sparingly to exposed skin. Effective repellents contain20% 30% N,N-diethyltoluamide (deet). In concentrations greater than 30%, deet can cause adverse effects, particularly in children, and should beavoided; adults should apply repellent with no more than 10% deet on chil-dren. /H18546Avoid applying repellent under clothing. /H18546Avoid applying repellent over cuts, wounds, sunburn, or irritated skin. /H18546Wash repellent off daily and reapply as needed.897303.qxd:9781582558974_03 7/12/13 1:51 Page 284Pa 1:53 PM Page 285Adrenalectomy DESCRIPTION Surgical resection or removal of one or both of the adrenal glands PURPOSE To resolve adrenal hyperfunction or hyperaldosteronism To remove a benign or malignant adrenal tumor Secondary treatment of neoplasms Secondary treatment of corticotropin oversecretion PATIENT PREPARATION Explain the treatment and preparation to the patient and his family .

Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- signs and symptoms of infection- signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction- complications- when to ostomy DESCRIPTION Excision of diseased bowel and creation of a stoma on the outer abdomi- nal wall to allow feces elimination Laparoscopic approach possible for both standard colostomy and end-ileostomy PURPOSE To treat inflammatory bowel disease To treat familial adenomatous polyposis To treat diverticulitis To treat advanced colorectal cancer PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Provide total parenteral nutrition as ordered. Administer antibiotics and other medications as ordered. Monitor the patient's vital signs, nutritional status, fluid and electrolytestatus, intake and output, and daily weight. PROCEDURE After the patient receives a general anesthetic, the surgeon makes an inci-sion in the abdominal wall near the bowel area to be resected. The diseased bowel segment is resected, possibly along with several moreinches of bowel. The surgeon creates a stoma. Abdominoperineal resection A low abdominal incision is made, and the sigmoid colon is divided. The proximal end of the colon is brought out through another, smaller ab-dominal incision to create an end stoma. A wide perineal incision is made, and the anus, rectum, and distal portionof the sigmoid colon are resected. The abdominal wound is closed, and abdominal drains are placed. The perineal wound may be left open, packed with gauze, or closed; sev-eral Penrose drains are placed. Ileostomy The surgeon resects all or part of the colon and rectum.BOWEL RESECTION OSTOMY 291897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 291A permanent ileostomy is created by bringing the end of the ileum out through a small abdominal incision in the right lower quadrant. Ileoanal reservoir A colectomy is made, and a loop or an end stoma is created for a tempo-rary ileostomy . The rectal mucosa is stripped, and an internal pouch is made with a por-tion of the ileum. A pouch-anal anastomosis is performed. A temporary ileostomy is made; usually , it's closed after 3 or 4 months. Kock ileostomy The surgeon removes the colon, rectum, and anus and closes the anus. A reservoir is constructed from a loop of the terminal ileum. A portion of the ileum is intussuscepted to form a nipple valve. The upper part of the sutured and cut ileum is pulled down and suturedto form a pouch. The nipple valve is used to create a stoma by pulling it through the ab-dominal wall and suturing it flush with the skin. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Provide meticulous wound care. Administer analgesics as ordered. After an abdominoperineal resection, irrigate the perineal area as ordered. If the patient has a Kock pouch with a catheter inserted in the stoma:- Connect the catheter to low intermittent suction or to straight drainage as ordered. - Check catheter patency regularly , and irrigate with 20 to 30 ml of nor- mal saline solution as ordered. - Assess pouch drainage, and advance the patient's diet as ordered.- Clamp and unclamp the pouch catheter to increase its capacity as or- dered.

Administer analgesics as ordered. Implement noninvasive pain-relief techniques. Explain palliative treatments if indicated.294 TREATMENTS IMMUNOTHERAPIES Immunotherapies offer promise in treating cancer. Specic immunotherapies that have proved useful are discussed below. /H18546Nonspecic immunostimulation uses biological agents, such as bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine and Corynebacterium parvum, to stimulate the reticuloendothelial system. This therapy augments the patient's immune sys- tem and combats the immunosuppressive effects of cancer and its treat-ment. /H18546 Intralesional stimulation involves injecting a biological agent directly into the tumor.

Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Withhold oral intake as ordered. Administer preoperative medications as ordered. PROCEDURE Patients having either the open abdominal or the laparoscopic approachundergo general anesthesia. Abdominal cholecystectomy A right subcostal or paramedial incision is made. The surgeon surveys the abdomen. Laparotomy packs are used to isolate the gallbladder from the surround-ing organs. After biliary tract structures are identified, cholangiography or ultra-sonography may be used to identify gallstones. The bile ducts are visualized using a choledoscope. The ducts are cleared of stones after insertion of a Fogarty balloon-tipcatheter. The surgeon ligates and divides the cystic duct and artery and removesthe entire gallbladder. A choledochotomy may be performed, with a T tube inserted into thecommon bile duct. A Penrose drain may be placed into the ducts. The incision is closed and a dressing is applied. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy A small incision is made just above the umbilicus. Carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide is injected into the abdominal cavity .296 TREATMENTS897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 296A trocar, connected to an insufflator, is inserted through the incision. A laparoscope is passed through the trocar to view the intra-abdominal contents. The patient is placed in a 30-degree reverse Trendelenburg position andtilted slightly to the left. With laparoscopic guidance, the surgeon makes three incisions in theright upper quadrant: one below the xiphoid process in the midline; onebelow the right costal margin in the midclavicular line; and one in the an-terior axillary line at the umbilical level. Using the laparoscope, the surgeon passes instruments through the threeincisions to clamp and tie off the cystic duct and excise the gallbladder. The gallbladder is removed through the umbilical opening. The surgeon sutures all four incisions and places a dressing over each. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Place the patient in low Fowler's position. Attach the nasogastric (NG) tube to low intermittent suction as ordered. Report drainage greater than 500 ml after 48 hours. Provide meticulous skin care, especially around drainage tube insertionsites. After NG tube removal, introduce foods as ordered. Clamp the T tube before and after each meal as ordered. After laparoscopic cholecystectomy , start clear liquids as ordered whenthe patient has fully recovered from anesthesia. Assist with early ambulation. Encourage coughing and deep-breathing exercises. Encourage incentive spirometry use. Provide analgesics as ordered. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, respiratory status,amount and characteristics of drainage, surgical dressings, and positionand patency of drainage tubes. Monitor the patient for complications such as peritonitis, postcholecys-tectomy syndrome, atelectasis, bile duct injury , small bowel injury ,wound infection, ileus, urine retention, and retained gallstones.

Implantable cardioverter-debrillator DESCRIPTION An implantable electronic device that monitors the heart for bradycardia,ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation and delivers shocks or pacedbeats when indicated Stores information and electrocardiograms (ECGs) and tracks treatmentsand their outcome Allows information retrieval to evaluate the device's function and batterystatus and to adjust the settings Depending on the model, may deliver bradycardia pacing, antitachycar-dia pacing, cardioversion, and defibrillation Also called an ICD PURPOSE To treat cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation that are refractoryto drug therapy , surgery , or catheter ablation PATIENT PREPARATION Explain treatment, postoperative care.IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR 305897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 305Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Obtain baseline vital signs and a 12-lead ECG. Evaluate the patient's radial and pedal pulses. Assess the patient's mental status. Restrict food and fluids before the procedure as ordered. If the patient is monitored, document and report any arrhythmias. Administer medications as ordered, and prepare to assist with medical procedures, such as defibrillation, if indicated. PROCEDURE The following methods may be used:- transvenous route with fluoroscopy - thoracotomy approach, for patients who have mediastinal adhesions previous sternal surgery - subxiphoid approach- median sternotomy , for patients who need other cardiac surgery such as revascularization. One or more leadwires are attached to the epicardium. A programmable pulse generator is inserted into a pocket made under theright or left clavicle. The device is programmed and checked for proper functioning. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Obtain a printed status report verifying the ICD type and model, status,detection rates, and therapies to be delivered, such as pacing, antitachy-cardia pacing, cardioversion, and defibrillation. Don't remove the occlusive dressing for the first 24 hours without aphysician's order. After the first 24 hours, begin passive range-of-motion exercises if or-dered, and progress as tolerated. If the patient experiences cardiac arrest, initiate cardiopulmonary resusci-tation and advanced cardiac life support. ALERT For external defibrillation, use anteroposterior pad- dle placement; don't place paddles directly over the pulse generator. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, heart rate andrhythm, surgical incision and dressings, and drainage. Monitor the patient for complications such as infection, venous thrombo-sis and Page 306and ICD malfunction resulting in untreated ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. ALERT Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of a per- forated ventricle with resultant cardiac tamponade. hiccups, distant heart sounds, pulsusparadoxus, hypotension accompanied by narrow pulse pressure, in-creased venous pressure, jugular vein distention, cyanosis, de-creased urine output, restlessness, and complaints of fullness in thechest. Notify the physician immediately, and prepare the patient foremergency surgery. Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- signs and symptoms of infection- complications- when to notify the physician- importance of wearing medical alert identification that indicates ICD placement and of carrying ICD information at all times - what to do in an emergency , such as calling 911 and having a family member perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation if the ICD fails - avoidance of placing excessive pressure over the insertion site or mov- ing or jerking the area, until the physician approves - prescribed activity restrictions- what to expect when the ICD discharges- notifying the physician when the ICD discharges- importance of informing airline personnel and health care workers who perform diagnostic tests (such as computed tomography scansand magnetic resonance imaging) of ICD presence - possible disruption of the ICD by electrical or electronic devices - follow-up care. Joint replacement DESCRIPTION Total or partial replacement of a joint with a synthetic prosthesis Restores joint mobility and stability and relieves pain May involve any joint except a spinal joint Most commonly involves the hip, knee, and shoulder (see Arthroplastyvariations, page 308) Also called arthroplastyJOINT REPLACEMENT 307897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 307PURPOSE To treat severe chronic arthritis To treat degenerative joint disorders To treat extensive joint trauma PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Reassure the patient that analgesics will be available as needed. Provide emotional support. PROCEDURE The procedure varies slightly depending on the joint and its condition. The patient is placed in the appropriate position and receives a regional or general anesthetic. An incision is made to expose the affected joint. The joint capsule is incised or excised as indicated. The joint is dislocated to expose all parts of the affected joint as indicated. The intact bone of one side of the joint is shaped and reamed to acceptthe prosthetic part. The device is secured in place by cement, press fit, or bone ingrowth. Polymethylmethacrylate adhesive is used to secure the device in place ifthe prosthesis is cemented.308 TREATMENTS ARTHROPLASTY VARIATIONS Arthroplasty, the surgical reconstruction or replacement of a joint, is done to restore mobility of the joint and function to the muscles and ligaments. Otherthan total joint replacement, types of arthroplastic surgery include joint resectionand interpositional reconstruction. Joint resection involves removing a portion of the bone from a stiffened joint, creating a gap between the bone and the socket, to improve the range ofmotion. Scar tissue eventually lls this gap. Although pain is relieved and motionis restored, the joint is less stable. Interpositional reconstruction involves reshaping the joint and placing a pros- thetic disk between the reshaped bony ends forming the joint. The prosthesismay be made of metal, plastic, skin, or body tissue such as fascia. However,with repeated injury and surgical reshaping, the patient eventually may needtotal joint replacement. In recent years, joint replacement has become the operation of choice for most knee and hip problems. Elbow, shoulder, ankle, and nger joints are morelikely to be treated with joint resection or interpositional reconstruction.897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 308The process is repeated for the other side of the joint. After the prosthetic parts are in place, the surgeon fits them together to restore the joint. The incision is closed in layers and a dressing is applied. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Maintain bed rest for the prescribed period. Maintain the affected joint in proper alignment. Assess the patient's pain level and provide analgesics as ordered. Change dressings as ordered. Reposition the patient frequently . Encourage frequent coughing and deep breathing. Encourage adequate fluid intake. Exercise the affected joint as ordered. If joint displacement occurs, notify the physician. If traction is used to correct joint displacement, periodically checkweights and other equipment. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, surgical wound anddressings, drainage, abnormal bleeding, respiratory status, and neurovas-cular status of the affected extremity . Monitor for complications such as infection, hypovolemic em-bolism, thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism necrosis, atelectasis, pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- signs and symptoms of infection- signs and symptoms of joint dislodgment- complications- when to notify the physician- incision care- follow-up care- signs and symptoms of DVT and PE- the need to follow a prescribed exercise regimen as directed by a physi- cal therapist - prescribed activity restrictions- range-of-motion exercises and use of a continuous passive motion de- vice as appropriate - infective endocarditis prophylaxis. After hip replacement, be sure to teach the patient about:- importance of maintaining hip abductionJOINT REPLACEMENT 309897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 309- avoidance of crossing legs when sitting - avoidance of flexing hips more than 90 degrees when rising from a bed or chair - using a chair with high arms and a firm seat- importance of sleeping on a firm mattress- the proper use of crutches or a cane. After shoulder joint replacement, be sure to teach the patient about:- importance of keeping the affected arm in a sling until postoperative swelling subsides. Laminectomy and spinal fusion DESCRIPTION Laminectomy: removal of one or more of the bony laminae that cover the vertebrae; typically done to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or spinalnerve roots Spinal fusion: grafting of bone chips between the vertebral spaces to stabi- lize the spine; it follows laminectomy Spinal fusion used when more conservative treatments, such as pro-longed bed rest, traction, and use of a back brace, prove ineffective Percutaneous diskectomy: alternative to laminectomy for decompressing and repairing damaged lumbar disks (see Laminectomy alternative ) PURPOSE To treat herniated disk To treat compression fracture To treat vertebral dislocation To treat spinal cord tumor To treat vertebrae seriously weakened by trauma or disease PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Perform a baseline assessment of motor function and sensation. Show the patient how to perform the logrolling method of turning, andexplain that he'll use this technique later to get in and out of bed by him-self. PROCEDURE The patient receives a general anesthetic and is placed in a prone position.310 TREATMENTS897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 310Laminectomy A midline vertical incision is made. The fascia and muscles are stripped off the bony laminae. One or more sections of laminae are removed to expose the spinal defect. Herniated disk Part or all of the disk is removed. Spinal cord tumor The dura is incised, and the cord is explored for metastasis. The tumor is dissected and removed, using suction, forceps, or dissecting scissors. Spinal fusion The surgeon exposes the affected vertebrae. Bone chips from the iliac crest, bone bank, or both are inserted. Wire, spinal plates, rods, or screws are used to secure bone grafts into sev-eral vertebrae surrounding the unstable area. The incision is closed and a dressing is applied. External traction, such as a halo device, may be applied if surgery in-volved the cervical spine. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Keep the head of the bed flat or elevated no more than 45 degrees for atleast 24 hours after surgery .LAMINECTOMY AND SPINAL FUSION 311 LAMINECTOMY ALTERNATIVE Percutaneous (endoscopic) diskectomy is an alternative to traditional surgery for a herniated disk. In this technique, the physician uses arthroscopy with suctionand X-ray visualization to insert a small instrument to remove only the disk por-tion that's causing pain. Typically used for smaller, less-severe disk abnormalities, percutaneous auto- mated diskectomy, a slightly different method in which a needle is placedinstead of the small instrument, has only a 50% success rate, perhaps becausethe operative site isn't visualized directly. One report indicates a high incidenceof postoperative diskitis. Nursing care after diskectomy resembles postlaminectomy care. Typically, the patient is allowed out of bed in 24 to 48 hours and is encouraged to walkwithout assistance as soon as possible.897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 311Urge the patient to remain in a supine position for the prescribed period. When the patient can lie on his side, make sure the spine is straight, with his knees flexed and drawn up toward his chest. Insert a pillow between the patient's knees. Assist the surgeon with the initial dressing change. If the patient doesn't void within 8 to 12 hours after surgery , notify thephysician, and prepare to insert a urinary catheter (or assist with inser-tion). If the patient can void normally , provide assistance in getting on and offthe bedpan while maintaining proper body alignment. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, surgical wound anddressings, drainage, abnormal bleeding, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, mo-tor and neurologic function, peripheral vascular status, bowel sounds,and respiratory status. Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- incision care- signs and symptoms of infection- complications related to herniation relapse, arachnoiditis, chronic neu- ritis, nerve or muscle damage - when to notify the physician- showering with his back facing away from the stream of water- prescribed activity restrictions- prescribed exercises - proper body mechanics- avoidance of lying on his stomach or on his back with legs flat- sitting up straight with his feet on a low stool- using a firm, straight-backed chair - alternating placing each foot on a low stool - sleeping only on a firm mattress or inserting a bed board between the mattress and box spring - postoperative and follow-up care- pain relief, after chronic nerve irritation and swelling subside- availability of analgesics and muscle relaxants Laparoscopy and laparotomy Laparoscopy, also called pelvic peritoneoscopy: insertion of a laparoscope through the abdominal wall near the umbilicus Laparotomy: a general term for any surgical incision made into the ab-312 TREATMENTS897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 312dominal wall; laparotomy when the extent of abdom- inal injury or disease is unknown PURPOSE To examine the pelvic cavity and repair or remove diseased or injured structures Laparoscopy To allow for certain abdominal surgical procedures, such as:- salpingectomy To resolve lysis abnormalities, such as cysts, adhesions, fibroids, and infection To identify the cause of pelvic pain To diagnose endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy , or pelvic inflammatorydisease To evaluate pelvic masses To examine the fallopian tubes in an infertile patient Laparotomy To allow extensive surgical repair To treat pelvic conditions untreatable by laparoscopy To resect ovarian cysts containing endometrial tissue PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Restrict food and fluids as ordered. Obtain laboratory re sults and report abnormal findings to the physician. PROCEDURE Laparoscopy The patient receives regional or general anesthesia. The patient is placed in the lithotomy position. A needle is inserted below the umbilicus, and carbon dioxide is infusedinto the pelvic cavity . An infra-umbilical incision is made, and a trocar removed, and the laparoscope is inserted through the cannu- la. The pelvic cavity is visualized, and additional instruments are insertedthrough a second small incision close to the infra-umbilical incision, orthey may be passed through the laparoscope. Carbon dioxide is removed. The incision is sutured and a dressing is applied. Laparotomy The patient receives general anesthesia. An abdominal incision is made, and the abdominal cavity is explored. Necessary repairs or excisions are made. The incision is sutured, and a sterile dressing is applied. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Assess for abdominal pain and, if the patient had a laparoscopy , for ab-dominal cramps or shoulder pain. Provide comfort measures. Explain that bloating or abdominal fullness from laparoscopy will sub-side as gas is absorbed. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, surgical wound anddressings, drainage, and signs of infection as well as for such complica-tions as infection and hemorrhage. Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- coughing and deep-breathing exercises- use of incentive spirometry- incision care- signs and symptoms of infection- complications- when to notify the physician- prescribed activity restrictions- follow-up care. Mastectomy DESCRIPTION Breast excision done primarily to remove malignant breast tissue and re-gional lymphatic metastasis May involve one of various procedures (see T ypes of mastectomy )314 TREATMENTS897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 314May be combined with radiation and chemotherapy PURPOSE To treat breast cancer PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Take baseline arm measurements on both sides. Provide emotional support. PROCEDURE Total mastectomy The entire breast is removed without dissecting the lymph nodes. A skin graft may be applied if necessary . Modied radical mastectomy Axillary lymph nodes are resected while the pectoralis major is left in- tact. The pectoralis minor may be removed. If the patient has small lesions and no metastasis, breast reconstructionmay follow immediately or a few days later.MASTECTOMY 315 TYPES OF MASTECTOMY The type of mastectomy performed depends on the extent of tissue and lymph node involvement. /H18546A lumpectomy (partial mastectomy) or a total (simple) mastectomy may be done if the tumor is conned to breast tissue and no lymph node involvement is detected. A total mastectomy also may be used palliatively for advanced,ulcerative cancer and to treat extensive benign disease. /H18546 Modied radical mastectomy \u2014the standard surgery for stages I and II breast cancer\u2014removes small, localized tumors. It has replaced radical mastecto-my as the most widely used breast cancer surgery. Besides causing less dis-gurement than radical mastectomy, it reduces postoperative arm edemaand shoulder problems. /H18546 Radical mastectomy controls the spread of larger, metastatic lesions. Later, breast reconstruction may be performed using a portion of the latissimusdorsi. /H18546 Extended radical mastectomy is used to treat cancer in the medial quadrant of the breast or in subareolar tissue. This rare procedure may prevent metas-tasis to the internal mammary lymph nodes.897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 315Radical mastectomy The entire breast, axillary lymph nodes, underlying pectoral muscles, and adjacent tissues are removed. Skin flaps and exposed tissue are covered with moist packs. The chest wall and axilla are irrigated before closure. Extended radical mastectomy The breast, underlying pectoral muscles, axillary contents, and upper in-ternal mammary (mediastinal) lymph node chain are removed. After closure of the mastectomy site, a drain or catheter may be inserted. Large pressure dressings may be applied if a drain isn't inserted. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Elevate the patient's affected arm on a pillow . Regularly check the suction tubing to ensure proper functioning. Initiate flexion and extension arm exercises as ordered. Place a sign in the patient's room indicating that no blood pressure read-ings, injections, or venipunctures should be performed on the affectedarm. Gently encourage the patient to look at the operative site. Encourage her to express her feelings. Arrange a fitting for a temporary breast pad after 2 to 3 days. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, surgical wound anddressings, drainage, and emotional response. Monitor the patient for complications such as infection, delayed healing,lymphedema, and change in self-concept. Refer the patient to the American Cancer Society and Reach to Recovery . Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- signs and symptoms of infection- complications- when to notify the physician- ways to prevent infection- importance of using the affected arm as much as possible- range-of-motion exercises and other postoperative exercises- temporary breast prosthesis as needed- avoidance of blood pressure readings, injections, and venipunctures on the affected arm - avoidance of keeping the affected arm in a dependent position for a prolonged period316 TREATMENTS897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 316- protecting the affected arm from injury - adequate rest periods- monthly breast self-examinations- follow-up care, including chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , or relax- ation therapy - permanent prosthesis, which can be fitted 3 to 4 weeks after surgery . Prostatectomy DESCRIPTION Surgical removal of the prostate T ransurethral resection of the prostate: prostate removal via insertion of a resectoscope into the urethra May be performed by an open surgical approach, such as suprapubicprostatectomy , retropubic prostatectomy , or perineal prostatectomy PURPOSE prostate cancer To treat obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Administer an enema. Restrict foods and fluids as ordered. PROCEDURE Transurethral resection of the prostate The patient is placed in a lithotomy position and anesthetized. The surgeon introduces a resectoscope into the urethra and advances it tothe prostate. A clear irrigating solution is instilled, and the obstruction is visualized. The resectoscope's cutting loop is used to resect prostatic tissue and re-store the urethral opening. Suprapubic prostatectomy The patient is placed in a supine position and anesthetized. A horizontal incision is made just above the pubic symphysis. Fluid is instilled into the bladder. A small incision is made in the bladder wall to expose the prostate. The surgeon shells out prostatic tissue with a finger.PROSTATECTOMY 317897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 317The obstruction is cleared and bleeding points are ligated. A suprapubic drainage tube and Penrose drain are inserted. Retropubic prostatectomy The patient is placed in a supine position and anesthetized. A horizontal suprapubic incision is made. The prostate is approached from between the bladder and pubic arch. Another incision is made in the prostatic capsule, and the obstructing tis- sue is removed. Bleeding is controlled. A suprapubic tube and Penrose drain are inserted. Perineal prostatectomy The patient is placed in an exaggerated lithotomy position and anes-thetized. The surgeon makes an inverted U-shaped incision in the perineum. The entire prostate is removed, along with the seminal vesicles. The urethra is anastomosed to the bladder. The incision is closed, leaving a Penrose drain in place. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. ALERT Never administer medication rectally in a patient who has had a total prostatectomy. Maintain urinary catheter and suprapubic tube patency as ordered. Keep the urine collection container below the bladder level. Administer antispasmodics and analgesics as ordered. Offer sitz baths.

Thoracotomy DESCRIPTION Surgical incision into the thoracic cavity , most commonly performed toremove part or all of a lung and thus spare healthy lung tissue from dis-ease May involve to evaluate the chest and pleural space for chest trauma and tumors Decortication: removal or stripping of the fibrous membrane covering the visceral pleura; helps reexpand the lung in empyema Thoracoplasty: removes part or all of one rib to reduce chest cavity size, decreasing the risk of mediastinal shift; may be done when tuberculosishas reduced lung volume PURPOSE To locate and examine thoracic abnormalities To perform a biopsy To remove diseased lung tissue PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Arrange for laboratory studies and tests; report abnormal results. Withhold food and fluids as ordered.THORACOTOMY 319897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 319PROCEDURE The patient is anesthetized. In a posterolateral thoracotomy, the incision starts in the submammary fold of the anterior chest, is drawn below the scapular tip and along the ribs, and then curves posteriorly and up to the scapular spine. In an anterolateral thoracotomy, the incision begins below the breast and above the costal margins, extending from the anterior axillary line andthen turning downward to avoid the axillary apex. In a median sternotomy, a straight incision is made from the suprasternal notch to below the xiphoid process; the sternum must be transected withan electric or air-driven saw . Once the incision is made, the surgeon removes tissue for a biopsy . Bleeding sources are tied off. Injuries within the thoracic cavity are located and repaired. The ribs may be spread and the lung exposed for excision. Pneumonectomy The surgeon ligates and severs the pulmonary arteries. The mainstem bronchus leading to the affected lung is clamped. The bronchus is divided and closed with nonabsorbable sutures or sta-ples. The lung is removed. To ensure airtight closure, a pleural flap is placed over the bronchus andclosed. The phrenic nerve is severed on the affected side. After air pressure in the pleural cavity stabilizes, the chest is closed. Lobectomy The surgeon resects the affected lobe. Appropriate arteries, veins, and bronchial passages are ligated and sev-ered. One or two chest tubes are inserted for drainage and lung reexpansion. Segmental resection The surgeon removes the affected lung segment. The appropriate artery , vein, and bronchus are ligated and severed. Two chest tubes are inserted to aid lung reexpansion. Wedge resection The affected area is clamped, excised, and sutured. The surgeon inserts two chest tubes to aid lung reexpansion.320 TREATMENTS897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 320After completing the procedure requiring the thoracotomy , the surgeon closes the chest cavity and applies a dressing. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. After pneumonectomy , make sure the patient lies only on the operativeside or his back until stabilized. Make sure chest tubes are patent and functioning. Provide comfort measures. Encourage coughing, deep breathing, and incentive spirometry use. Have the patient splint the incision as needed. Perform passive range-of-motion (ROM) exercises, progressing to activeROM exercises. Perform incision care and dressing changes as ordered. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, respiratory status,breath sounds, surgical wound and dressings, and drainage. Monitor patient for complications such as hemorrhage, infection, tensionpneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula, empyema, and persistent air spacethat the remaining lung tissue doesn't expand to fill. ALERT W atch for and immediately report dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension, vertigo, syncope, emphysema, or deviation from the mid-line. These findings indicate tension pneumothorax. Refer the patient to home health care as needed. Refer the patient to a smoking-cessation program, if needed.

PROCEDURE The thrombolytic is usually given by I.V . bolus, with I.V . infusion given ata specific rate in a separate I.V . line. Some thrombolytics are given by intracoronary infusion. The thrombolytic can also be given locally or directly into the thrombus. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Minimize invasive procedures and venipunctures. Administer anticoagulants as ordered. Provide comfort measures. Provide supplemental oxygen as ordered. Restrict physical activity as ordered. Monitor patient's vital signs, intake and output, hypersensitivity reac-tions, heart rate and rhythm, peripheral pulses, motor and sensory func-tion, and respiratory status.322 TREATMENTS897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 322Monitor the patient for complications, such as bleeding, adverse reactions to the thrombolytic, streptokinase resistance, and arrhythmias. Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- abnormal bleeding- signs and symptoms of thrombus formation and thromboembolic events - complications- when to notify the physician- prevention of thrombotic events- smoking cessation, if indicated- postoperative and follow-up care. Thyroidectomy DESCRIPTION Surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland PURPOSE To resolve hyperthyroidism or respiratory obstruction caused by goiter To treat thyroid cancer PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Make sure the patient has followed the preoperative drug regimen as or-dered. Collect blood samples for serum thyroid hormone measurement. Obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram. PROCEDURE The patient is anesthetized. The surgeon extends the patient's neck fully and determines the incisionline by measuring bilaterally from each clavicle. The surgeon cuts through the skin, fascia, and muscle and raises skinflaps from the strap muscles. The muscles are separated at midline, revealing the isthmus of the thy-roid. The thyroid artery and veins are ligated to help prevent bleeding. The surgeon locates and visualizes the laryngeal nerves and parathyroidglands.THYROIDECTOMY 323897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 323Thyroid tissue is dissected and removed. A Penrose drain or a closed wound drainage device is inserted, and the wound is closed. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Keep the patient in high Fowler's position. Evaluate the patient's speech for signs of laryngeal nerve damage. Keep a tracheotomy tray at the bedside for 24 hours after surgery . Provide surgical wound care and dressing changes as ordered. Provide comfort measures. Maintain patency of drains. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, surgical wound anddressings, drainage, and respiratory status. Monitor the patient for complications, such as hypocalcemia, thyroidstorm, hemorrhage, parathyroid damage, tetany , laryngeal nerve cord paralysis. Inform the patient that some hoarseness and a sore throat will occur aftersurgery . Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- signs and symptoms of respiratory distress - signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism - signs and symptoms of infection - signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia - abnormal bleeding- complications- when to notify the physician- prescribed thyroid hormone replacement therapy- calcium supplements as indicated- incision care and dressing changes- follow-up care. Urinary diversion surgery DESCRIPTION Provides an alternative route for urine excretion when disease impedesnormal urine flow through the bladder Incontinent diversion: used when urine flow is constant and the patient re- quires an external collection device permanently; used when an external collection bag isn't needed; types include the Kock pouch, Indiana pouch, Mainz pouch, and Camey procedure in men PURPOSE To treat cystectomy To treat congenital urinary tract defect To treat severe, unmanageable urinary tract infection that threatens renalfunction To treat chronic cystitis To treat injury to the ureters, bladder, or urethra To treat obstructive malignancy To treat neurogenic bladder PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Initiate referrals if the patient needs assistance with stoma management. Prepare the bowel as ordered. PROCEDURE The patient receives a general anesthetic. The surgeon makes a midline or paramedial abdominal incision. To construct an ileal conduit The surgeon excises a segment of the ileum measuring 6 /H11033to 8/H11033 (15 to 20.5 cm). The remaining ileal ends are anastomosed to maintain intestinal integrity . The ureters are dissected from the bladder and implanted in the ileal seg-ment. The surgeon sutures one end of the ileal segment closed. The other end of the segment is brought through the abdominal wall toform a stoma. To create a nephrostomy The surgeon inserts a catheter into the renal pelvis percutaneously orthrough a flank incision. This procedure is usually palliative because it carries a high risk of infec-tion and renal calculus formation. To create a continent internal ileal reservoir (such as the Kock pouch) Segments of the small bowel and colon are used.URINARY DIVERSION SURGERY 325897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM 24 /H11033to 32/H11033 (61 to 81 cm) of ileum and anastomoses the remaining ileal ends. The isolated ileum segment is shaped into a pocket to serve as a bladder. The Kock pouch is connected to the urethra, or an intussuscepted nipple valve is used to connect the pouch to the external skin of the anterior ab-dominal wall. A second nipple valve is constructed at the other end of the pouch. The ureters are implanted at the site of the second nipple valve, alongwith ureteral stents. Ureteral stents originate in the pelvis of the kidneys and extend throughthe ureter into the reservoir and out through the abdominal opening orseparate stab wounds. Stents may be attached to dependent drainage or may be contained with apouching system. One or two drainage tubes are inserted into the reservoir and remainthere until healing has occurred and pouch integrity is confirmed. Camey procedure (orthotopic bladder replacement) The surgeon creates a pouch from both the small and large bowels andconnects it to the urethral stump. An indwelling catheter is inserted and remains in place for about 3weeks. After the catheter is removed, the patient voids through the urethra bymeans of abdominal straining. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Provide comfort measures. Observe urine drainage for pus and blood; report these findings. Maintain patency of drainage catheters as ordered and report urine leak-age from the drain or suture line. ALERT Report signs and symptoms of peritonitis\u2014fever, abdominal distention, and pain. Perform surgical wound care and dressing changes as ordered. Continue I.V . replacement therapy and total parenteral nutrition. Provide emotional support. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, surgical wound anddressings, stoma and peristomal skin, drainage, urine characteristics, andbowel sounds. Monitor the patient for complications, such as abnormal bleeding, skinbreakdown, infection, urinary renal calculi, and psychological problems. Refer the patient to sexual counseling as needed. Refer the patient to support groups. Be sure to teach the patient about: - medications and adverse reactions- signs and symptoms of infection- complications- when to notify the physician- stoma care and abnormal changes- pouch drainage tube care until it's removed (with a continent internal ileal reservoir) - prescribed activity restrictions- follow-up care. Vascular repair DESCRIPTION Treatment of choice for damaged vessels May involve aneurysm resection, bypass grafting, embolectomy , or veinstripping PURPOSE To a vessel damaged by an arteriosclerotic or thromboembolic dis-order To treat aortic aneurysm To treat limb-threatening acute arterial occlusion To resolve vessel trauma, infection, or congenital defect To treat vascular disease that doesn't respond to drug therapy or nonsur-gical revascularization PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Perform a complete vascular assessment. Obtain baseline vital signs. Evaluate pulses, noting bruits. Restrict food and fluids as ordered. Administer sedation as ordered.VASCULAR REPAIR 327897303pt2.qxd:9781582558974_03pt2 7/12/13 1:53 PM Page 327ALERT If the patient is waiting for aortic aneurysm repair surgery, be sure to watch for and immediately report the clas- sic triad of shock, pulsatile mass, and abdominal or back pain, which highly suggests rupture. PROCEDURE Typically , the patient receives general anesthesia. The procedure varies with the vessel affected and the specific repair needed. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Administer medications as ordered. Position the patient as ordered. Explain recommended activity levels during the early recovery stage. Provide comfort measures. Use Doppler ultrasonography if peripheral pulses aren't palpable. As the patient's condition improves assist with weaning from the mechan-ical ventilator. Encourage frequent coughing, turning, and deep breathing. Assist with range-of-motion exercises. Provide incision care. Change dressings as ordered. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, neurovascular status,heart rate and rhythm, hemodynamic values, surgical wound and dress-ings, and drainage. Monitor the patient for complications, such as vessel trauma; thrombusformation; embolism; hemorrhage; infection; and rupture involved with bypass grafting. Be sure to teach the patient about:- medications and possible adverse reactions- palpation and monitoring of peripheral pulses- monitoring of extremities for changes in temperature, sensation, and motor ability - incision care- signs and symptoms of infection- complications- when to notify the physician- follow-up 329Bladder irrigation, continuous DESCRIPTION Helps prevent urinary tract obstruction by flushing out small blood clots that form after prostate or bladder surgery Can be used to treat an irritated, inflamed, or infected bladder lining Continuous flow of irrigating solution through the bladder to create amild tamponade that may help prevent venous hemorrhage Catheter usually inserted during prostate or bladder surgery but possiblyinserted at bedside for a nonsurgical patient EQUIPMENT One 4,000-ml container or two 2,000-ml containers of irrigating solutionor prescribed amount of medicated solution Y -type tubing made specifical- ly for bladder irrigation alcohol or povidone-iodine pad (see Setup for con- tinuous bladder irrigation) ESSENTIAL STEPS Wash your hands. Use large volumes of irrigating solution, if necessary , during the first 24to 48 hours after surgery . Double-check the irrigating solution against the physician's order beforestarting. Check the patient's chart to make sure he isn't allergic to any anti bioticsin the solution. Assemble all equipment at the patient's bedside. Explain the procedure and provide privacy . Keep the patient on bed rest throughout continuous bladder irrigation,unless specified otherwise. Insert the spike of the Y -type tubing into the container of irrigating solu-tion. Insert one spike into each container if you are using a two-container sys-tem. Squeeze the drip chamber on the spike of the tubing. Open the flow clamp and flush the tubing to remove air that could causebladder distention. Close the clamp. Hang the bag of irrigating solution on the I.V . pole. Clean the opening to the inflow lumen of the catheter with the alcohol orpovidone-iodine pad. 330 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 330Insert the distal end of the Y -type tubing securely into the third port of the catheter. Make sure the catheter's outflow lumen is securely attached to thedrainage bag tubing. Open the flow clamp under the container of irrigating solution and setthe drip rate as ordered. Replace the primary container before it empties completely , in order toprevent air from entering the system. Close the flow clamp under the nearly empty container and open theflow clamp under the reserve container simultaneously if you have a two-BLADDER IRRIGATION, CONTINUOUS 331 SETUP FOR CONTINUOUS BLADDER IRRIGATION In continuous bladder irrigation, a triple-lumen catheter allows irrigating solu- tion to flow into the bladder through one lumen and flow out through another,as shown in the inset. The third lumen is used to inflate the balloon that holdsthe catheter in place. Irrigating solution Drip chamber Clamp Irrigation tubing Indwelling catheter Drainage tubingDrainage channel Irrigation channel Channel to retention balloon897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 331container system. This prevents reflux of irrigating solution from the re- serve container into the nearly empty one. Hang a new reserve container on the I.V . pole and insert the tubing, main-taining asepsis. Empty the drainage bag about every 4 hours or as often as needed. Use sterile technique to avoid risk of contamination. Monitor vital signs at least every 4 hours during irrigation, increasing thefrequency if the patient becomes unstable. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Check inflow and outflow lines periodically for kinks to ensure solutionis running freely . Check the lines frequently if solution flows rapidly . Measure the outflow volume accurately . The outflow should be the sameor slightly more than the inflow volume, allowing for urine production. ALERT Postoperative inflow volume exceeding outflow vol- ume may indicate bladder rupture at the suture lines or renal damage; notify the physician immediately. Assess outflow for changes in appearance and for blood clots, especially ifirrigation is being done postoperatively to control bleeding. ALERT If drainage is bright red, irrigating solution should be infused rapidly with the cl amp wide open until drainage clears. Notify the physician immediately if you suspect hemorrhage. Administer the solution at a rate of 40 to 60 drops/minute if thedrainage is clear. Administer antibiotic solutions at a rate usually specified by the physi-cian. Encourage oral fluid intake of 2 to 3 qt (2 to 3 L)/day unless contraindi-cated. Interruptions in a continuous irrigation system may cause infection. Obstruction in the catheter's outflow lumen may cause bladder disten-tion. Record the date, time, and amount of fluids on the intake and outputrecord each time a container of solution is finished. Record the time and amount of fluid each time you empty the drainagebag. Note the appearance of the drainage and patient complaints. Instruct the patient to report bladder distention or spasms.332 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 332Bone growth stimulation, electrical DESCRIPTION Initiates or accelerates healing in patients with a fractured bone that fails to heal (about 1 in 20 fractures), by imitating the body's natural electricalforces Failure to heal possibly resulting from infection, insufficient reduction orfixation, pseudarthrosis, or severe tissue trauma around the fracture The stimulating effects of electrical currents first used on osteogenesis,which led to its use to promote healing May also be used for treating spinal fusions Three techniques: fully implantable direct-current stimulation, semi-inva-sive percutaneous stimulation, and noninvasive electromagnetic coilstimulation (see Methods of electrical bone growth stimulation, page 334) Choice of technique dependent on the fracture type and location, thephysician's preference, and the patient's ability and willingness to com-ply Fully implantable device requiring little or no patient management Semi-invasive and noninvasive techniques requiring the patient to man-age his own treatment schedule and maintain the equipment Treatment time: averages 3 to 6 months Electromagnetic coils contraindicated for pregnant patients, patients withtumors, and patients with arm fractures who also have a pacemaker Percutaneous electrical bone stimulation contraindicated if the patienthas any kind of inflammatory process ALERT Use caution in patients who are sensitive to nickel or chromium because both are present in the electrical bone stimulation system. EQUIPMENT All equipment comes with instructions provided by the manufacturer. Fol-low the instructions carefully . Make sure all parts are included and sterilizedaccording to facility policy and procedure.

Note the type of electrical bone stimulation equipment provided. Note the date, time, and location, as appropriate.334 PROCEDURES METHODS OF ELECTRICAL BONE GROWTH STIMULATION Electrical bone growth stimulation may be invasive or noninvasive. Invasive system An invasive system involves placing a spiralcathode inside the bone atthe fracture site. A wireleads from the cathode toa battery-powered genera-tor, also implanted in The system A mayinclude cufflike trans-ducer or fitted ring thatwraps around the patient'slimb at the level of theinjury. Electric current pen-etrates the limb. Transducer Control 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 334Record the patient's skin condition and tolerance of procedure. Document instructions given to the patient and his family . Direct-current stimulation Implantation is performed with the patient under general anesthesia. The physician may apply a cast or external fixator to immobilize the limb. The patient is usually hospitalized for 2 to 3 days after implantation. W eight bearing may be ordered as tolerated. After the bone fragments join, the generator and leadwire can be removedunder local anesthesia. The titanium cathode remains implanted. Percutaneous stimulation Remove excessive hair from the injury site before applying the anodepad. Avoid stressing or pulling on the anode wire. Tell the patient to change the anode pad every 48 hours. Tell the patient to report local pain to his physician and not to bear weighton the limb for the duration of treatment. Electromagnetic stimulation Show the patient where to place the coils and tell him to apply them for 3to 10 hours each day , or as ordered. Many patients find it most convenient to perform the procedure at night. Advise the patient to not interrupt the treatments for more than 10 min-utes at a time. Teach the patient how to use and care for the generator. Restate the physician's instructions for weight bearing. The physicianwill usually advise against bearing weight until evidence of healing ap-pears on X-rays. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS A patient with a direct-current electrical bone stimulation shouldn't un-dergo electrocauterization, the system.- Diathermy may potentiate the electrical current, possibly causing tis- sue damage. - MRI will interfere with or stop the current. Increased risk of infection exists with direct-current electrical bone stimu-lation equipment.BONE GROWTH STIMULATION, ELECTRICAL 335897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 335Local irritation or skin ulceration may occur around cathode pin sites with percutaneous devices. No known complications are associated with electromagnetic coils. Teach the patient how to care for his cast or external fixation devices. Tell the patient how to care for the electrical generator. Urge the patient to follow treatment instructions. Burn care DESCRIPTION Competent care immediately after a burn to dramatically improve thesuccess of overall treatment Goals: To maintain the patient's physiologic stability , repair skin integrity ,prevent infection, and maximize functionality and psychosocial health Burn severity determined by the depth and extent of the burn, age, com-plications (such as infection, pulmonary problems), and coexisting illness(see Evaluating burn severity) Initial step: aggressive wound debridement, followed by maintenance of aclean wound bed until the wound heals or is covered with a skin graft Full-thickness burns and some deep partial-thickness burns debrided andgrafted in the operating room; surgery as soon as possible after fluid re-suscitation Most wounds managed with twice-daily dressing changes using topicalantibiotics Dressings to bar germ entry and remove exudate, eschar, and other debristhat host infection, encouraging healing EQUIPMENT A sterile field is required, and all equipment and supplies used in the dress-ing should be sterile.

Superficial partial-thickness (first-degree) burn Does the burned area appear pink or red with minimal edema? Is the areasensitive to touch and temperaturechanges? If so, your patient probablyhas a superficial partial-thickness, orfirst-degree, burn (shown here) affect-ing only the epidermal skin layer. Deep partial-thickness (second-degree) burn Does the burned area look pink or red, and have a mottled appearance? Dored areas blanch when you touchthem? Does the skin have large, thick-walled blisters with subcutaneousedema? Does touching the burn causesevere pain? Is hair still present? If so,your patient probably has a deep par-tial-thickness, or burn(shown here) affecting the epidermaland dermal layers. Full-thickness (third-degree) burn Does the burned area appear red, waxy white, brown, or black? Does redskin remain red with no blanchingwhen you touch it? Is the skin leatherywith extensive subcutaneous edema?Is the skin insensitive to touch? Doesthe hair fall out easily? If so, yourpatient probably has a full-thickness,or third-degree, burn (shown here)that affects all skin layers. 897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 337ESSENTIAL STEPS Give the ordered analgesic about 20 minutes before beginning wound care to maximize patient comfort and cooperation. Explain the procedure and provide privacy . Open equipment packages using sterile technique. Arrange supplies on a sterile field in order of use. Dress the cleanest areas first and the dirtiest or most contaminated areaslast to prevent cross-contamination. Dress in stages if necessary to avoid exposing all wounds at the sametime to help prevent excessive pain or cross-contamination. Turn on overhead heat lamps to keep the patient warm. Make sure theydon't overheat him. Pour warmed normal saline solution into the sterile bowl in the sterilefield. Wash your hands. Removing a dressing without hydrotherapy Put on a gown, a mask, and sterile gloves. Remove dressing layers down to the innermost layer by cutting the outerdressings with sterile blunt scissors. Lay open these dressings. If the inner layer appears dry , soak it with warm normal saline solution toease removal. Remove the inner dressing with sterile tissue forceps or your sterilegloved hand. Dispose of soiled dressings carefully in an impervious plastic trash bagaccording to facility policy , because these dressings harbor infection. Dispose of gloves and wash your hands. Put on a new pair of sterile gloves. Using gauze pads moistened with normal saline solution, gently removeexudate and old topical drug. Carefully remove all loose eschar with sterile forceps and scissors, if or-dered. Assess the wound condition. It should appear clean, with no debris, loosetissue, purulence, inflammation, or darkened margins. Before applying a new dressing, remove your surgical cap, gown, gloves,and mask. Discard them properly; put on a clean mask, a cap, a gown, and sterilegloves.338 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 338Applying a wet dressing Soak fine-mesh gauze and the elastic gauze dressing in a large sterile basin containing the ordered solution. Wring out the fine-mesh gauze until it's moist but not dripping, and ap-ply it to the wound. Warn the patient he may feel transient pain when you apply the dressing. Wring out the elastic gauze dressing and position it to hold the fine-meshgauze in place. Roll an elastic gauze dressing over the fine-mesh dressing to keep it in-tact. Cover the patient with a cotton bath blanket to prevent chills. Change the blanket if it becomes damp. Use an overhead heat lamp, if necessary . Change the dressings frequently , as ordered, to keep the wound moist, es-pecially if you're using silver nitrate. If the dressings become dry , silver nitrate becomes ineffective and the sil-ver ions may damage tissue. To maintain moist dressings, some protocols call for irrigating the dress-ing with solution at least every 4 hours through small slits cut into theouter dressing. Applying a dry dressing with a topical drug Remove old dressings and clean the wound. Apply the drug to the wound in a thin layer \u2014 about 2 to 4 mm thick \u2014with your sterile gloved hand or a sterile tongue blade. Apply several layers of burn gauze over the wound to contain the drugbut allow exudate to escape. Cut the dressing to fit only the wound areas. Don't cover unburned areas. Cover the entire dressing with roller gauze and secure it with elastic net-ting or tape. Providing arm and leg care Apply the dressings from the distal to the proximal area to stimulate cir-culation and prevent constriction. Wrap the burn gauze once around the arm or leg so the edges overlapslightly . Continue wrapping until the gauze covers the wound. Apply a dry roller gauze dressing to hold bottom layers in place. Secure with elastic netting or tape.BURN CARE 339897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 339Providing hand and foot care Wrap each finger separately with a single 4 /H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pad to allow the patient to use his hands and to prevent webbing contractures. Place the hand in a functional position, and secure using a dressing. Apply splints if ordered. Put gauze between each toe as appropriate to prevent webbing contrac- tures. Providing chest, abdomen, and back care Apply the ordered drug to the wound in a thin layer. Cover the entire burned area with sheets of burn gauze. Wrap with roller gauze or apply a specialty vest dressing to hold the burngauze in place. Secure the dressing with elastic netting or tape. Make sure the dressing doesn't restrict respiratory motion, especially invery young or elderly patients, or in those with circumferential injuries. Providing facial care If the patient has scalp burns, clip or shave the hair around the burn, asordered. Clip other hair until it's about 2 /H11033(5 cm) long to prevent contamination of burned scalp areas. Shave facial hair if it comes in contact with burned areas. Typically , facial burns are managed with milder topical agents, such astriple antibiotic ointment, and are left open to air. If dressings are required, make sure they don't cover the eyes, nostrils, ormouth. Providing ear care Clip or shave hair around the affected ear. Remove exudate and crusts with cotton-tipped applicators dipped in nor-mal saline Place a layer of 4/H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze behind the auricle to prevent webbing. Apply the ordered topical drug to 4/H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pads and place them over the burned area. Before securing the dressing with a roller bandage, position the patient'sears normally to avoid damaging the auricular cartilage. Assess the patient's hearing ability . Providing eye care Clean the area around the patient's eyes and eyelids with a cotton-tippedapplicator and normal saline solution every 4 to 6 hours, or as needed, toremove crust and drainage.340 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 340Give eye ointments or drops. If the patient's eyes can't be closed, apply lubricating ointments or drops, as ordered. Be sure to close his eyes before applying eye pads to prevent corneal abra-sion. Don't apply topical ointments near his eyes without a physician's order. Providing nasal care Check the patient's nostrils for inhalation injury , such as the presence ofinflamed mucosa, singed and soot. Clean cotton-tipped applicators dipped in nor-mal saline solution. Remove crust. Apply the ordered ointments. If the patient has a nasogastric tube, use tracheostomy ties to secure thetube. Be sure to check tracheostomy ties frequently for tightness caused byswelling facial tissue. Clean the area around the tube every 4 to 6 hours. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Thorough assessment and documentation of the wound's appearance areessential to detect infection and other complications. ALERT A purulent wound or wound with green-gray exudate indicates infection, an overly dry wound suggests dehydra- tion, and a wound with a swollen red edge suggests cellulitis. Sus-pect a fungal infection if the wound is white and powdery. Healthy granulation tissue appears clean, pinkish, faintly shiny , and freeof exudate. Blisters protect underlying tissue; leave them intact unless they impedejoint motion, become infected, or cause discomfort. Be certain to meet the increased nutritional needs of the patient withhealing burns; extra protein and carbohydrates are required to accommo-date an almost doubled basal metabolism. If you must manage a burn with topical drugs, exposure to air, and nodressing, watch for such problems as wound adhe rence to bed linens, poor drainage control, and partial loss of topical drugs. Watch for complications such as infection, sepsis, allergic reactions toointments or dressings, renal failure, and multisystem organ dysfunction. Record the dates and times for all care provided. Describe wound condition.BURN CARE 341 (T ext continues on page 344.)897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 341342 PROCEDURES POSITIONING THE BURN PATIENT TO PREVENT DEFORMITY For each of the potential deformities listed below, you can use the corresponding positioning and interventions to help prevent the deformity.

List topical drugs given. Note positioning of the burned area. Describe the patient's tolerance of the procedure. Monitor the patient's respiratory status carefully in order to promote stability , especially if he suffered smoke inhalation. A patient with burns involving more than 20% of his total body surfacearea usually needs fluid resuscitation to support his body's compensatorymechanisms without overwhelming them. Give fluids, such as lactated Ringer's solution, to keep the patient's urineoutput at 30 to 50 ml/hour; monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Control the patient's body temperature, because skin loss interferes withtemperature regulation. Use warm fluids, heat lamps, and hyperthermia blankets, as appropriate,to keep the patient's temperature above 97\u00b0 F (36.1\u00b0 C), if possible. Frequently review laboratory v alues such as serum electrolyte levels to detect early changes in the patient's condition. Infection can increase wound depth, cause rejection of skin grafts, slowhealing, worsen pain, prolong hospitalization, and lead to death. For pre-vention use strict sterile technique during care, dress the burn site as or-dered, monitor and rotate I.V . lines regularly , and carefully assess theburn extent, body system function, and the patient's emotional status. Other interventions, such as careful positioning and regular exercise forburned extremities, help maintain joint function, prevent contractures,and minimize deformity . (See Positioning the burn patient to prevent defor- mity, pages 342 and 343.) Begin discharge planning as soon as the patient enters the facility to helphim and his family transition from facility to home. To encourage therapeutic compliance, prepare the patient to expect scar-ring, but advise him that proper therapy can minimize scarring. Teach the patient wound management and pain control, and urge him todo the prescribed exercises. Provide encouragement and emotional support, and urge the patient tojoin a burn survivor support group. Teach the family or caregivers how to encourage, support, and providecare for the patient. Refer the patient and family to home care services for follow-up teachingand therapies as needed. Refer the patient and family to burn survivor resources such as Burn Survivors Online, from World Burn Foundation.344 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 344Chest physiotherapy DESCRIPTION Used on patients who expectorate large amounts of sputum, such as those with bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis Techniques including postural drainage, chest percussion and vibration,and coughing and deep-breathing exercises To mobilize and eliminate secretions, expand lung tissue, and promote ef-ficient use of respiratory muscles Important for the bedridden patient; to help prevent or treat atelectasisand possibly prevent pneumonia, which can seriously impede recovery Postural drainage done with percussion and vibration, causing peripheralpulmonary secretions to empty into the major bronchi or trachea; accom-plished by sequential repositioning of the patient Has little value for treating patients with stable, chronic bronchitis Contraindicated in active pulmonary bleeding with hemoptysis or postural drainage table (if available) or ad- justable hospital bed emesis basin facial tissues suction equipment oral care equipment trash bag sterile specimen container mechanical ventilator supplemental oxygen (optional) ESSENTIAL STEPS Explain the procedure to the patient, provide privacy , and wash your hands. Gather the equipment at the patient's bedside. Set up and test the suction equipment. Auscultate the patient's lungs to determine baseline respiratory status. Position him as ordered. In generalized disease, drainage begins with lower lobes, continues withmiddle lobes, and ends with upper lobes. In localized disease, drainage begins with affected lobes and proceeds toother lobes to avoid spreading disease to uninvolved areas. Tell the patient to remain in each position for 10 to 15 minutes. CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY 345897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 345Perform percussion and vibration as ordered. (See Performing percussion and vibration .) After postural drainage, percussion, or vibration, tell him to cough to re- move loosened secretions. Tell the patient to inhale deeply through his nose, then exhale in threeshort huffs. Have him inhale deeply again and cough through a slightly open mouth.Three consecutive coughs are highly effective. An effective cough soundsdeep, low , and hollow; an ineffective cough sounds high-pitched. Have the patient perform exercises for about 1 minute, then rest for 2minutes. Gradually progress to a 10-minute exercise period four timesdaily . Provide oral hygiene because secretions may have a foul taste or staleodor. Auscultate the patient's lungs to evaluate effectiveness of therapy .346 PROCEDURES PERFORMING PERCUSSION AND VIBRATION Instruct the patient to breathe slowly and deeply using the diaphragm topromote relaxation. Percuss eachsegment with a cupped hand for 1to 2 minutes. Listen for a hollowsound on percussion to verify cor-rect performance of technique. To perform vibration, ask the patient to inhale deeply, then exhaleslowly. During exhalation firmlypress your hands against the chestwall. Tense the muscles of yourarms and shoulders in an isometriccontraction to send fine vibrationsthrough the chest wall. Do this dur-ing five exhalations over each chestsegment. 897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 346NURSING CONSIDERATIONS For effectiveness and safety , modify chest physiotherapy as needed. Chest physiotherapy isn't effective in the patient with status asthmaticus, lobar pneumonia, or acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis when hehas scant secretions and is being mechanically ventilated. Suction the patient who has an ineffective cough reflex. If he tires quickly during therapy , shorten the sessions because fatigueleads to shallow respirations and increased hypoxia. Maintain adequate hydration if he's receiving chest physiotherapy to pre-vent mucus dehydration and promote mobilization. Secretions drain best with the patient positioned so the bronchi are per-pendicular to the floor. Lower and middle lobe bronchi empty best with the patient in the head-down position; upper lobe bronchi, in the head-up hands mechanically dislodges thick,tenacious secretions from the bronchial walls. Vibration can be used with percussion or as an alternative to it in a pa-tient who's frail, in pain, or recovering from thoracic surgery or trauma. Avoid postural drainage immediately before or within 112hours after meals to avoid nausea, vomiting, and aspiration of food or vomitus. To prevent bronchospasm, adjunct treatments \u2014 intermittent positive-pressure breathing, aerosol, or nebulizer therapy \u2014 should precede chestphysiotherapy . To avoid injury , don't percuss over the spine, liver, kidneys, or spleen. Avoid percussion on bare skin or on a female patient's breasts. Percuss over soft clothing or place a thin towel over the chest wall. Remove jewelry before percussing. Monitor the patient for complications such as impaired respiratory excur-sion during postural drainage in head-down position; increased intracra-nial pressure in head-down rib fracture caused by vigorous per-cussion or vibration; pneumothorax caused by coughing. Record the date and time of chest physiotherapy . Note positions for secretion drainage and length of time for each. Document chest segments percussed or vibrated. Report color, amount, odor, and viscosity of secretions produced andpresence of blood. Record complications and nursing actions taken. Note the patient's tolerance of treatment. Explain coughing and deep-breathing exercises preoperatively so the pa-tient can practice them when he's pain-free and better able to concentrate. Postoperatively , splint the patient's incision using your hands, or teachhim to splint it himself to minimize pain during coughing.CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY 347897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 347Closed-wound drain management Promotes healing and prevents swelling by suctioning serosanguin eous fluid that accumulates at wound site Typically inserted during surgery in anticipation of substantial postoper-ative drainage Reduces the risk of infection and skin breakdown and frequency of dress-ing changes by removing postoperative fluid Hemovac and Jackson-Pratt closed drainage systems most commonlyused; consisting of perforated tubing connected to a portable vacuum unit The distal end of the tubing lying inside the wound and usually exitingthe body from a site other than the primary suture line to preserve in-tegrity of the surgical wound Drain usually sutured to the skin; tubing exit site treated as an additionalsurgical wound For heavy drainage, a closed-wound drain possibly left in place for longerthan 1 week Drainage emptied and measured frequently to maintain maximum suc-tion and prevent strain on the suture line EQUIPMENT Graduated biohazard cylinder sterile laboratory container, if needed al- cohol pads gloves gown face shield trash bag sterile gauze pads antiseptic cleaning agent prepackaged povidone-iodine swabs label (op- tional) ESSENTIAL STEPS Check the physician's order and assess the patient's condition. Explain the procedure, provide privacy , and wash your hands. Unclip the vacuum unit from the patient's bed or gown. Using sterile technique, release the vacuum by removing the spout plugon the collection chamber. The container expands completely as it draws in air. Empty the unit's contents into a graduated biohazard cylinder, and notethe amount and appearance of drainage. If diagnostic tests will be performed on the specimen, pour the drainagedirectly into a sterile la boratory con tainer. Note the amount and appear- ance, label the specimen pad, and send to the laboratory .348 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 348Clean the unit's spout and plug with an alcohol pad using sterile tech- nique. To reestablish the vacuum that creates the drain's suction power, fullycompress the vacuum unit. Compress the unit with one hand to maintain the vacuum and replacethe spout plug. (See Using a closed-wound drainage system .) Check patency of equipment. Make sure tubing is free from twists, kinks, and leaks; the drainage sys-tem must be airtight to work properly . The vacuum unit should remain compressed when you release manualpressure.CLOSED-WOUND DRAIN MANAGEMENT 349 USING A CLOSED-WOUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM This system draws drainage from a wound site, such as the chest wall postmas- tectomy (shown below top) by means of a Y-tube. To empty the drainage,remove plug and empty into a graduated cylinder. To reestablish suction, com-press the drainage unit against a rm surface to expel air and, while holding itdown, replace the plug (as shown below left). The same principle is used for theJackson-Pratt bulb drain (shown below right). 897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 349If rapid reinflation occurs, indicating an air leak, recompress the unit and resecure the spout plug. Fasten the vacuum unit to the patient's gown below wound level to pro-mote drainage. To prevent dislodgment, don't apply tension on drainage tubing when fas-tening the unit. Remove and discard gloves and wash your hands. Check the sutures that secure the drain to the patient's skin. Look for signs of pulling or tearing and swelling or infection. Gently clean the sutures with sterile gauze pads soaked in an antisepticcleaning agent or with a povidone-iodine swab. Properly dispose of drainage, solutions, and trash bag, and clean or dis-pose of soiled equipment and supplies according to facility policy . NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Empty drain and measure contents once during each shift, more often ifdrainage is excessive. Removing excess drainage maintains maximum suction and avoidsstraining the drain's suture line. Empty and measure before the patient ambulates to prevent weight ofdrainage from pulling on the drain. ALERT Be careful not to mistake chest tubes for closed- wound drains because the vacuum of a chest tube should never be released. Occlusion of tubing by fibrin, clots, or other particles can reduce or ob-struct drainage. Record the date and time when you empty the drain. Describe appearance of the drain site. Note the presence of swelling or signs of infection. Document equipment malfunction and nursing action. Note the patient's tolerance of treatment. Record drainage color, consistency , type, and amount on the input andoutput sheet. If there's more than one closed-wound drain, number the drains andrecord the information above separately for each drainage site. Explain purpose of closed-wound drainage system. Explain importance of not pulling on drains and of having the drain emp-tied before ambulation. Explain how to empty the drains and provide site care if the patient is togo home before drains are removed.350 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM 350Gastric lavage DESCRIPTION Flushes the stomach and removes ingested substances through a tube (af- ter poisoning or drug overdose or before an endoscopic examination);used in central nervous system depression or inadequate gag reflex or toadminister a vasocontrictive drug to a patient with stomach bleeding be-fore endoscopic examination Can be continuous or intermittent; usually done in the emergency roomor intensive care unit by a physician, gastroenterologist, or nurse Contraindicated after ingestion of corrosive substances such as lye, petro-leum distillates, ammonia, alkalis, or mineral acids may perforate the already-compromised esophagus EQUIPMENT Lavage setup, consisting of two graduated containers for drainage, threepieces of large-lumen rubber tubing, Y -connector, and clamp or hemostat 2 to 3 L of normal saline solution, tap water, or appropriate antidote as or-dered Ewald tube or any large-lumen gastric tube, typically #36 #40 French I.V towel Y ankauer or tonsil-tip suc- tion device suction apparatus labeled specimen container laboratory request form norepinephrine basin of ice, if ordered patient restraints, charcoal tablets (optional) Preparation A prepackaged, syringe-type irrigation kit may be used for intermittentlavage. For poisoning or drug overdose, the continuous lavage setup isfaster and more effective for diluting and removing the harmful sub-stance. Connect one of the three pieces of large-lumen tubing to the irrigant con-tainer. (See Using wide-bore gastric tubes, page 352.) Insert the Y -connector stem in the other end of the tubing. Connect the remaining two pieces of tubing to the free ends of theY connect or. Place the unattached end of one of the tubes into one of the drainage containers. GASTRIC LAVAGE 351897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 351Clamp the tube leading to the irrigant. Suspend the entire setup from the I.V . pole, hanging the irrigant container at the highest level. If iced lavage is ordered, chill the ordered irrigant in a basin of ice. Lubricate the end of the lavage tube with water-soluble lubricant or anes-thetic ointment.352 PROCEDURES USING WIDE-BORE GASTRIC TUBES To deliver a large volume of fluid rapidly through a gastric tube (for such con- ditions as profuse gastric bleeding or poisoning), a wide-bore gastric tubeworks best. Typically inserted orally, the tube remains in place long enough tocomplete the lavage and evacuate stomach contents. Ewald tube In an emergency, using theEwald tube\u2014a single-lumentube with several openings atthe distal amounts of gas-tric contents quickly. Levacuator tube The Levacuator tube has twolumens. Use the larger lumenfor evacuating gastric contents;the smaller, for instilling an irri-gant. Edlich tube The Edlich tube is a single-lumen tube that has four open-ings near the closed distal tip. Afunnel or syringe may be con-nected end. Ewald tube, the Edlich tubelets you quanti-ties gastric contents quickly. 897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 352ESSENTIAL STEPS Provide privacy . Wash your hands and put on gloves and a face shield. Place the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. The physician inserts the lavage tube orally and advances it slowly; force- ful insertion may injure tissues. Tube placement is checked by aspiratingfor stomach contents and checking for pH of 5.0 or less on test strip. Correct tube placement is essential; accidental misplacement in the lungsfollowed by lavage can be fatal. ALERT The patient may vomit when the lavage tube reaches the posterior pharynx; be prepared to suction the airway im- mediately. After securing the tube with tape and making sure the irrigant inflowtube on the lavage setup is clamped, connect the unattached end of the ir-rigant inflow tube to the lavage tube. Allow stomach contents to empty into the drainage container before in-stilling irrigant. This confirms proper tube placement and decreases riskof overfilling the stomach with irrigant and inducing vomiting. If using a syringe irrigation set, aspirate stomach contents with a 50-mlbulb or catheter-tip syringe before instilling irrigant. After you confirm proper tube placement, begin gastric lavage by instill-ing 100 to 300 ml of irrigant to assess the patient's tolerance and pre-vent vomiting. If using a syringe, instill about 50 ml of solution at a time until you've in-stilled between 100 and 300 ml. Clamp the inflow tube and unclamp theoutflow tube to allow irrigant to flow out. If using the syringe irrigation kit, aspirate the irrigant with the syringeand empty into a calibrated container. Measure outflow to ensure it atleast equals the amount of irrigant instilled. This prevents stomach dis-tention and vomiting. If the drainage amount is significantly less than instilled amount, reposi-tion the tube until sufficient solution flows out. Gently massage the ab-domen over the stomach to promote outflow . Repeat the inflow-outflow cycle until returned fluids appear clear, signal-ing that the stomach no longer contains harmful substances or bleedinghas stopped. Assess vital signs, urine output, and level of consciousness (LOC) every15 minutes. Notify the physician of changes. If ordered, remove the lavage tube.GASTRIC LAVAGE 353897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 353NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Explain the procedure to the patient. To control GI bleeding, the physician may order continuous stomach irri- gation with a vasoconstrictor. There are two ways to do this: - The drug is delivered directly to the liver via the portal septum, thus preventing systemic circulation, which could cause hypertension. - The outflow tube is clamped for a prescribed period after instilling the irrigant and vasoconstrictor and before withdrawing them. This allowsthe mucosa time to absorb the drug. Never leave a patient alone during gastric lavage. Watch for changes inLOC and monitor vital signs frequently; the vagal response to intubationcan depress the patient's heart rate. If you need to restrain the patient, secure restraints on one side of the bedor stretcher so you can free them quickly . Keep tracheal suctioning equipment nearby; watch closely for airway ob-struction caused by vomiting or excess oral secretions. Suction the oral cavity often to ensure an open airway and prevent aspira-tion. If the patient doesn't have an adequate gag reflex, he may need an endo-tracheal tube before the procedure. When aspirating the stomach for ingested poisons or drugs (a rare proce-dure), save the contents in a labeled container for laboratory analysis. If ordered, after lavage to remove poisons or drugs, mix charcoal tabletswith the irrigant and administer the mixture through the tube. When lavage is performed to stop bleeding, keep precise intake and out-put records to determine amount of bleeding. When large volumes of flu-id are instilled and withdrawn, serum electrolyte and arterial blood gaslevels may be measured during or after lavage. Monitor for complications, such as vomiting and aspiration, brady -arrhythmias, and cardiac arrhythmias triggered by body temperaturedropping after iced lavage. Record the date and time of lavage. Note the size and type of nasogastric tube used. Document volume and type of irrigant. Record the amount of drained gastric contents. Record information on intake and output record sheet. Note the color and consistency of drainage. Keep precise records of the patient's vital signs and LOC. Document drugs instilled through the tube. Note the time the tube was removed. Record the patient's tolerance of the procedure.354 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 354Gastrostomy feeding button care DESCRIPTION An alternative feeding device for an ambulatory patient receiving long- term enteral feedings Approved for 6-month implantation and can replace gastrostomy tubes Inserted into an established stoma (takes less than 15 minutes) and liesalmost flush with skin; only the top of safety plug visible Advantages over ordinary feeding tubes: cosmetic appeal, ease of mainte-nance, reduced skin irritation and breakdown, and less chance of beingdislodged or migrating One-way antireflux valve inside a mushroom dome that prevents leakageof gastric contents; usually replaced after 3 to 4 months, typically be-cause the antireflux valve wears out Contraindicated in intestinal obstruction that prohibits use of the bowel;diffuse peritonitis; intractable vomiting; paralytic ileus; severe diarrheathat makes metabolic cautiously in severe pancreatitis; enterocutaneous fistulae;gastrointestinal ischemia EQUIPMENT Gastrostomy feeding button of correct size (all three sizes, if correct one isn't known) obturator water-soluble lubricant gloves feeding acces- sories, including adapter, feeding catheter, food syringe or bag, and formula catheter clamp cleaning equipment, including water, a syringe, cotton- tipped applicator, pipe cleaner, and mild soap or povidone-iodine solution I.V . pole, pump to provide continuous infusion over several hours (optional) ESSENTIAL STEPS Explain the insertion, reinsertion, and feeding procedure to the patient.

ALERT To avoid further spinal cord injury, don't put the pa- tient's head on a pillow before applying the halo. Elevate the bed so the physician has access to the front and back of thehalo unit. Stand at the head of the bed and see if the patient's chin lines up with hismidsternum, indicating proper alignment. If ordered, support the patient's head in your hands and rotate the neckinto alignment without flexing or extending it. Assisting with halo application Explain the procedure to the patient, wash your hands, and provide priva-cy . Have an assisting nurse hold the patient's head and neck stable while thephysician removes the cervical collar or sandbags. Maintain support untilthe halo is secure \u2014 while you assist with pin insertion. The physician measures the patient's head with a tape measure and refersto the halo ring conversion chart to determine correct ring size. The ring should clear the head by 58/H11033(1.6 cm) and fit 12/H11033(1.3 cm) above the bridge of the nose. The physician selects four pin sites: 12/H11033above the lateral one-third of each eyebrow and 12/H11033above the top of each ear in the occipital area.360 PROCEDURES COMPARING HALO-VEST TRACTION DEVICES (continued) /H18546Traction is produced by four pins that com-press the skull. /H18546Flexion and extensionare obtained by adjust-ing 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 360He also takes into account the degree and type of correction needed to provide proper cervical alignment. Trim and shave hair at the pin sites to facilitate subsequent care and helpprevent infection, and put on gloves. Use 4/H11033 /H11003 4/H11033gauze pads soaked in povidone-iodine solution to clean sites. Open the halo-vest unit using sterile technique to avoid contamination. The physician puts on sterile gloves and removes the halo and Allenwrench. He places the halo over the patient's head and inserts the four positioningpins to hold the halo in place temporarily . Help the physician prepare anesthetic. Clean the injection port of themultidose vial of lidocaine with an alcohol pad. Invert the vial so thephysician can insert a 25G needle attached to the 3-ml syringe and with-draw the anesthetic. The physician injects the anesthetic at the four pin sites; he may changeneedles on the syringe after each injection. The physician removes four of the five skull pins from the sterile setupand firmly screws in each pin at a 90-degree angle to the skull. When the pins are in place, he removes the positioning pins. He tightens the skull pins with the torque screwdriver. Applying the vest After the physician measures the patient's chest and abdomen, he selectsan appropriate-sized vest. Place sheepskin liners inside the front and back of the vest for comfortand to help prevent pressure ulcers. Help the physician to carefully raise the patient while another nurse sup-ports the patient's head and neck; slide the back of the vest under the pa-tient and gently lay him down. The physician fastens the front of the vest on the patient's chest using Vel-cro straps and attaches the metal bars to the halo and vest. He tightenseach bolt in turn, avoiding tightening completely , which causes malad-justed tension. ALERT When halo-vest traction is in place, X-rays should be taken to check depth of skull pins and verify proper align- ment. Caring for the patient Take routine and neurologic vital signs at least every 2 hours for 24hours, then every 4 hours until stable.HALO-VEST TRACTION 361897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 361ALERT Notify the physician immediately of any loss of mo- tor function or decreased sensation from baseline, which could indicate spinal cord trauma. Put on gloves and clean the pin sites every 4 hours with cotton-tipped ap- plicators dipped in cleaning solution. Rinse the sites with sterile water or normal saline solution to remove ex-cess cleaning solution. Clean pin sites with povidone-iodine or other ordered solution to preventinfection and remove debris that might block drainage and cause abscess-es. Watch for signs of infection \u2014 a loose pin, swelling or redness, purulentdrainage, pain at the site \u2014 and notify physician if signs develop. The physician retightens the skull pins with the torque screwdriver 24and 48 hours after the halo is applied. If the patient complains of headache after the pins are tightened, obtainan order for an analgesic. ALERT If pain occurs with jaw movement, notify the physi- cian; this may indicate that pins have slipped onto the thin temporal plate. Examine the halo-vest every shift to ensure everything is secure and thepatient's head is centered. If the vest fits correctly , you should be able to insert one or two fingersunder the jacket at the shoulder and chest when the patient is supine. Wash the patient's chest and back daily . Place him on his back, looseningthe bottom Velcro straps so you can get to the chest and back. Turn the patient on his side \u2014 less than 45 degrees \u2014 to wash his back.Close the vest. ALERT Don't put stress on the apparatus, which could knock it out of alignment and lead to subluxation of the cer- vical spine. Check for tender areas or pressure spots that may develop into ulcers. If necessary , use a hair dryer to dry damp sheepskin; moisture predispos-es the skin to pressure ulcer formation. Dust the skin with medicated powder or cornstarch to prevent itching. Ifitching persists, check to see if the patient is allergic to sheepskin or ifany drug he's taking might cause skin rash. Change the vest lining as necessary , per facility policy . NURSING CONSIDERATIONS ALERT Keep two wrenches available. They may be taped to the halo-vest on the chest area. If cardiac arrest occurs, you'll362 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 362need them to remove the distal anterior bolts. Pull the two upright bars outward, unfasten the straps, and remove the front of the vest.Use the back of the vest as a board for cardiopulmonary resuscita-tion (CPR); some vests have a hinged front. To prevent subluxatingthe cervical injury, start CPR with the jaw-thrust maneuver toavoid hyperextending the neck. Pull his mandible forward, whilemaintaining proper head and neck alignment. This pulls the tongueforward to open the airway. ALERT Always be aware of what type of vest your patient is wearing so that in an emergency, CPR can be performed quickly and effectively. ALERT Never lift the patient up by the vertical bars. This could strain or tear the skin at the pin sites or misalign the traction. To prevent falls, walk with the ambulatory patient. He may have troubleseeing objects at or near his feet, and the weight of the halo-vest unit(about 10 lb [4.5 kg]) may throw him off balance. If he's in a wheelchair, lower the leg rests to prevent the chair from tip-ping backward. The vest limits chest expansion; routinely assess pulmonary function, es-pecially in a patient with pulmonary disease. Manipulating the patient's neck during application of halo-vest tractionmay cause subluxation of the spinal cord or push a bone fragment intothe spinal cord, possibly causing paralysis below the break. Inaccurate skull pin positioning can result in puncturing the skull anddura mater, causing loss of cerebrospinal fluid and central nervous sys-tem infection. Nonsterile technique during application or inadequate pin-site care canlead to infection at pin sites. Record the date and time halo-vest traction was applied. Note the length of the procedure and the patient's response. After application, record routine and neurologic vital signs. Document pin-site care and note signs of infection. Teach the patient about pin-site care and shampooing and hair care. Teach the patient to turn slowly and incrementally to avoid losing his bal-ance. Remind the patient to avoid bending forward; the extra weight of the ap-paratus may cause him to fall. Teach him to bend at the knees, not thewaist.HALO-VEST TRACTION 363897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 363COLLABORATION Have a physical therapist teach the patient how to use assistive devices to extend his reach and help him put on socks and shoes. Suggest to the patient that he wear large shirts that button in front to ac- commodate the halo-vest. Knee extension therapy DESCRIPTION Used to treat patients with joint stiffness and limited range of motion(ROM) from fractures, dislocations, ligament and tendon repairs, jointarthroplasty , burns, total knee replacement, hemophilia, spinal cord in-juries, rheumatoid arthritis, tendon release, cerebral palsy , multiple scle-rosis, and other traumatic and nontraumatic disorders Involves application of low-load, prolonged-duration stretching force toknee joint Restores functional ROM to limbs stiffened by immobility and possiblycontractures or adhesions and helps the patient regain ROM by applyingdynamic stress continuously while he's sleeping or resting Provides support to upper and lower limbs by struts fitted with tensionrods that apply firm force to coax muscles and connective tissues tostretch Contraindicated in unhealed or unstable fracture; acutethrombophlebitis; severe arthritic joint inflammation; recent trauma withpossible hidden fractures or internal injuries May be used cautiously in patients with thrombophlebitis, osteoporosis,spasticity , edema, gross ligament instability , and circulatory impairment EQUIPMENT Knee extension system knee extension system and tension adjustment tool pillow , adhesive tape, marking pen (optional) ESSENTIAL STEPS Wash your hands. Explain the procedure to the patient. Hold the system so that the adjustment scale is visible on one of thestruts. To read the tension, look at the number on the tension scale lined up withthe flat top of the tension spacer inside the strut. The tension spacer is vis-ible in the window next to the tension scale. 364 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 364If the top of the tension spacer isn't lined up with the \"0\" on the tension scale with each strut, adjust the tension screw in the top of each spacerwith the tension adjustment tool until they're lined up. Adjusting strut length To shorten or lengthen the distal strut, first remove the 18/H11033screw or screws located near the cam, using the tension adjustment tool. Slide the smaller tube in or out of the larger tube to obtain correct strutlength. Line up the screw holes, replace and tighten the screw or screws. Repeat this adjustment on each strut as necessary . Open the front-of-thigh, shin, and over-the-knee straps, pull them out ofthe D-wire that's attached to the strut, and fold the strap's Velcro closureonto itself. Loosen the back-of-thigh and calf cuffs to widen the splint to accommo-date the patient's calf and thigh dimensions. Place the system under his leg. Position the distal struts, which are the larger tubes with the tension ad-justers, beneath the calf. Pull the proximal and distal struts up with both hands until the struts areeven with the midlines of the sides of the thigh and calf. Align the cams across the knee axis, making sure they're in a straightline. With the cams aligned, close the over-the-knee straps, making sure thatyou can slide one finger under the upper and lower edges of each strap. Close the front-of-thigh cuffs and shin cuffs. Adjust and close the back-of-thigh cuffs and calf cuffs. If necessary , adjust strut length so that cuffs are positioned on the bulk ofthe muscle mass at midthigh and midcalf. ALERT Elderly patients are at increased risk of skin break- down; assess for pressure ulcer development while using a knee extension system. Setting splint tension Insert the tension adjustment tool into the open end of the lower strut. Increase the tension by turning the tool clockwise; reduce the tension byturning it counterclockwise. Make sure the cams are aligned across the knee axis, struts are placed onthe medial and lateral axes of the leg, and cuffs are evenly contouredacross the leg. Mark the backs of both cuffs to keep the patient from changing the fitting. KNEE EXTENSION THERAPY 365897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 365Mark a reference line with a pen on the over-the-knee straps and the front-of-thigh and shin cuffs so the patient knows where to close them. Make sure the patient practices applying and removing the splint. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS The system is custom-fitted and tension is adjusted to the patient's toler-ance; worn at the optimal tolerable tension for the longest time (8 to 10hours), preferably at night. When applied early in treatment program, duration of rehabilitation isgreatly reduced. Monitor the patient for complications such as pain and stiffness. Note alterations in skin integrity . Note the date and time of the procedure. Record tension ordered by physician, length of time the patient can toler-ate tension, increases or decreases in tension, and reasons for tensionchanges. Document the patient's tolerance of the procedure. Record patient teaching. Explain the reasons for knee extension therapy . Tell the patient how to apply the equipment. Advise the patient about the length of time for each session. Explain to the patient how to adjust tension settings. Inform the patient about signs and symptoms to report. Nasal packing DESCRIPTION Typically performed with a nurse assisting a physician Performed when routine therapeutic measures fail to control epistaxis Two main types of epistaxis: anterior bleeding and posterior bleeding Contraindicated in nasal trauma that might involve internal structure in-jury , coagulopathy , potential cerebrospinal fluid leak EQUIPMENT For anterior and posterior packing Gowns goggles masks sterile gloves emesis basin facial tissue patient drape nasal speculum and directed illumina- tion nasal endoscope with sterile suction-connecting tubing and sterile nasal aspirator tip sterile bowl and sterile normal saline solution for flushing sterile towels sterile cotton-366 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page solution sedative or saline solution hypoal- lergenic tape antibiotic ointment petroleum jelly For anterior packing Two packages of 112/H11033(4-cm) petroleum strip gauze 36/H11033 to 48/H11033 (0.9 to 1.2 m) two nasal tampons anterior nasal packing sponge For posterior packing Posterior nasal packing sponge with or without airway or two #14 or #16 French catheters with 30-cc balloon or two single- or double-chamber nasalballoon catheters bayonet forceps marking pen For assessment and bedside use Tongue blades flashlight long hemostats or sponge forceps 60-ml sy- ringe for deflating balloons (if applicable) ESSENTIAL STEPS Wash your hands. Assemble all equipment at the patient's bedside. Plug in and test the suction apparatus, and connect the tubing from thecollection bottle to the suction source. Create a sterile field at the bedside and, using sterile technique, place allsterile equipment on the sterile field. If the physician will inject a local anesthetic rather than spray , place the22G 1 12/H11033needle attached to the 10-ml syringe on the sterile field. When the physician readies the syringe, clean the stopper and hold thevial so he can withdraw the anesthetic. Open the packages containing the sterile suction-connecting tubing andaspirating tip, and place them on the sterile field. Fill the sterile bowl with normal saline solution to flush the suction tub-ing. Thoroughly lubricate the anterior or posterior packing with antibioticointment if ordered. Test a balloon for leaks by inflating the catheter with normal saline solu-tion. Remove the solution before insertion. W ear a gown, gloves, and goggles during insertion of packing to preventcontamination. Check vital signs, and observe for hypotension with postural NASAL PACKING 367897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 367ALERT Hypotension in a patient with a nosebleed suggests significant blood loss. Monitor airway patency . ALERT A patient with an uncontrolled nosebleed is at risk for aspirating or vomiting swallowed blood. Explain the procedure to the patient and offer reassurance. If ordered, give a sedative or analgesic to reduce anxiety and pain and de- crease sympathetic stimulation, which can exacerbate a nosebleed. Help the patient sit with his head tilted forward. Turn on the suction apparatus and attach the connecting tubing. To inspect the nasal cavity , the physician will use a nasal speculum andan external light source or a fiber-optic nasal endoscope. To remove collected blood and help visualize the bleeding vessel, thephysician will use suction or cotton-tipped applicators. The nose may be treated early with a topical vasoconstrictor such asphenylephrine to slow bleeding and aid visualization. ALERT Heavy posterior bleeding that's difficult to treat is most common in elderly patients due to hypertension or co- agulopathy. For anterior nasal packing Help the physician apply a topical vasoconstrictor or use chemicalcautery (silver nitrate stick) to control bleeding. To enhance the vasoconstrictor's action, apply manual pressure to thenose for about 10 minutes. If bleeding persists, you may help insert an absorbable hemostatic nasaltampon directly on the bleeding site. If these methods fail, prepare to assist with electrocautery or insertion ofpetroleum strip gauze or a packing sponge. While the anterior pack is in place, apply petroleum jelly to the patient'slips and nostrils to prevent drying and cracking. For posterior nasal packing Wash your hands and put on sterile gloves. Lubricate the soft catheters to ease insertion if using a balloon device. Instruct the patient to open his mouth and breathe normally . Help the physician insert the packing as directed. Help the patient assume a position with his head elevated 45 to 90 de-grees. Assess him for airway obstruction or respiratory changes. Monitor vital signs regularly . 368 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 368NURSING CONSIDERATIONS ALERT Nasal packing is very uncomfortable and promotes hypoxia and hypoventilation, which can be fatal if the pa- tient isn't properly monitored. If mucosal oozing persists, apply a moustache dressing. Change the pad when soiled. Test the patient's call bell to ensure he can summon help. ALERT Keep emergency equipment at the patient's bedside to speed packing removal if it becomes displaced and oc- cludes the airway. Obtain a patient history to determine the underlying cause of nosebleed. Laboratory work may include complete blood count and coagulation pro- file. A blood transfusion may be necessary . Arterial blood gas analysis may be ordered. Supplemental humidified oxygen with a face mask may be needed. Provide thorough mouth care often. The patient should be on modified bed rest. Give nonaspirin analgesics, decongestants, sedatives, and antibiotics. Nasal packing is usually removed in 2 to 5 days. Monitor the patient for complications such as blood loss; infections suchas migration of packing. Note the type of pack used to ensure its removal at the appropriate time. Record estimated blood loss and all fluids given. Document vital signs. Note the response to sedation or position changes. Record laboratory results. Document drugs given, including topical agents. Document discharge instructions and clinical follow-up plans. After an anterior pack is removed, tell the patient to avoid picking at, in-serting an object into, or blowing his nose forcefully for 48 hours or as or-dered. Tell the patient to expect reduced smell and taste ability . Make sure the patient has a working smoke detector at home. Advise the patient to eat soft foods because of eating and swallowing im-pairment. Instruct the patient to drink fluids or use artificial saliva to cope with drymouth. NASAL PACKING 369897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 369Teach the patient how to prevent nosebleeds and have him seek medical help if he can't stop bleeding. Nasogastric tube insertion and removal DESCRIPTION Usually inserted to decompress the stomach Can prevent vomiting after major surgery Used to assess and treat upper GI bleeding, collect gastric contents foranalysis, perform gastric lavage, aspirate gastric secretions, and givedrugs and nutrients Requires close observation of the patient and verification of proper place-ment Must be inserted with care in pregnant patients and those with increasedrisk of complications Most common tubes: Levin tube and Salem sump tube Contraindicated in coma, facial or basilar skull fracture with cribriformplate injury , and hypothermia EQUIPMENT For inserting a nasogastric tube Tube (usually #12, #14, #16, or #18 French for a normal adult) towel or linen-saver pad facial tissues emesis basin penlight 1/H11033or 2/H11033hypoal- lergenic tape gloves water-soluble lubricant cup or glass of water with straw pH test strip tongue blade catheter-tip or bulb syringe or irriga- tion set safety pin ordered suction equipment For removing a nasogastric tube Stethoscope gloves catheter-tip syringe normal saline solution towel or linen-saver pad adhesive remover clamp (optional) ESSENTIAL STEPS Provide privacy . Wash your hands and put on gloves. Identify the proper tube. Inspect the NG tube for defects. Check the tube's patency by flushing it with water. Inserting a nasogastric tube Explain the procedure to the patient. Emphasize that swallowing will ease the tube's advancement.370 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 370Agree on a signal the patient can use if he wants you to stop briefly dur- ing the procedure. Put the patient in high Fowler's position, unless contraindicated. Drape the towel or linen-saver pad over his chest. Have him blow his nose to clear his nostrils. Place the facial tissues and emesis basin within reach. Help him face forward with his neck in a neutral position. Hold the end of the tube at the tip of his nose, then extend the tube to hisearlobe and down to the xiphoid process in order to determine how longthe NG tube must be to reach the stomach. Mark this distance on the tubing with tape. It may be necessary to add 2 /H11033 (5 cm) for tall individuals to ensure entry into the stomach. Use a penlight and inspect for a deviated septum or other abnormalitiesin order to determine which nostril will allow easier access. Ask if he ever had nasal surgery or a nasal injury , and assess airflow inboth nostrils. Lubricate the first 3 /H11033(7.6 cm) of the tube with a water-soluble gel. Instruct the patient to hold his head straight and upright. Grasp the tube with the end pointing downward, curve it if necessary , andcarefully insert it into the more patent nostril. Aim the tube downward and toward the ear closer to the chosen nostril. Advance it slowly to avoid pressure on the turbinates and resultant painand bleeding. When the tube reaches the nasopharynx, you'll feel resis-tance. Instruct the patient to lower his head slightly to close the trachea andopen the esophagus. Rotate the tube 180 degrees toward the opposite nostril. Unless contraindicated, offer the patient a cup or glass of water with astraw . Direct him to sip and swallow as you slowly advance the tube. Watch for respiratory distress as you advance the tube. ALERT If the patient is coughing, choking, or otherwise showing signs of respiratory distress, withdraw the tube un- til symptoms subside. Stop advancing the tube when the tape mark reaches the patient's nostril. Ensuring proper tube placement Use a tongue blade and penlight to examine the patient's mouth andthroat for signs of a coiled section of tubing. Attach a catheter-tip or bulb syringe and try to aspirate stomach contents. Examine the aspirate and place a small amount on the pH test strip.NASOGASTRIC TUBE INSERTION AND REMOVAL 371897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 371Correct gastric placement is likely if the aspirate has a typical gastric fluid appearance and the pH is 5.0 or less. ALERT When confirming tube placement, never place the tube's end in a container of water. If the tube is in the tra- chea, the patient may aspirate water. Bubbles don't confirm properplacement as the tube may be coiled in the trachea or the esopha-gus. Advance the tube 1/H11033 to 2/H11033 (2.5 to 5 cm) if you still can't aspirate stomach contents. Inject 10 cc of air into the tube. Obtain X-ray verification if tests don't confirm proper tube placement. Secure the NG tube to the patient's nose with hypoallergenic tape or witha prepackaged product that secures and cushions the tube at the nose. Tie a slipknot around the tube with a rubber band; secure the rubberband to the patient's gown with a safety pin. Fasten the tape tab to the patient's gown. Attach the tube to suction equipment, if ordered, and set the designatedsuction pressure. Provide frequent nose and mouth care while the tube is in place. Removing a nasogastric tube Explain the procedure to the patient. Assess bowel function by auscultating for peristalsis or flatus. Help the patient into semi-Fowler's position. Wash your hands and put on gloves. Drape a towel or linen-saver pad across his chest. Flush the tube with 10 ml of normal saline solution using a catheter-tipsyringe to ensure that the tube doesn't contain stomach contents. Untape the tube from the patient's nose and unpin it from his gown. Clamp the tube by folding it in your hand. Ask the patient to hold his breath to close the epiglottis. Withdraw the tube slowly . Cover and discard the tube immediately . Assist the patient with thorough mouth and skin care. Monitor for signs of GI dysfunction for the next 48 hours. GI dysfunction may necessitate reinsertion of the tube. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Pass the tube orally if the patient has a deviated septum or other nasalcondition that prevents nasal insertion. Sliding the tube over the tongue,proceed as you would for nasal insertion. When using the oral route, coil the end of the tube around your hand. 372 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 372If your patient is unconscious, tilt the chin toward his chest to close the trachea. Advance the tube between respirations. While advancing the tube, watch for signs that it entered the trachea, suchas choking or breathing difficulties in a conscious patient and cyanosis inan unconscious patient or a patient without a cough reflex. If these signsoccur, remove the tube immediately . Allow the patient time to rest; try to reinsert the tube. After tube placement, vomiting suggests tubal obstruction or incorrectposition. Assess immediately to determine the cause. Monitor the patient for complications, such as skin erosion at the nostril,sinusitis, esophagitis, esophagotracheal fistula, gastric ulceration, pul-monary and oral infection, electrolyte imbalances, and dehydration. Record the type and size of the NG tube. Note the date, time, and route of insertion and removal. Note the patient's tolerance of procedure. Document type, color, odor, consistency , and amount of gastric drainage. Record the patient's tolerance of procedure. Note the subsequent irrigation procedures and continuing problems afterirrigation. Note unusual events following NG removal, such as nausea, vomiting, ab-dominal distention, and food intolerance. Tell the patient what to expect during insertion. Explain signs and symptoms to report, as needed. Tell the patient to avoid food and drink for several hours after tube re-moval.

Assemble equipment at the patient's bedside. Open several packages of gauze pads, place them in the sterile cup oremesis basin, and pour the povidone-iodine solution over them. Open a commercially packaged kit (if available) using sterile technique. Fill the cup with antiseptic solution. Open the paper bag and place it away from the other equipment to avoidcontaminating the sterile field. Changing a dressing Put the patient on his back for a cystostomy tube or the side opposite thetube for a nephrostomy tube. Place the linen-saver pad under the patient to absorb drainage. Put on clean gloves. Carefully remove the tape around the tube. Remove wet or soiled dressings. Discard the tape and dressing in the paper bag. Remove the gloves and discard them in the bag. Put on sterile gloves. Pick up a saturated pad or dip a dry one into the cup of antiseptic solu-tion. To clean the wound, wipe only once with each pad or sponge, movingfrom the insertion site outward. Discard the used pad or sponge in the paper bag. To avoid contaminating your gloves, don't touch the bag. Pick up a sterile 4/H11033/H110034 /H11033drain dressing and place it around the tube. If necessary , overlap two drain dressings to provide maximum absorp-tion. Alternatively , depending on your facility's policy , apply a transpar-ent semipermeable dressing over the site and tubing to allow observationof the site. Secure the dressing with hypoallergenic tape. Tape the tube to the patient's lateral abdomen to prevent tension. Dispose of all equipment appropriately . Clean the patient as necessary . NEPHROSTOMY AND CYSTOSTOMY CARE 375897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 a tube Fill the 3-ml syringe with the normal saline solution. Clean the junction of the nephrostomy tube and drainage tube with the alcohol pad or povidone-iodine pad, and disconnect the tubes. Insert the syringe into the nephrostomy tube opening, and instill 2 to3 ml of normal saline solution into the tube. Slowly aspirate the solution back into the syringe. Never pull back on the plunger. If the solution doesn't return, remove the syringe from the tube and reat-tach it to the drainage tubing to allow the solution to drain by gravity . Dispose of all equipment appropriately . NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Change dressings once per day or more often as needed. ALERT Never irrigate a nephrostomy tube with more than 5 ml of solution because the capacity of the renal pelvis is usually between 4 and 8 ml. (The purpose of irrigation is to keepthe tube patent, not to lavage the renal pelvis.) Irrigate a cystostomy tube as you would an indwelling urinary catheter. Perform irrigation to avoid damaging suture lines. Curve a cystostomy tube to prevent kinks; kinks are likely if the patientlies on the insertion site. Check a nephrostomy tube frequently for kinks or obstructions. Suspect an obstruction when the amount of urine in the drainage bag de-creases or the amount of urine around the insertion site increases. If a blood clot or mucus plug obstructs a nephrostomy or cystostomytube, try milking the tube to its patency . Check cystostomy hourly for postoperative urologic patients. To check tube patency , note the amount of urine in the drainage bag andcheck the patient's bladder for distention. Keep the drainage bag below the level of the kidney at all times. Notify the physician immediately if the tube becomes dislodged. Cover the site with a sterile dressing. While clamping the nephrostomy tube, assess the patient for flank painand fever, and monitor urine output. Monitor the patient for complications such as infection, sepsis, hemor-rhage, nephron damage, colonic perforation, and perinephric abscess. Record the color and amount of drainage. Note the amount and type of irrigant used. Document whether you obtained a complete return. Document condition of skin around site.376 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 376Document patient teaching. Explain how to clean the insertion site with soap and water, check for skin breakdown, and change dressing daily . Teach the patient how to change the leg bag or drainage bag. Explain how and when to wash the drainage bag. Encourage the patient to increase fluid intake to 3 qt (3 L) daily , if no con-traindications. Explain signs of infection and have the patient report them to his physi-cian. Refer the patient and family to appropriate community support sources. Pacemaker (permanent) insertion and care DESCRIPTION A self-contained heart pacing device implanted in a pocket beneath the pa-tient's skin, designed to operate 3 to 20 years Inserted in an operating room or cardiac catheterization la boratory Nursing responsibilities: monitoring electrocardiogram (ECG) and main-taining sterile technique Used in patients with myocardial infarction, persistent bradyarrhythmia,complete heart block or slow ventricular rates, Stokes-Adams syndrome,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and sick sinus syndrome A biventricular pacemaker possibly benefiting a patient with heart failure Functions in the demand mode, which allows the patient's heart to beaton its own but prevents it from falling below a preset level Pacing electrodes placed in the atria, ventricles, or in both chambers;most common pacing codes are VVI for single-chamber pacing and DDDfor dual-chamber pacing (see Understanding pacemaker codes, page 378) EQUIPMENT Sphygmomanometer stethoscope ECG monitor and strip-chart recorder sterile dressing tray povidone-iodine ointment shaving supplies sterile gauze dressing hypoallergenic tape sedatives alcohol pads emergency resuscitation equipment sterile gown and mask I.V . line for emergency medications (optional) ESSENTIAL STEPS Explain the procedure to the patient. Provide and review literature from the manufacturer or the AmericanHeart Association. PACEMAKER (PERMANENT) INSERTION AND CARE 377897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 377Emphasize that the pacemaker augments his natural heart rate. Obtain informed consent. Ask the patient if he's allergic to anesthetics or iodine. Preoperative care For pacemaker insertion Shave the patient's chest from the axilla to the midline and from the clav- icle to the nipple line on the side selected by the physician. Establish an I.V . line at a keep-vein-open rate. 378 PROCEDURES UNDERSTANDING PACEMAKER CODES A permanent pacemaker uses a three- or five-letter programming code. The first letter represents the chamber that's paced. The second represents the chamberthat's sensed. The third represents how the pulse generator responds. The fourthdenotes the pacemaker's programmability. The fifth denotes the pacemaker'sresponse to a tachyarrhythmia. First letter A = atrium V = ventricleD = dual (both chambers)O = not applicableSecond letter A = atriumV = ventricleD = dual (both chambers)O = not applicableThird letter I = inhibitedT = triggeredD = dual (inhibited and triggered) O = not applicable Fourth letter P = basic functions programmable M = multiprogrammable parameters C = communicating functions such as telemetry R = rate responsivenessO = noneFifth letter P = pacing abilityS = shockD = dual ability to shock and pace O = none Examples of two common programming codes DDDPace: Atrium and ventricleSense: Atrium and ventricleResponse: Inhibited and triggeredThis is a fully automatic, or universal, pacemakerVVIPace: VentricleSense: VentricleResponse: InhibitedThis is a demand pacemaker, inhibited897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 378Obtain baseline vital signs and a baseline ECG. Provide sedation, as ordered. In the operating room Put on a gown and a mask. Run a baseline rhythm strip. Check for adequate paper. In transvenous placement, the catheter is guided by a fluoroscope, passes through the cephalic or external jugular vein until it reaches the rightventricle. The catheter is attached to the pulse generator, inserted into the chestwall, and sutured closed. A small drainage tube outlet remains. Postoperative care Monitor the patient's ECG. Monitor the I.V . flow rate; the I.V . line is usually kept in place for 24 to48 hours postoperatively to allow for possible emergency treatment ofarrhythmias. Check the dressing for signs of bleeding and infection. Prophylactic antibiotics may be ordered for up to 7 days after implanta-tion. Change the dressing and apply povidone-iodine ointment at least onceevery 24 to 48 hours. If the dressing becomes soiled or the site is exposed to air, change thedressing immediately . Check vital signs and level of consciousness (LOC) every 15 minutes forthe first hour, every hour for the next 4 hours, every 4 hours for the next48 hours, and then once every shift. ALERT Confused, elderly patients with second-degree heart block won't show immediate improvement in LOC. ALERT Report to the physician signs and symptoms of a per- forated ventricle, with resultant hypotensionwith narrow pulse pressure, increased venous pressure, cyanosis,jugular vein distention, decreased urine output, restlessness, orcomplaints of fullness in the chest. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS A biventricular pacemaker has three leads instead of one or two; one leadis placed in the right atrium and the other two are placed in each of theventricles, improving pumping efficiency . Provide the patient with an identification card that lists the pacemakerPACEMAKER (PERMANENT) INSERTION AND CARE 379897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 379type and manufacturer, serial number, pacemaker rate setting, date im- planted, and physician's name. Watch for signs of pacemaker malfunction. Monitor the patient for complications such as infection; lead displace-ment; perforated ventricle; cardiac tamponade; and lead fracture and dis-connection. Record the type, serial number, and manufacturer of pacemaker. Document the pacing rate. Record the date of implantation. Note the physician's name. Document whether the pacemaker successfully treated the arrhythmias. Tell the patient to inform his physicians, dentist, and other health carepersonnel that he has a pacemaker. Advise the patient to use a cellular phone on the opposite side of his pace-maker. Caution the patient to move away from electrical equipment if he experi-ences light-headedness or dizziness. Moving away should restore normalpacemaker function. Teach the patient to clean his pacemaker site gently with soap and waterwhen he takes a shower or a bath. Tell him to leave the incision exposedto the air. Instruct the patient to inspect the skin around the incision. Advise himthat a slight bulge is normal, but to call the physician if he feels discom-fort or notices swelling, redness, discharge, or other problems. Teach the patient how to check his pulse for 1 minute on the side of hisneck, inside his elbow , or on the thumb side of his wrist. The pulse rateshould be the same as his pacemaker rate or faster. Instruct him to con-tact the physician if he thinks his heart is beating too fast or too slow . Advise the patient to take his medications, including those for pain, asprescribed. Advise the patient to notify the physician if he experiences signs of pace-maker failure, such as palpitations, a fast heart rate, a slow heart rate (5 to10 beats less than the pacemaker's setting), dizziness, fainting, shortnessof breath, swollen ankles or feet, anxiety , forgetfulness, or confusion. Postoperative care DESCRIPTION Begins when the patient arrives in the postanesthesia care unit (P ACU)and continues as he moves on to the short procedure unit, medical- surgical unit, or critical care area380 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 380To minimize postoperative complications by early detection and prompt treatment To treat pain, inadequate oxygenation, or adverse physiologic effects ofsudden movement Recovery time from general anesthesia varying with the patient's amountof body fat, overall condition, premedication regimen, and type, dosage,and duration of anesthesia; lasts longer than induction because anesthet-ic is retained in fat and muscle EQUIPMENT Thermometer watch with second hand stethoscope sphygmomanome- ter postoperative flowchart or documentation tool ESSENTIAL STEPS Assemble the necessary equipment at the patient's bedside. Obtain the patient's record from the P ACU nurse. Transfer the patient from the stretcher to the bed and position him prop-erly . Use caution when transferring patients with orthopedic surgery or skele-tal traction. Provide comfort and ensure safety (raise the bed's side rails). Assess level of consciousness, skin color, and mucous membranes. Monitor breathing rate, depth, and breath sounds. Administer oxygen and initiate oximetry . Monitor the patient's pulse rate. Make sure that preoperative and postoperative blood pressures are within20% of each other. Make sure the patient's body temperature is at least 95\u00b0 F (35\u00b0 C). If it'slower, use blankets or the Bair Hugger patient-warming system. Assess infusion sites for redness, pain, swelling, or drainage. If infiltrationoccurs, discontinue the I.V . and restart. Assess wound dressings. If soiled, note the characteristics of drainage andoutline the soiled area. Note the date and time of assessment on thedressing. If the drainage area enlarges, reinforce the dressing and alert the physi-cian. Note the presence and condition of drains and tubes. Note the color, type, odor, and amount of drainage and urine output. Make sure drains are properly connected and free from obstructions. For a vascular or orthopedic surgery , assess all extremities. Perform assess temperature, sensation,POSTOPERATIVE CARE 381897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 381movement, and presence and quality of pulses. Notify the physician of abnormalities. Be alert for signs of airway obstruction and hypoventilation. Assess for cardiovascular complications (arrhythmias or hypotension). Encourage coughing and deep-breathing exercises. (Exceptions: nasal,ophthalmic, or neurologic surgery .) Administer postoperative drugs. Assess gag reflex before offering fluids. Monitor the patient's intake and output. Assess for bowel sounds and flatus before offering food. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Monitor for fear, pain, anxiety , hypothermia, confusion, and immobility ,which can affect patient safety and recovery . Offer emotional support and refer for ongoing emotional support if indi-cated. Avoid talking about the patient in his presence because hearing returnsfirst. Cough and gag reflexes reappear and, if the patient can lift his head, he'susually able to breathe on his own. After spinal anesthesia, the patient should remain supine with the bed ad-justed between 0 and 20 degrees for at least 6 hours. Reassure him thatsensation and mobility will return to his legs. Monitor respiratory status for those using epidural analgesia infusion forpostoperative pain control. Monitor for nausea, vomiting, itching, or sensorimotor loss. Monitor the patient for complications such as arrhythmias, hypotension,hypovolemia, septicemia, septic shock, atelectasis, pneumonia, throm-bophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, retention, wound infection, distention, paralytic ileus, constipation, altered bodyimage, and postoperative psychosis. Record vital signs. Note the condition of dressings and drains and characteristics ofdrainage. Document interventions taken to alleviate pain and anxiety and the pa-tient's responses to them. Record complications and interventions taken. Teach the patient how to use the patient-controlled analgesia if one hasbeen ordered.382 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 382Preoperative care DESCRIPTION Begins when surgery is planned and ends with administration of anesthe- sia Includes an interview and assessment to collect baseline subjective andobjective data from the patient and family; diagnostic tests such as urinal-ysis, electrocardiogram, and chest radiography , preoperative teaching, se-curing informed consent from the patient, and physical preparation EQUIPMENT Thermometer sphygmomanometer stethoscope watch with second hand weight scale tape measure ESSENTIAL STEPS Assemble needed equipment at the patient's bedside or admission area. For same-day surgery , instruct the patient not to eat or drink for 8 hoursbefore surgery . Confirm arrival time and instruct him to leave valuables at home. Verify arrangements for postsurgery transportation. Obtain a health history , including previous medical or surgical proce-dures. Assess the patient's readiness in knowledge, perceptions, and expecta-tions. Assess psychosocial needs for occupational, financial, support systems,mental status, and cultural areas. Obtain a drug history of prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, supple-ments, and herbal preparations. Assess for known allergies to foods, drugs, and latex. Obtain height, weight, and vital signs. Identify risk factors including age, general health, drug use, mobility , nu-tritional status, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, lifestyle considera-tions, disorder's duration, location, and nature of the procedure. Explain preoperative procedures to reduce postoperative anxiety andpain, increase compliance, hasten recovery , and decrease length of stay . Explain sequence of events, holding area, surgical dress, equipment, inci-sion, dressings, and staples or sutures. Explain that minimal conversation will help the preoperative medicationtake effect.PREOPERATIVE CARE 383897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 sensations the pa- tient will experience. Discuss postoperative exercises such as deep breathing and coughing, ex-tremity exercises, and movement and ambulation to minimize respirato-ry and circulatory complications. Discuss surgery procedures including morning care, verifying a signed in-formed consent form, preoperative medications, preoperative checklist,and chart. (See Obtaining informed consent. ) Discuss preoperative interventions such as restricting food and fluids forabout 8 hours before surgery , enemas before abdominal or GI surgery ,and antibiotics for 2 or 3 days preoperatively to prevent con tamination ofthe peritoneal cavity by GI bacteria. Remove hairpins, nail polish, and jewelry . Note whether dentures, contactlenses, or prosthetic devices have been removed or left in place. Verifywith the patient that the correct surgical site has been marked. Before transport to the surgical area, ensure that the patient's hospitalgown and identification band are in place and that his vital signs havebeen recorded. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Administer preoperative medications on time. Make sure the patient has had no food or drink preoperatively . Raise the bed's side rails after giving preoperative medications.384 PROCEDURES OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT Informed consent means that the patient has consented to a procedure after receiving a full explanation of the procedure, its risks and complications, and therisk if the procedure isn't performed at this time. Although obtaining informedconsent is the physician's responsibility, the nurse is responsible for verifyingthat this step has been taken. You may be asked to witness the patient's signature. However, if you didn't hear the physician's explanation to the patient, you must sign that you're wit-nessing the patient's signature only. Consent forms must be signed before the patient receives preoperative med- ication because forms signed after sedatives are given are legally invalid. Adultsand emancipated minors can sign their own consent forms. A consent form forchildren or adults with impaired mental status must be signed by a parent orguardian.897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 384If present, direct the patient's family to the appropriate waiting area and offer support as needed. The chart and the surgical checklist must accompany the patient tosurgery . Document using preoperative checklist used by your facility . Note all nursing care measures. Document preoperative drugs. Record the results of diagnostic tests. Note the time the patient is transferred to the surgical area. Teach the patient coughing and deep-breathing exercises before surgery ,as appropriate. Inform the patient that he may have surgical dressings, surgical drains,an I.V . line, and a urinary catheter after the surgery . Advise the patient that he'll feel discomfort but that pain medication willbe available and he should ask for it when he feels pain. Tell the patient that he'll be in an after-surgery recovery area for at least 1hour after surgery to monitor his vital signs. Pressure ulcer care DESCRIPTION Involves relieving pressure, restoring circulation, promoting adequate nu-trition, and resolving or managing related disorders May require special pressure-reducing devices such as beds, mattresses,mattress overlays, and chair cushions Other measures: decreasing risk factors, use of topical treatments, woundcleansing, debridement, and use of dressings to support moist woundhealing Uses standard precaution guidelines of the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention Effectiveness and duration of treatment dependent on the pressure ulcer'scharacteristics EQUIPMENT Hypoallergenic tape or elastic netting overbed table piston-type irrigat- ing system two pairs of gloves normal saline solution, as ordered ster- ile 4/H11033/H11003 4/H11033gauze pads sterile cotton swabs selected topical dressing linen-saver pads impervious plastic trash bag disposable wound-measur- ing devicePRESSURE ULCER CARE 385897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 385ESSENTIAL STEPS Wash your hands. Review principles of standard precautions. Provide privacy . Assemble equipment at the patient's bedside. Cut tape into strips. Loosen lids on cleaning solutions and drugs. Loosen existing dressing edges and tapes. Put on gloves. Attach an impervious plastic trash bag to the overbed table. Cleaning the pressure ulcer Explain the procedure to allay fear and promote cooperation. Position the patient for comfort and easy access to site. Cover bed linens with a linen-saver pad to prevent soiling. Open the normal saline solution container and the piston syringe. Pour solution carefully into a clean or sterile irrigation container. Put the piston syringe into the opening of the irrigation container. Open the packages of supplies. Put on gloves before removing old dressing and exposing the pressure ulcer. Discard the soiled dressing in the impervious plastic trash bag. Inspect the wound. Note the color, amount, and odor of drainage ornecrotic debris. Measure the wound perimeter with a disposable wound-measuring device. Apply full force of the piston syringe to irrigate the ulcer, remove necroticdebris, and decrease bacteria in the wound. ALERT The benefits of cleaning the wound need to be weighed against the trauma to the tissue bed caused by the cleaning. Don't use povidone-iodine, iodophor, sodium hypochloritesolution, hydrogen peroxide, or acetic acid because they have beenshown to be cytotoxic. Use normal saline at a pressure between 4and 15 pounds per square inch. For nonnecrotic wounds, use minimal pressure to prevent damage. Remove and discard your soiled gloves and put on a fresh pair. Insert a sterile cotton swab into the wound to assess wound tunneling orundermining. Assess and note the condition of clean wound and surrounding skin. COLLABORATION Notify a wound care specialist if adherent necrotic material is present or the ulcer fails to improve. Apply the appropriate topical dressing. 386 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 386Applying a moist saline gauze dressing Irrigate the ulcer with normal saline solution. Blot surrounding skin dry . Moisten the gauze dressing with normal saline solution. Gently place the dressing over the surface of the ulcer. To separate surfaces within the wound, gently place a dressing between opposing wound surfaces. Don't pack the gauze tightly . Change the dressing often enough to keep the wound moist. Applying a hydrocolloid dressing Irrigate the ulcer with normal saline solution. Blot surrounding skin dry . Choose a clean, dry , presized dressing, or cut one to overlap the pressureulcer by about 1/H11033 (2.5 cm). Remove the dressing from its package, remove the release paper and ap-ply the dressing to the wound. Carefully smooth wrinkles as you applythe dressing. If using tape to secure the dressing, apply a skin sealant to the intact skinaround the ulcer. When dry , tape the dressing to the skin. Avoid tension or pressure. Remove and discard your gloves and other refuse. Wash your hands. Change a hydrocolloid dressing every 2 to 7 days. Discontinue if signs of infection are present. Applying a transparent dressing Irrigate the ulcer with normal saline solution. Blot surrounding skin dry . Clean and dry the wound as described above. Select a dressing to overlap the ulcer by 2/H11033 (5 cm). Gently lay the dressing over the ulcer. Don't stretch it. Press firmly on the edges of the dressing to promote adhe rence. Tape edges to prevent them from curling. If necessary , aspirate accumulated fluid with a 21G needle and syringe. Clean the site with an alcohol pad and cover it with a transparent dress-ing. Change the dressing every 3 to 7 days, depending on drainage. Applying an alginate dressing Irrigate the ulcer with normal saline solution. Blot surrounding skin dry . Apply alginate dressing to the ulcer surface. Cover with a second dress-ing. Secure with tape or elastic netting. If drainage is heavy , change the dressing once or twice daily for the first 3to 5 days. PRESSURE ULCER CARE 387897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 387As drainage decreases, change the dressing less frequently \u2014 every 2 to 4 days or as ordered. When drainage stops or the wound bed looks dry , stop using alginatedressing. Applying a foam dressing Irrigate the ulcer with normal saline solution. Blot surrounding skin dry . Lay the foam dressing over the ulcer. Use tape, elastic netting, or gauze to hold the dressing in place. Change the dressing when the foam no longer absorbs the exudate. Applying a hydrogel dressing Irrigate the ulcer with normal saline solution. Blot surrounding skin dry . Apply gel to the wound bed. Cover the area with a second dressing. Change the dressing as needed to keep the wound bed moist. If you choose a sheet form dressing, cut it to match the wound base. Hydrogel dressings also come in a prepackaged, saturated gauze to fill\"dead space.\" Follow the manufacturer's directions. Preventing pressure ulcers Turn and reposition the patient every 1 to 2 hours unless contraindicat-ed. Use an air, gel, or 4 /H11033foam mattress for those who can't turn themselves or those who are turned on a schedule. Low- or high-air-loss therapy may be indicated. Implement active or passive range-of-motion exercises. To save time, combine exercises with bathing if applicable. Lift rather than slide the patient when turning. Use a turning sheet and get help from coworkers. Use pillows to position the patient and increase his comfort. ALERT Don't sit the patient on a rubber or plastic dough- nut, which can increase localized pressure at vulnerable points. Eliminate sheet wrinkles. Post a turning schedule at his bedside. Avoid the trochanter position. Instead, position at a 30-degree angle. Avoid raising the bed more than 30 degrees for long periods. Adjust or pad appliances, casts, or splints to ensure proper fit. Gently apply lotion after bathing to keep skin moist. Clean and dry soiled skin. Apply a protective moisture barrier.388 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 388RESIDUAL LIMB AND PROSTHESIS CARE 389 NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Prevention helps avoid extensive therapy; measures include ensuring ad- equate nourishment and mobility to relieve pressure and promote circu-lation. Direct the patient in a chair or wheelchair to shift his weight every 15minutes. Instruct a paraplegic to shift his weight by doing push-ups. Tell the patient to avoid heat lamps and harsh soaps. Avoid using elbow and heel protectors with a single narrow strap. Avoid using artificial sheepskin. It doesn't reduce pressure. Repair of stages 3 and 4 ulcers may require surgical intervention. Infection produces foul-smelling drainage, persistent pain, severe erythe-ma, induration, and elevated skin and body temperatures. Infection may lead to cellulitis and septicemia. Record the date and time of initial and subsequent treatments. Detail preventive strategies performed. Note the location, size (length, width, depth), color, and appearance of theulcer. Record the amount, odor, color, and consistency of drainage. Document condition and temperature of surrounding skin. Record body temperature daily . Reassess pressure ulcers at least weekly and update the plan. Record physician notification. Teach the patient and family the importance of prevention, signs andsymptoms of infection, position changes, and treatment. Teach propermethods and encourage participation. Encourage the patient to follow a diet with adequate calories, protein, andvitamins. Refer the patient and his family to home health services for additional follow-up and instruction. Residual limb and prosthesis care DESCRIPTION Patient care immediately after limb amputation to include monitoringdrainage from the residual limb, positioning the affected limb, assistingwith exercises prescribed by a physical therapist, and wrapping and con-ditioning the limb Postoperative care slightly variable, depending on the amputation siteand whether an elastic bandage or plaster cast is used897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 389After the residual limb heals, only routine daily care (proper hygiene and continued muscle-strengthening exercises) needed Prosthesis to be cleaned and lubricated daily and checked for proper fit EQUIPMENT For postoperative residual limb care Pressure dressing abdominal pad suction equipment, if ordered over- head trapeze 1/H11033adhesive tape bandage clips or safety pins sandbags or trochanter roll (for a leg) elastic limb shrinker or 4/H11033 elastic bandage tourniquet (optional, as last resort to control bleeding) For residual limb and prosthesis care Mild soap or alcohol pads special limb socks or athletic tube socks two washcloths two towels appropriate lubricating oil ESSENTIAL STEPS Perform routine postoperative care. Provide for the patient's comfort, pain management, and safety . Monitoring residual limb drainage Gravity causes fluid to accumulate at the residual limb. Frequently checkthe amount of blood and drainage on the dressing. Notify the physician if accumulations of drainage or blood increase rapid-ly or excessive bleeding occurs. Apply a pressure dressing or compress to the appropriate pressure points. Keep a tourniquet available and use it as a last resort. Tape the abdominal pad over the moist part of the dressing to provide adry area to help prevent bacterial infection. Monitor the suction drainage equipment and note the amount and typeof drainage. Positioning the extremity Elevate the extremity for the first 24 hours. To prevent contractures, position the arm with the elbow extended andthe shoulder abducted. To correctly position the leg, elevate the foot of the bed slightly and placesandbags or a trochanter roll against the hip to prevent external rotation. ALERT Don't place a pillow under the thigh to flex the hip because this can cause hip flexion contracture. For the same reason, tell the patient to avoid prolonged sitting. After a below-the-knee amputation, maintain knee extension to preventhamstring muscle contractures. 390 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 390After a leg amputation, place the patient on a firm surface in the prone position for at least 2 hours per day , with his legs close together and with-out pillows under his stomach, hips, knees, or residual limb, unless thisposition is contraindicated. Assisting with prescribed exercises After arm amputation, encourage the patient to exercise the residual armto prevent muscle contractures. Help the patient perform isometric and range-of-motion (ROM) exercisesfor both shoulders. After leg amputation, stand behind the patient and, if necessary , supporthim with your hands at his waist during balancing exercises. Instruct the patient to exercise the affected and unaffected limbs to main-tain muscle tone and increase muscle strength. The patient with a leg amputation may perform push-ups in the sittingposition with his arms at his sides, or pull-ups on the overhead trapezeto strengthen his arms, shoulders, and back, in preparation for usingcrutches. Wrapping and conditioning the residual limb If the patient doesn't have a rigid cast, apply an elastic shrinker to preventedema and shape the limb in preparation for the prosthesis. Wrap the limb so it narrows toward the distal end. (See Wrapping a resid-ual limb, page 392.) This helps ensure comfort when the patient wears the prosthesis. If an elastic shrinker isn't available, you can wrap the limb in a 4 /H11033elastic bandage. Stretch the bandage to about two-thirds its maximum length asyou wrap it diagonally around the residual limb, with the greatest pres-sure distally . Make sure the bandage covers all portions of the limb smoothly becausewrinkles or exposed areas encourage skin breakdown. If the patient experiences throbbing after the limb is wrapped, the ban-dage may be too tight. Remove the bandage immediately , reapply it lesstightly , and check it regularly . Rewrap it when it begins to bunch up at the end (typically about every12 hours for a moderately active patient). After removing the bandage to rewrap it, massage the residual limb gen-tly , always pushing toward the suture line rather than away from it. When healing begins, instruct the patient to push the residual limbagainst a pillow . Have him progress gradually to pushing against harder surfaces.RESIDUAL LIMB AND PROSTHESIS CARE 391897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 391Caring for the healed limb Bathe the residual limb at the end of the day because the warm water may cause swelling, making reapplication of the prosthesis difficult.Don't soak the limb for long periods. Don't apply lotion to the limb. This may clog follicles, increasing the riskof infection. Rub the residual limb with alcohol daily to toughen the skin and reducerisk of skin breakdown. 392 PROCEDURES WRAPPING A RESIDUAL LIMB Proper residual limb care helps pro- tect the limb, reduces swelling, andprepares the limb for a prosthesis.As you perform the procedure,teach it to the patient. Start by obtaining two 4 /H11033elastic bandages. Center the end of thefirst 4/H11033 bandage at the top of the pa tient's thigh. Unroll the bandagedownward over the stump and tothe back of the leg (as shown atright). Make three figure-eight turns to adequately cover the ends of the stump. As you wrap, be sure to include the roll of flesh in the groin area. Use enough pres-sure to ensure that the stump narrows toward the end so that it fits comfortablyinto the prosthesis. Use the second 4/H11033 bandage to anchor the first bandage around the waist. For a below-the-knee amputation, use the knee to anchor the bandage in place.Secure the bandage with clips, safety pins, or adhesive tape. Check the stumpbandage regularly and rewrap it if it bunches at the end. 897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 392Instruct the patient to watch for and report severe irritation after rubbing the limb with alcohol. Avoid using powders or lotions, which can soften or irritate the skin. Inspect the residual limb for redness, swelling, irritation, and calluses.Report these to the physician. Change and wash the patient's elastic bandages every day to avoid expos-ing the skin to excessive perspiration. To shape the residual limb, have the patient wear an elastic bandage24 hours per day except while bathing. To prevent infection, never shave the residual limb. Tell the patient to avoid putting weight on the residual limb, but continuemuscle-strengthening exercises. Caring for the plastic prosthesis Wipe the plastic socket of the prosthesis with a damp cloth and mild soapor alcohol to prevent bacterial accumulation. Wipe the insert, if the prosthesis has one, with a dry cloth and dry theprosthesis thoroughly . When possible, allow it to dry overnight. Maintain and lubricate the prosthesis and check for malfunctions. Frequently check the condition of a shoe on a foot prosthesis and changeit as necessary . Applying the prosthesis Apply a residual limb sock, keeping the seams away from bony promi-nences. If the prosthesis has an insert, remove it from the socket, place it over theresidual limb, and insert the residual limb into the prosthesis. If it has no insert, slide the prosthesis over the residual limb. Secure the prosthesis onto the residual limb according to the manufactur-er's directions. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS If the patient arrives at the facility with a traumatic amputation, the am-putated part may be saved for possible reimplantation. (See Caring for an amputated body part, page 394.) Exercise of the remaining muscles in an amputated limb must begin theday after surgery . Arm exercises progress from isometrics to assisted ROM to active ROM. Leg exercises include rising from a chair, balancing on one leg, and ROMexercises of the knees and hips. For a below-the-knee amputation, you may substitute an athletic tubesock for a residual limb sock by cutting off the elastic band. RESIDUAL LIMB AND PROSTHESIS CARE 393897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 393If the patient has a rigid dressing, perform normal cast care. If the cast slips off, apply an elastic bandage immediately and notify the physician because edema will develop rapidly . Monitor the patient for complications, such as hemorrhage, residual limbinfection, contractures, swollen or flabby residual limb, skin breakdownor irritation, from an irritant in the prosthesis, sebaceous cyst orboil, psychological problems, and phantom limb pain. 394 PROCEDURES CARING FOR AN AMPUTATED BODY PART After traumatic amputation, a sur- geon may be able to reimplant thesevered body part through micro-surgery. The chance of successfulreimplantation is much greater if theamputated part has received propercare (amputated parts should beplaced in a clean plastic bag). If the patient arrives at the hospi- tal with a severed body part, rstmake sure that bleeding at theamputation site has been controlled.Follow these guidelines for preserv-ing the body part. /H18546Put on sterile gloves. Place sev- eral sterile gauze pads and an a ppropriate amount of sterile roller gauze in a sterile basin and pour sterile normal saline or sterile lactated Ringer's solu-tion over them. Never use any other solution and don't try to scrub or debridethe part. /H18546Holding the body part in one gloved hand, carefully pat it dry with sterilegauze. Place saline-soaked gauze pads over the stump; wrap the whole body part with saline-soaked roller gauze. Wrap the gauze with a sterile towel, ifavailable. Put this package in a watertight container or bag and seal it. /H18546Fill another plastic bag with ice and place the part, still in its watertight con-tainer , inside. Seal the outer bag (always protect the part from direct contact with ice\u2014and never use dry ice\u2014to prevent irreversible tissue damage thatwould make the part unsuitable for reimplantation). Keep this bag ice-colduntil reimplantation surgery. /H18546Label amputa ted part, the hospital identication number, and the date and time when cooling began. /H18546The body part must be wrapped and cooled quickly. Irreversible tissue dam-a ge occurs after only 6 hours at ambient temperature. However, hypothermic management seldom preserves tissues for more than 24 hours. Wrapped, amputated body part Outer container Ice897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 394Record the date, time, and specific procedures of postoperative care. Note the amount and type of drainage and condition of the dressing. Document need for dressing reinforcement. Record the appearance and condition of the suture line and surrounding tissue. Note pain assessment. Record signs of skin irritation or infection, such as redness or tenderness. Record complications and nursing actions taken. Note the patient's tolerance of exercises, progress in caring for the resid-ual limb or prosthesis, and psychological reaction to the amputation. Teach the patient how to care for his residual limb and prosthesis. En-courage proper daily residual limb care. Emphasize that proper care of his residual limb can speed healing. Tell the patient to inspect his residual limb every day , using a mirror. Make sure the patient knows the signs and symptoms that indicate prob-lems in the residual limb. Instruct the patient to call the physician if the incision appears to beopening, looks red or swollen, feels warm, is painful to touch, or is seep-ing drainage. Explain to the patient that a 10-lb (4.5-kg) change in body weight will al-ter his residual limb size and require a new prosthesis socket. Tell the patient to massage the residual limb toward the suture line tomobilize the scar and prevent its adherence to bone. Advise the patient to avoid exposing the skin around the residual limb toexcessive perspiration, which can cause irritation. Tell the patient to change his elastic bandages or residual limb socks daily . Tell the patient that he may experience twitching, spasms, or phantomlimb sensations, such as pain, warmth, cold, or itching, as his residuallimb muscles adjust to amputation. Discuss measures such as imagery , biofeedback, or distraction to relievephantom limb pain or other sensations. Advise the patient to use heat, massage, or gentle pressure for thesesymptoms. If the patient's residual limb is sensitive to touch, tell him to rub it with adry washcloth for 4 minutes, three times per day . Stress the importance of performing prescribed exercises to help mini-mize complications, maintain muscle strength and tone, prevent contrac-tures, and promote independence. Stress the importance of positioning to prevent contractures and edema. Refer the patient and his family to appropriate community supportsources, such as home care nursing and physical and occupational thera-py as well as prosthetic suppliers.RESIDUAL LIMB AND PROSTHESIS CARE 395897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 395Skull tong care DESCRIPTION Skeletal traction with skull tongs to immobilize the cervical spine Skull tongs applied after a fracture or dislocation, invasion by tumor or infection, or surgery Three types of skull tongs: Crutchfield, Gardner-W tongs applied by incising the skin with a scalpel, drilling ahole in the exposed skull, and inserting the pins into the hole; Gardner-W ells and Vinke tongs less invasive When tongs in place, traction created by extending a rope from the centerof the tongs over a pulley and attaching weights to it W eights adjusted, using X-ray monitoring to establish reduction andmaintain alignment Meticulous pin-site care required three times a day Frequent observation of the traction apparatus required to make sure thatit's working properly EQUIPMENT Three sterile specimen containers one bottle each of ordered cleaning solu- tion normal saline solution povidone-iodine solution sterile, cotton- tipped applicators, sandbags or cervical collar (hard or soft) fine mesh gauze strips 4/H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pads sterile gloves sterile basin sterile scissors hair clippers turning frame, antibacterial ointment (optional) ESSENTIAL STEPS Bring the equipment to the patient's room. Place the sterile specimen containers on the bedside table. Fill one with a small amount of cleaning solution, one with normal salinesolution, and one with povidone-iodine solution. Set out the cotton-tipped applicators. Keep the sandbags or cervical collar handy for emergency immobilizationof the head and neck. Explain the procedure to the patient. Wash your hands. Inform the patient that pin sites usually feel tender for several days afterthe tongs are applied. Tell him that he'll also feel some muscular discomfort in the injured area.396 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 396Before providing care, observe each pin site carefully for signs of infec- tion: loose pins, swelling or redness, or purulent drainage. Use hair clippers to trim the patient's hair around the pin sites. Put on gloves. Wipe pin sites with a cotton-tipped applicator dipped in cleaning solu-tion. Repeat with a fresh applicator, as needed, for thorough cleaning. Use a separate applicator for each site to avoid cross-contamination. Wipe the sites with normal saline solution to remove excess cleaning so-lution. Wipe with povidone-iodine to provide asepsis at the site and prevent in-fection. After providing care, discard all pin-site cleaning materials. Apply a povidone-iodine wrap as ordered for infected pin sites. Obtain strips of fine mesh gauze or cut a 4 /H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pad into strips. Soak the strips in a sterile basin of povidone-iodine solution or normalsaline solution, and squeeze out excess solution. Wrap one strip securely around each pin site. Leave the strip in place to dry until you provide care again.SKULL TONG CARE 397 TYPES OF SKULL TONGS Skull (or cervical) tongs consist of a stainless steel body with a pin at the end of each arm. Each pin is about 18/H11033(0.5 cm) in diameter with a sharp tip. On Crutchfield tongs, pins are placed about 5/H11033(12.5 cm) apart in linewith the long axis of thecervical near the widesttransverse diameter ofthe skull, about 1/H11033(2.5 cm) above the helix.897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 397Removing the dried strip aids in debridement and helps clear infection. Check the traction apparatus \u2014 rope, weights, pulleys \u2014 at the start of each shift, every 4 hours, and as necessary . Make sure the rope hangs freely . NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Antibacterial ointment for pin-site care may be ordered instead of povi-done-iodine solution. To remove old ointment, wrap a cotton-tipped applicator with a 4/H11033/H110034 /H11033 gauze pad, moisten with cleaning solution, and gently clean each site. Keep a box of sterile gauze pads at the patient's bedside. Osteoporosis can cause skull pins to slip or pull out, which requires im-mediate attention to prevent further injury . Watch for signs and symptoms of loose pins, such as persistent pain ortenderness at pin sites, redness, drainage, or patient reports of feeling orhearing the pins move. If you suspect a pin has loosened or slipped, notify the physician. Await the physician's examination before turning the patient. If the pins pull out, immobilize the patient's head and neck with sandbagsor apply a cervical collar, and carefully remove the traction weights. Apply manual traction to the patient's head by placing your hands oneach side of the mandible and pulling gently , while maintaining properalignment. After you stabilize the alignment, have someone send for the physicianimmediately . Remain calm and reassure the patient. When traction is reestablished, take neurologic vital signs (mental statusor Glasgow Coma Scale, and pupillary reflexes). ALERT Never add weights to or subtract weights from the traction apparatus without an order from the physician. Im- proper procedure can result in neurologic impair ment to the patient. Take neurologic vital signs at the beginning of each shift, every 4 hours,and as necessary . Carefully assess the function of cranial nerves, which may be impaired bypin placement. Note asymmetry , deviation, or atrophy . Review the patient's chart to determine baseline neurologic vital signsand those immediately after tongs were applied. Monitor respirations closely and keep suction equipment handy . Injury to the cervical spine may affect respiration, so be alert for signs ofrespiratory distress.398 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 398Patients with skull tongs may be placed on a turning frame to facilitate turning without disrupting vertebral alignment. Establish a turningschedule to help prevent complications of immobility . Never remove a patient from the bed or turning frame when transporting. Monitor for and document signs of infection. Monitor for excessive traction force. Record the date, time, and type of pin-site care. Note the patient's response to the procedure. Record whether weights were added or removed. Note neurologic vital signs and the patient's respiratory status. Explain how skull tong care is performed to lessen the patient's anxiety . Tell the patient that pin sites may feel tender for several days after tongsare applied. Inform the patient about signs and symptoms of complications, such aspain at pin sites or hearing or feeling the pins move, and to notify thephysician or nurse if these occur. Teach the patient how to turn and position himself with skull tongs inplace. Reassure the patient that he'll be closely monitored. T-tube care DESCRIPTION May be placed in the common bile duct after cholecystectomy or choledo-chostomy The short end inserted into the common bile duct and the long end drawnthrough the incision; the tube then connected to a closed gravity drainagesystem Facilitates biliary drainage during healing Remains in place between 7 and 14 days EQUIPMENT Graduated collection container small plastic bag sterile gloves and clean gloves clamp sterile 4/H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pads transparent dressings rub- ber band normal saline solution sterile cleaning solution two sterile basins povidone-iodine pads sterile precut drain dressings hypoaller- genic paper tape skin protectant, such as petroleum jelly , aluminum-based gel, or zinc oxide Montgomery straps (optional)T-TUBE CARE 399897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 399ESSENTIAL STEPS Wash your hands. Assemble equipment at the bedside. Open all sterile equipment. Place one sterile 4/H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pad in each sterile basin. Using sterile technique, pour 50 ml of cleaning solution into one basin and 50 ml of normal saline solution into the other basin. Tape a small plastic bag on the table to use for refuse. Provide privacy and explain the procedure to the patient. Emptying drainage Put on clean gloves. Place the graduated collection container under the outlet valve of thedrainage bag. Without contaminating the clamp, valve, or outlet valve,empty the bag's contents completely into the container and reseal theoutlet valve. Carefully measure and record the character, color, and amount ofdrainage. Discard gloves. Redressing the T-tube Wash your hands and put on clean gloves. Without dislodging the T-tube, remove old dressings, and dispose of themin the small plastic bag. Remove gloves. Wash your hands again and put on sterile gloves; follow strict sterile tech-nique to prevent contamination of the incision. Inspect the incision and tube site for signs of infection, including redness,edema, warmth, tenderness, induration, or skin excoriation. Assess forwound dehiscence or evisceration. Use sterile cleaning solution as prescribed to clean and remove dried mat-ter or drainage from around the tube. Start at the tube site and gentlywipe outward in a continuous motion to prevent recontamination of theincision. Use normal saline solution to rinse off the prescribed cleaning solution.Dry the area with a sterile 4 /H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pad and discard all used materi- als. Using a povidone-iodine pad, wipe the incision site in a circular motion.Allow the area to dry . Apply a skin protectant (petroleum jelly , zinc oxide, or aluminum-basedgel) to prevent injury from draining bile. Apply a sterile precut drain dressing on each side of the T-tube to absorbdrainage.400 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 400Apply a 4/H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pad or transparent dressing over the T-tube and the drain dressings. ALERT Don't kink the tubing, whi ch can block drainage, and don't put the dressing over the open end of the T -tube because it connects to the closed drainage system. Secure the dressings with the hypoallergenic paper tape or Montgomery straps if necessary . Clamping the T-tube As ordered, occlude the tube lightly with a clamp or wrap a rubber bandaround the end. Clamping the tube 1 hour before and after meals divertsbile back to the duodenum to aid digestion. Monitor the patient's response to clamping. To ensure his comfort and safety , check bile drainage amounts regularly . ALERT Report signs of obstructed bile flow: chills, fever, tachycardia, nausea, right-upper-quadrant fullness and pain, jaundice, dark foamy urine, and clay-colored stools. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS The T-tube usually drains 300 to 500 ml of blood-tinged bile in the first24 hours after surgery . ALERT Report drai nage that exceeds 500 ml in the first 24 hours after surgery; if it's 50 ml or less, notify the physi- cian; the tube may be obstructe d. Drai nage typically declines to 200 ml or less after 4 days and the color changes to green-brown.Monitor fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base status. To prevent excessive bile loss (over 500 ml in first 24 hours) or backflowcontamination, secure the T-tube drainage system at abdominal level. Bilewill flow into bag only when biliary pressure increases. Provide meticulous skin care and frequent dressing changes. Observe for bile leakage, which may indicate obstruction. (See Managing T -tube obstruction, page 402.) Assess tube patency and site condition hourly for the first 8 hours, thenevery 4 hours until the physician removes the tube. Protect the skin edges and avoid excessive taping. Monitor all urine and stools for color changes. Assess for icteric skin andsclera, which may signal jaundice. Monitor the patient for complications, such as obstructed bile flow; skinexcoriation or breakdown; tube dislodgment; drainage reflux; and infec-tion. Record the date and time of each dressing change. Note the appearance of the wound and surrounding skin.T-TUBE CARE 401897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 401Write down the color, character, and volume of bile collected. Record the color of skin and mucous membranes around the T-tube. Explain to the patient that loose bowels commonly occur the first few weeks after surgery . Teach the patient about signs and symptoms of T-tube and biliary ob-struction and to report them to the physician. Teach the patient how to care for the tube at home. Caution the patient that bile stains clothing. Tracheostomy care DESCRIPTION Required to ensure airway patency by keeping the tube free of mucusbuildup, to maintain mucous membrane and skin integrity , prevent infec-tion, and provide psychological support Should be performed using sterile technique until the stoma has healed For recent tracheotomies, sterile gloves used for all manipulations at thesite; after the stoma has healed, clean gloves may be substituted for sterileones Three types of tracheostomy tube: rence) - An uncuffed plastic or metal tube that allows air to flow freely around the tracheostomy tube and through the larynx, reducing risk of tra-cheal damage - A cuffed plastic tube that's disposab le; the cuff and tube bonded to- gether to prevent separation inside the trachea, reducing risk of tra-cheal damage; doesn't require periodic deflating to lower pressure be-cause cuff pressure is low and evenly distributed against the trachealwall 402 PROCEDURES MANAGING T-TUBE OBSTRUCTION If your patient's after cholecystectomy: /H18546Notify the physician. /H18546Unclamp the T-tube (if it was clamped before and after a meal) and connect the tube to a c losed gravity-drainage system. /H18546Inspect the tube to detect any kinks or obstructions. /H18546Prepare for possible T-tube irrigation or direct X-ray of the common bile duct(cholangiogra phy).

Explain the procedure, even if the patient is unresponsive. Provide privacy . Wash your hands and assemble equipment and supplies in the patient'sroom. Check the expiration date on each sterile package and inspect for tears. Place the open waterproof trash bag next to you to avoid reaching acrossthe sterile field or the patient's stoma when discarding soiled items. Establish a sterile field near his bed and place equipment and supplieson it. TRACHEOSTOMY CARE 403897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 403Pour normal saline solution, hydrogen peroxide, or a mixture of equal parts of both solutions into one of the sterile solution containers; pournormal saline solution into the second sterile container for rinsing. For inner-cannula care, use a third sterile solution container to hold thegauze pads and cotton-tipped applicators saturated with cleaning solu-tion. If replacing the disposable inner cannula, open the package containingthe new inner cannula while maintaining sterile technique. Obtain or prepare new tracheostomy ties, if indicated. Keep supplies in full view for easy emergency access. Consider taping awrapped, sterile tracheostomy tube to the head of the bed for emergen-cies. Place the patient in semi-Fowler's position, unless contraindicated, to de-crease abdominal pressure on the diaphragm and promote lung expan-sion. Remove humidification or ventilation device. Using sterile technique, suction the entire length of the tracheostomytube to clear the airway of secretions that may hinder oxygenation. Reconnect the patient to the humidifier or ventilator, if necessary . Cleaning a stoma and outer cannula Put on sterile gloves if you aren't already wearing them. With your dominant hand, saturate a sterile gauze pad or cotton-tippedapplicator with the cleaning solution. Squeeze out excess liquid to prevent accidental aspiration. Wipe the patient's neck under the tracheostomy tube flanges and twilltapes. Saturate a second pad or applicator, and wipe until the skin surroundingthe tracheostomy is cleaned. Use additional pads or cotton-tipped applica-tors to clean the stoma site and the tube's flanges. Wipe only once with each pad or applicator to prevent contamination of aclean area. Rinse debris and peroxide you may have used with one or more sterile4/H11033/H110034 /H11033gauze pads dampened in normal saline solution. Dry the area thoroughly with additional sterile gauze pads; apply a newsterile tracheostomy dressing. Remove and discard your gloves. Cleaning a nondisposable inner cannula Put on sterile gloves. Using your nondominant hand, remove and discardthe patient's tracheostomy dressing. With the same hand, disconnect the or humidification device,404 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 by rotating it counter- clockwise. Place the inner cannula in the container of hydrogen peroxide. Working quickly , use your dominant hand to scrub the cannula with thesterile nylon brush. If the brush doesn't slide easily into the cannula, use a sterile pipe clean-er. Immerse the cannula in the container of normal saline solution, and agi-tate it for about 10 seconds to rinse it. Inspect the cannula for cleanliness. Repeat the cleaning process if neces-sary . If it's clean, tap it against the inside edge of the sterile container to re-move excess liquid and prevent aspiration. ALERT Don't dry the outer surface; a film of moisture acts as a lubricant during insertion. Reinsert the inner cannula into the patient's tracheostomy tube. Lock it in place and ensure it's positioned securely . Reconnect the me-chanical ventilator. Apply a new sterile tracheostomy dressing. If the patient can't tolerate being disconnected from the ventilator for thetime it takes to clean the inner cannula, replace the existing inner cannu-la with a clean one and reattach the mechanical ventilator. Clean the can-nula just removed from him, and store it in a sterile container for the nexttime. Caring for a disposable inner cannula Put on clean gloves. Using your dominant hand, remove the inner cannula. After evaluating the secretions in the cannula, discard it properly . Pick up the new inner cannula, touching only the outer locking portion.Insert the cannula into the tracheostomy and, following manufacturer'sinstructions, lock it securely . Changing tracheostomy ties Get help from another nurse or a respiratory therapist to avoid accidentaltube expulsion. Patient movement or coughing can dislodge the tube. Wash your hands and put on sterile gloves if you aren't already wearingthem. If you aren't using commercially packaged tracheostomy ties, preparenew ties from a 30/H11033 (76.2-cm) length of twill tape by folding one end back 1/H11033 (2.5 cm) on itself, and then, with bandage scissors, cutting a 1 12/H11033 (3.8-cm) slit down the center of the tape from the folded edge. Prepare the other end of the tape the same way . TRACHEOSTOMY CARE 405897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 405Hold both ends together and cut the resulting circle of tape so one piece is about 10/H11033 (25.4 cm) long and the other is about 20 /H11033(53 cm) long. Assist the patient into semi-Fowler's position, if possible. After your assistant puts on gloves, instruct her to hold the tracheostomytube in place to prevent expulsion during replacement of the ties. With the assistant's gloved fingers holding the tracheostomy tube inplace, cut the soiled tracheostomy ties with bandage scissors or untiethem and discard. ALERT Be careful not to cut the tube of the pilot balloon. Thread the slit end of one new tie a short distance through the eye of onetracheostomy tube flange from the underside; use the hemostat, if need-ed, to pull the tie through. Thread the other end of the tie completelythrough the slit end and pull it taut so it loops firmly through the flange.This avoids knots that can cause throat discomfort, tissue irritation, pres-sure, and necrosis. Fasten the second tie to the opposite flange in the same manner. Instruct the patient to flex his neck while you bring the ties around to theside, and tie them together with a square knot. Flexion produces the sameneck circumference as coughing and helps prevent an overly tight tie. Have your assistant place one finger under the tapes as you tie them toensure they're tight enough to avoid slippage but loose enough to preventchoking or jugular vein constriction. Placing the closure on the side allows easy access and prevents pressurenecrosis at the back of the neck when the patient is recumbent. After securing the ties, cut off excess tape with scissors and have your as-sistant release the tracheostomy tube. Make sure the patient is comfortable and can reach the call bell easily . ALERT Check tracheostomy tie tension frequently on pa- tients with traumatic injury, radical neck dissection, or car- diac failure because neck diameter can increase from swelling andcause constriction; check neonatal or restless patients frequentlybecause ties can loosen and cause tube dislodgment. Concluding tracheostomy care Replace humidification device. Provide oral care as needed because the oral cavity can become dry andmalodorous or develop sores from encrusted secretions. Observe soiled dressings and suctioned secretions for amount, color, con-sistency , and odor. Properly clean or dispose of equipment, supplies, solu-tions, and trash. Remove and discard your gloves. Make sure the patient is comfortable and can reach the call bell easily .406 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 406Make sure necessary supplies are readily available at the bedside. Repeat the procedure at least once every 8 hours, or as needed. Change the dressing as often as necessary regardless of whether you per- form the entire cleaning procedure. A wet dressing with exudate or secre-tions predisposes the patient to skin excoriation, breakdown, and infec-tion. Deflating and inflating a tracheostomy cuff Read the cuff manufacturer's instructions; cuff types and procedures vary . Assess the patient's condition, explain the procedure, and reassure him. Wash your hands. Help the patient into semi-Fowler's position, if possible, or place him in asupine position so secretions above the cuff site will be pushed up intohis mouth if he's receiving positive-pressure ventilation. Suction the oropharyngeal cavity to prevent pooled secretions from de-scending into the trachea after cuff deflation. Release the padded hemostat clamping the cuff inflation tubing, if a he-mostat is present. Insert a 5- or 10-ml syringe into the cuff pilot balloon and slowly with-draw all air from the cuff. Leave syringe attached to tubing for cuff rein-flation. Slow deflation allows positive lung pressure to push secretions upwardfrom the bronchi. Cuff deflation may also stimulate the cough reflex, pro-ducing additional secretions. Remove the ventilation device and suction the lower airway through theexisting tube to remove all secretions. Reconnect the patient to the ventilation device. Maintain cuff deflation for the prescribed time. Observe for adequate ventilation, and suction as necessary . If the patient has difficulty breathing, reinflate the cuff immediately bydepressing the syringe plunger very slowly . Use a stethoscope to listen over the trachea for the air leak; inject as littleair as necessary to achieve an adequate tracheal seal. When inflating the cuff, you may use the minimal-leak technique or theminimal occlusive volume technique to help gauge the proper inflationpoint. If inflating the cuff using cuff pressure measurement, don't exceed25 mm Hg. ALERT Recommended cuff pressure is about 18 mm Hg. If pressure exceeds 25 mm Hg, notify the physician. Y ou may need to change to a larger-size tube, use higher inflation pressures,or permit a larger air leak.TRACHEOSTOMY CARE 407897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 407After you've inflated the cuff, if the tubing doesn't have a one-way valve at the end, clamp the inflation line with a padded hemostat and removethe syringe. Check for a minimal-leak cuff seal. Y ou shouldn't feel air coming from thepatient's mouth, nose, or tracheostomy site, and a conscious patientshouldn't be able to speak. Be alert for air leaks from the cuff itself. Suspect a leak if injection of air fails to inflate the cuff or increase cuffpressure, if you're unable to inject the amount of air you withdrew , if thepatient can speak, if ventilation fails to maintain adequate respiratorymovement with pressures or volumes previously considered adequate, orif air escapes during the ventilator's inspiratory cycle. Note the exact amount of air used to inflate the cuff to detect trachealmalacia if more air is consistently needed. Make sure the patient is comfortable and can easily reach the call bell andcommunication aids. Properly clean or dispose of equipment, supplies, and trash according tofacility policy . Replenish used supplies and make sure all necessary emergency suppliesare at the bedside. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Keep appropriate equipment at the patient's bedside for immediate use inan emergency . Consult the physician about first-aid measures you can use for your tra-cheostomy patient should an emergency occur. ALERT Follow facility policy if a tracheostomy tube is ex- pelled or the outer cannula becomes blocked. If breathing is obstructed, call the appropriate code and provide manual resuscita-tion with a handheld resuscitation bag or reconnect the patient tothe ventilator. Don't remove the tracheostomy tube; the airway mayclose completely. Use caution when reinserting to avoid trachealtrauma, perforation, compression, and asphyxiation. Don't change tracheostomy ties unnecessarily during the immediatepostoperative period before the stoma track is well formed to avoid acci-dental dislodgment and expulsion of the tube. Unless secretions ordrainage is a problem, ties can be changed once per day . Don't change a single-cannula tracheostomy tube or the outer cannula ofa double-cannula tube. Because of the risk of tracheal complications, thephysician usually changes the cannula; the frequency depends on the pa-tient's condition. 408 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 408If the patient's neck or stoma is excoriated or infected, apply a water- soluble lubricant or topical antibiotic cream as ordered. Don't use a pow-der or oil-based substance on or around a stoma; aspiration can cause in-fection and abscess. Replace all equipment regularly (including solutions) to reduce risk ofnosocomial infections. Monitor for complications, such as hemorrhage at operative site, bleedingor edema in tracheal tissue, pleural cavity , hypoxia or tissues, secretions under dressings and twill tape, hardened mucus ora slipped cuff, tube displacement, and tracheal erosion and necrosis. Record the date, time, and type of procedure. Note the amount, consistency , color, and odor of secretions. Document stoma and skin condition. Record the patient's respiratory status. Note change of the tracheostomy tube by the physician. Record the duration of cuff deflation. Document the amount of cuff inflation. Record cuff pressure readings and specific body position. Note complications and nursing actions taken. Document patient or family teaching and their understanding. Record the patient's tolerance of the treatment. Explain the procedure, even if the patient is unresponsive. If the patient will be discharged with a tracheostomy , start self-care teach-ing as soon as he's receptive. Teach the patient how to change and clean the tube. If the patient is being discharged with suction equipment, make sure heand his family are knowledgeable and comfortable about using the equip-ment. Refer the patient and family for home care services for follow-up if tra-cheotomy is permanent. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation DESCRIPTION Based on the gate control theory of pain Performed with a portable battery-powered device that transmits painlesselectrical current to peripheral nerves or directly to a painful area overrelatively large nerve fibers Effectively alters the patient's perception of pain by blocking painful stim-uli traveling over smaller fibersTRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION 409897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 409Used for postoperative patients and those with chronic pain to reduce need for analgesics; may allow the patient to resume normal activities Treatment typically lasting 3 to 5 days Some conditions, such as phantom limb pain, needing continuous stimu-lation; other conditions, such as a painful arthritic joint, shorter periods(see Uses of TENS ) Also known as TENS ALERT Cardiac pacemakers can interfere with function. EQUIPMENT Commercial TENS kits are available. They include the stimulator, leadwires,electrodes, spare battery pack, battery recharger, and adhesive patch. TENS device alcohol pads reusable self-adhesive electrodes warm water and soap leadwires charged battery pack battery recharger skin cleanser and protectant electrode spray (optional) ALERT Before beginning the procedure, test the battery pack to ensure it's fully charged. ESSENTIAL STEPS Wash your hands and follow standard precautions. Provide privacy and explain the procedure. Thoroughly clean the skin where the electrode will be applied with soapand water, dry well. Wipe with skin cleanser and protectant to enhanceconductivity , if desired.410 PROCEDURES USES OF TENS Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) must be prescribed by a physician and is most successful if administered and taught to the patient bya skilled therapist. TENS has been used for temporary relief of acute pain,such as postoperative pain, and for ongoing relief of chronic pain such as sci-atica. Among the types of pain that respond to TENS are: /H18546arthritis /H18546bone fracture pain PM Page 410If necessary , shave hair at the site where each electrode will be placed. Rehydrate electrodes with electrode spray or small amount of water if needed. Place the ordered number of electrodes on the proper skin area, leaving atleast 2 /H11033(5 cm) between them. (See Positioning TENS electrodes, page 412.) Secure them with the adhesive patch or hypoallergenic tape on all sidesevenly , so electrodes are firmly attached to the skin. Plug the pin connectors into the electrode sockets. To protect the cords, hold the connectors \u2014 not the cords themselves \u2014during insertion. Turn the channel controls to the OFF position or as recommended in the operator's manual. Plug the leadwires into the jacks in the control box. Turn the amplitude and rate dials slowly , as the manual directs. The pa-tient should feel a tingling sensation. Adjust the control to the prescribed settings or to settings that aremost comfortable. Most patients select stimulation frequencies of 60to 100 Hz. Attach the TENS control box to part of the patient's clothing, such as abelt, pocket, or bra. To ensure the device is working effectively , monitor for signs of excessivestimulation, such as muscle twitches, and for signs of inadequate stimula-tion, signaled by the patient not feeling any mild tingling sensation. After transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation treatment Turn off the controls and unplug the electrode leadwires. If another treat-ment will be given soon, leave the electrodes in place. Replace the electrodes on the plastic pad supplied and enclose in pouch.May refrigerate between uses. Don't soak the electrodes in alcohol because it will damage the rubber. Remove the battery pack and replace it with a charged battery pack. Recharge the used battery pack so it's always ready for use. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS If you must move electrodes during the procedure, turn off the controlsfirst. Follow the physician's orders about electrode placement and control set-tings. TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION 411897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 411ALERT Incorrect placement of the electrodes will result in in- appropriate pain control. Setting the controls too high can cause pain; setting them too low will fail to relieve pain. ALERT Never place the electrodes near the patient's eyes or over the nerves that innervate the carotid sinus or laryngeal or pharyngeal muscles to avoid interference with critical nerve func- tion. 412 PROCEDURES POSITIONING TENS ELECTRODES In transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), electrodes placed around peripheral nerves (or an incisional site) transmit mild electrical pulses to thebrain. The current is thought to block pain impulses. The patient can influencethe level and frequency of pain relief by adjusting controls on the device. Typically, electrode placement varies even though patients may have similar complaints. Electrodes can be placed in several ways: /H18546They can cover the painful area or surround it, as with muscle tenderness or spasm or painful joints. /H18546They can \"capture\" the painful area between electrodes, as with incisionalpain. /H18546In peripheral nerve injury, electrodes should be placed proximal to the injury(between the brain and the injur y site) to avoid increasing pain. /H18546Placing electrodes in a hypersensitive area can also increase pain. /H18546In an area lacking sensation, electrodes should be placed on adjacent der-ma tomes. These illustrations show combinations of electrode placement (colored squares) and areas of nerve stimulation (shaded panels) for low back and legpain. 897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 412If TENS is used continuously for postoperative pain, remove the elec- trodes at least daily to check for skin irritation, provide skin care, and torotate sites of electrode placement. Record the electrode sites and control settings. Note the patient's tolerance of treatment. Record the location of pain and how the patient rates his pain using a painscale. If appropriate, let the patient study the operator's manual. Teach the patient how to place the electrodes properly and how to takecare of the TENS unit. Transfusion reaction management DESCRIPTION Condition that stems from a major antigen-antibody reaction and can re-sult from a single or massive transfusion of blood or blood products Many reactions occurring during transfusion or within 96 hours after-ward Requires immediate recognition and prompt nursing action to preventfurther complications or death, particularly if the patient is unconsciousor heavily sedated and can't report symptoms (see Guide to transfusion reactions, pages 414 to 417) EQUIPMENT Normal saline solution I.V . administration set sterile urine specimen container needle, syringe, and tubes for blood samples transfusion reac- tion report form oxygen epinephrine hypothermia blanket leuko- cyte removal filter (optional) ESSENTIAL STEPS If adverse reaction is suspected, stop the transfusion and start the normalsaline solution infusion using a new I.V . administration set at a keep-vein-open rate to maintain venous access. Don't discard the blood bag or ad-ministration set. Notify the physician. Monitor vital signs every 15 minutes or as indicated by severity and typeof reaction. Compare labels on blood containers with corresponding patient identifi-cation forms to verify that transfusion was the correct blood or bloodproduct.TRANSFUSION REACTION MANAGEMENT 413 (T ext continues on page 418.)897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 413GUIDE TO TRANSFUSION REACTIONS A patient receiving a transfusion of processed blood products risks certain com- plications; for example, hemosiderosis and hypothermia.

MANAGEMENT 417897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM Page 417Notify the blood bank of a possible transfusion reaction and collect blood samples, as ordered. Immediately send the samples, transfusion containers (even if empty),and the administration set to the blood bank; they'll test materials to fur-ther evaluate the reaction. Collect the first posttransfusion urine specimen, mark the collection slip\"Possible transfusion reactio n,\" and send it to the laboratory i mmediately to test for presence of hemoglobin, which indicates a hemolytic reaction. Closely monitor intake and output. Note evidence of oliguria or anuriabecause hemoglobin deposition in the renal tubules can cause renal dam-age. If prescribed, give oxygen, epinephrine, or other drugs and apply a hypo -thermia blanket to reduce fever. Make the patient as comfortable as possible and provide reassurance asnecessary . NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Treat all transfusion reactions as serious until proven otherwise. If the physician anticipates a transfusion reaction, he may order prophy-lactic treatment with antihistamines or antipyretics to precede blood ad-ministration. To avoid a possible febrile reaction, the physician may order the blood tobe washed to remove as many leukocytes as possible, or a leukocyte re-moval filter may be used during the transfusion. Record the time and date of transfusion reaction. Note the type and amount of infused blood or blood products. Document clinical signs of the transfusion reaction in order of occur-rence. Record vital signs, specimens sent to the laboratory for analysis, treat- ment given, and patient response. If required by facility policy , complete the transfusion reaction form. Tell the patient to report new symptoms promptly .418 PROCEDURES897304pt3.qxd:9781582558974_04pt3 7/12/13 1:55 PM PM Page 419Arterial blood gas analysis PURPOSE To measure the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa O2), the partial pres- sure of arterial carbon dioxide (Pa CO2), and the pH of an arterial sample: -P a O2: amount of oxygen the lungs deliver to the blood -P a CO2: how efficiently the lungs eliminate carbon dioxide - pH: acid-base level of the blood, or the hydrogen ion (H+) level (acidity indicates H+excess; alkalinity , H+deficit) (Sa O2), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) values To evaluate the efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange To assess the integrity of the ventilatory control system To monitor respiratory therapy PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure that the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Note and report allergies. Explain that arterial blood gas analysis evaluates how well the lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood and eliminating carbon dioxide. Tell the patient that the test requires a blood sample. Explain who willperform the arterial puncture, when it will occur, and where the puncturesite will be: radial, brachial, or femoral artery . Inform the patient that he need not restrict food and fluids. Instruct the patient to breathe normally during the test, and warn himthat he may experience a brief cramping or throbbing pain at the punc-ture site. PROCEDURE Wait at least 20 minutes before drawing arterial blood when starting,changing, or discontinuing oxygen therapy; after starting or changing me-chanical ventilation settings; or after extubation. Use a heparinized blood gas syringe to draw the sample. Perform an arterial puncture or draw blood from an arterial line. Eliminate air from the sample, place it on ice immediately , and prepare totransport it for analysis. Before sending the sample to the laboratory , note on the laboratory re-quest whether the patient was breathing room air or receiving oxygentherapy when the sample was collected. Note the flow rate of oxygen therapy and method of delivery . If the pa-420 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 420tient is on a ventilator, note the fraction of inspired oxygen, tidal volume mode, respiratory rate, and positive end-expiratory pressure. Note the patient's rectal temperature. POSTPROCEDURE CARE After applying pressure to the puncture site for 3 to 5 minutes or untilbleeding has stopped, tape a gauze pad firmly over it. If the patient is receiving anticoagulants or has a coagulopathy , applypressure to the puncture site longer than 5 minutes if necessary . If the puncture site is on the arm, don't tape the entire circumference; this may restrict circulation. Monitor the patient's vital signs and observe for signs of circulatory im-pairment, such as swelling, discoloration, pain, numbness, and tingling inthe bandaged arm or leg. Assess bleeding from the puncture site. NORMAL RESULTS PaO2: 80 to 100 mm Hg (SI, 10.6 to 13.3 kPa) PaCO2: 35 to 45 mm Hg (SI, 4.7 to 5.3 kPa) pH: 7.35 to 7.45 (SI, 7.35 to 7.45) O2CT: 15% to 23% (SI, 0.15 to 0.23) SaO2: 94% to 100% (SI, 0.94 to 1) HCO3-: 22 to 25 mEq/L (SI, 22 to 25 mmol/L) ABNORMAL RESULTS Low Pa O2, O2CT, and Sa O2levels and a high Pa CO2level may result from conditions that impair respiratory function, such as respiratory muscleweakness or paralysis, respiratory center inhibition (from head injury ,brain tumor, or drug abuse), and airway obstruction (possibly from mu-cus plugs or a tumor). Low readings with a high Pa CO2level may result from bronchiole obstruc- tion caused by asthma or emphysema, from an abnormal ventilation-per-fusion ratio caused by partially blocked alveoli or pulmonary capillaries,or from alveoli that are damaged or filled with fluid because of disease,hemorrhage, or near-drowning. When inspired air contains insufficient oxygen, the Pa O2, O2CT, and Sa O2 decrease, but the Pa CO2may be normal. Such findings are common in pneumothorax, impaired diffusion between alveoli and blood (caused byinterstitial fibrosis, for example), or an arteriovenous shunt that permitsblood bypass the lungs.ARTERIAL BLOOD 421897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page Sa O2and, possibly , Pa CO2values\u2014may result from severe anemia, decreased blood volume, and reduced hemo- globin oxygen-carrying capacity .

Explain that the test usually takes only 5 to 10 minutes. Explain which bone site (sternum, anterior or posterior iliac crest, verte-bral spinous process, rib, or tibia) will receive the test. (See Common bonemarrow aspiration and biopsy sites, page 424. ) PROCEDURE The patient is positioned and instructed to remain as still as possible. Aspiration biopsy The biopsy site is prepared and draped, and a local anesthetic is injected.The marrow aspiration needle is inserted through the skin, subcutaneoustissue, and bone cortex, using a twisting motion. The stylet is removed from the aspiration needle, and a 10- to 20-ml sy-ringe is attached. From 0.2 to 0.5 ml of marrow is aspirated and the nee-dle is withdrawn. If the aspiration specimen is inadequate, the needle may be repositionedwithin the marrow cavity or removed and reinserted in another anes-thetized site. If the second attempt fails, a needle biopsy may be neces-sary . Needle biopsy The biopsy site is prepared and draped. The skin is marked at the site withan indelible pencil or marking pen. A local anesthetic is injected intrader-mally , subcutaneously , and at the surface of the bone. The biopsy needle is inserted into the periosteum and the needle guardset as indicated. Rotating the inner needle alternately clockwise andcounterclockwise directs the needle into the marrow cavity . A tissue plug is removed and the needle assembly is withdrawn. The mar-row is expelled into a labeled bottle containing a special fixative. POSTPROCEDURE CARE While the marrow slides are being prepared, apply pressure to the biopsysite until bleeding stops. Clean the biopsy site and apply a sterile dressing. Monitor the patient's vital signs and the biopsy site for signs and symp-toms of infection. Monitor the patient for hemorrhage and infection. Monitor for possible puncture of the mediastinum (sternal site).BONE MARROW ASPIRATION AND BIOPSY 423897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 423424 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS COMMON BONE MARROW ASPIRATION AND BIOPSY SITES These illustrations show commonly used sites for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Usually, the posterior superior iliac spine is preferred for bone marrow aspirationbecause no vital organs or vessels arelocated nearby. The sternum involves the greatest risk. However, it's commonly used for marrowaspiration because it's near the surface,the cortical bone is thin, and the marrowcavity contains numerous cells and rela-tively little fat or supporting bone. The spinous process is the preferred site if multiple punctures are necessary, ifmarrow is absent at other sites, or if thepatient objects to a sternal puncture. The tibia is the site of choice for infants younger than age 1. 897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 424NORMAL RESULTS Y ellow marrow containing fat cells and connective tissue Red marrow containing hematopoietic cells, fat cells, and connective tis- sue The iron stain, which measures hemosiderin (storage iron), at +2 The Sudan black B stain, which shows granulocytes, negative The periodic acid-Schiff (P AS) stain, which detects glycogen reactions,negative ABNORMAL RESULTS Decreased hemosiderin levels in an iron stain, possibly indicating a trueiron deficiency Increased hemosiderin level, possibly suggesting other types of anemiasor blood disorders A positive stain, possibly differentiating acute myelogenous leukemiafrom acute lymphoblastic leukemia (negative stain) A positive Sudan black B stain, possibly suggesting granulation inmyeloblasts A positive P AS stain, possibly suggesting acute or chronic lymphocyticleukemia, amyloidosis, thalassemia, lymphoma, infectious mononucleo-sis, iron deficiency anemia, or sideroblastic anemia Bronchoscopy PURPOSE To provide direct visualization of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi using arigid or fiber-optic bronchoscope To better view of the segmental and subsegmental bronchi withless risk of trauma To remove foreign objects, excise endobronchial lesions, and control mas-sive hemoptysis; requires general anesthesia (large, rigid bronchoscope) To allow a brush, biopsy forceps, or catheter to be passed through thebronchoscope to obtain specimens for cytologic or microbiological exami-nation To allow visual examination of tumors, obstructions, secretions, or for-eign bodies in the tracheobronchial tree To diagnose bronchogenic carcinoma, tuberculosis, interstitial pulmo -nary disease, and fungal or parasitic pulmonary infections To locate bleeding sites in the tracheobronchial tree To remove foreign bodies, malignant or benign tumors, mucus plugs, andexcessive secretions PM Page 425PATIENT PREPARATION Make sure that the patient has signed an appropriate consent form. Note and report allergies. Obtain results of preprocedure studies; report abnormal results. Obtain the patient's baseline vital signs. An I.V . sedative may be given. Remove the patient's dentures. Instruct the patient to fast for 6 to 12 hours before the test. Explain to the patient that the test takes 45 to 60 minutes. Inform the patient that the airway won't be blocked, but that he may ex- perience hoarseness, loss of voice, hemoptysis, and a sore throat. PROCEDURE Position the patient properly . Give the patient supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula, if ordered. Monitor the patient's pulse oximetry , vital signs, and cardiac rhythm. A local anesthetic is sprayed into the patient's mouth and throat to sup-press the gag reflex. The bronchoscope is inserted through the mouth or nose; a bite block isplaced in the mouth if using the oral approach. When the bronchoscope is just above the vocal cords, about 3 to 4 ml of2% to 4% lidocaine is flushed through the inner channel of the scope tothe vocal cords to anesthetize deeper areas. A fiber-optic camera is used to take photographs for documentation. Tissue specimens are obtained from suspect areas. A suction apparatus may remove foreign bodies or mucus plugs. Bronchoalveolar lavage may remove thickened secretions or may diag-nose infectious causes of infiltrates. Specimens are prepared properly and imme diately sent to the labora tory . POSTPROCEDURE CARE Position a conscious patient in semi-Fowler's position. Position an unconscious patient on one side, with the head of the bedslightly elevated to prevent aspiration. Instruct the patient to spit out saliva rather than swallow it. Observe the patient for bleeding. Resume the patient's usual diet, beginning with sips of clear liquid or icechips, when the gag reflex returns. Provide lozenges or a soothing liquid gargle to ease discomfort when thegag reflex returns.426 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page follow-up chest X-ray for pneumothorax.

Make sure that the patient or a responsible family member has signed aninformed consent form. Explain to the patient that cardiac blood pool imaging permits assess-ment of the heart's left ventricle. Describe the test, including who will perform it, where it will take place,and its expected duration. Tell the patient that he need not restrict food and fluids. Explain to the patient that he'll receive an I.V . injection of a radioactivetracer and that a detector positioned above his chest will record the circu-lation of this tracer through his heart. Reassure the patient that the tracer poses no radiation hazard and rarelyproduces adverse effects. Inform the patient that he may experience slight discomfort from theneedle puncture but that the imaging itself is painless. PROCEDURE The patient is placed in a supine position beneath the detector of a scintil-lation camera, and 15 to 20 mCi of albumin or RBCs tagged with 99m Tc pertechnetate is injected I.V . For the next minute, the scintillation camera records the first pass of theisotope through the heart to locate the aortic and mitral valves. Then, using an electrocardiogram, the camera is gated for selected 60 msec intervals, representing end-systole and end-diastole, and500 to 1,000 cardiac cycles are recorded on X-ray or Polaroid film. To observe septal and posterior wall motion, the patient may be assistedto a modified left anterior oblique position or he may be assisted to aright anterior oblique position and given 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin sublin-gually . The scintillation camera then records additional gated images toevaluate abnormal contraction in the left ventricle. The patient may be asked to exercise as the scintillation camera recordsgated images. ALERT If the patient is elderly or physically compromised, help him sit up and make sure that he isn't dizzy. Then help him get off the examination table.428 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 428POSTPROCEDURE CARE Monitor the patient's vital signs and response to the testing.

Notify the physician of hypersensitivity to shellfish, iodine, or contrastmedia. Stop anticoagulants, as ordered, to reduce complications of bleeding. Restrict food and fluids for at least 6 hours before the test. CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION 429897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 429Explain that even if a mild sedative is given, the patient remains con- scious. Warn the patient that a transient hot, flushing sensation or nausea mayoccur. Tell the patient that the test will take 1 to 2 hours. PROCEDURE The patient is placed supine on a padded table and his heart rate andrhythm, respiratory status, and blood pressure are monitored throughoutthe procedure. An I.V . line is started, if not already in place; a local anesthetic is injectedat the insertion site. A small incision is made into the artery or vein, depending on whetherthe test is for the left or right side. The catheter is passed through the sheath into the vessel and guided us-ing fluoroscopy . In right-sided heart catheterization, the catheter is inserted into the ante-cubital or femoral vein and advanced through the vena cava into the rightside of the heart and into the pulmonary artery . In left-sided heart catheterization, the catheter is inserted into thebrachial or femoral artery and advanced retrograde through the aorta intothe coronary artery ostium and left ventricle. When the catheter is in place, contrast medium is injected to make visiblethe cardiac vessels and structures. Nitroglycerin is given to eliminate catheter-induced spasm or watch its ef-fect on the coronary arteries. After the catheter is removed, direct pressure is applied to the incisionsite until bleeding stops, and a sterile dressing is applied. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Reinforce the dressing as needed. Enforce bed rest for 8 hours. If the femoral route was used for catheter insertion, keep the leg straightat the hip for 6 to 8 hours. If the antecubital fossa route was used for catheter insertion, keep thearm straight at the elbow for at least 3 hours. Resume medications and give analgesics. Encourage fluid intake. Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, cardiac rhythm, neu-rologic and respiratory status, and peripheral vascular status distal site.430 the catheter insertion site and dressings for signs and symptoms of infection. Monitor the patient for the following possible complications:- In patients with valvular heart disease: blood loss, adverse reaction to media, response - Left-sided heart catheterization: arterial heart catheterization: thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism.

Note and report drug allergies. Have the patient fast for 8 to 10 hours before the test. Provide I.V . access and give I.V . fluids. Give a sedative. Tell the patient that his head will be immobilized and he'll need to liestill. Explain to the patient that he'll receive a local anesthetic. Warn the patient that nausea, warmth, or burning may occur with thecontrast injection. Explain to the patient that the test takes 2 to 4 hours.432 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 432PROCEDURE The patient is placed in a supine position on an X-ray table. The access site (usually femoral) is prepared and draped and a local anes- thetic is injected. The artery is punctured with the appropriate needle and catheterized un-der fluoroscopic guidance. Catheter placement in the carotid or vertebral arteries is verified by fluo-roscopy and a contrast medium is injected. A series of radiographs is taken and reviewed. Arterial catheter patency is maintained by continuous or periodic flush-ing. The patient's vital signs and neurologic status are monitored continuous-ly . The catheter is removed, firm pressure is applied to the access site untilbleeding stops, and a pressure dressing is applied. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Enforce bed rest and apply an ice bag. If active bleeding or expanding hematoma occurs, apply firm pressure tothe puncture site and inform the physician immediately . Make sure that the patient is adequately hydrated. Provide analgesia. Monitor the patient's vital signs, along with intake and output. Monitor the neurovascular status of the extremity distal to the accesssite. If the femoral approach was used as the access site, keep the involved legstraight at the hip and check pulses distal to the site. If the carotid artery was used as the access site, watch for dysphagia orrespiratory distress, which can result from hematoma or edema. Alsowatch for disorientation, weakness, or numbness in the extremities andfor arterial spasms, which produce symptoms of transient ischemic at-tacks (TIAs). Notify the physician immediately if abnormal signs develop. If the brachial artery was used as the access site, keep the arm straight atthe elbow and assess distal pulses. Avoid venipuncture and blood pres-sures in the affected arm. Observe the extremity for changes in color, tem-perature, or sensation. If it becomes pale, cool, or numb, notify the physi-cian immediately . Watch for potential adverse reactions to contrast media. Watch for potential complications, such as embolism, bleeding,hematoma, normal During the arterial phase of perfusion, the contrast medium fills and opacifies superficial and deep arteries and arterioles During the venous phase, the contrast medium opacifies superficial anddeep veins ABNORMAL RESULTS Changes in the caliber of vessel lumina suggesting vascular disease (seeComparing cerebral angiograms) Vessel displacement suggesting a possible tumor Blockage of vessels suggesting ischemic stroke Computed tomography PURPOSE To combine radiologic and computer technology to produce cross- sectional images of various layers of tissue, called computed tomography (CT)434 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS COMPARING CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAMS The angiograms below show the differences between normal and abnormal cerebral vasculature.

Note and report allergies. A CT scan usually isn't recommended during pregnancy because of thepotential risk to the fetus. Check the patient's history for hypersensitivity to shellfish, iodine, or io-dinated contrast media, and document such reactions on the patient'schart. The specific type of CT scan dictates the need for an oral or I.V . contrastmedium. Warn the patient about transient discomfort from the needle punctureand a warm or flushed feeling from an I.V . contrast medium, if used. ALERT Tell the patient to immediately report feelings of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, itching, or hives, in- dicating a hypersensitivity reaction. Instruct the patient to remain still during the test because movement canlimit the accuracy of results. Tell the patient he may experience minimal discomfort because of lyingstill. Tell the patient that the study takes from 5 minutes to 1 hour, dependingon the type of CT and his ability to remain still. PROCEDURE The patient is positioned on an adjustable table inside a scanning gantry . A series of transverse radiographs is taken and recorded. The information is reconstructed by a computer and selected images arephotographed. After the images are reviewed, an I.V . contrast enhancement may be or-dered. Additional images are obtained after the I.V . contrast injection. The patient is observed carefully for adverse reactions to the contrastmedium.COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY 435897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 435POSTPROCEDURE CARE Normal diet and activities may resume, unless otherwise ordered.

Note and report drug allergies. Tell the patient the test takes about 20 minutes. Explain that the test doesn't involve risk or discomfort. PROCEDURE Doppler ultrasonography is performed bilaterally . The patient is assisted into the supine position on the examination tablewith his arms at his sides. Peripheral arterial evaluation For peripheral arterial evaluation in the leg, the usual test sites are thecommon and superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalispedis arteries. For peripheral arterial evaluation in the arm, the usual test sites are thesubclavian, brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries. Brachial blood pressure is measured, and the transducer is placed at vari-ous points along the test arteries. The signals are monitored, and the waveforms are recorded for lateranalysis. The blood flow velocity is monitored and recorded over the test artery .442 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 442Segmental limb blood pressures are obtained to localize arterial occlusive disease. Peripheral venous evaluation For peripheral venous evaluation in the leg, the usual test sites are thepopliteal, superficial and common femoral veins, and posterior tibialvein. For extracranial cerebrovascular evaluation, the usual test sites are thesupraorbital artery; the common, external, and is appropriate vessel, waveforms arerecorded, and respiratory modulations are noted.DOPPLER ULTRASOUND 443 HOW THE DOPPLER PROBE WORKS The Doppler ultrasonic probe directs high-frequency sound waves through lay- ers of tissue. When these waves strike red blood cells (RBCs) moving throughthe bloodstream, their frequency changes in proportion to the flow velocity ofthe RBCs. Recording these waves permits detection of arterial and venousobstruction but not quantitative blood flow measurement.

Warn the patient about possible adverse effects of amyl nitrite (dizziness,flushing, and tachycardia), but reassure him that such effects quickly sub-side. Stress the need to remain still during the test because movement may dis-tort results. Explain that the test takes 15 to 30 minutes. PROCEDURE The patient is placed in the supine position and conductive gel is appliedto the third or fourth intercostal space to the left of the sternum. Thetransducer is placed directly over it. The transducer is systematically angled to direct ultrasonic waves at spe-cific parts of the patient's heart. During the test, the oscilloscope screen is observed; significant findingsare recorded on a strip chart recorder or videotape recorder.ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY 445897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 445446 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS COMPARING TWO TYPES OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY This illustration shows how M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography dif- fer.

Note and report drug allergies. The procedure shouldn't be performed without a physician and emer-gency resuscitation equipment readily available.448 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:24 PM Page 448Withhold drugs the patient is currently taking. Instruct the patient to refrain from eating, smoking, or drinking alcoholic or caffeinated beverages at least 3 to 4 hours before the test. Warn the patient that he might feel tired, diaphoretic, and slightly shortof breath. Reassure him that if symptoms become severe or if chest paindevelops, the test will stop. Explain that the test takes about 60 minutes. PROCEDURE The patient is placed in the supine position and a baseline echocardio-gram is obtained. An initial baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure readingare obtained. The patient is then placed on the treadmill at a slow speed until he be-comes acclimated to it. The work rate is increased every 3 minutes as tolerated by increasing thespeed of the machine slightly and increasing the degree of incline by 3%each time. The cardiac monitor is observed continuously for changes, and bloodpressure is monitored at predetermined intervals. The rhythm strip is checked at preset intervals for arrhythmias, prema-ture ventricular contractions, and ST-segment and T-wave changes. The test level and time it took to reach that level are marked on eachstrip. Common responses to maximal exercise include dizziness, light- headedness, leg fatigue, dyspnea, diaphoresis, and a slightly ataxic gait.If symptoms become severe, the test is stopped. The test is stopped for significant ECG changes, arrhythmias, or symp-toms, including hypertension, hypotension, or angina. After the patient has reached the maximum predicted heart rate, thetreadmill is slowed. While the patient's heart rate is still elevated, he's helped off the treadmilland placed on a litter for a second echocardiogram. POSTPROCEDURE CARE Remove electrodes and conductive gel. Monitor the patient's vital signs, ECG, and heart sounds.

Note and report allergies. For stress imaging: Instruct the patient to wear comfortable walking shoesduring the treadmill exercise. Inform the patient that he must restrict his use of alcohol, tobacco, andnonprescription medications for 24 hours before the test. Tell the patient to fast after midnight the night before the test. Tell the patient to report fatigue, pain, shortness of breath, or other angi-nal symptoms immediately . PROCEDURE Stress imaging: The patient walks on a treadmill at a regulated pace that'sgradually increased while his electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure,and heart rate are monitored. When the patient reaches peak stress, give him 1.5 to 3 mCi of thal lium. The patient exercises an additional 45 to 60 seconds to permit circula-tion and uptake of the isotope.THALLIUM IMAGING 473897305pt4.qxd:9781582558974_05pt4 7/12/13 2:25 PM Page 473ALERT Stop the stress imaging immediately if the patient develops chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, hypoten- sion, ischemic ECG changes, significant arrhythmias, or other criti- cal signs and symptoms (confusion, staggering, or pale, clammyskin). Disconnect the patient from monitoring equipment as long as he's clini-cally stable, and position him on his back under the nuclear medicinecamera. Additional scans may be taken after the patient rests and occasionally af-ter 24 hours. Scanning after rest is helpful in differentiating between an ischemic areaand an infarcted or scarred area of the myocardium. Resting imaging: The patient is given an injection of thallium I.V . or Car-diolyte. Scanning is performed as in stress imaging. POSTPROCEDURE CARE If further scanning is required, have the patient rest and restrict foods andbeverages other than water. Monitor the patient's vital signs and ECG. Monitor the patient for possible complications, such as cardiac arrhyth-mias, myocardial ischemia, respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, and hypo -tension or hypertension.

You can help prevent drug mistakes by following these guidelines as well as yourfacility's policies. DRUG ORDERS /H18546Don't rely on the pharmacy computer system to detect all unsafe orders. Before yougive a drug understand the correct dosa ge, indications, and adverse effects. If nec- essary, check a current drug reference guide. /H18546Be aware of the drugs your patient takes regularly, and question any deviation fromhis regular routine. As with any drug, take your time and read the label carefully. /H18546Ask all prescribers to spell out drug names and any error-prone abbreviations. /H18546Before you give drugs that are ordered in units, such as insulin and heparin, alwayscheck the prescriber' s written order against the provided dose. Never abbreviate the word \"units.\" /H18546If you must accept a verbal order, have another nurse listen in; then transcribe thatorder directly into an order form and repea t it to the prescriber to ensure that you've transcribed it correctly. /H18546To prevent an acetaminophen overdose from combined analgesics, note the amountof acetaminophen in each drug. Beware of substitutions by the pharmacy because the amount of acetaminophen might vary. /H18546Keep in mind that lipid-based products have different dosages than their convention-al counterparts. Check the prescriber's orders and labels carefully to avoid confu- sion. DRUG PREPARATION /H18546If a familiar drug has an unfamiliar appearance, nd out why. If the pharmacist citesa manufacturing change, ask him to double-check whether he has received verica- tion from the manufacturer. Document the appearance discrepancy, your actions,and the pharmacist's response in the patient record. /H18546Obtain a new allergy history with each admission. If the patient's history must befaxed, name the drugs, note how many are included, and follow your facility's faxing safeguards. If the pharmacy also adheres to strict guidelines, the computer-generat-ed medication administration record should be accurate. GIVING DRUGS /H18546Use two patient identiers, such as the patient's name and assigned medical recordnumber , to identify the patient before administering drug or treatment. Teach the patient to offer his identication bracelet for inspection when anyone arrives withdrugs and to insist on having it replaced if it's removed. /H18546Ask the patient about his use of over-the-counter and alternative therapies, includingherbs, and record your ndings in his medical record. Monitor the patient carefully and report unusual events. Ask the patient to keep a diary of all therapies he usesand to take the diary for review each time he visits a health care professional. DRUG ADMINISTRATION SAFETY GUIDELINES 497897306pt5.qxd:9781582558974_06pt5 7/12/13 2:30 PM Page 497498 CLINICAL TOOLS CALCULATION ERRORS /H18546Writing the mg/kg or mg/m2 dose and the calculated dose provides a safeguard against calculation errors. Whenever a prescriber provides the calculation, double- check it and document that the dose was veried. /H18546Don't assume that liquid drugs are less likely to cause harm than other forms,inc luding parenteral ones. Pediatric and geriatric patients commonly receive liquid drugs and may be especially sensitive to the effects of an inaccurate dose. If a unit-dose form isn't available, calculate carefully and double-check your math and thedrug label. /H18546Leaving potentially dangerous chemicals near a patient is extremely risky, especiallywhen the container labels don't indica te toxicity. To prevent problems, never leave drug containers near a patient. /H18546Read the label on every drug you prepare and never administer any drug that isn'tlabeled. DOSAGE EQUATIONS /H18546After you calculate a drug dosage, always have another nurse calculate it indepen-dently to double-check your results. If doubts or questions remain or if the calcula- tions don't match, ask a pharmacist to calculate the dose before you give the drug. AIR BUBBLES IN PUMP TUBING /H18546To clear bubbles from I.V. tubing, never increase the pump's flow rate to flush theline. Instead, remove the tubing from the pump, disconnect it from the patient, and use the flow-control clamp to establish gravity flow. /H18546When the bubbles have been removed, return the tubing to the pump, restart theinfusion, and recheck the flow rate. INCORRECT ADMINISTRATION ROUTE /H18546When a patient has multiple I.V. lines, label the distal end of each line. /H18546Use of a parenteral syringe to prepare oral liquid drugs increases the chance forerror because the syringe tip ts easily into I.V . ports. To safely give an oral drug through a feeding tube, use a dose prepared by the pharmacy and a syringe with theappropriate tip. 897306pt5.qxd:9781582558974_06pt5 7/12/13 2:30 PM Page 498Drug pregnancy risk categories Pregnancy risk categories were designed to alert prescribers to the risks associated with drugs administered during pregnancy. The categories include: /H18546A: Adequa te studies in pregnant women have failed to show a risk to the fetus. /H18546B: Animal studies ha ven't shown a risk to the fetus, but controlled studies haven't been conducted in pregnant women; or animal studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but adequate studies in pregnant women have not shown a riskto the fetus. /H18546C: Animal studies ha ve shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but adequate studies haven't been conducted in humans. The benets from use in pregnant women maybe acceptable despite potential risks. /H18546D: The drug may cause risk to the fetus, but the potential benets of use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risks (such as in life-threatening situations orserious disease for which safer drugs can't be used or are ineffective). /H18546X: Studies in animals and humans sho w fetal abnormalities, or adverse reaction reports indicate evidence of fetal risk.

The impulses are conducted through an intact chest wallusing skin electrodes placed in either anterior-posterior (shown below) or sternal-apexpositions. Transcutaneous pacing is the pacing method of choice in emergency situations because it's the least invasive technique and it can be instituted quickly. Anterior pacing electrode Posterior pacingelectrode UNDERSTANDING PERMANENT PACEMAKER CODES A permanent pacemaker's three-letter (or sometimes ve-letter) code simply refers to how it's programmed. First letter (chamber that's paced) Aatrium Vventricle Ddual (both chambers) TRANSCUTANEOUS PLACEMENT, MALFUNCTIONS, AND CODES 539 TEMPORARY PACEMAKER MALFUNCTIONS Occasionally, a temporary pacemaker may fail to function appropriately. When this occurs, you'll need to take immediate action to correct the problem. Take the stepsdescribed below when your patient's pacemaker fails to pace, capture, or sense intrin-sic beats. Failure to pace This happens when the pacemakereither doesn't re or res too often.The pulse generator may not beworking properly, or it may not beconducting the impulse to the patient. Nursing interventions /H18546If the pacing or sensing indicator flashes, check the connections to the cable and theposition of the pacing electrode in the pa tient (by X-ray). The cable may have come loose, or the electrode may have been dislodged, pulled out, or broken. /H18546If the pulse generator is turned on but the indicators still aren't flashing, change theba ttery. If that doesn't help, use a different pulse generator. /H18546Check the settings if the pacemaker is ring too rapidly. If they're correct, or if alter-ing them (according to facility polic y or physician's order) doesn't help, change the pulse generator. Failure to capture In failure to capture, you see the pace -maker spikes but the heart isn't re -sponding. This may be caused bychanges in the pacing threshold fromischemia, an electrolyte imbalance(high or low potassium or magnesiumlevels), acidosis, an adverse reaction to a medication, a perforated ventricle, brosis, or the position of the electrode. Nursing interventions /H18546If the patient's condition has changed, notify the physician and ask him for new set-tings. /H18546If the pacemaker settings have been altered by the patient (or his family members),return them to their correct positions. Then make sure the face of the pacemaker is covered with a plastic shield. Tell the patient and his family members not to touchthe dials. /H18546If the heart isn't responding, try these suggestions: Carefully check all connections,making sure they're placed properly and securely; increase the milliamperes slo wly (according to facility policy or physician's order); turn the patient on his left side,then on his right (if turning him to the left didn't help); schedule an anteroposterioror lateral chest X-ray to determine the position of the electrode. Pacemaker spike should appear here Pacemaker spike, but no response from heart897306pt5.qxd:9781582558974_06pt5 7/12/13 2:30 PM Page 539540 CLINICAL TOOLS Failure to sense intrinsic beats This could cause ventricular tachycar- dia or ventricular brillation if thepacemaker res on the vulnerableT wave. This could be caused by thepacemaker sensing an external stimu-lus as a QRS complex, which could lead to asystole, or by the pacemaker not beingsensitive enough, which means it could re anywhere within the cardiac cycle. Nursing interventions /H18546If the pacing is undersensing, turn the sensitivity control completely to the right. Ifit' s oversensing, turn it slightly to the left. /H18546If the pacemaker isn't functioning correctly, change the battery or the pulse genera-tor . /H18546Remove items in the room that may be causing electromechanical interference (suchas razors, radios, and cautery devices). Check the ground wires on the bed and other equipment for obvious damage. Unplug each piece and see if the interference stops.When you locate the cause, notify the staff engineer and ask him to check it. /H18546If the pacemaker is still ring on the T wave and all else has failed, turn off thepacemaker . Make sure atropine is available in case the patient's heart rate drops. Be prepared to call a code and institute cardiopulmonary resuscitation if necessary.
