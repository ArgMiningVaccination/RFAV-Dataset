But some parasites are not uncommon in the U.S. Toxoplasma is one which many Americans may not hear about until a prenatal visit\u2014even though over 60 million people in the U.S. are infected. The usually mild indications of infection are generally not recognized as \"symptoms,\" and for healthy individuals, the parasite usually retreats into self-enclosed cysts in the brain, eye, or muscles. But for those with weak or underdeveloped immune systems\u2014like those with cancer, HIV, or especially a fetus\u2014Toxoplasma is quite dangerous. In a fetus unwittingly exposed via its apparently healthy mother, the infection can cause death, loss of sight, or severe neurologic deficits. Vulnerability usually arises when the mother is exposed to Toxoplasma for the first time during her pregnancy, before her body can generate the immune response to sequester the parasite into cysts. Pregnant women are thus advised not to handle or eat raw or undercooked meat, seafood, or milk and to avoid exposure to material potentially contaminated with cat feces, including soil. Of all the many animals that can be infected with Toxoplasma, members of the cat family are the only ones in which the parasite reproduce sexually, and kittens are the most likely to excrete active parasites.

(Rima McLeod/University of Chicago) [Rima McLeod, MD](http://www.uchospitals.edu/physicians/rima-mcleod.html?), medical director of the [University of Chicago Medicine Toxoplasmosis Center](http://www.uchospitals.edu/specialties/infectious-diseases/toxoplasmosis/) and a professor of both ophthalmology and pediatrics, has spent a good part of a very active career on these one-celled animals. She and the international teams with whom she works\u2014many of which she leads\u2014have looked at Toxoplasma from a variety of angles: its epidemiology (Are fathers of babies with the infection likely to have it? Yes.), new animal models (Zebra fish, with their short lifespans and transparent bodies, are proving helpful for drug testing), diagnosis, treatment, and very importantly, vaccines. Diagnosis In France and Austria, where prenatal screening for Toxoplasma is the law, symptomatic disease has been nearly eliminated. One of McLeod's research teams recently made a strong economic case for using an inexpensive, point-of-care diagnostic test, developed and approved in France, for all pregnant women, not only in the U.S., but in low- and middle-income countries as well. They found this simple immunological test 100 percent sensitive and specific. The cost factor is especially critical, as the test should be repeated monthly over the course of pregnancy, to identify any potential exposures while the baby is developing\u2014the worst possible time to come in contact with these tiny animals. Babies infected with active Toxoplasma can then be treated effectively. Unfortunately, Toxoplasma cysts, commonly located in the muscles, eyes, or brains, are usually permanent\u2014so far, nothing can reliably eradicate them. This leaves anyone who carries the cysts\u2014babies or adults\u2014vulnerable to attacks from escaping parasites when immunity is low\u2014think cancer, HIV, malnutrition, treatments for autoimmune disease. Finding effective drug treatments that work on the cysts is therefore a priority, and McLeod and colleagues have identified a small molecule that inhibits both the parasite's dormant and active phases\u2014a molecule which also appears to have significant relevance in attacking the malaria parasite. A child dies of malaria every eleven seconds, with up to half a million children lost every year, so synthesizing this molecule into a viable drug could improve or save billions of lives. McLeod is now working with the [Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/) to get their help in developing a safe, effective oral medicine that protects against both diseases. A Vaccine\u2014or Several\u2014on the Way McLeod and her many collaborators are advancing several vaccination strategies. One approach is to vaccinate cats so they don't shed the parasite, which will prevent environmental contamination with Toxoplasma in their hardiest, most infectious stage. She is also leading an effort aimed at developing a human vaccine against the parasite. The self-assembling protein nanoparticle her team has designed and produced has been proven to work in mice with human genes, although there is still work to be done to assure the vaccine works in people. A Key to Many Diseases? Perhaps most tantalizing is McLeod's \"systems biology\" research. She has been leading a large team assembled from around the world to create a comprehensive analysis of the toxoplasmosis-infected brain, from the genes that cause disease susceptibility; to the proteins those genes encode; to how these molecules affect the neural, immune, and endocrine networks; to identifying biomarkers of infection and disease. They have found significant crossover between the biochemical pathways involved in toxoplasmosis and those in many other neurological disorders: proteins associated with the neurodegeneration in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, others involved with epilepsy, and still others involved in cell proliferation and cancer. Thus, deep discovery in the basic science of toxoplasmosis may offer a roadmap to understanding many neuropathologies and give clues to treat or prevent them. Who knew that a parasite that causes brain cysts could be so useful? Photo above: Microscopic cysts containing Toxoplasma gondii develop in the tissues of many vertebrates.

They powerfully fight off bacteria\u2014by damaging their DNA, disarming their protein-making machinery, or causing their cell walls to explode. But what happens if antibiotics inadvertently target the \"good\" bacteria in our bodies? These are the micro-organisms that help us digest our food, make our vitamins, keep our skin moisturized, tune our immune system, and so much more. For over a decade, scientists and physicians have noticed a connection between early use of antibiotics and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)\u2014chronic, painful gastrointestinal conditions that are growing in incidence at an alarming rate. IBD, the umbrella term for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affects over 1.5 million in the U.S. alone. As many people can attest, there are few effective therapies that provide lasting relief. Recently, [Eugene Chang, MD](http://www.uchospitals.edu/physicians/eugene-chang.html), and his team at the University of Chicago published a study aiming to understand the connection between antibiotics and IBD development. In this study, Jun Miyoshi, MD, PhD, and Alexandria Bobe, PhD, treated pregnant, genetically susceptible mice with antibiotics and then observed both the mothers and their new pups over time. Mouse pups whose mothers were treated with antibiotics did, indeed, tend to develop IBD-like symptoms, but the evidence showed a more complicated story. Since the antibiotics were not transmitted from mother to pups, Miyoshi and Bobe could determine that it wasn't the antibiotics themselves that triggered the IBD symptoms. Instead, the antibiotics disrupted the bacterial community in the mothers, and this unbalanced microbiota (dysbiosis) was transferred to the pups during pregnancy, delivery, and nursing. The gut dysbiosis skewed the pups' immune system, priming them for inflammation and increased development of IBD-like symptoms, as compared to non-treated mice. Interestingly, the mothers of these pups, as well as other adult mice given the same antibiotic exposure, tended not to develop symptoms, which include weight loss and diarrhea. It was as if their immune systems, which were fully mature before they were exposed to the antibiotics, kept them from developing symptoms\u2014even though they were genetically primed. These experiments seem to indicate a direct, causal link between gut dysbiosis\u2014an imbalance of bacteria in the gut, which can be caused by antibiotic use\u2014and later development of IBD, especially in those with both immature immune systems and a background of genetic susceptibility. This is not to say that we should stop using antibiotics, as they can be crucial, life-saving treatments. What this study does show is the powerful, complex effects of gut bacteria during early life on our health. And this may be true not just for IBD, but other inflammatory diseases as well, from allergies to certain types of arthritis. This research and others suggest promising new avenues to improve health. What if the balance of bacteria in our gut could be used as a biomarker to diagnose or even predict IBD? And what if we could find a way to reset the microbiota in the gut and tame the inflammation that results in IBD? Diving into the complex mechanisms of the gut microbiome Although research has revealed so much, the mechanisms by which the microbes in our bodies affect disease are still cloudy. Microbial communities in the gut are not only complex, but thrive only in an air-free environment, which makes them particularly difficult to study. But the more we discover about the dynamics of the microbiome\u2014in both healthy and sick individuals\u2014the better chance we have to turn the dial towards health. [The Duchossois Family Institute](https://dfi.uchicago.edu/) was established to advance these discoveries. But that is only part of the Duchossois Family Institute mission. It will also drive translation of bench research on the microbiome more efficiently into the clinic and back again to the lab. We need to better understand how our current lifestyles and treatments affect the bacteria living within us, so we can help countless other people achieve a lifetime of vigor and good health.

Lack of sleep may serve as badge of honor, a sign of productivity, or, a necessity\u2014to get a job done. The number of sleepless Americans seems to be steadily increasing. Poor sleep is not just a problem for night-owls. Approximately 24 to 50 percent of middle aged men and 9 to 23 percent of middle aged women face the day with a poor night's sleep due to sleep-disordered breathing, a catch-all term that includes conditions like sleep apnea. The risk is higher in certain populations, including the elderly, those with high blood pressure or obesity, and those with a family history. When the airway is repeatedly restricted, sleep disordered breathing occurs, causing a drop in blood oxygen, blood pressure fluctuation, and widespread stress. The brain senses the change in oxygen level and triggers arousal, a \"wake-up now!\" response, which generally lasts three to fifteen seconds; longer arousals typically cause the person to awaken fully. This condition can go undetected and persist for years, but those affected may feel poorly rested and have trouble remembering things. As few as five arousals an hour may be enough to cause a person to feel chronically sleepy; some people with severe cases experience an average of 30 arousals hourly. Left untreated, the combination of low blood oxygen levels and poor sleep can have a disastrous effect on health, wellbeing\u2014and potentially the gut microbiome. Both population studies and experimental studies have shown a provocative connection between inadequate sleep and increased risk of both obesity and diabetes. \"Good sleep is important for maintaining optimal health, but people don't always realize the impact that sleep has,\" says [Erin Hanlon, PhD](https://microbiome.uchicago.edu/directory/erin-hanlon), from the University of Chicago Sleep Research Center. [Seminal](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673699013768?via%3Dihub#fig2) work led by UChicago researcher [Eve Van Cauter, PhD](https://microbiome.uchicago.edu/directory/eve-van-cauter), showed that sleep deprivation hinders the body's ability to control blood sugar. In fact, after about a week of sleeping only four hours a night, study participants showed their first meal of the day elicited peak blood sugar responses akin to aging about 30-40 years. Interrupted breathing presents a major barrier to sleep quality. Every time an arousal occurs, the sleeper goes back to stages of lighter sleep\u2014problematic, because the brain needs to cycle through specific sleep stages each night. In just three nights where subjects' deepest sleep was disrupted, researcher [Esra Tasali, MD](http://www.uchospitals.edu/physicians/esra-tasali.html), found a 25 percent decline in insulin sensitivity\u2014a hallmark of type two diabetes\u2014similar to gaining between 17 and 27 pounds. \"The mechanisms between sleep loss, body weight, and blood sugar control are not well understood,\" Hanlon says. \"Sleep loss might be affecting the function of the microbiome which, in turn, influences body weight and glucose regulation. It could possibly be the other way around, or perhaps a multi-directional relationship.\" A [recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep35405) published by a UChicago team with international collaborators provided some clarity. They compared two groups of mice for four weeks, repeatedly disrupting sleep every two minutes (as in severe sleep apnea) in one group while the other slept undisturbed. Mice with repeatedly disrupted sleep demonstrated increased appetite, diminished insulin sensitivity, and an accumulation of fat concentrated underneath the abdominal muscles and around the organs in the gut. This particular fat also showed indications of elevated inflammation. The researchers noted changes in both the type of bacteria and the metabolic products those bacteria produced. Despite these interesting relationships, the exact mechanisms were unclear. The team went on to create a model with cells that mimicked intestinal barrier tissue, the tissue critical for keeping waste and bacteria in the intestine while letting nutrients pass through. They exposed the model tissue to intestinal contents from both mouse groups. The tissue grown from sleep-disrupted mice proved to be leaky; that from the well-rested mice held its own. Next, the team inoculated germ-free mice with microbiota from each of the mouse groups. The germ-free mice given bacteria from the sleep-disrupted group increased their food intake and went on to develop tell-tale signs of inflammation and insulin resistance\u2014despite no disruption to their sleep and no change in body weight or visceral fat. This work provides some tantalizing clues to the consequences of disrupted sleep, which raises some practical questions. Would a healthy gut microbiome protect against the development of obesity or diabetes in the face of a sleep-deprived world? Perhaps the answer to sound sleep is waiting deep within our guts.

She had found this post-doctoral opportunity\u2014with eminent scientist Eugene Chang, MD\u2014that would allow her to study how the microbiome contributes to inflammatory bowel disease, knowledge that someday might improve the lives of the 1.6 million people who suffer from this debilitating, often lifelong condition. But she found UChicago offered an opportunity she never expected, one with impact much more immediate than \"someday.\" Never did she think she would be going into business. It just so happened that a more advanced post-doctoral colleague in her lab, Joe Pierre, had just recognized some interesting things about a fungus named Candida albicans. Candida, which grow well only in the human body, usually cause fairly solvable problems, like vaginal \"yeast\" infections. But Candida are shapeshifters. Usually oval (in the \"yeast\" mode), they can also convert to a hyphal form\u2014a filament with a point at one end. And minor changes in its environment can cause rapid switching. The problem is, hyphae can wreak havoc in the gut. They use their tips to break out of the human digestive system and into the blood stream. The result, for those with cancer or HIV or otherwise compromised immune systems, is a potentially deadly infection. On the other hand, Candida in yeast form are valuable members of the gut community. They stimulate the gut lining, significantly reducing our susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease, influenza infections, and other conditions. So eradicating Candida is not a winning strategy. Another complicating factor is that fungal cells, unlike bacteria, are structurally similar to our own. This makes finding agents that target them without attacking human cells very difficult. What Joe, now on faculty at the University of Tennessee, noticed was that there were certain peptides\u2014smaller versions of proteins\u2014that specifically prevent Candida from going from yeast to hyphal form. They are like fairy dust that could keep your basically good children always on their best behavior. Joe's next move was to pull together a team to make this discovery useful to the greatest number of people. He enlisted Katie and Dr. Chang, and they looked to the [Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/) to help get the discovery out of the lab and into clinics and homes. The goal: develop a safe, effective product that would help prevent dangerous Candida infections in immuno-compromised patients. They started building a company: [AVnovum](https://www.linkedin.com/company/avnovum-therapeutics-inc/), named for the novel AVpeptides they were creating to maximize the \"fairy-dust\" effect Joe had discovered. The [AVnovum](http://wgnradio.com/tag/avnovum/) team entered the [Innovation Fund](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/programs-events/innovation-fund/) competition run by the Polsky Center. They knew that in order to be competitive they would need a strong business pitch as well as a good scientific idea, so they enlisted Myles Minter, a post-doctoral scientist at UChicago with a degree in intellectual property and an aptitude for business. A large, experienced panel of business experts heard their pitch and [awarded the team](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/2017/06/05/innovation-fund-invests-500000-in-microbiome-research-and-energy-companies/) $150,000 to develop and test improved AVpeptides. Monica Vajani, a Booth student also trained as a biomedical engineer, enthusiastically joined the team to help. With Joe off to his faculty position in Tennessee and Myles accepting a position at [William Blair](https://www.williamblair.com/), she and Katie became the \"boots on the ground\" to move this fledgling business forward. Katie redoubled her efforts in synthesizing a variety of AVpeptides, about 30 so far, to see which worked the best to keep Candida in line. She first tests the peptides \"in vitro\"\u2014in a petri dish where the Candida is growing by itself\u2014and will eventually test in various animal models. She has already demonstrated the new compounds can improve effectiveness. Meanwhile, Monica is collaborating closely with the Polsky team to put AVnovum on solid commercial footing. She developed a business plan, with the help of advisors at [MATTER](https://matter.health/), who have extensive drug development experience. Once Katie identifies the best peptide candidates, they will concentrate on finding the most cost-effective ways to produce these in bulk, perhaps in the lab, or maybe via a biologic, using living microorganisms, plants, or animal cells to manufacture the compounds. Next will come preclinical toxicology tests, clinical trials, etc.: a long road, but perhaps a profitable one. Candida poses a $3.5 billion burden to the health care system, and those with Candida bloodstream infections have mortality rates as high as 30 percent. There are currently no safe and specific treatments for this subset of immunocompromised patients. The AVnovum team hopes to change that fact soon. The peptides can be given orally and are so specific to defanging Candida that demonstrating safety is likely a slam-dunk. For those at highest risk\u2014those on high-dose corticosteroids or about to receive an organ transplant or being treated for cancer\u2014the AVpeptides will likely be used prophylactically, to prevent infections in the first place. Katie has surprised herself with her own involvement in this business venture. \"Entrepreneurial science was something I never had an interest in,\" she says. \"I got involved with biological research because I find the natural world absolutely fascinating. \"But I am thrilled to know that my work can actually improve lives. If this treatment ends up available to patients, my work in the lab would contribute to preventing fungal infections in a safe and effective way. I still love performing research in basic biological concepts, but I now have a greater appreciation for how that research can be used to improve human health.\" As sources of government and corporate funding flow and (mostly) ebb, capturing the monetary value of scientific discovery may be essential to advancing the boundaries of knowledge. Good science is expensive, but it is the surest road to progress. That is why the growing partnership between the [University of Chicago Medicine](http://www.uchospitals.edu/index.shtml) and the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation may be one of the most critical facets of the [Duchossois Family Institute](https://dfi.uchicago.edu/).

It took her three minutes to jog from the lab back to her apartment; living close to work is a big perk when you are collecting microbial samples from mice at 2 a.m. Katya wants to know what microbes are doing in the middle of the night, and so she routinely gives up sleep to collect samples. For years, scientists have observed that our bodies function differently throughout the course of a day. Body temperatures, hormone levels, immune function, and metabolism all exhibit daily rhythms, oscillating over the course of 24 hours. In fact, this year's [Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2017/) was awarded to researchers for their discovery of the biological underpinnings of this circadian clock, now known as a powerful influence in maintaining health. Researchers at the University of Chicago are investigating how the vast community of microbes that live in and on the human body participate in this daily dance, and Katya is an important member of this team. In 2015 [Vanessa Leone](http://changlab.uchicago.edu/personnel/name/vanessa-leone/), PhD, and [Eugene Chang](http://changlab.uchicago.edu/), MD, published some breakthrough research on the [circadian rhythms of the microbial community in the gut](http://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(15)00123-7) using mice as their model system. Their work showed that the abundance and function of microbial species living in the guts of mice differs depending on the time of day and that these fluctuations influence whether or not the mice became obese. How does this happen? The major biological clocks in our body are set by light/dark cues. But the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tract never see the sun, so how could they know the time of day? One part of the answer is the diet of their host. What, when, and how much the mice eat directly affects what nutrition is available to their microbes. Leone and Chang's 2015 experiments fed one set of mice a regular, low-fat, high-fiber mouse chow and another set a high-fat diet. Perhaps not too surprisingly, the mice on the high-fat diet gained much more weight. When the team examined both the mouse fecal matter and contents of their digestive systems, they found starkly different microbial composition between the two groups. Surprisingly, in the mice fed the low-fat diet, the types of bacteria changed in abundance and function over the course of 24 hours, and so did the waste products they put out, with levels rising and falling depending on the time of day. In the mice on the high-fat diet, the bacterial balance varied much less, as did their waste products, sending a steady stream out to the liver, one of the main organs involved in metabolizing fat. Perhaps the microbes on the high-fat diet lost track of time and confused the rhythm of the liver? Or was it the liver that was somehow telling the microbes what time it was? And how do the oscillations in microbial populations influence metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes? These are the questions that Katya and Dr. Leone's team are seeking to answer. Modern life\u2014with its electric lights, shift work, constantly available food, and quick and easy international travel\u2014assault our biological rhythmicity, the sleep/wake cycles developed over eons of evolution. Circadian disruptions are associated with higher rates of metabolic disorders, increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, abnormal cholesterol levels, obesity, and elevated risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and even some cancers. Maybe understanding and being able to manipulate the 24-hour variations of our microbial tenants can help prevent some of these outcomes. And so Katya continues to visit the lab at all hours of the day and night, observing how microbial populations are expanding and contracting, digesting their host's food and spitting out waste products, in an effort to communicate with the host that provides their habitat. Each time Katya's alarm sounds in the middle of the night and she flips on the lights, perhaps her own microbes are startled out of rhythm in reaction to their host's strange and unexpected behavior, altering their own behavior in response. Katya says she knew what she was signing up for when she chose this research, but she finds working on such a fascinating problem worth the stress on her own circadian rhythms. Her hope is that studying these mice and their bacteria carefully may provide powerful knowledge that will help us restore and maintain circadian rhythms and promote wellness.

PAD occurs when plaque\u2014an amalgam of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances\u2014builds up on the walls of the arteries to the arms and legs. These corroded \"pipes\" can restrict or even stop blood flow, particularly in the legs and feet. The person with PAD may feel no symptoms, but many begin to notice that walking or climbing stairs causes leg pain or numbness which stops on resting. The skin on their feet and legs may look pale, blue, or shiny, and nail and hair growth often slows or stops completely\u2014all indications that oxygen and nourishment are not getting where they need to go. Over time, people with PAD have increasing difficulty with walking; they are more likely to lose their independence, with major impact on quality of life. Those with very advanced disease may develop sores on the feet and legs, which often heal slowly, or not at all. They are also at risk for problems in the arteries in the heart (coronary artery disease) and in the brain (cerebrovascular disease). Because of the strong connection between plaque in the legs and other parts of the body, PAD is one of the largest risk factors for both heart attack and stroke. While the disease can start as early as age 40, incidence increases significantly with age. By age 70, more than ten percent of men and nearly as many women are dealing with PAD. For African Americans, the numbers are nearly twice as high. Clinicians know that smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes can set up PAD, but not everyone with these risk factors develop the disease. Physician-scientists are beginning to understand that inflammation\u2014the body's complex immune response developed to protect against microbial pathogens or other irritants\u2014is also a major player, causing plaque to develop inside the artery walls. But how to pinpoint the irritants that invoke this response? There are millions of kinds of microbes in, on, and around us that could be causing this immune response, but the vast majority\u2014especially those in our gut\u2014are essential for keeping us healthy. University of Chicago scientists engaged in the fight against PAD are now focusing on the complex interplay of the immune system, inflammation, and the microbiome. Better understanding of the mechanisms involved may yield new tools and strategies against the disease and the heart attacks and strokes that can follow. The researchers are coming at this problem from three angles: in the lab, in the clinic, and in the broader population. - In the lab, they are feeding mice high-cholesterol diets to see how the microbial balance in each mouse affects the development of plaque in the arteries. By then transplanting fecal matter from healthy humans into mice with PAD, the team can see if changing the bacterial balance in these mice slows or stops disease progression. - In the clinic, the team is tracking patients with serious PAD, those with wounds so severe they must have surgery to improve blood flow in hopes of preventing amputations. The team will track how the balance of bacteria, both in the patients' gut and on their skin, affects blood flow to damaged tissues. By pairing extensive clinical data about these patients\u2014including measures of inflammation in the blood and studies of genetic information \u2014with information on the microbial populations present in each patient, the team aims to identify the balance of bacteria that promotes healing. - In the wider population, the investigators aim to track 100 patients with PAD over two years. In this much broader group, they hope to discover the connections among each patient's microbiome, immunological markers, imaging tests that measure arterial health, and, importantly, functional status\u2014through a walking test\u2014to gauge how the microbiome affects not only disease progress but also quality of life. The investigators will also track the participants' diet and physical activity, two factors well known to influence the microbiome and PAD. Because UChicago Medicine has developed relationships with patients of such diverse ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds, this study can yield findings to suggest new treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of individuals. Each of these three studies will inform the others. This three-pronged approach is a classic example of how academic research drives better medicine: 1) find ways to get at the underlying biological mechanisms of health and disease; 2) translate that understanding to address the critical problems of the sickest patients, and 3) develop the knowledge that can help the broader population achieve wellness and the most satisfying life possible.

In recent years, [food allergy rates among children have risen sharply](https://www.foodallergy.org/life-food-allergies/food-allergy-101/facts-and-statistics), increasing approximately 50 percent between 1997 and 2011. Why is the problem growing? Let's go back to the nineteenth century, when the findings of Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, and many others were converging on an essential function of the human body: immunity. The immune system was so named because it seemed to \"exempt\" the body from attack by microorganisms. Given that microbial infection was thought to be the primary cause of immune reactions, it seems counterintuitive that people today\u2014more free from infectious disease than ever\u2014would be so heavily crippled by inflammation, the quintessential immune response. But decades of research reveal that a hyper-reactive immune system underlies autoimmune and allergic diseases, leading to severe conditions such as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening. In the same way that a healthy immune system reacts robustly to the intrusion of foreign toxins and microbes, a hyper-reactive one can respond just as dramatically to certain foods. Despite the increasing prevalence of food allergies, current treatment options are problematic. Searching for new solutions, scientists have turned to the gut microbiome, the teeming ecosystem of microscopic organisms occupying our gastrointestinal system. For some 800 million years, we have been building mutually beneficial relationships with the microbes that dwell within our gut. But over the past few decades we have drastically altered the environment that they call home, thanks to widespread antibiotic administration, extreme sanitary practices, and especially a high-fat, low-fiber diet. Our dietary choices affect the species of bacteria that live within us. Our microbes eat what we eat, taking a small cut of our food in exchange for synthesizing nutrients that we need but cannot make ourselves. Many bacteria ferment what we cannot digest, such as the soluble fibers in vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes. As a byproduct, they produce anti-inflammatory molecules called short-chain fatty acids. Bacteria known as Clostridia are star performers. [Cathryn Nagler, PhD](https://naglerlab.uchicago.edu/), and her team have pinpointed Clostridia as key peacekeepers in the gut microbiome. Using mice born and raised in a microbe-free environment, Nagler's group has demonstrated that introducing Clostridia blocks sensitization to food allergens. The microbes foster an anti-inflammatory environment within the gut in multiple ways, promoting the secretion of mucus along the gastrointestinal lining and producing a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate, which nourishes cells in the colon. These help to create a protective barrier in the gut, which prevents allergens\u2014like peanuts and milk\u2014from encountering pro-inflammatory immune cells. These findings might soon change how we treat allergies. Nagler has teamed up with [Jeffrey Hubbell, PhD](https://ime.uchicago.edu/hubbell_lab/people/jeffrey_hubbell/), of the University of Chicago's [Institute for Molecular Engineering](http://ime.uchicago.edu/), to [launch the start-up ClostraBio](https://itm.uchicago.edu/news-postcat/new-uchicago-company-launched-to-create-first-food-allergy-medications/) in order to [commercialize novel food allergy remedies](https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2017/07/23/clostrabio-is-developing-a-cure-for-food-allergies.html). Their aim is to develop novel, targeted treatments to restore the protective barrier naturally provided by peacekeeper microbes. For centuries, we have appreciated the protective functions of the immune system against microbial attack. We have memorialized the contributions of Pasteur and Lister in everyday words like pasteurization and Listerine\u00ae, concentrating on the harmful bacteria that we must eliminate to remain healthy. But in fact, only about 2 percent of all microbes are pathogenic\u2014the rest are neutral, beneficial, or even essential to our well-being. While there is no doubt that modern sanitary practices have reduced the scourge of infectious disease, we have come to understand that though \"bad\" microbes can cause disease, \"good\" bacteria can also prevent it. Just as plants depend on microbes to extract vital nutrients from the soil, scientists now hypothesize that animals only achieved mobility when we learned to carry within our bodies the microbes necessary for our survival. Maybe it's high time for us to appreciate the importance of our symbiotic pact with the microbes that helped make us who we are today.

Like a growing number of Americans\u2014 [33,600 in 2016](https://www.unos.org/us-organ-transplants-set-record-in-2016/)\u2014they received life-saving organ transplants. When vital organs like the lungs, heart, liver, or kidneys are destroyed by disease or genetic conditions, organ transplantation is the only cure. Many of these organs come from people who sign their organ donor cards, in the hopes that even in tragedy they might be able to save someone else's life. [Marisa Alegre](https://biomedsciences.uchicago.edu/page/marisa-alegre-md-phd-0), MD, PhD, and her team at the University of Chicago are trying to learn how to prolong survival for both the transplanted organ and the recipient, to get the most benefit from this final, amazing gift of life. Surgical recovery is only the beginning for transplant recipients, because the life-saving organ comes from another person and their bodies know it. Our immune systems evolved to protect us from infections, but some microbes can burrow inside our cells to avoid detection. To leave clues about where these stealthy invaders are hiding, infected cells leave \"breadcrumbs\" on their surfaces, by-products of what the invaders are making inside. Like drug-sniffing dogs on a raid, immune cells hunt down these clues in the body's nooks and crannies. If they find something unfamiliar, they howl and send the DEA agents, the T cells, into defensive action. It's a great system, except when someone receives an organ transplant. Then the immune system attacks the foreign cells, thinking it's fighting a massive infection. To pacify the immune system, organ recipients face a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs. Unfortunately, this stupefies their T cells and leaves the recipient vulnerable to infection and cancer. In rare cases, the immune system and the transplanted tissue reach a truce. In these \"tolerant\" individuals, the new organ survives without the immunosuppressive drugs and the immune system still protects against disease. Clinicians usually find these outliers by accident: the patient stops taking his or her immunosuppressants for medical or financial reasons and yet still survives, perhaps even thrives. Many researchers, including Alegre, took note of these lucky unicorns. They reasoned that if we better understood how these patients became and stayed tolerant, we might be able to improve outcomes for many more transplant recipients. Several years ago, the teams of Alegre and Anita Chong, PhD, showed that severe [bacterial infections could cause transplant rejection](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8566) in previously tolerant mice. Then, they set out to test how the [ microbiome - the collection of bacteria that live on the mice - affects transplant survival](https://jci.org/articles/view/85295). First, they treated mice with antibiotics. This didn't wipe out the entire microbiome, but killed off all the antibiotic-sensitive members. They found that treating both donor and recipient nearly doubled the survival time of the transplant. Next they looked at germ-free mice, special experimental animals born and raised in bacteria-free bubbles\u2014an exceptionally expensive but irreplaceably useful laboratory technique. As with antibiotic-treated mice, foreign tissue transplanted in germ-free mice lasted longer than usual. The team then exploited an icky but valuable characteristic of mice: they eat poop. Alegre's team fed the germ-free mice the poop of mice with a normal microbiome: a fecal transplant. Germ-free mice that were fed normal mouse poop rejected the organ grafts as quickly as the normal mice. But when the germ-free mice got poop from antibiotic-treated normal mice, they rejected the organ graft as slowly as their brethren who remained bacteria-free. It appears that at least one of the normal components of the mouse's microbiome\u2014one sensitive to the antibiotics\u2014was causing the immune system to reject the new organ faster. This work suggests that we might be able to increase transplant tolerance in humans by treating them with specific antibiotics. And if we can discover the exact bacteria causing the rejection, we might be able to use a short-term antibiotic targeted very directly at eradicating the trouble-makers, perhaps even in the case of organs harvested after a donor's death. Weeding out the microbial agitators while leaving most of the patients' microbiome intact may allow doctors to limit the immunosuppressants prescribed and help keep their patients healthy for a new life with a new organ.

What he saw prompted him to fire off a letter to the Royal Society of London, describing the \"animalcules\" he realized were living in his mouth. We now appreciate that these microbial creatures are everywhere on Earth, thriving even in hostile environments the likes of which other animals could never tolerate\u2014underneath Antarctic glaciers, within bubbling asphalt lakes, inside hydrogen sulfide gas caves. Some, like Leeuwenhoek's \"animalcules,\" grow just fine in the presence of oxygen; other \"anaerobes\" can't tolerate air at all. Bacteria are important members of every ecological niche. We like to give plants all the glory for producing the oxygen necessary for life, but photosynthetic marine and freshwater inhabitants actually produce [half of the oxygen we breathe](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/06/0607_040607_phytoplankton.html). Meanwhile, bacteria living in the soil are often model citizens, breaking down nature's waste to obtain nutrients for themselves and recycling the rest into building blocks for new life. What's more, the human gastrointestinal tract houses over three pounds of bacteria that break down our food and provide us with essential vitamins. With the fundamental roles that microbes play in our daily lives, it's important for us to understand them. But how do you physically and genetically dissect something so small? Scientists initially solved this problem by growing individual strains of bacteria in rich broths to study their biological properties, including their DNA. Soon enough, they ran into a roadblock: less than 1 percent of the bacteria on Earth could be easily cultivated. Studying the other 99 percent was going to require some new tools. Thus, the field of metagenomics was born. Metagenomics technologies allow us to directly sequence the entire genetic contents of all microbes living within a habitat. Unfortunately, sequencing the collective genetic makeup of even a 2,000-member community means several million DNA fragments. Although accurately piecing them back together into coherent genomes provides essential insights to microbiologists, the task is not much different than simultaneously assembling 2,000 jigsaw puzzles with all the pieces mixed into one huge pile. Yikes. A. Murat Eren, PhD\u2014known to colleagues as Meren\u2014and his team at the University of Chicago are at the frontier of developing the computational tools necessary for this daunting task. They have created several flexible, open-source software packages that allow users to dig deep into their data while retaining command of their analysis. These tools enable scientists to reconstruct novel microbial genomes from environmental samples, study their evolutionary relationships to other organisms, and investigate their abundance and distribution, as well as their functions. Collectively, the approach can tell us a lot about the biological traits important for a given microbe to survive and promote various environmental conditions, including health and disease. In 2015 Meren and his team launched [anvi'o](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/), an advanced analysis and visualization platform. Using this software, scientists can ask a wide range of questions about the metagenomes they are studying through a highly intuitive, fully customizable interactive interface. The team has produced [many highly comprehensive tutorials](http://merenlab.org/2016/06/22/anvio-tutorial-v2/) for users. Anvi'o has already been cited by more than 50 publications, ranging from studies characterizing the human microbiome to articles debating the origins of humankind. Meren and his team make the software freely available online, for researchers all over the world. At UChicago and affiliated labs at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and at Argonne National Laboratory, Meren's tools are helping colleagues re-envision the future of microbiome research. Scientists are using the tools to study the use of [antibiotics during pregnancy](http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(17)30891-4), fight [serious infections](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-017-0270-x), understand [ gut inflammation](http://mbio.asm.org/content/7/6/e01713-16.full), and even [survey oral \"animalcules\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965363) much like those Leeuwenhoek saw in his mouth centuries ago. This research would be impossible without scientists like Meren who also excel in computational technologies. With outstanding tools at the centerpiece of the efforts, these collaborative efforts will help us gain knowledge about the microbiome, which will improve health for millions. As it has been through eons of human history, scientific discovery and tool development are like the chicken and the egg, totally dependent on each other. But Meren and his team put the scientific chicken first: \"Although the inherent link between the tool and thinking will continue to bind them together, we believe it must be mostly the intellectual curiosity that drives the direction of science, and not the comfort of what is available. We intend to maintain our flexibility, and let the incoming questions shape and re-shape our software.\" [ ](https://voices.uchicago.edu/dfiwellnews/2017/10/26/head-stalk-and-b-cell-building-a-better-vaccine/) Oct 26, 2017 | [Medicine](https://voices.uchicago.edu/dfiwellnews/category/medicine/), [Vaccination](https://voices.uchicago.edu/dfiwellnews/category/vaccination/) by Ren\u00e9e de Pooter, PhD Staff scientist in the Department of Pathology Every year as the days get shorter and kids head back to school, we are reminded of both the vulnerability and the importance of our immune systems. Your doctor, your family and friends, maybe even your employer asks if you've had your flu shot yet. It's an important question. The CDC estimates that the 2015-2016 flu season cost the US economy [$7 billion](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flu/activities.html) in lost productivity and contributed to [12,000](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/2015-16.htm#table3) deaths. And those who have survived the flu aren't likely to forget the cough, high fever, muscle pain and sheer debilitating exhaustion. Every year, vaccine manufacturers churn out 179 million doses of vaccine, an estimated [$1.6 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/19/the-16-billion-business-of-flu.html)/year industry. That's a lot of money for something that does not always work well. Every year, flu vaccine manufacturers have to make an educated guess about which strains of flu to include in their vaccine, based on the recommendations of the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2017_18_north/en/). In the northern hemisphere, the guessing game starts in spring, to assure there are stockpiles of that year's vaccine ready before the December-to-March flu season. There is no sure way to predict how the flu will mutate from year to year. Like an errant monk distracted by worldly thoughts, the flu virus is a poor copyist: every time it replicates it makes little mistakes that cause small changes, called \"antigenic drift.\" More dramatically, because some types of flu can infect pigs or fowl as well as humans, these animals can pick up a completely different version of a gene from another virus that infects the same animal. Those viruses can undergo an even more profound \"antigenic shift,\" as if the befuddled monk started one day by copying from an entirely different book. The 2015-2016 flu vaccine was pretty successful, with an estimated [vaccine effectiveness](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm) (VE) of 48 percent. The 2014-2015 vaccine was less effective and had an overall VE of just 19 percent. More worryingly, it's hard to predict real wild-card events, like the antigenic shift that created the 1918 pandemic. By tapping into our immune system's memories, [Patrick Wilson, PhD](https://biomedsciences.uchicago.edu/page/patrick-c-wilson-phd), associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, hopes his research will lead to a universal flu vaccine, one that will protect everyone, perhaps for a lifetime. The best vaccine targets are the proteins that stud the outside of the virus particle like sprinkles on a cupcake. If the vaccine can goad the body into making antibodies that lock onto the sprinkles, the virus can't infect human cells. Over time, scientists have learned that the most protective antibodies tend to focus on a protein called hemagglutinin. Hemagglutinin is shaped like a lollipop, a slender stalk with a big blob\u2014the head region\u2014at the end. While the stalks of different flu strains are pretty similar, the head regions are highly mutable, changing every year. Unfortunately, immune-soldier cells\u2014the B cells\u2014tend to get fixated on the sugary ball of the lollipop and ignore the blander stalk. In doing so, they miss the chance to create an immune memory that would offer broad protection against multiple strains of flu. Viruses have evolved to use this sneaky distraction technique to elude the host's immune system. To better understand how vaccines and the flu shape our immune system, Wilson and his group looked at individual B cells in people vaccinated against the flu. They found that the B cells that produced antibodies against the stalk were hold-overs from previous immunizations/infections, multiple-tour soldiers called [memory B cells](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/316/316ra192.short). They went on to prove that the antibodies made by these stalk-specific memory B cells could protect people against [new strains of flu](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/74374) they'd never encountered, confirming that immunity to the stalk confers broad protection against the flu. Wilson's group is now working to better understand which vaccination strategy would get the body's B cells to ignore the tempting head region and make more antibodies against the stalk. If they can figure this out, we could design vaccines that protect against the flu year after year, saving thousands of lives and billions of dollars.
