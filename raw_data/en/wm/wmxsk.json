I have been a client of Paws & Claws Animal Hospital and Holistic Pet Center for a little over a year now and I can't say enough good things about this business and their staff. My dog has been under Dr. Messonnier's care from the first day I stopped in to inquire about their holistic practice. I switched veterinarians looking for more options for my dog who was suffering from a recurring tumor on her leg. The staff there is absolutely wonderful! They will welcome you as soon as you walk in the door and immediately take to your pet as if he/she is their own. During my visits and appointments, Dr. Messonnier quickly realized the challenges in getting my dog the care needed to get her back to a healthy state. He always offered recommendations and explained all the options so I fully understood everything before leaving the appointment. Recently, my dog required a lifesaving surgery which occurred during the stay-at-home ordinance. Dr. Messonnier and staff absolutely went above and beyond to help me save her life. The staff made phone calls, posted on social media and even included an article in their weekly newsletter. My sweet girl is here with me today because of the doctor and staff at Paws & Claws Animal Hospital. I am forever a Paws & Claws client and would recommend them to any one with pets.
