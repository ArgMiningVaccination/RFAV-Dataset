GLOBE-TE X INDUSTRIES TENSILE STRENGTH TESTER L) MACHINE DESCRIPTION : Tensile Strength and elo ngation are the two prime characte ristics of most of the raw materials, whether t hey are metals ; or non-met als such as r ubber, leather, tex tiles, plastic paper; or finished products such as rods, wires, ropes, yarns belts etc. These pr operties ver y often pla y the major ro le in determining the suitability of any raw material fo r any specific app lications. It is, therefore of utmost importance to d etermine the se characteri stics accurat ely, conveniently, and quick ly. The Tensile Testing Machines provi de a relative ly inexpensive way for determining the tensile strength and elongation of a variet y of raw mate rials such as rubber , leather, fabric, plastics, belts wires etc., They are based on constant rate of traverse principle in which one end of the test specimen is held in a and screw arrangement . The load ex erted on the stationary grip is measured by a pendulum dynamo meter, wher e the angular movement of the pend ulum because of application of load is converted into the moveme nt of a poin ter on a calibrated circular dial indicating the load directly in kilog rams or Ne wtons. A dummy pointer is provide d to indicate the maximum load exerted b y the te st specimen before it fails. The load measurement range is sub divided into three or four sub r anges which can be attain ed by addition / removal of calib rated disc weights from the pe ndulum.

Sim ilar troubles are also caused when dyed yarns processed in the package dyeing having woven or knitted into a fabric, because the fabric thus p roduced is f ound often to include so me yarns dyed which sh ade rem arkably different from other yarn this is because of the difficulty in distinguishin g slight color difference between one and another packaged yarn before weav ing or knitting. The dyed yarn processed in the package dyeing m ust also be classified by color diffe rence into som e group of yarns in unified color, by using the knit test pieces representing the color consistency or shade of yarn in each package. FEATURES : GLOBE-TE X INDUSTRIES For production fabrics of the unified stitches and loops the needle cyli nder is locked and the cam s rings to drive needles and sinkers are designed to circulate round th e needle cylinder. Extra cylinders are easily ex changed thanks to the above needle cylinder and cam rings m echanism . The fabric takedown rollers are desig ned to ro tate accord ing to an am ount of the fabric produced and give a constant tension of the fabric. SPECIFICATIONS : 1. Cylinder Diam eter : 3, 3.5 inch 2.

GLOBE-TE X INDUSTRIES UNIVERS AL TESTING MACHINE Features of Electronic Control Panel Measuring system consists of m icroprocessor pa nel with serial in terface software. In fully computerized system , you are dependent on the type of computer used. Becau se in this system ADD- ON cards are used, fitted inside th e com puter. In case of any problem related in the com puter the system halts. Also due to fast chang es in the co mputer hard ware, size o f the cabin ets etc. no on e can guarantee long life of the sy stem . In our system mcroprocessor panel work indepe ndently. It shows load, extension and displacem ent digitally. Also it has keyboard for data entry. Test results and graph can be obtained from panel itself if you connect dot m atrix printer to panel. So it works independent of PC. PC is must only when 0.2% proof stress and data storage is requ ired. Also w ith our system any computer of any m ake and si ze with RS232 port can be used. i Highlights: ystem is independent of the type of com puter used for comm S unication.
