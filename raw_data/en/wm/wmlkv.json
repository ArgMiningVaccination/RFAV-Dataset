Viral RNA XRelease of viral RNAEndocytosisAttachment Endosome AQCH site of actionVIRUS In vitro mode of action of AQCH against Dengue suggested that it interferes with the endosomal release of the viral RNA. Since all +strand RNA viruses use the similar endolysosomal pathway for the release of their genetic material, this drug candidate had a strong case for testing its efficacy against novel COVID-19. Anti-COVID-19 activity of AQCH was confirmed against COVID-19 at ICGEB, Trieste through In vitro studies. Human safety studies of AQCH completed and phase II clinical trials for anti-COVID-19 treatment is in progress. 64DBT-ICGEB, Sun Pharmaceuticals, IIIM-CSIRDBT-MINISTRY OF AYUSH INITIATIVE ON SARS-COV-2 VIRUS AND COVID-19 DISEASE A joint DBT-AYUSH action plan formulated and implemented Network programme launched involving four DBT's institutions along with NMPB and CCRAS of Ministry of AYUSH Fifteen medicinal plants along with eight traditional Ayurvedic formulations shortlistedInitiated screening of selected medicinal plants and traditional Ayurvedic formulations focusing on in vitro tests against SARS-CoV-2 along with testing immuno-pharmacological, toxicological and drug interaction studiesAbout 50 plants known in traditional system of medicine in tribal areas of Odisha to be screened 65DBT-ILS EVALUATED TRADTIONAL KNOWLEDGE-BASED traditionally known for anti viral activities collected from Similipal Biosphere Reserve and Gandhamardhan Hills.High content and High throughput screening initiated with variou solvent extracts.Aim to identify bioactive fractions with capability to restrict growth of SARS-CoV2 virus.Assessing bioactive fractions/compositions with capability to induce immunity to AQCH FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19 PATIENTS Repurposing of anti-dengue botanical drug (AQCH) for COVID-19 (developed jointly by ICGEB, CSIR-IIIM and Sun Pharma) AQCH has shown anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in in-vitro studies Human safety studies of AQCH completed and drug has been found safe at the recommended dose for Phase II clinical trials First phytopharmaceutical drug approved by DCGI for Phase II clinical trial for COVID-19 Clinical trials in progress across 10 centres in India covering 200 patients. 67DBT- RGCB SCIENTISTS DEVELOPED TWO VERSIONS OF SARS COV2 PSEUDOVIRION ASSAY Being used for the testing of anti Covid solutions from industry and Academia More than 200 samples tested CURRENTLY BEING USED FOR THE VALDIATION OF PRODUCTS FROM ALL OVER INDIA 68GENOME ANALYSIS OF SARS-COV 2Coordinated by National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG-Kalyani), West Bengal.

Other collaborating National Institutes and clinical organizations RNA GENOME SEQUENCING CONSORTIUM West Bengal - NIBMG Institutes: 70HAPLOTYPE DISTRIBUTION: REGION WISE Within haplotypes different states appear to have different proportions. East and North are similar. West and South are similar. 71TEMPORAL CLADE DIVERSITIES: PAN INDIA Haplotype diversities peaked between March-May, early part of the outbreak. By June A2a (20A/B/C) emerged as predominant haplotype The temporal haplotype diversities landscape appears to be similar PAN India East (West Bengal & Odisha) South (Karnataka & Telangana) West (Maharashtra) North (Uttarakhand, Haryana & Delhi) Pan India 72ASSOCIATION OF HIGH VIRAL LOAD WITH A2A (CLADE 20) Marginally significant association of sequences belonging to 20A, 20B and 20C with lower Ct values of diagnostic Real Time PCR assay compared to those belonging to 19A and 19B 73HIGHLIGHTS The Consortium has achieved its initial goal of completing the sequencing of 1000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with samples across 10 states covering different zones within India. The sequence data will soon be released in public domain (GISAID database). Initial results indicate that multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in India, probably introduced by travel from Europe, USA and East Asia. In particular, there is a predominance of the A2a haplotype (20A/B/C) with D614G mutation, which is globally reported to be associated with enhanced transmission efficiency.Future Directions: Study the implications of mutations in Virus Entry, Immunogenicity and Pathogenesis using VLP model Identify host genetic polymorphisms that either confers susceptibility or protection from the viral infections.
