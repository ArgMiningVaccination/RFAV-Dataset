NTIFS will drive sustainable economic empowerment and prosperity into tribal areas through a reimagined North American food system that also addresses the health impacts of injustice. - Indigenous food markets in the US 3% 3% - Indigenous food restaurants in the US 1% 1% - Indigenous land in the US 100% 100% INTRO Indigenous Food Lab We offer high-quality Indigenous foods and products to our community.
