By Mark Sircus Ac., OMD Introduction I have been going through a struggle of spirit recently as I have walked through the deepest darkness the earth has ever known. And I have been struggling to find my way back to my voice, to my heart that just knows which way to go and what to say. About two weeks ago I deliberately decided to take a trip into the deepest pit of hell, into the dark subject of Pharmaceutical Terrorism knowing instinctively what I was going to find. Those who know me the longest or who have looked deeply into my work World Psychology knows I have already traveled many roads and mapped out many dark corners of our race consciousness. From 'economic eugenics,' to a wide diversity of terrorism practiced by the most unlikely people, from rape to child sexual abuse, I have turned over many stones. But now we have to turn over the heaviest one, we have to confront the kind of evil that feels nothing about the killing and murder of millions upon millions of people each year including newborn babies. These past few days has challenged my soul greatly as I opened my heart to an incredible evil that is lurking on earth whose principle instrument of torture and killing is chemical. In this opening I experienced a moment of real anger, anger at myself at how I have had the hood pulled over my own eyes by the professional propaganda people whose job is to do just that. The truth is that most of us do not know our own ignorance and for some people that's the same thing as saying that we do not know our own evil. I say this for some people define evil as ignorance and I believe this does provide a solid definition, at least in part. Evil is only a word, (injustice does nicely in its place), and many new age people would have us doubt its existence and many of the religious right would have us imagine evil in a way that does not help its eradication at all. Perhaps one of my conclusions these last days is that our ignorance of evil, our refusal to look at it in its full manifestation and ugliness is perhaps the greatest evil because it gives evil its power and position on the center stage of human affairs. This denial and refusal runs deep in the psycho-spiritual make up of mankind and is in fact the basis for much of the work of therapy that modern psychology deals with everyday. The denial of reality is well known in psychological circles, but true to form, it seems that many or most psychologists are not aware of their own denial of their own ignorance. Thus denial takes us into spiritual issues, into the dark side of the force or the death principle, as Sigmund Freud would put it. Until recently I saw the greatest darkness centered around sexual violence and sexual child abuse, the violence against the environment with the resultant effect of pollution and global climate change that is heading us quickly into disaster. (20,000 Europeans died from the heat this summer) If we want to be aware of what is comingone just has to look to the poles where we can see most easily the problem because they are quickly losing their ice. (One percent per year according to the folks at the Goddard Space Center) Then a year ago I centered my consciousness on economics and the financial rape of humanity by a handful of people and wrote about this in The Terrorism of Money and Debt, and in my essays on Usury and capitalism. Norwegian polar researchers, tops in the field, were predicting that the Arctic Ocean's ice cover would completely disappear by the middle of this century. The nightmare part is not rising sea levels since ice already displaces its water volume. Rather it is the radical change in \"albedo,\" the amount of solar energy reflected from the surface. Right now Arctic ice is a huge mirror sending heat back to space; remove the ice, however, and the clear blue sea absorbs immense additional amounts of solar energy. Warming, as a result, will suddenly accelerate. ~Tom Davis I cried many tears since my son was born reading about the experiences of many parents who either lost their children after being vaccinated and the overwhelming flood of grief and anger from parent whose children have been left seriously damaged though left alive. Its hard to believe that in less than fifteen years that in the United States that the autism rate went from approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in about 200 without anyone in the 'official' medical community really willing to look honestly at why. I am sorry to say that disaster has already hit, that we have struck the iceberg and it is taking many people down into despair. After looking carefully at the vaccination subject I have come to the conclusion that pediatricians are extremely dangerous to babies and have dirtied the profession of medicine in a most disgusting way. In writing about the psychology and history of Pharmaceutical Terrorism I found the unbelievable common thread and a source of evil of a magnitude that staggers the imagination and soul. The truth is that the greed of human nature coupled with capitalism and pharmaceuticals equals disaster and it all started long ago with slavery and the first commercial drugs of high profit, with sugar and then to a lesser degree with tobacco. Near the end of the story we have a race of beings enslaved to an industry whose only interest is making money through the chemical poisoning of human beings. The chemical companies that produce the pesticides and herbicides and many a toxic chemicals like aspartame that are added to foods, are in the front lines of a form of terrorism very difficult to fathom. Certainly it's pretty difficult to stomach. Human greed gave rise to an exceptionally poisonous idea, perhaps the most evil idea in human existence, the idea of short-term gain or profit. With this as the backbone of corporate philosophy the way was cleared to earn this profit at the expense of not only the environment but at the expense of people's health and even their very lives. It became politically correct to earn ones fortune killing, enslaving and causing disease in others. Hitler's excuse and insanity had to do with ideas of racial purity, his corporate sponsors excuse was money and the power that flows from it. Our denial of the truth of what is issuing from the pharmaceutical and chemical companies will perhaps bury our race for not only are they sucking the health out of people but they are polluting the environment to the point where the ice will melt and the temperatures will sore. Denial is the principle weapon of evil and is essentially the attitude that takes us away from life. On all levels denial works powerfully in our minds and the cost is usually high in personal terms but in social terms it spells disaster. There have already been many revelations and scandals about the darker side of medical science that should have seriously damaged our trust in scientists and government institutions. It is my hope that the information provided herein will destroy all trust andthat a mandate will eventually develop to totally reformulate the entire medical, pharmaceutical, scientific and governmental agencies involvement in the area of health and medicine. The following material will confront some of the most deeply held beliefs that are held in modern society, beliefs that FDA approved drugs and vaccines are safe, that our governmental agencies are working to protect the public, that doctors are knowledgeable benign beings who care about us, that the western allopathic medical paradigm is good and a truth to be trusted, that we have a wonderful future thanks to technology and imminent medical breakthroughs, that we can relax and enjoy life knowing that everything is going to be all right, that the future is safe for our children, and that we are awake and aware free thinking beings who know where we have been, our history, and where we are going as a race. Many have said that when presented with new information or ideas 96% of people will spend their time and energy defending their current beliefs and only 4% will embrace the new unless a crisis of great proportion rolls in like an avalanche. It is my hope that a walk through the darkest corridors of hell, through the medical and pharmaceutical industries, will hit you the reader hard enough to awaken you to something that even the most aware are not yet conscious of. By combining history with the psychology of these areas perhaps we can begin to break the strongest chains that have been set up around our minds, which have had devastating effects on our hearts and souls. Through this confrontation with evil it is my hope that we will grasp its true nature and that we will organize ourselves in a way that has at least a minimal hope in stopping it before humanity as a whole is brought to its knees in a devastating slaughter of 'innocents' that will overtake billions. Know that from the heart of this evil radiates out a madness that has overtaken most all, a suicidal impulse of truly global proportions. This evil holds the reigns to much more than we would ever believe and the truth is that most people look at this evil and think it good. That is correct, evil has evolved itself to such an extent that it has fooled the vast majority of us into believing it to be beautiful and benevolent especially as it incarnates in the form of medicine and science. Evil walks the world today in three-piece suits, white lab and medical coats, cloths that somehow hide monsters from hell from clear view. They look normal and that has become the standard of evil, it has become normal and occupies the central stage in the human struggle for life, beauty, health and sanity. The following materials will change our very definition and feeling about evil, the dark side of life. The danger of confronting evil is seen in the self-righteousness that develops in people who can only see this darkness in others and not in the self. We all have a light and a dark side, a healthy and sick self, and intimate knowledge of both sides, our strengths as well as our weaknesses is essential to understand the darkness in a useful way that is sweeping up and out from the centers of money, power and medicine combined together into a most lethal cocktail that is destroying the health of our bodies and world simultaneously. It is a matter of racial survival and the situation is demanding a radical shift in humanity, more radical than we all realize.The Most Indecent of Men \"Among all criminals and murderers the most dangerous type is the criminal physician.\" Miklos Nyiszli Prisoner and pathologist to Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz. Viktor Frankl wrote a long time ago, \"From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two - the \"race\" of the decent man and the \"race\" of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people.\" In the concentration camp there was no one who wielded terror like the Nazi doctor. He was the ultimate indecent man. Under the hands of doctors' innocent men, women, and children were gassed, poisoned, frozen to death, and vivisected. They were injected with typhus and malaria. They were exposed to mustard gas, killed in high-pressure chambers, injected with lethal bacteria like gangrene and tetanus, injected with salt water, forcibly sterilized during fast and bloody operations, infected with jaundice, deliberately poisoned, exposed to incendiary bombs, and literally skinned, among other horrors, like forced sterilizations, hypothermia tests that killed human subjects, deliberately injecting tuberculosis bacteria in children, forced abortions, as well as lethal injections to kill sick prisoners. \"Psychologically speaking, nothing is darker or more menacing, or harder to accept, than the participation of physicians in mass murder\" wrote Dr. Robert Jay Lifton of the Nuremberg Commission. Inside the camps the Nazi doctors, scientists, and nurses performed criminal experiments on live patients. There are men who utterly fail their profession and all sense of humanity, men who do things that the rest of us cannot even begin to imagine. The Nazi doctor showed the world how doctors are able to completely pervert their Hippocratic Oaths, how completely a doctor can stand in disregard of their moral duty to their fellow humans, patients, and profession. There are many unanswered questions regarding this betrayal of humanity by doctors. The facts are relatively easy to obtain but the more we look at what happened the less comprehensible it becomes. How could it happen that men of medicine and science could so utterly betray all sense of decency? The facts of history scream out that some doctors are capable of the most disgusting, brutal, offensive, and shocking behaviors the world has ever known. The question of course is can it happen again? Or worse, what will make us all sick is to discover that it is still happening, that certain medical men are still finding ways to betray humanity in ways even more cruel than the Nazi doctors who at least did not experiment with their own children. Primo Levi, an Auschwitz survivor and author of numerous books on the Holocaust, made a prescient warning after the war: \"It happened, therefore it can happen again.\" His chilling words have proven true in Tibet, Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia, and Iraq since the defeat of Nazi Germany. It might comes as a shocking surprise that the same hold true for the doctors, the cruel evil of the Nazi doctor has carried on in the medical profession, meaning doctors are still inflicting horrors on people and still doing experiments on humans without proper consent.Lethal injections were a common crime of the Nazi doctor, neat and simple in its application, cruel and horrid in result. Doctors were found in 1947 to be guilty of the most heinous crimes in the history of the world, partially because they had the medical knowledge and skill to inflict suffering and pain with scientific precision and partially because of a special mental sickness and cold arrogance of being that seems to be unique to 'certain' members of the medical profession. Nazi history highlighted a trend that was long in coming in the medical and pharmaceutical areas, an undercurrent of darkness, arrogance and terrorism; a bestiality of spirit which now has overtaken great parts of the medical profession. Today there can be no possible doubt that evil exists and that there are people who are capable of extremely destructive behavior. Any lingering doubts on this score will be swept away by an evening spent in front of the television. Alice Miller A careful study of pharmaceutical terrorism entails taking a trip into the darkest places that exist in humanity and it is no accident that when we make the journey we find ourselves in places where doctors and scientists work together as they did in Nazi Germany. This subject takes us to the bottom cellars of hell, into the deepest and darkest dungeon, into a place and into a type of person that defiles the very nature of beauty, love, a place where all semblances to the human heart is lost in darkness. The Nazi doctors offer us a view of even greater monsters that have remained invisible from view, dressed as they are eternally in business suits. There is a direct line of continuity that can be traced between a group of men and companies that arose to the heights of industrial power years before Hitler, men and companies who existed and supported the rise of Nazi Germany, and who continued on to the present day in comfortable corporate luxury and power. The personnel, infrastructure and technology of companies like Bayer, for example, have flowed on continuously through 3 incarnations of corporate name and structure. The greatest criminals in the history of the world actually were not these Nazi doctors; they were and still are the people who populate the top hierarchies of the giant pharmaceutical and chemical companies of the world and the men and woman who shuffle back and forth between these companies and the CDC and the FDA in the United States. Bayer, and Hoechst, were originally one company called Interessengemeinschaft Farben or IG Farben. When we enter several of the huge transnational companies that produce toxic chemicals found in pesticides, herbicides and industrial and household products we enter a world of people that perhaps will shame us about the very nature of humanity. The people who have run these companies for over a hundred years have the most incredible business plan. The same companies that produce toxic chemicals that pollute and destroy our health and environment also are the same ones that produce prescription drugs, veterinary medicines, a wide array of medical products and imaging technologies, hold cancer treatment and medical device patents, and produce a staggering assortment of over-the-counter drugs. Is it a trick of fate or a well thought out business plan that has them profiting first from the sale of pesticides, herbicides anda thousand outer chemical products like mercury, (that they secretly put into many products like vaccines without doctors or us being aware), into products and drugs that cause damage to human bio-systems, and then has them making even greater fortunes from the symptoms and chronic illnesses that they trigger in the ever increasing populations that fall victim to their products. Yes that means first they make money getting us sick and then make money poisoning us further in the pretense of getting us well. It's the biggest con came in the history of the world and nets certain people billions of dollars a year. This circle of profit is not a fantasy or conspiracy theory, but one of the most demonstrable and easily provable facts of every day modern existence. The major groups and forces that shaped the medical system, as we now know it, are the pharmaceutical and chemical companies and the people heading up and profiting most from them. That's correct. Chemical and pharmaceutical companies are in the business of manufacturing toxic chemicals and drugs for the purpose of making money, so much that these industries have produced the wealthiest people the world has ever seen. That is P-O-I-S-O-N like in danger, hazard, beware, and handle with care type of substances that you do not want around your children. When we investigate these companies and their history we enter a disgusting subject area inhabited by people who can only be defined as monsters from hell. Historically we are talking about the same people that stood behind and supported Adolf Hitler. The U.S. government investigation of the factors that led to the Second World War in 1946 came to the conclusion that without IG Farben the Second World War would simply not have been possible . We have to come to grips with the fact that it was not a psychopath, Adolph Hitler, or bad genes of the German people that brought about the Second World War. Economic greed and an incredible ugliness of spirit inherent in companies like Bayer, BASF and Hoechst brought about the Holocaust . Drug companies are supposed to be in the business of making drugs for health and well-being, not to kill people. Chemical considerations have played a role since ancient times. If ingestion of lead caused the fall of the Roman Empire, then what will the injection of mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, and a host of other chemicals, medicines, high levels of sugar, aspartame, do to the American empire? Harris L Coulter, Ph.D. wrote, \"A major cause of the Roman Empire's decline, after six centuries of world dominance, was its replacement of stone aqueducts by lead pipes for the transport and supply of drinking water. Roman engineers, the best in the world, turned their fellow citizens into neurological cripples. Today our own 'best and brightest,' with the best of intentions , achieve the same end through childhood vaccination programs yielding the modern scourges of hyperactivity, learning disabilities, autism, appetite disorders and impulsive violence.\" The information we come across in our investigation of pharmaceutical terrorism belies these words with the best of intentions because we now know the intentions and motives behind the people who administrate scientific and medical staffs at the pharmaceutical companies. Their intention and motive has never been health it has always been and is money.Nazi doctors and scientists at Auschwitz were called the \"ultimate biological warriors,\" by Dr. Robert Jay Lifton for their acts of carrying out Nazism's extreme racial eugenics. Real strength comes from understanding history. When it comes to medicine and vaccines it is important to free our minds from unconscious fears and the overriding conditioning that has been printed onto our brains like circuit boards. We need to see the unscientific basis of vaccines and the lack of medical ethics in their administration, as well as understand the historical perspectives. I.G. Farben attempted to shake its abominable image through corporate restructuring and renaming after World War II and they succeeded beyond their wildest imagination. Today their activities are completely hidden from site and the roots of their existence buried because most people cringe even at the mention of the word Nazi. Perhaps this is actually their greatest victory. Perhaps they have conditioned society to avoid any discussion of the past, which is actually very recent. Sixty years ago was yesterday in a sense yet for some reason we avoid as much as possible all thought of it. Some people pretend it never happened so deep do the roots of denial go. All of this is important when looking for medical truth and sanity because it is exactly that which was abandoned by the pharmaceutical and chemical giants in the beginning of the 20th century. Many are the horror stories that have come from this insanity. Forty years ago, for instance, the world was shocked by the thalidomide tragedy \u2014 when regulatory agencies in many countries approved a drug that caused damage to the fetus in early pregnancy. About 8,000 mothers worldwide who used the drug as a sleeping pill or as a remedy for morning sickness during the late 1950s and early 1960s gave birth to children with flipper-like arms and legs, missing fingers and toes and/or organs in the wrong places. The drug was ultimately banned in 1962. This was a high profile situation that has been repeated time and time again in more subtle ways with many other drugs and vaccines which are sold to us as safe but hold hidden horrors that we just do not want to see. The tragedy and lie of western medicine comes home to its most cruel and crude state with the vaccination of children. According to Harold E. Buttram MD there was a little-noted letter-to-the editor in the New England Journal of Medicine, in 1984, about an interesting German study. In the study, a significant though temporary drop of T- helper lymphocytes was found in 11 healthy adults following routine tetanus booster vaccinations. \"Special concern rests in the fact that, in 4 of the subjects, the T- helper lymphocytes fell to levels seen in active AIDS patients. The implications of these two studies are enormous. In regards to this German study, if this was the result of a single vaccine in healthy adults, it is sobering to think of the possible consequences of multiple vaccines (18 vaccines within the first six months of life at latest count) given to infants with their immature and vulnerable immune systems,\" wrote Buttram. Medical professionals now hold sway over much of life, and like modern day priests who we mistakenly worship and respect, we have surrendered and lost much to something whose evil has deep roots. At the core of western medicine is the allopathic paradigm that is controlled by the pharmaceutical giants and it is exactly here where we find men who can hardly be called men controlling the fate of much of humanity. The people who bring you your Bayer Aspirin are the same folks who built and ran the Auschwitz Concentration Camp .Nothing Has Changed Auschwitz was the largest mass extermination factory in human history. Few people know that Auschwitz was a 100% subsidiary of IG Farben which now lives on as the Bayer Aspirin company. On April 14, 1941, in Ludwigshafen, Otto Armbrust, the IG Farben board member responsible for the Auschwitz project, stated to his IG Farben board colleagues, \"our new friendship with the SS is a blessing. We have determined all measures integrating the concentration camps to benefit our company. \" The pharmaceutical departments of the IG Farben cartel used the victims of the concentration camps in their own way: thousands of them died during human experiments such as the testing of new and unknown vaccines . Bayer experimental drugs were tested on Auschwitz prisoners. One of the SS doctors at Auschwitz, Dr. Helmut Vetter, a longtime Bayer employee, was involved in the testing of Bayer experimental vaccines and medicines on inmates. He was later executed for giving inmates fatal injections. \"I have thrown myself into my work wholeheartedly,\" he wrote to his bosses at Bayer headquarters. \"Especially as I have the opportunity to test our new preparations. I feel like I am in paradise.\" The Nuremberg War Criminal Tribunal convicted 24 IG Farben board members and executives on the basis of mass murder, slavery and other crimes against humanity. Amazingly however, by 1951 all of them had already been released, continuing to consult with German corporations. The Nuremberg Tribunal dissolved the IG Farben into Bayer, Hoechst, and BASF. Today each of the three daughters of the IG Farben is 20 times as big as the IG Farben mother was at its height in 1944, the last year of the Second World War. More importantly, for almost three decades after the Second World War, BASF, Bayer and Hoechst (now Aventis) each filled its highest position, chairman of the board, with former members of the Nazi regime . The Nuremberg Code is based on the principle of informed consent and this is exactly what doctors, nurses, health care agencies like the CDC, FDA, APA, WHO and the pharmaceutical companies violate with common vaccination policies. The less we know the better is the mantra of these people, organizations and companies. \"The Nuremberg Code\" was promulgated by four American judges acting under the authority of the U.S. military. The key principle is the requirement for informed, voluntary consent by the individual subject of experimentation. The Code makes no exceptions for members of the military or the exigencies of war. Although U.S. law has not made authoritative use of the Nuremberg Code, the guidelines adopted by the National Institutes of Health in the mid-1950s were based on the \"ten commandments\" of Nuremberg, and provided that \"every volunteer must give his full consent to any test, and he must be told exactly what it involves.\" During the Persian Gulf War, the FDA granted a waiver permitting the use of pyridostigmine bromide and anti-botulinum vaccine, without consent. This was the first instance in which an official government agency officially sanctioned the direct violation of the Nuremberg Code,\" stated Jane M. Orient, M.D., Executive Director, Association of American Physicians and Surgeons in written testimony submitted to the Subcommittee on National Security, VeteransAffairs and International Relations, Committee on Government Reform in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999. In 1998, the pharmaceutical giant, Bayer, conducted pesticide experiments on humans in what was called the Inveresk trials. Three years later the company behind the tests stands accused of breaking the Nuremberg Code. The Sunday Herald in England reported that subjects were given a single dose of a substance called azinphos-methyl (AM) and then observed for seven days. Azinphos- methyl is one of its most widely used pesticides, sprayed on apples in the Pacific northwest, blueberries in Maine and sugar cane in the deep South. But it is highly controversial, even in America. In Louisiana in 1991, a flash thunder storm caused azinphos-methyl to run off sugar cane and into rivers, killing up to a million fish, along with turtles, alligators, snakes and birds. Six weeks ago Canadian officials reported that azinphos-methyl was found in high concentrations in the Wilmot River, where up to 15,000 fish had died. Three years ago the EPA reported that exposure to the pesticide caused enzyme changes in the red blood cells of 127 Californian farm workers, creating fears about potential nervous system damage. By accepted legal standards, the Bayer Company of today is, in fact, the Bayer of World War II. As such it is being sued by survivors of medical experiments such as Eva Kor who with her sister survived the most terrible experiences at the hand of one of the most terrible medical monsters who ever lived, Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz Psychopaths are notorious for being both charming and completely without remorse for even the most cruel and heartless acts. And most serial killers are sociopaths. They are able to kill with moral impunity because they are unable to feel remorseful, incapable of empathy. They are manipulative, shrewd and crafty. Psychiatrists really haven't a clue as to how to rehabilitate a sociopath. So what about these men who have worked such terror the likes the world has never seen before? What marks a truly indecent mental man is an attitude that scoffs at the suffering of others; an attitude that sees others who feel, suffer, cry and experience the agony of being a being on this planet as beneath their dignity to entertain. The great difference between the psychopath and sociopath that inflicts personal harm one on one and the man in the suit who directs others to do the same on a huge international scale is that one is diagnosed as being mentally and emotionally very ill, and the other is respected for making a huge profit making other people sick. Modern psychology has completely failed the human race for it has excluded from the roles of the criminally insane the psychological profiles of a group of men who control the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, men who take it as their duty and destiny to slowly torture and kill uncounted millions of other humans through slow, and sometimes quick chemical poisoning. The general nature of 'evil' is to not have consciousness of the effect that our actions have on the worlds of others. Thus ignorance and evil are really the same thing. Some people know and understand that p sychopaths are extreme versions of what is common in many people. The lack of heart and the lack of empathy is a chronic epidemic in humankind. At one end of the spectrum we have the heart that cares and listens to others and at the other, the sociopath and psychopaths who have clearly lost all capacity to feel, all capacity for empathy and real caring of others. But now we have something entirely new to deal with in the industrial era that psychology and psychiatry have failed to deal with. What can we say about men who are guilty of mass murder,slavery, torture, medical experimentation and other crimes against humanity? What should we think of the guy in the suit who has decided somewhere along the line that humans do not matter for anything and as such can be used in any way desired with the basic motive or objective of making money poisoning them from the first days of their lives. The movie the Matrix was not far off at all and the tubes that were unplugged from Neil the hero are in real life the chemical dependencies that are initiated by these master criminals. The poisons of these pharmaceutical companies do what they are meant to do by people of evil mind and being who know what they are doing. Their products (starting with vaccines) create medical problems and complications that demand the application of more drugs that cause other problems, which demand even more and more and more. Today there are billions of people totally dependent on their local pharmacies, the drug pushers of these enormous pharmaceutical and chemical giants. It is the uncaring that hurts our beings, the lack of heart, and the steel coldness of the mind that is always seeking power, dominance and control over the vulnerable heart that drag and keep humanity chained in darkness suffering and pain. The leaders of the pharmaceutical and chemical industries control a great a great part of our society and human life through controlling what we eat (all the pesticides and preservatives in our food and now in the form of genetically engineered foods) and then when we get sick from these products of theirs they control the medical industry and a whole army of drugs (also highly toxic demonstrable the long list of side effects that are listed in the product information provided with each drug including products as simple as aspirin) that we are programmed to take when we begin to feel ill. It is not commonly known that pharmaceutical interests control medical research and medical schools and have most health professions dependent on them. They have moved into crucial branches of government and for all practical purpose control the FDA and the CDC because many of the people who work inside of these organizations, whose sole purpose is to protect the public, come from the giant pharmaceutical companies and hold stock in them. To maintain and secure their position of power, the pharmaceutical companies have been manipulating governments around the world for decades and the world mass media are completely in their pockets. Thirteen of the world's leading medical journals mounted an outspoken attack on the rich and powerful drug companies in September of 2001, accusing them of distorting the results of scientific research for the sake of profits. The Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and other major journals accused the drug giants of using their money - or the threat of its removal - to tie up academic researchers with legal contracts so that they are unable to report freely and fairly on the results of drug trials. And yet we can tell that we are really in trouble because when even prestigious medical journals have the courage to stand up to their advertisers, and still the results are nil, where can we hope to find the silver spike that we can drive up through these companies hearts to get them to stop their campaign of terror. Mandatory vaccine programs are \"A violation of the Nuremberg Code in that they force individuals to have medical treatment against their will, or to participate in the functional equivalent of a vast experiment without fully informed consent. Jane Orient, M.D. In expensive, well thought out and designed, large-scale advertising campaigns the pharmaceutical PR and propaganda department have created a smoke screen so thick and blinding that the man and woman on the street cannot see the hills from the valleys, cannot see that the true interests of the pharmaceutical industry are to make fortunes through the mass poisoning of the human race. These men have completely gotten away with their crimes making a mockery of the entire criminal justice system, have made governments into their personally trained monkeys who do exactly what they want them to do, the media into dupes who have lost all sense of integrity, and an entire race of beings into dependent drug addicts who suck down their products and pay for the privilege. They have helped create a social and criminal system that spends an enormous amount of money and social resources hunting down and imprisoning people for the use and sale of 'illegal' drugs while the real drug lords remain comfortable in their castles of gold that wall them off from the general population of the earth. Perhaps the real truth is that they are not human at all like the super computers that took over the earth in the Matrix. Or perhaps they provided the original inspiration for the movie. Inventors of illnesses earn their money from healthy people, whom they persuade are ill in either never-ending media campaigns or by the promotion of unhealthy practices like the mass consumption of foods lased with hormones, preservatives and pesticides. Once an invented illness has reached public awareness, patients and health insurers pay out for the medicines and therapies to treat it without complaint. The pharmaceutical companies live very comfortably behind the high walls of self- images that they have deliberately created to deceive us. They portray themselves in the light of Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch and other pioneers in medicine successfully hiding the truth of who they really are. They claim to be interested in the eradication of diseases in order to serve humanity when the truth is they deliberately create disease to expand their markets and profits. \"The pharmaceutical industry does not act in the tradition of the protector of humanity, but in the tradition of the IG Farben, a group of organized criminals willing to sacrifice countless human lives in order to maintain their profits\" says Dr. Rath who has filed a case against them at the world court at the Hague. Many are the examples but one of the most outstanding ones is the story found with aspartame. Aspartame is an rDNA derivative that the Pentagon once listed in an inventory of 'prospective' biochemical warfare weapons submitted to Congress. But instead of poisoning enemy populations, the \"food additive\" is currently marketed as a sweetening agent in some 1200 food products. Perhaps one of the chief problems with this substance is that internally, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids and methanol, which degrades into formaldehyde . Children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of aspartame probably because formaldehyde is totally intolerable to biological systems. It is one of the few chemical substances for which the FDA and the EPA have set no tolerable limits yet it is also contained in some vaccines.The chief patent holder of the sweetener is the Monsanto Co., based in St. Louis. In 1967, Monsanto entered into a joint venture with I.G. Farbenfabriken, the aforementioned financial core of the Hitler regime and the key supplier of poison gas to the Nazi racial extermination program. In view of Monsanto's Nazi, chemical warfare ties, and the fact that aspartame is a potent stand-alone poison, NutraSweet is a can of worms unprecedented in the American food industry and casts an extraordinarily long shadow across the integrity of the FDA and the American Medical Association that should have screamed bloody murder over the issue. The history of the product is laden with flawed and fabricated research findings, basically a barrage of blatant lies provided by a battery of independent medical researchers, all of which were used as the basis of FDA approval. Aspartame is a deliberate poisoning of the masses. Auschwitz taught doctors and scientists how to kill their fellow humans without remorse, a lesson they did not lose but only sharpened in the decades after the defeat of Nazi Germany, for many of these men were freed soon after the war and took up powerful positions in the international pharmaceutical and chemical companies. Doctors and scientists participated in every stage of the murder factory, from direct experiments, to lethal injections, to supervisions at the \"ramp\" where prisoners were selected for gas chambers. This legacy provided a blueprint for the next generation of indecent men of medicine and science who were left free to improve on their methods by taking them underground. The medical staffs of many hospitals and mental institutions participated in the killing of tens of thousands of innocent persons . It has recently been estimated that at least 200,000 handicapped, mentally ill and other institutional patients, who were deemed physically inferior, were murdered by doctors and hospital staff using gas, drugs or starvation to kill disabled men, women and children at medical facilities in Germany and in present-day Austria, Poland and the Czech Republic. In internal documents, the Nazis cynically referred to the deaths as mercy killings. These crimes were meant to be kept secret, the doctors in charge worked under false names as the Nazis turned six hospitals in Brandenburg, Grafeneck, Hartheim, Sonnenstein, Bernburg and Hadamar into killing grounds for what they referred to as \"euthanasia.\" Other clinics and hospitals were soon added as the program expanded making hospitals and medical staffs a kind of training ground for the Nazi regime to \"fine tune\" its \"technology of death\" before the Holocaust. My final conclusion after forty years or more in medicine is that the unofficial policy of the World Health Organization and the Save the Children's Fund is one of murder and genocide .\" Dr Kalokerinos MD This \"technology of death\" was not lost and though we have no individual gas chambers, millions around the world today die of air pollution as the entire atmosphere is being turned into lethal gas. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills 3 million people annually, three times the number \"who die in automobile accidents.\" A study published in 2000 (Lancet) demonstrated that air pollution was \"responsible for more than 40,000 deaths annually\" in France, Austria and Switzerland. In the U.S., \"air pollution claims 70,000 lives annually.\" This exceeds 10 times the number of traffic fatalities and equals the annual mortality \"from breast and prostate cancer combined.\" Air pollutants are known to produce arterial constriction and reduceblood flow and oxygen supply to the heart. More importantly, the principle chemical pollutants found in the air have no safe level; they damage humans even at very low levels. Vaccination is a biological weapon at the service of biological warfare. It permits the targeting of people of a certain race, and leaves the others who are close by more or less untouched. Vaccination enables the selection of populations to be decimated. It facilitates targeted genocide. It permits one to kill people of a certain race, a certain group, a certain country. And to leave others untouched. In the name of health and well-being, of course. Guylaine Lanctot, M.D The chemical and petrochemical companies are at the heart of an evil that is shared by the pharmaceutical companies, which never forgot about the lessons learned from administering lethal injections. It is the height of our ignorance (not innocence) that assumes these men and woman and their practices have simply disappeared with the death of one man, with Adolf Hitler and the military defeat of his regime. Instead of disappearing their \"technology of death\" has been taken onto a truly global scale with newborn babies being the first in line to be subjected to chemical injury, pain, and sometimes even death. In the middle of all this darkness is the modern day doctor and nurse with shining white self-images doing the dirty work for good pay. Medical politics is the art of sheer power. There is no compromise: you go right for the jugular vein before your own is torn out. There's no room for compromise because churches never compromise on canon law. In medical politics there is a rigid authoritarian power structure, which can be moved only through winner-take-all power plays. Doctors who have dared to change things significantly have been ostracized and have had to sacrifice their careers in order to hold to their ideas. Few doctors are willing to do either. Dr. Robert Mendelsohn Mendelsohn speaks of medical reality, an ugly reality. There is really no escaping the conclusion that modern medicine turned an ugly corner way back when, and doctors, all the ones but the few Mendelsohn talks about, are not really doctors who can think for themselves and who have integrity in their work. These rigid authoritarian power structures are fascist in effect and mimic the same kind of manifestations seen in the early church, which would not allow any kind of dissent. Doctors act more like priests of a fixed system then physicians who know how to use their own feelings, intuitions, best rational judgment, and basic personal touch to help people with their health and healing. In fact when it comes down to it that's not the paradigm that they work from at all. Health and healing are strange subjects to modern day physicians for they have been trained and are obedient to a system that works much more with poison and its administration than health and healing. The most incredible and most disturbing truth of modern day life is that most of the drugs people are taking are not for their benefit or enjoyment, and certainly not for healing and the improving of health. They are for the profit and wealth generated for anelite group of men and women who live incredibly high on the hog while laughing constantly at our monumental stupidity. Medicine has been made to server the most evil of all the capitalists and this was accomplished through control of the medical schools that produce the professional personnel who are pounded into submission through a type of training and indoctrination that modern day cults can only envy. It is little known that John D. Rockefeller was the original genius that thought up the subversion of medicine through his philanthropy of medical schools. Through his and others efforts medicine was made to serve selfish capitalist designs, which included ignoring the most important factors that contribute to both health and disease. The United States maintains an overwhelming lead in the production and sale of drugs. Eleven of the eighteen leading pharmaceutical firms are located in the United States . It is a historic fact that the Rockefellers took an early lead and now dominate this area. In the earliest years of the twentieth century Rockefeller , with the help of a young American Medical Association , gained control of America's healthcare industry by taking over control of medical schools. This gave them access and direct control over the conditioning process that shaped young doctor's core belief systems. R ockefeller spent more than $100 million (at that time a huge fortune) to gain control of the nation's medical schools and turn the nation's physicians to the allopathic school dedicated to surgery and the heavy use of drugs. While the exploding costs burden the health system, the pharmaceutical industry is doing great business. In 2002, the year of general financial crisis , the profits of the ten largest pharmaceutical companies again rose by a handsome 13 per cent. This rich industry spends more on marketing than on research. The big pharmaceutical companies use a third of their profits and personnel to promote their medicines in the market. The trade in illness works in several different ways, as described by the Australian medical critic Ray Moynihan: Normal life processes are sold as medical problems . For example, after the company Merck & Co. discovered a remedy for hair loss, the international PR agency Edelman started a campaign. It fed journalists with studies: a third of all men, it said, suffered hair loss. Additionally it had come to light that hair loss led to panic attacks and emotional difficulties and reduced chances of candidates being appointed for jobs. What was not said was that Merck & Co. sponsored these studies itself and that Edelman had sought out the medical experts who had dictated the quotes to journalists. Rare symptoms are presented as rampant illnesses. Impotence has spread to an astonishing degree since introduction of the potency pill Viagra. On the Viagra manufacturer Pfizer's internet website, it says: \"Erection disorders are a common health complaint that should be taken seriously: roughly 50 percent of men between the ages of 40 and 70 are affected\". The Hamburg urologist Hartmut Porst, one of the world's leading potency researchers, considers this blanket statement to be completely exaggerated: \"Absolute rubbish\". Personal and social problems are reformulated as medical problems . The transformation of healthy people into sick ones is particularly successful in psychiatric medicine because there is \"no lack of theories according to which almost all people are not healthy\", as the Hamburg doctor Klaus D\u00f6rnermockingly puts it. The number of mental disorders in official 'classification systems' has increased at a correspondingly swift rate. Just 26 disorders were listed in the catalogue of the American Veteran's Administration after the Second World War. The currently valid 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' (DSM-IV) of the American association of psychiatrists contains 395 different complaints. Risks are marketed as illnesses . As normal levels for cholesterol and bone density are lowered, the group of sufferers increases. Juggling risk factors will speed up to an unprecedented rate in the next few years as a result of the recently concluded decoding of the human genome. Genes are being discovered that trigger or increase the likelihood of illnesses in later life almost every week. In future these may also include 'illness genes', which supposedly contribute to socially unacceptable behavior. The moral philosophers Jacinta Kerin and Julian Savulescu believe that this radically alters our view of health: \"By these means, genetics will underpin a view that sees all of us as 'sick' in some respect or other\". The future seems very, very dark. It will continue to be so unless all Americans, each time they see their flag waving in the breeze, realize that this emblem now symbolizes in this year of our Lord 2003 that Americans can kill anybody they want to for any reason we choose, even if that reason is a lie. Walter Cronkite If a man like Walter Cronkite can speak words like this about the government services imagine what can be said about the people who are into the massive poisoning of human beings. What can we say about people and a system that has allowed the worst criminals and most evil of beings to take responsibility for things like food production and medical products like vaccines and other medicines meant to heal and cure? Dan Goleman said, \"A psychological fault line is common to rapists, child molesters, and many perpetrators of family violence alike: they are incapable of empathy. This inability to feel their victim's pain allows them to tell themselves lies that encourage their crime.\" But now we have to develop an entirely new psychology to deal with what has become another psychological fault line that leads us to tell lies about these people. We lie to ourselves about them refusing to believe that such beings exist and inhabit the strongest halls of money and power on earth. We refuse to admit that these people are monsters worse then the ones that inhabit our worst nightmares. These men have gone beyond the human imagination, engineering suffering on a truly massive scale while simultaneously pulling the biggest scam of recorded history, getting the subject population totally into the insanity of it all by creating a massive blind spot to the reality of their activities among the subject populations. In movies and science fiction novels we can understand how and why an alien race might want to enslave and poison us but we are still very na\u00efve when it comes to our own fellow human beings. It is hard to think the worst about other humans and in this psychological aversion much evil runs free to do a harm. The men who ran Germany's death camps were scientists; they wanted to cleanse the gene pool and breed a super-race. They had no sense of right and wrong, and neither do many of the scientists who work for the NIH, the CDC, and the PHS. Stanley Monteith, M.D.Dealing with human nature is a great undertaking and dealing with the dark or negative side offers the most challenging task for any soul. Many people react to concepts like good Vs bad but they are just words/concepts that relate to any of the following dualities: good - bad, right - wrong, positive - negative, open - closed, listening - non-listening, healthy - sick, decent - indecent, honest - dishonest, caring - uncaring, remember - forget, acceptance - denial, sensitive - insensitive, and strong - weak. But can we escape the dualities of life? Many New Age people think or pretend they can because of their dire wish for a non-violent world, which is only getting more violent in the 21st century. When we avoid the duality we avoid the darkness and in doing that the darkness only takes heart and strength. Gandhi, the great revolutionary, understood the difference between strong, assertive, non-violent action and the incredible laziness of doing nothing whatever the reason. The overriding intelligence of empathy, of the heart and the mind working together, is wrapped up in a 'feeling sensitivity' to injustice and harm that is being done to both others and self. This sensitivity is cut very short when we fear looking into the black hole of either our own or other people's consciousness. When we avoid the dark side of the force we diminish the light. The large increase in medical diagnoses in industrialized countries has assumed grotesque proportions. Roughly 30,000 different epidemics and syndromes, disorders and illnesses have supposedly been discovered by the medical profession. There is a pill for every illness - and more and more frequently also a new illness for every pill. Deep Patterns of Violence \"According to statistical surveys (see Olivier Maurel, La Fess\u00e9e, La Plage, 2001) 90% of the people alive today believe that children need a \"good\" smacking from time to time if anything is to come of them. To one degree or another most of us were hit when we were small and fear the revival of the pain caused by the humiliation we went through. At the same time, we were told that it was \"all for our own good.\" Because we love our parents we suppress the pain and incorporate as truth what they say to us when they told us it was for our own good. \" Most of us still believe it and go around asserting that one cannot bring up children without blows, slaps, and smacks - in other words, without resorting to humiliation.\" Humiliation is a poison, it destroys the vulnerability and purity that children are born with and forces the creation of an ego defense system that distances us from the truth of our existence which has much more to do with love than it does with hate and violence. When it comes to the humiliation we received at the hands of our parents we had no choice but to deny the truth. \"For a maltreated child, denying suffering is the only hope of survival in an unbearable situation.\" Hitting children is not only useless but an actively dangerous act that encourages hate and the desire for revenge, feelings that will be unleashed against society later on. Every schoolteacher has to deal with this on a daily basis for it all pours out into the classroom from the children who are the most maltreated.Money-hungry pharmaceutical companies are partly to blame for the laws concerning cancer treatment. After seeking treatment in Mexico, Lela Lendman commented on U.S. treatment laws, stating, \"It's criminal, absolutely nothing short of criminal!\" The above represents the heart of Alice Miller, the famous psychiatrist's, theory for the formation of violence and evil in the world. And its most interesting that the evil we saw from the Nazi and from the chemical and pharmaceutical companies throughout the past century incorporates not only the violence, whether physically or chemically induced, but the same lies we had to tell ourselves as children. No these big companies and the people who work at the top in them cannot be monsters from hell , they have to be more like our parents, benign beings who know what is good for us. This is the truth of evil, it usually comes in a pretty package tempting us with good when in truth it is altogether bad. The vaccine story repeats this perfectly Cruelty and torture take us into some of the darkest pits of humanity. Is humanity cruel and prone to the practice of torture? Are the worst behaviors, that we would like to pretend do not exist in the medical and scientific community, really that uncommon? One just has to look at the common experiences in medical and scientific laboratories for the answer. And when one looks at what students of medicine and biological sciences are led to do in their basic training we can more easily understand how they have been conditioned to cruelty and the type of cold heartedness that would make them good tools for the designs of evil men. Each year, for instance, thousands of dogs, many of whom are former companion animals, are led into university laboratories, strapped to tables, and cut open so that students can view their hearts under a variety of conditions. Others are subjected to different surgical procedures at the hands of untrained and inexperienced students. The cruelty, futility, and stupidity of teaching human physiology and surgical skills on dogs is not lost on the students who are forced into a savagery against animals - and that does what to them psychologically? What is to stop certain humans from crossing the line and treating other humans as students are routinely taught to treat dogs in class? Des Moines University College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery has finally ended a controversial surgical exercise in which medical students cut off the nipples of live dogs and then sewed them back on. According to students who have participated in this exercise, dogs have awoken during \"surgery\" and have been kept alive for up to two weeks without receiving pain medication. In one evaluation of the exercise, a student wrote: \"The poor dog had to suffer a week with the botch job that most of us performed, including myself. One person in my group practically eviscerated [the nipple].\" Students at the University of Virginia who completed Psychobiology Laboratory 321 , report that rats used in the laboratory were subjected to \"extreme torture.\" Not only did \"untrained undergraduate psychology students\" inadvertently kill rats during instruction, they reportedly failed to ensure the animals were properly anesthetized prior to being butchered by the students. As a result, rats had their skulls drilled and swabbed and their skin peeled back and then stapled while fully conscious. In addition, two rats are said to have been \"baked alive\" on a heating pad set too high. Finally, some of the students reportedly joked about the suffering these animals were forced to endure. In many countries in the Far East, cruelty to animals is obvious and shocking. Western visitors to these countries are often upset at the brutality and wanton cruelty they have seen. But in fact, much more cruelty actually takes place in Western countries. Unlike in the Far East, the cruelty takes place behindclosed doors, and is carried out by corporations, rather than by individuals. In the West, most people have some affection for cats and dogs, and are upset when they hear of cruelty towards them. Yet the pig, an equally intelligent animal, is treated with complete brutality. In their natural environment, pigs would live in social groups, and spend much of their time rummaging for food. Before giving birth, sows make a nest and line it with leaves and twigs. In a factory farm, none of this is possible. The baby piglet is forcibly removed from her mother and kept for most of her life in a stall so small that she can barely move. While she is weaning her piglets, the mother is constrained by an \"iron maiden\" which prevents movement altogether. Because of the stress caused by this cruelty, pigs kept in factory farms often bite each others' tails. Instead of reducing the stress that causes this, farmers cut off their tails with a pair of side-cutters. Pale veal meat fetches a premium in expensive restaurants: the meat tastes basically the same as ordinary meat, but is pale because it contains very little iron. The flesh of very young calves is pale, but as soon as the animals are weaned and start eating grass their flesh darkens. In order to feed them up, while at the same time keeping their flesh light, they are kept on a liquid diet which contains just enough iron to keep them alive, but permanently anemic. They spend their entire lives in crates so small that they cannot turn round, nor sleep properly. This means that they are constantly uncomfortable, and are unable to groom themselves. They have no bedding, because they might eat this, and thereby take in iron. To add to the boredom and misery, they are kept in almost permanent darkness.Lethal Injections At the February 1999 ACIP meeting, the CDC's head of epidemiology, Dr. Robert Chen, presented data in a handout showing that serious reactions to the hepatitis B vaccine were approximately ten times higher than for other vaccine, meaning that it kills, in a gruesome way, ten times as many babies as other vaccines. In April '97 a Texas newspaper reported a freakish accident. A lady, while hospitalized, was accidentally injected with one of the three poisons used to kill prisoners in the state's death chamber. The horrible way she died, convulsing in pain and screaming that she was burning, shocked the readers. Efforts have been made to convince the public that lethal injection is a painless and humane way to kill human beings. This news report forces us to rethink that view. Lethal Injection is not humane nor \"painless\" as death penalty advocates claim. Potassium is a metallic inert chemical. Potassium chloride is the salt of potassium after it's reacted with hydrochloric acid. It's an essential mineral in small doses, ingested like eating bananas. It's essential to muscle tone and action. That's why people who become dehydrated from working in the sun too long have severe muscle cramps, because their electrolyte balance is thrown off by potassium loss. It's the first to go when one sweats profusely. The use of lethal injection as a form of execution began in Nazi Germany as early as the fall of 1939. Texas performed the first lethal injection in the U.S. in 1982. In large doses, injected intravenously, it would burn and hurt horribly, because it's a salt and because it instantly throws off the chemical balance of the blood with which it comes into contact. It makes all muscles lock up in extreme contraction that would hurt unbearably. It wouldn't get to all muscles when a prisoner is being killed with it, however. Since the heart is a muscle and it pumps the blood -- the minute that massive dose of potassium salt hits the heart, one would be history and that would be as far as it would travel. \"In lethal injection, three chemicals are used to kill. First, sodium pentothal (its trade name) or thiopental sodium (its chemical name). Then one minute later they inject pavulon. One minute later the potassium chloride. Pentothal is a short acting barbituric acid (barbiturate used in anaesthesia) and is commonly called \"truth serum\" as it's used in narcoanalysis. It knocks one out. It's a hypnotic. Pavulon is a curare derivative which locks up the lungs so one can't breathe. Pharmaceutical Manufactures of Lethal Injections Abbott Laboratories, Inc. American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. AmerisourceBergen B. Braun Medical, Inc. Baxter Healthcare Corp Cardinal Health\"So, while the helpless man strapped to a gurney is knocked out by the thiopental and can't draw a breath because of the pavulon -- he certainly can't scream in pain when that burning potassium is injected and sends his heart into a crunching excruciating cramp. Ah, but the woman in the article didn't have any thiopental or pavulon beforehand. It hurt so bad she sat up in bed and screamed, seizured violently, then died. But she wasn't strapped down to a gurney, either. The inmates they're killing would scream too, if they were able. They'd sit up and scream if they weren't strapped down and if their lungs weren't seized by pavulon. But they do gasp. Every one of them has. It's all they can do. \"It looked as if he just went to sleep\" -- that's how it's designed to look, to make it more palatable to the observers and those who're doing it. While it looks that way, it certainly isn't that way for the inmate they're killing. Looks are deceiving! All three of these drugs are acidic with pH higher than 6. God only knows what chemical reactions occur as they're mixed together in one's bloodstream. It probably burns so terribly that one feels as if he's being injected with fire right out of hell. Lethal injection executions depend on medical drugs and procedures and the potential of this kind of execution to involve medical professionals in unethical behavior, including direct involvement in killing, is clear. Because of this, there has been a long-standing campaign by some individual health professionals and some professional bodies to prohibit medical participation in lethal injection executions. There have been many botched executions using lethal injection drugs. Theoretically, if these drugs were administered correctly, the condemned person would be unconscious after the first injection, and stay that way throughout the entire procedure. However, according to Dr. Edward Brunner, professor and chairman emeritus of anesthesia at Northwestern University Medical School, the lethal injection process can be riddled with errors. If the drugs are not used properly, the sleep drug can wear off, allowing the patient to be aware but unable to move, even to breath. He undergoes suffocation and asphyxiation in a horribly painful way, even though he looks completely calm as he is lying on the table. Then he experiences that deep burning sensation as the potassium courses through his veins on the way to his heart. If done by an anesthesiologist, using secure and working intravenous lines, the injection process could be complete in five minutes. Due, however, to complications that arise from clogged intravenous lines and lack of suitable veins, the process does not run free of errors. Further compounding the problem, State protocols often do not indicate dosage amounts and executioners are poorly trained in administering the drugs. As a result, there are times when it has taken the condemned inmate up to 45 minutes to die. \"I can assure you that death from vaccination is neither quick nor painless. I helplessly watched my daughter suffer an excruciatingly slow death as she screamed and arched her back in pain, while the vaccine did as it was intended to do and assaulted her immature immune system. The poisons used as preservatives seeped through her tiny body, overwhelming her vital organs one by one until they collapsed. It is an image that will haunt me forever and I hope no other parent ever has to witness it. A death sentence considered too inhumane for this county's most violent criminals was handed down to my beautiful, innocent, infant daughter, death by lethal injection.\" Christine Colebeck, whose daughter died twenty-four hours after receiving DPT OPV vaccinations Pharmaceutical companies that produce lethal injection drugs have failed to acknowledge that use of their products in executions violates their own corporate mission, ethical codes of conduct, and basic human rights norms, which affirm the right to life. Abbott Laboratories, for example, manufactures all three drugs used in the lethal injection process. In the year 2001, Abbott's company sales reached $16.2 billion and their net earnings were $1.5 billion. Forbes Magazine ranks them number 70 in the top 500 companies, and Fortune Magazine lists them as 135 out of 500 of the largest U.S. based companies. Abbot sells itself publicly as being \"focused\" on creating products that \"enhance the lives of millions of people around the world,\" yet they have also been dedicated to ripping babies from their mothers breasts, preferring of course that they use their infant baby formula. DPT shots kill at least two to four people a year, according to the Institute of Medicine study and perhaps as many as 900 a year- including a great number misclassified as victims of sudden infant death syndrome- according to the independent National Vaccine Information Center. James Cherry MD, a physician and professor of pediatrics at the University of California at Los Angeles is a widely recognized pertussis expert who has been a leader on advisory committees that help frame immunization policy for the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control. Back in 1979, at a symposium he said, \"All physicians are aware that pertussis vaccine occasionally produces severe reactions and that these may be associated with permanent sequellae [complications caused by the vaccine] or even death .\"The FDA & the CDC These organizations are the last ones we should trust when it comes to issues surrounding public health. In two articles on September 25, 2000 by both Reuters News and USA Today came reports that 54 percent of the experts the FDA asks for advice on which medicines should be approved for sale had a direct financial interest in the drugs or topics they were evaluating. These financial conflicts or interest typically include stock ownership, consulting fees or research grants. Federal law prohibits the FDA from using experts with financial conflicts of interest, but the FDA has waived the restriction more than 800 times since 1998. The USA Today article stated, \"These pharmaceutical experts, about 300 on 18 advisory committees, make decisions that affect the health of millions of Americans and billions of dollars in drugs sales. With few exceptions, the FDA follows the committees' advice.\" \"The vaccine manufacturers, the Center for Disease Control, the FDA, and the various medical associations have failed miserably in their duty to protect our children. Rather than acknowledge their role in creating the immense, catastrophic rise in autism, these organizations have resorted to denial and obfuscation. They stand to lose their credibility, and billions of dollars in liability suits will soon reach the court,\" said. Bernard Rimland, Ph.D. Rather than acting aggressively to remove thimerosal from children's vaccines, the FDA and other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopted an incremental approach that allowed children to continue to be exposed to ethylmercury from vaccines for more than two additional years. In fact, in 2001,the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) refused even to express a preference for thimerosal-free vaccines, despite the fact that thimerosal had been removed from almost every childhood vaccine produced for use in the United States. FDA approval costs anywhere from $20,000,000 to $120,000,000. Only a large drug company can afford that amount of money to do the double-blind studies and other research to prove the cure will not hurt someone. It is generally thought that if the government did not require such studies, drug companies would be killing us right and left with unproven \"cures,\" yet what is the truth? According to consumer advocate Ralph Nader, medical doctors actually caused the deaths of 300,000 people per year in the USA in the last half of the 20th century through negligence and error, and a significant number of them were through injections that ended up being lethal to the patient. The FDA is know for some very strange things. For instance in 1976, after five soldiers stationed at a military base in New Jersey contracted the flu, CDC officials announced an imminent influenza epidemic. Their news releases predicted an outbreak that could wipe out as many as 500,000 Americans within a year. Congress responded to the CDC warnings by diverting millions of federal dollars into an emergency vaccine program, and following appeals from US President Gerald Ford, multitudes of concerned Americans received Swine Flu shots. However, no epidemic ever materialized and no substantiation for the notion of a life-threatening pig virus was ever found. Instead,more than 600 people were left paralyzed by the vaccine which also caused nearly 100 deaths. Although the causes of AIDS were obvious, the gay-male AIDS and cancer illnesses were explained as a mystery. Instead it was postulated that there had to be a \"new virus\" causing the illnesses. Otherwise one would have had to reckon on a pharmaceutical catastrophe with unforeseeable consequences. Doctor Heinrich Kremer Radiation treatments following surgery for breast cancer reduce deaths from breast cancer by about 13%, but increased deaths from other causes (mostly heart disease) by approximately 21%! Cancer patients given conventional treatment are not told that both radiation and chemotherapy can cause secondary cancer. Nicholas Regush writing for ABC News reported that \"Monster egos, conflict of interest and arrogance are all too often the baggage that accompanies medical science,\" in response to the disturbing revelations in USA Today that more than 50 per cent of scientific advisors to the Food and Drug Administration have financial ties to pharmaceutical companies whose drugs they are reviewing for safety and effectiveness. Regush said, \"It has been my experience when speaking to scientists with such conflicts of interest that they somehow have managed to convince themselves that they can truly be impartial in reaching decisions on whether to approve medical products that will affect millions of people. Sure, and pigs can fly. Which credible studies or brain science textbook are these mythmakers relying upon to claim they have such phenomenal mental and emotional control over their judgment calls? Scientists financed by a drug company tend to view that company's data more favorably than those who have no such ties.\" Those with a conflict of interest should be given a quick heave-ho by the FDA, but this just isn't happening. It demonstrates how far the FDA has strayed from its mandate to protect the public. Nicholas Regush Here we have our direct link between the pharmaceutical terrorists and government advisors that destroys the integrity of the FDA. The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform in August 2000 criticized the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for routinely allowing scientists with conflicts of interest to serve on two influential advisory committees that make recommendations on vaccine policy. The report concluded that, \"conflict-of-interest rules employed by the FDA and the CDC have been weak, enforcement has been lax, and committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies have been given waivers to participate in committee proceedings.\" In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, Chairman Burton called for reforms to crack down on conflicts of interest on the two committees. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) makes recommendations on the approval of new vaccines. The CDC'sAdvisory Committee on Immunizations Practices (ACIP) makes recommendations on guidelines for the administration of vaccines. The Government Reform Committee staff report found that the majority of members of both committees have financial ties to vaccine manufacturers or hold patents on vaccines under development. Despite concerns about potentially serious side effects of the controversial rotavirus vaccine, it won unanimous votes of support in both committees. Within one year, the vaccine, made by Wyeth Lederle, had to be pulled from the market because it was causing severe bowel obstructions in infants that required surgery to correct. One baby died. The Committee found that three out of the five full-time FDA advisory committee members who voted for the vaccine had financial ties to Wyeth Lederle or two companies developing rival rotavirus vaccines -- Merck and SmithKline Beecham. Four out of eight CDC advisory committee members who supported the vaccine had conflicts with the same companies. In his letter to Secretary Shalala, Chairman Burton stated: \"For the public to have confidence in the decisions made by their government, they must be assured that those decisions are not being affected by conflict of interest. ... It has become clear over the course of this investigation that the VRBPAC and the ACIP are dominated by individuals with close working relationships with the vaccine producers. This was never the intent of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires that a diversity of views be represented on advisory committees.\" These conflicts of interest makes it impossible for the world to trust the FDA and the CDC. You can read a very poignant example of this in G. Edward Griffins' brilliantly researched book World Without Cancer about the suppression of laetrile, a drug that actually works to prevent and treat cancer. It explains how cancer develops and how Vitamin B17 from apricot kernels operates to suppress the growth cancer, and it clearly documents how misrepresentations and lies in FDA-funded reports caused the FDA to put laetrile on the \"restricted\" list of banned substances. Now you can only get laetrile for your own use by illegally importing it or going through a complicated legal process. Evidence suggests the FDA is in collusion with the AMA and drug companies to prevent laetrile from being used as a cancer treatment. If so, officials in the FDA are actually conspiring to facilitate the sickness and death of cancer victims . We deserve better than that from our government. The point here is: if the cure is too cheap, the drug companies and medical doctors can't make money off it and will pressure the FDA to disapprove it. Furthermore, the FDA will not approve any cure that cannot be proven by its normal process. Either way, we don't get the cure. And what's worse, our insurance companies will not pay for the real cure. It seems a bit insane that the insurance companies will only pay for super- expensive \"cures\" that seldom if ever work, but when we understand the paradigm of alopathic medicine and the horror of pharmaceutical terrorism it unfortunately does make sense.
