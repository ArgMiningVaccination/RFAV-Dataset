The incidence rate is high and spread across all age groups. With the rapid development of the world economy and the increasing competition in social life, the incidence rate has also increased rapidly, more and more young suffer from these three kinds of mental il l- nesses. Many studies have been carried out to investigate the p athogenesis and therapeutic method . It is necessary to summarize the progress for refe r- ences to further research and treatment . Method : Based on a series of liter a- ture, the studies on the p athogenesis and therapeutic method of the three kinds of illnesses are summarized and analyzed. The points and results either of West medicine (WM) or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are collected and compared to find the best tendency of study and the best therapeutic method . Results : Obsessive -compulsive disorder, a nxiety disorder and d e- pression are common in recent years and severely affect people 's lives. In view of WM. These three kinds of illnesses are all related to the changes or damage of part of brain and nervous system . While TCM thinks that they are due to Qi stagnation or d eficiency of heart Yin . Many methods of treatment have been presented and used clinically, but the effect is limited. Conclusion : The most promising and effective methods are those combining WM and TCM.

A nxiety disorder (AD), a kind of neurosis mainly manifested by anxiety, is listed as one of the top ten disabling diseases by the World Health Organization. I t is often manifested as worry without obvious cause and fixed content, accompanied by obvious autonomic nervous dysfunction. Depression (or Major depressive disorder, MDD) is an af- fective disorder with a high incidence rate and serious harm to human physical and mental health. The occurrence of depression will lead to the disorder of normal sleep mechanism to a certain extent, while insomnia may have sym p- toms of depression and mania. Depression is the fourth largest disease in the world . It is expected to become the second largest disease by 2030. Gene rally, OCD , AD and depression are the most common negative emotions. OCD , AD and depression are closely related, transforming, interdependent and restraining each other. For example, OCD generally does not occur alone. Most OCD patients are accompanied by anxiety, a few are accompanied by d e- pression, and some OCD patients are mixed with AD and depression together . The three kinds of illnesses are all caused by the impa irment of the function of serotonin, a neurotransmitter. More precisely, the patient's ser otonin system is defective. Therefore, the basic idea of treating OCD is the same as that of trea t- ing depression. The difference is that the dosage is larger and mixed drugs are needed for OCD . People have carried out long -term research on these three di s- eases and have a certain understanding of the pathogenesis. O n this basis, a v a- riety of treatment schemes have been put forward, especially the combining treatment of TCM and WM is more promising. On the above viewpoints, this paper summarizes and analyzes the research progress on the pathogenesis and treatment methods of these three diseases, in order to provide help for the future research direction of pathogenesis and treatment methods. 2. Pathogenesis and D iagnosis OCD is characterized by excessive monitoring of errors and behaviors and the abnormal increase of error related negative wave amplitude in EEG indexes. In terms of brain function, it is characterized by excessive activation of prefrontal lobe and anterior cingulate gyrus. Error processing hyperfunction is to be a specific intraphenotype of OCD [1] . AD is a neurosis characterized by anxiety. Clinically, it is divided into panic disorde (PD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD, also known as chronic anxiety or floating anxiety, is the most common form, accounting for 75% of AD . The symptoms of patients are extensive and persistent anxi ety. They often feel inexplicable panic. The overall mood is irritable, restless, and anxious. They often feel that something unfortunate will happen immediately and can't concentrate on doing something, which is unbearable but can't get rid of. The sympto ms includes palpitation, palpitation, timidity, sweating, chest tightness, irritability, shortness of breath, forgetfulness, dry mouth, insomnia, constip a-W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 226 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines tion, diarrhea, skin flushing or pallor, and in serious cases, lip tremor and limb trembling, which se riously affect the life and work of patients [2] . AD is widespread among college students (about 20%). Some doctoral st u- dents are in a sub -health state due to great mental pressure. Depression and AD are common psychological diseases among doctoral students also, and the inc i- dence rate is high. Many students can't graduate on schedule, and even delay as long as 5 - 10 years or longer. Some escape academic research halfway. The weak relationship with tutors is a common feature of most graduate students exp e- riencing depression and/or AD [3]. Univariate analysis shows that the c ommon potential risk factors for depression and AD of doctorial students are profe s- sional title promotion pressure, frequency of meeting with tutors, unpleasant experience with tutors, type of tutors, difficulty in meeting the requirements of paper publish ing, meaningful perception of doctoral reading, expected gradu a- tion time, balance among work, family and difficulty. A ssistance for tutors in applying for projects or applying for awards, assisting in guiding thesis writing, and participating in tutor proj ects are unique risk factors for depression of do c- torial students. Raising children and the number of doctoral students under the guidance of tutors are unique risk factors for the occurrence of AD . Teac h- er-student relationship is the greatest influencing factor of depressive symptom. The influence of factors of anxiety symptom of doctorial students in order of contribution are as follows: teacher -student relationship, difficulty in publishing papers, difficulty in balancing work, family and doctoral study, scientific r e- search self -efficacy, graduation expectation, frequency of meeting, significance of doctoral projects, frequency of meeting, feeling of economic pressure and whether or not you are working in clinical practice. The neural mechanism of OCD is mainly related to the prefrontal brain r e- gions including orbital frontal ventral striatum, A number of studies on the neural mechanism of OCD agree that the dysfunction of cortico striato thalamo cortical circuits (CSTC) is pathophysiological mechanism of OCD [4] [5]. The cognitive psychology model of OCD proposed by Schwartz mainly focu s- es on the error related risk identification system. The key to the formation of obsessive -compulsive concept is the persistent and excessive cognitive monito r- ing of errors or errors in a specific behavior situation, and so constant formation of the subjective impression that \"something is wrong\". When the relief o f ten- sion or anxiety associated with obsessive -compulsive behavior may be experienced as a form of reward, then there will be a pathological cycle pattern of obse s- sive\u2014compulsive thinking motivation\u2014 behavior [6] . The reason for OCD patients always trying to correct something due to their suspection of the correctness is that the generation of i n- appropriate \"false risk awareness\" cognitive signals results from the over -activation of the error monitoring system. The evidences are found from the perspectives W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 227 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines of behavior, EEG, functional imaging and so on. Depression is an affective disorder mental disease, which is mainly manifested by long -term depression. At the same time, it also has symptoms such as lack of pleasure and slow thinking. Depression seriously endangers human physical and mental health. There are three main points on the pathogenesis of depression in reinfor ce- ment learning: 1) The activities of dopamine system in basal ganglia and mi d- brain respond to internal and external false signals decrease, and false informa-tion causes the phase reduction of dopamine system activities; 2) The phase d e- crease of dopamine system activity relieves the inhibition of ACC and medial frontal lobe, and the activity of ACC and medial frontal lobe increase; 3) ERN or FRN, as a reinforcement learning signal from depression activity to ACC, is conducive to adjusting the next step of behavior. Depression has an important impact on people's decision -making behavior through reinforcement learning signals such as ERN or FRN. Among them, learning from \"mistakes\" through external feedback is an important way for people to adapt to the enviro nment and develop themselves. It is shown that intestinal flora may play an important role in the occurrence, development, prevention and treatment of depression by acting on the ne u- roendocrine system, autonomic nerve and immune of l actobacillus and bifidobacterium in the feces of patients wit h depression is significantly lower than that of healthy volunteers [11] . The relative abundance of prevobacteriaceae in patients with depression is significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers. The contents of rumen cocci and fecal bacilli in the genus level are significantly reduced, while the abundance of pr e- vobacteriaceae is significantly increased, suggesting that patients with depression are also accomp anied by abnormal intestinal flora [12] . The intestinal flora af- fects the central nervous system through the \"gut brain\" axis. The abnormality of the intestinal flora gut brain axis can participate in the occurrence of depression through neural, immune, endocrine and other mechanisms [13] . A variety of intestinal flora can produce neuromodulatory substances and may affect brain development, especially synaptogenesis and maturation. The changes in the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), mRNA and pr o- tein in hippocampus are related to the intestinal brain axis. The level of BDNF mRNA in the brain of sterile animals is different from that of animals parasitic on normal flora. After intestinal inflammation caused b y whipworm infection, mice show anxiety -like behavior, which is related to the decrease in the expres- sion of BDNF mRNA in hippocampus. beh a- vior by probiotics, BDNF expression level returned to normal level [14] . In- flammatory markers (such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF -)), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C -reactive protein in the serum of patients with depression are often higher than normal l evels. The classic hypothesis of depression \u2014monoamine hypothesis believes that the reduction of 5 -HT, dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) released in the W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 228 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines central nervous system will lead to the decrease of the content of neurotransmi t- ters above the synapse [15] . When the body is in a state of psychological stress for a long time, it is easy to cause stress injury and abnormal function of the \"g ut brain\" axis, leading to the decline of 5 -HT level, and inducing depression. More than 50% of DA in the body comes from the intestine. DA include s the receptors of D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5. D1, D3 and D5 exist not only in the nerve endings of the intestinal wall, but also in the intestinal mucosa. D3 is a key factor involved in the reward circuit of the midbrain limbic dopamine system and is closely related to the 5 -HT energy of the central nervous system. D2 exists only in the nerve endings of the intestinal wall and is involved in regulating the me-sencephalic limbic reward pathway, and six loci have been found to be closely related to the pathogenesis of depression. D 4 exists only in the intestinal mucosa [16]. Norepinephrine (NE) neurons are located in the locus coeruleus of the brain and communicate through NE. They are divided into and receptors, where the increase of the activity of subtypes of receptors 2 can lead to the decrease of NE release and the aggravation of depressive symptoms. The occurrence of epilepsy, depression and many other neuropsychiatric di s- eases are related with GABA (-Aminobutyric acid). Functional defect, abno r- mal level and receptor d ysfunction of GABA can all induce depression. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), includes formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, etc., are the met a- bolites of intestinal flora and important energ y source of intestinal epithelial cells. It can affect intestinal mucosal barrier, induce T cell differentiation, and play immune regulation and anti -inflammatory functions [17]. The production of SCFA changes with flora structure. It can enter the brain through the blood -brain barrier and is an important signal molecule connecting the function of intestinal flora- intestinal -brain axis. It can increase the release o f sympathetic NE, stimulate intestinal chromaffin cells to produce 5 -HT, and regulate GABA and Glu [18] . Intestinal flora can be combined with intestinal endocrine cells through vagal afferent fibers, and then transmitted rius, thalamus, locus coeruleus, of neurotransmitters in the brain [19] [20] . The frontal lobe structure of patients with depression will change, including the frontal lobe volume, cortical thickness and surface area, cortical folding coe f- ficient. The volume of prefrontal lobe in patients with depression decreases sig- nificantly, especially volume of dorsomedial and lateral prefrontal lobe [21] . Because the thickness of frontal cortex changes in different parts, the thickness of frontal pole, paracentral gyrus and right medial orbital frontal lobe in patients with depression will increase, and the thickness of left anterior central gyrus will decrease [22] . At rest, patients with depression have abnormal brain activity. Liu et al. [23] found that the Cohe -ReHo values of the left medial prefrontal lobe and the left inferior parietal lobule in patients with depression are higher than those in the W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 229 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines control group. The fMRI multi modal scan shows that in the depression group, the Cohe -ReHo values of bilateral striatum, bilateral medial right thalamus increase, while the Cohe of left middle gyrus, and righ t amygdala decrease [24] . However, the current study still has some limitations in the study and diag- nose based on imaging technology : 1) for brain structure imaging study, most of them focus on brain area/ volume, and few studies are on other variables, such as cortical thickness, surface area, folding coefficient and so on. But the study of these variables may improve the study of brain structural abnormalities and comprehensively reflect the characteristics of brain structur e in patients with depression. 2) The study on brain structure, function and metabolism is rel a- tively independent. We should avoid distinguishing too much in study. As a whole, we can explore the connections of important brain regions in structure, function and metabolism, and find key therapeutic targets. 3) At present, there are few studies on the imaging differences of brain structure, brain function and brain metabolism between patients with a nd without refractory depression, and most of them are cross- sectional studies, which urgently need developmental study of large samples. 3. Therapeutic M ethod 3.1. Treatment of AD and OCD GAD is a kind of neurosis mainly manifested by anxiety, accompanied by o b- vious autonomic nervous dysfunction. Patients often complain of sleep disorder, often or continuously have tension without clear object or fixed content, exce s- sive worry about things, often accompanied by neurological symptoms such as depression and mental weakness [25] . Compared with decades ago, the GAD p a- tients are no longer mainly with liver depression and Qi stagnation, but caused by mental tension and exc essive thinking in the viewpoints of TCM . Excessive thinking, insufficient blood and loss of mental health can all lead to mental di s- orders and anxiety. AD can also cause the lack of heart Yin, hyperactivity, hot flashes, night sweats, five heart upset hea t, dizziness, tinnitus, pulse count and other symptoms. Based on the above pathogenesis, Tianwang Buxin Dan is often selected to treat generalized anxiety due to heart Yin deficiency. At present, the main drug for the first -line treatment of GAD is benzodi aze- pines, but this drug has great side effects. Most patients are highly dependent on this drug, and will develop resistance to it, with poor compliance. Other drugs such as serotonin inhibitors, adrenergic receptor blockers are not only expe n- sive, but also have many side effects. Buspirone type drugs have no obvious side effects, but they take effect slowly and have selectivity in the treatment of AD . People have to look for other more safe and effective drug, which provides a broad space for giving play t o the advantages of TCM in the treatment of AD. Modified Wendan Decoction can improve the behavior of either AD or depres-sion, and its antidepressant effect may be better than that of anti AD. W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 230 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines TCM, such as wild jujube kernel, cypress acacia flower, rose generation flower, raw dragon tooth, pearl powder, are found to have good cur a- tive effect when used for treatment of GAD. Except for treatment by using drug, comprehensive nursing intervention for anxiety patients can reduce anxiety scores and improve sleep quality, which is conducive to the improvement of comprehensive quality [26]. Cognitive beh a- vioral therapy and psychosocial support combined with paroxetine can alleviate the anxiety level of anxiety and depression patients, improve mindfulness and psychological elasticity, and improve the quality of life of patients [27] . OCD often occurs companying with AD. Sometimes OCD patients suffer from AD and depression at the same time. So the treatment scheme of these il l- nesses is similar. The drugs often used f or OCD are serotonin reuptake inhib paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram, similar to that for AD and depression. However, the OCD usually needs to take large d oses of drugs in the treatment relative to AD and depression, so not only side effects are more , but also drug resistance is easier to happen. The e fficiency is not more than 60% and easy to r elapse . Therefore, psychotherapy (such as c ognitive behavioral t herapy , Mindfulness cognitive therapy , psychoanalysis ) or psychother a- py combined with drugs are often used for treatment of OCD. In recent years, the surgical methods such as anterior cingulate gyrus destruction, internal ca p- sule forelimb d estruction, vagus nerve stimulation and deep brain electrical st i- mulation are used to treat OCD. Many regulating drugs of glutamate system are used in the treatment of refractory OCD , such as N -methyl -D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and NMDAR agonists, and some of them show signifi- cant effects. 3.2. Treatment of Depression Metformin is a first -line drug for the treatment of T2DM (type 2 diabetes). It is safe and can play an antidepressant role through anti diabetes, anti -inflammatory, anti-oxid ation, direct repair of damaged hippocampal formation and other me- chanisms. The reactivity of metformin in the treatment of depression is closely related to gender. The dose of metformin used to improve depression is equiv a- lent to that used to treat T2DM, but the sample size of the current study is small, and no large cohort study of antidepressant by metformin has been carried out in China [28] . Drugs traditionally used in clinical treatment of depression include selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) reuptake inhibitors, [29]. However, these antidepressants have some limitations in clinical treatment. For example, monoamine drugs will take weeks or even months to produce a therapeutic response. Studies have shown that glutamatergic drugs (such as l a-W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 231 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines motrigine and riluzole) can produce faster and more lasting antidepressant e f- fects, but the efficacy of these drugs is limited, and drug resistance will appear in 20% - 30% of patients with depression [30] . In addition, long -term use of ant i- depressants is likely to lead to metabolic abnormalities in patients (such as i n- creased body mass, hyperglycemia, high abdominal blood glucose, hype rinsul i- nemia, insulin resistance (IR) and lipid metabolism disorders), which may ag- gravate GAD or induce diabetes [31] . TCM can protect nerve cells by inhibiting th e activation of NLRP3, so as to reduce depression [32] . TCM classifies depression as \"depression syndrome\". At first, Qi stagnation is the main cause of depression, then the pathogenesis slowly transforms to actual symptom such as fire, blood stasis, phlegm, food stagnation, dampness stagnation, and so on. At this moment, damage of the function of vi s- cera (heart, spleen, kidney) will occur due to long illness. It is found that one of the mechanisms of antidepressant effect of TCM is due to the oligomeric d o- main of binding nucleotides, leucine rich repeats and inflammatory signal pat h- way containing pyridine domain 3 (NOD like receptor 3, NLRP3) . As the main active comp onent of cinnamon, trans cinnamaldehyde has the anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and neurological functions. Trans cinnamal- dehyde can inhibit activation of NLRP3 pathway and NF -B pathway in the pr e- frontal cortex and hippocampus [33] . Many TCMs are developed to treat depression. The mechanism for treatment has been studied detailed. Shugan Jianpi Recipe can promote NLRP3 to enter cells to separate the Caspase -1 from ASC complex, and release IL -1. The pr o- portion of myeloid suppressor cells will decrease based on TLR4/NF -B inflam- matory pathway and then affects the immunosuppressive microenvironment. It is thought that this may be the main mechanism of Shugan Jianpi Recipe on the apoptosis of depression [34]. It is found that Chaihu Shugan powder can inhibit the inflammatory response of liver and prefrontal cortexmediate by r egulating the activation of NLRP3 pathway and mediating the routing of TLR4/NF -B. It is the mechanism that Chaihu Shugan depression [35] . Ma- huang Fuzi Xixin decoction can alleviate depression by regulating NLRP3 pat way and enhancing neurogenesis pathway [36]. Banxia Houpu Decoction can play an role antid regulating NLRP3 pathway caspase -1 and IL -1 to cortical cells and improve depression [38] . Suanzaoren Decoction is often used to treat patients with depression. A c- cording to the research results, t here are 309 active ingredients in Suanzaoren Decoction and 111 action targets to depression. The main active ingredients are saponins. There are 1496 intersection targets between insomnia and depression. Suanzaoren Decoction and depression and insomnia have a total of 42 targets. By using the integrated pharmacology platform, it is found that the three (Sua n- zaoren Decoction , depression and insomnia) et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 232 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines tion regulates the signal transmission of nervous system and endocrine system by stimulating these six key targets, such as serotonin receptor pathway and d o- pamine receptor pathway, so as to regulate neurotransmitters in the brain and achieve the effects of calming nerves and antidepressant. Therefore, Suanzaoren Decoction can prevent insomnia and depression through multiple ways, mu l- tiple targets and multiple links [39] . The key to the pathogenesis of depression is that the Qi is disordered due to excessive worry, or uncontrollable joy and anger, or depressed mood for a long time. The brain activity is suppressed and so it cannot play its corresponding i n- tegration and regulation role, resulting in the occurrence of depression. That means, the location of the pathogenesis of depression is in the brain [40] . In p a- tients of first -episode depression, the functional connection between the pos t- erior cingulate gyrus or precuneus of the throat of DMN and other brain regions decreases when the patients do not receive drug treatment. Exercise can effectively regulate the formation of speci fic parts of the central nervous system, the concentration of neurotrophic factors, the level of glucoco r- ticoids and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and induce hippocampal neurogenesis in the central nervous system, so as to effectively stimulate the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of depression. Therefore, it is suggested to take exercise as an effective intervention to alleviate depression [41]. Bupleurum Liver -Soothing Powder is composed has the effects of soothing the liver, moving Qi and promoting blood circulation and relieving pain. In this formula, Chaihu all have certain anti -depressant effects. Combined with these four herbs, the simplified formula of Bupleurum Li v- er-Soothing Powder is used to intervene in depression- like rats. It is found that it can effectively improve the state of depression through a variety of ways [42] . Melatonin (MT), also known as pineal hormone or melatonin, is an indole heterocyclic compound secrete d by the brain pineal gland. After synthesis, MT is stored in the pineal gland and released by sympathetic excitation. MT is an e n- dogenous hormone which can regulate circadian rhythm, neuroendocrine, i m- mune function and synaptic plasticity, and is closely related to the pathogenesis of depression. Clinical trials find that the level of serum MT in patients with d e- pression is significantly increased. The antidepressant mechanism of MT i n- volves the regulation with MT, its receptor agonist has the characteristics of long half -life, high absorption rate and more obvious curative effect. Therefore, MT receptor agonists, as a drug that can effecti vely treat depression and sleep disorders with relatively small adverse W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 233 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines reactions, have received extensive attention in recent years. Agomelatine ( AGO ) is an agonist of MT1 and MT2 receptors. High fat diet will produce oxidative stress on the central nervo us system, which is easy to cause mood disorders and neuroinflammation. Agomelatine treatment can reverse depressive symptoms and reduce the levels of cytokines TNF , IL6 and IL1 and restore the levels of BDNF and the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase. GW117 is a d e- rivative compound of agomelatine, a new serotonin receptor antagonist and M T1 and MT2 receptor Ramelteon has a significant cli n- ical improvement effect on patients. Compared with healthy people, the content of BDNF, NGF and other neurotrophic factors in patients' serum is reduced, while the levels of in flammatory factors such as IL6 and IL1 increase signifi- cantly. RMT treatment can factors and cytokines [43] . 3.2.1. Treatment of Depression from Microorganism Gut Brain Axis Viable bacteria refer to living microorganisms that can have beneficial effects on human health when taken in sufficient quantities. This beneficial effect is not l i- mited to the gastrointestinal tract, but may also include the entire microbial gut-brain axis, in which probiotics that can improve behavior and mental state are called mental probiotics. Taking psycho probiotics can increase the level of key neurotransmitters in the pathogenesis of depression. However, the number of bacteria that can be used as probiotics is small, and the disturbance of inte s- tinal microbiota may limit the improvement of depression. Fecal microbiota transplantation is to clean up the intestinal microbiota of p a- tients with d epression and transplant a new human intestinal microbiota at one time, which will greatly improve the curative effect and maintain the therapeutic effect for a long time. This treatment can provide a relatively large number and diversity of bacteria, but fecal microbiota transplantation also has adverse reac- tions, including abdominal discomfort, spasm, abdominal distension, hiccups, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Eating and drinking is particularly important for improving the health of intestinal microorganisms. In areas with low s o- cio-economic level, the consumption of probiotics and fermented food is less, so the degree of depression is higher [44] . The primary motor cortex (M1) of patients with depression has a tendency to be damaged and its plasticity decreases. M1 area is involved in physical activity and muscle control, and also plays a role in cognitive process. The key symptom of depression, loss of pleasure, is considered to be related to the dysfunction of dopaminergic nervous system, because this area holds the reward system closely related to pleasure. Dopaminergic nervous syst em dysfunction is also closely r e- lated to depression with insomnia. Insomnia in patients with depression is usually manifested in difficulty in falling asleep, easy to wake up and early aw a- kening. Their sleep EEG usually shows the reduction of slow wave sl eep (SWS) and the extension of rapid eye movement sleep time (REM). W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 234 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines Depression is closely related to respiratory diseases. It shows that not only respiratory diseases can often be complicated with depression, but also the se- verity of depression affects the prognosis and outcome of respiratory diseases, which brings certain difficulties to clinical diagnosis and treatment. The reason is not only that lung disease is painful and difficult to heal, which brings psy- chological pressure and economic burden to pat ients, but also has a certain mo- lecular theoretical basis. For example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a common chronic disease in the elderly, has been confirmed by many studies to have a concurrent relationship with depression. COPD patien ts' lung tissue produces a large number of inflammatory factors such as IL -8, IL -6 and TNF -. It can not only stimulate inflammatory response and promote airway changes, but also act on the nervous system through the blood -brain barrier, a f- fecting the release of neurotransmitters and emotional regulation disorders, leading to depression [45] . Patients with depression often have autonomic nerve dysfunction, which is manifested by abnormal sympathetic excitation and parasympathetic inhibition. Sympathetic nerve excitability continues to increase, and the content of catech o- lamine in blood increases, which becomes a risk factor for coronary heart di s- ease, arrhythmia and other circulatory system diseases. Patients with depression often have gastrointestinal dysfunction, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastric ulcer. Many patients with depression often go to the hospital with gastrointe s- tinal symptoms as the primary reason. When evaluating the depression scale for patients with refractory gastrointestinal diseases, it is found that more than half of them are in a depressed state, which suggests tha t depression has a great i m- pact on the function of the digestive system [18]. In clinical diagnosis and treat- ment, it is easy to find that many patients with depres sion have symptoms of frequent urination, urgency or leakage of urine, which are most common in e l- derly women, and are considered to be related to overactive bladder (OAB). D e- pression and OAB usually a ffect each other. Patients with depression reduce s o- cial interaction due to the embarrassing situation of frequent urination or urine leakage, which aggravates their condition. OAB is more difficult to cure because of patients' negative attitude and low mood. Some scholars have found that the abnormal funct ion of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in patients with depression we a- kens its inhibitory effect on the occurrence of stress -related depression, leading to the over activation of HPA axis and promoting the occurrence of depression. Bone mineral density (BMD) of mo st patients with depression is lower than normal level, often accompanied by osteoporosis. A considerable number of p a- tients with brittle fracture in orthopedics department are accompanied by d e- pression, which suggests that depression is also a risk factor for BMD reduction and fracture. Some scholars measured the BMD of the left femoral neck, greater trochanter and ward triangle in patients with depression, and found that BMD in all parts was lower than normal, and women were even lower than men. BMD level was negatively correlated with the degree of depression and the course of W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 235 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines disease. The reason may be as following: the content of testosterone and estr a- diol and other sex hormones in patients with depression decreases, and they are both directly involved in the formation of bone and the inhibition of osteoclast function. HPA axis disorder leads to the increase of glucocorticoid release and inhibits osteoblast formation and promotes osteocyte apoptosis. Leptin (LEP) levels in patients with depression are reduced. LEP can not only directly act on osteoblasts and promote their differentiation, but also act on the central nervous system and gonads, indirectly affecting bone formation [33] . More and more r e- searchers find that the occurrence and development of depression are synchr o- nized with the occurrence of immune inflammatory response, suggesting that there is an interactive relationship between depression and the immune system. A large number of clinical experiments show that t he activation of inflammatory factors such as CRP , IL-1, IL -6, TNF - is a key factor affecting the progression of depression . 3.2.2. Other Methods of Treatment Except for the treatment of depres sion by drugs, there are other methods of TCM. Acupuncture therapy : Acupuncture therapy can treat this disease by regulating the whole body's meridians and Qi. Through statistical analysis of the acupoint se- lection mentioned in the clinical reports of acupuncture for post- stroke depre s- sion, it is concluded that all acupoints are ranked according to the total freque n- cy of use, among which the top improve the depressive symptoms of patients [46] . Electroacupuncture therapy : Electroacupuncture therapy is a treatment me- thod in which a trace current wave of human bioelectricity is applied to the needle after acupuncture to get Qi. Study shows that the total effective rate of treating depression by using electroacupuncture therapy is 90% (Baihui, Yin-tang, Sishencong points the WM . Moxibustion treatment : Moxibustion can significantly improve the sym p- toms of patients with depression with less adverse reactions. Moxibustion is simple to operate, and patients can treat them selves at home. So doctors can guide patients to carry out moxibustion treatment by themselves in home. Massage therapy : Guided by the theory of TCM and combined with the rel e- vant knowledge of W M, massage acts on specific parts of the body surface with manipulation to regulate the body and achieve the purpose of physiotherapy. Ear acupoint therapy : \"The ear is gathered by the imperial veins\", so clini- cally, it can achieve the effect of treating diseases by stimulating the acupoints on the ear [12]. The auricular points were needled and stimulated by electroac u- puncture. The auricular points were selected as Shenmen, brain stem, heart, liver and kidney. The results showed that the treatment effects is significant and the adverse reactions is less. W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 236 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines Acupoint application therapy : Acupoint application therapy is to select a p- propriate TCM according to different TCM syndrome types. For depression, four specific acupoints o f Xinshu, Ganshu, Pishu and Shenshu are often selected for application. The clinic trials indicates that acupoint application of TCM has a good effect on depression. Cupping therapy : For cupping, the acupoints on the dorsal governor vessel and bladder meridian are mainly used. In the point of TCM, Qi stagnation is mostly responsible for depression. The acupoints on the Du Meridian and blad- der meridian can stimulate Yang through cuppi ng stimulation, which plays a role in warming Yang and transforming Qi and regulating consciousness. Acupoint catgut embedding therapy : According to the theory of T CM, acu- point catgut embedding is to embed absorbable surgical thread into acupoints to stimulate acupoints and regulate the body. Depression, as a disease requiring long -term treatment, is difficult for patients to adhere to acupuncture treatment for many reasons. Acu point catgut embedding provides an alternative. 3.2.3. Combined Treatment of TCM and W M Combined treatment of TCM and W M can shorten the onset time, alleviate physical symptoms and prevent adverse reactions. Mild depression can be treated with TCM or acupu ncture alone; Moderate and severe depression requires ant i- depressants as the main treatment and TCM as the auxiliary treatment; Severe depression caused by mental trauma needs WM combined with acupoint stim u- lation and regulation [4 7]. In the combined treatment of TCM and W M, we should first reasonably use the psychological evaluation scale to correctly evaluate the condition of the di s- ease, so as to provide a basis for the determination of the treatment plan. Ant i- depressant WM is the most common method of mainstream medicine to treat depression, but its curative effect is often relatively slow, and the effective rate is less than 50%. Because of the uniqueness of TCM and a relatively systematic theoretical understanding and rich diagnosis and the accumulated treatment experience s in the perennial clinical practice of depression syndrome, TCM can play an active role in the prevention and treatment of depression. The ad vantag- es of TCM in the treatment of depression are more reflected in the consolidation and maintenance treatment of mild to moderate depression and depression. The combination of the two can achieve the effect of complementing each other and is often bette r than that of a single method. For example, t he effect of Shugan Jieyu capsule combined with with electroacupuncture Baihui, Sishencong, and combined acupuncture and medicine is more ideal. According to the specific condition of patients, the re a- sonable use of integrated TCM and W M can significantly improve the cure rate and quality of life of patients [48] [49] . 4. Conclusions Through the comprehensive analysis of the current research and treatment W. J. Lu et al. DOI: 10.4236/jbm.2022.109016 237 Journal of Biosciences and Medicines progress of OCD , AD and depression, it is found that there is a basic consensus on the pathogenesis of these diseases. Only with treatment, although people have put forward a variety of treatment schemes, there are advantages and disadva n- tages to any existing treatment methods, such as WM has relatively fast effect but large sid e effects, as for TCM, though the side effects are small, liver and kidney damage can occur after long -term use, acupuncture and moxibustion have a downward trend in long -term treat ment. The effect of combined treat- ment of TCM and W M is more ideal, which can not only effectively improve the mental state of patients, but also will not cause serious adverse reactions. Due to the heterogeneity of such mental disorders, individualized treatment is the best choice, and TCM syndrome differe ntiation is the paradigm of individ u- alized diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, it can be considered that the preve n- tion and combined treatment of TCM and W M will play an important role in the future diagnosis and treatment. Of course, there are still many problems in the combined treatment of TCM and W M, such as the lack of integration of the guiding ideology of TCM and the theoretical system of WM ; There are many classifications of TCM syndromes, which makes the comparability and repeat a- bility of clinical research obviously insufficient. At the same time, doctors often use drugs based on clinical experience, and the dosage is not fixed, which cannot be quantified and difficult to repeat verification; the evaluation scale is easy to be subjectively guided by doctors and lacks specific objective indicators. Therefore, there is still a lot of work to be done in the diagnosis and treatment of this kind of disease, especially in the combined treatment of TCM and W M.
