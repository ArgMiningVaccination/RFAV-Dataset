Under the joint degree program, a student can obtain both degrees in less time and at a lower cost than it would take to obtain both degrees if pursued consecutively. The joint degree program will use existing faculty, courses and resources. Important criteria relating to the joint degree program are as follows: 1. Candidates to the joint degree program must meet the entrance requirements established by each individual program. Candidates must indicate on their application their intention to pursue the joint degree option. Students deciding to pursue the joint degre e option after having been admitted to one program will indicate this intention only on their second application. 2. Applications for a joint degree will not be accepted from candidates who have already completed their degree. MSIRE and MSH students must appl y and be admitted prior to or concurrent with the last semester in which they are expected to complete their original degree requirements. 3. Joint degree candidates will not receive either degree until all requirements for both programs have been satisfied. Students deciding against completing a second degree must satisfy all first degree program requirements as if the student had never been a joint degree candidate. Graduate Catalog 201 4-2015 Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism Management 663 4. The joint degree program will apply to the on-line versions of both degree programs. The joint degree does not include the Executive MSHM degree. 5. Candidates must satisfy all requirements for each degree. To obtain the MSIRE degree, student will be required to take ten (10) courses totaling thirty (30) credit hours. These courses include the real e state courses in the MSIRE core, finance courses in the MSIRE core, plus real estate (REE prefix) or other electives (FIN prefix, for example) for a total of 30 credit hours.

The relations are one way based on the initial program within which a student enrolls. This means that students starting in the MSH program will take the HFT classes and the students in the MSIRE will take the FIN and REE classes. By considering these classes as sufficient substitutes, the joint degree program will reduce time to degree and cost. The two degrees will potentially have 4 common or substitute courses.
