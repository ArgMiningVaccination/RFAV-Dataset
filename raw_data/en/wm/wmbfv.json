This is the namegiven to them by the Bureau of IndianAffairs, the United States governmentagency designated to deal with NativeAmericans. The TAT refer to themselves asthe Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nationbut continue to use the name \"ThreeAffiliated T ribes.\" Of the total 10,000enrolled members 4,000 reside on thereservation. The Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people reside on the Fort Berthold IndianReservation, encompassing approximatelyone million acres of land, of whichapproximately half is owned by the tribeand its members (the remainder isprimarily owned by non-Indians with theU.S. Government owning a small share).In the 1851 T reaty of Fort Laramie, theoriginal size of the MHA territory agreedto by the Three Affiliated Tribes andrepresentatives of the United Statesgovernment included 12.5 million acres.Thus, the Three T ribes have lost over 92%of their original territory. The United States through the following actions reduced thesize of the MHA lands to its present dayboundaries.Unit One History Knife River Indian Villages NHS 9 Northwestern University Library, Edward S. Curtis's 'The North American Indian': the Photographic Images , 2001.Unit One History Knife River Indian Villages NHS 101845 Agreement at Ft. Berthold 1866: At the urging of the U.S. Government, the MHAagreed to grant rights-of-wayto railroads and settlers whowanted more land. Congress,however, added additionallands onto the agreementwithout the consent of theMHA. The treaty was neverratified but Congress refusedto recognize that the lands belonged to the Tribe.Executive Order of 1870: The actual Fort Berthold In-dian Reservation was estab-lished under this order. TheU.S. Government howeverreduced the Southernboundary of the MHA terri-tory because the Siouxclaimed it. In the early reser-vation days, people of theMHA were forbidden by thefederal government frompracticing their Native reli- gion.Executive Order of 1880: The U.S. Government fur-ther reduced the MHA landsto the present day bound-aries of the reservation.When the Three T ribes re-ceived a court settlementyears later on December 1,1930, it was determined bythe court that from 1851 theamount of lands taken fromthe MHA without compen-sation was 11,424,512.76 acres. General Allotment Act of 1887: This act was supposedly passed to assist tribes inadopting the lifestyles of non-Indians; how-ever, the actual intent was to gain controlover more Indian lands. The act succeededin the latter with the Indians losing over 90 million acres of their lands. The ThreeTribes alone lost 1,600,000 acres as a resultof the Executive Order of 1891 which pro-vided for allotment of the Fort BertholdIndian Reservation. The allotment was car-ried out with 160 acres going to each headof a family; 80 acres going to each individualover the age of 18 not heading a family; and40 acres to each child. The most fertilefarmland on the reservation was retained by the government as \"surplus\" lands.Unit One History Knife River Indian Villages NHS 11Act of June 10, 1910: Against the wishes of the ThreeTribes the government againforced them into selling thesurplus lands on their reser-vation. The Homestead Actopened up the northeastquadrant of the FortBerthold Indian Reservationfor settlement by white im-migrants taking over 200,000acres from the T ribe. Thiswas the most fertile land onthe reservation for agricul- ture. 1944 Flood Control Act: This legislation sought to control the upper Missouri primarily to prevent flooding of downstream states. Other fea- tures of the act included water use for irrigation and recreation. The damsites were located where Indian lands were affected. The Three Tribesfared the worst of any tribal group. The floodwaters of the Garrison Damessentially destroyed the whole socio-economic infrastructure of theMandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara, their homes, communities, hospital, cen-tralized school system, T ribal headquarters, sawmills, and connectingroads were all destroyed. The tribal peoples tried earnestly to preventthe destruction of their homelands; however, they lacked the politicalclout to stop the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclama- tion. Floodwaters of the completed dam were already covering the an-cestral homelands, possibly occupied for millennia, when the TribalChairman, George Gillette, tearfully signed the document turning the flooded land over to the government. 1950Unit One History Knife River Indian Villages NHS 12Pre-Garrison Dam Prior to the flooding of their lands, the Three Tribes had been doing quite well. A studyconducted in the mid -1980's to determine just how much the Garrison Dam had impactedthe Three Affiliated Tribes in the early 1950'sshowed that only six families on the entirereservation had been receiving any type ofstate or federal assistance (welfare). Only afew people on the reservation used alcohol.The people generally lived an industrious lifestyle in the early reservation days. Theycontinued to successfully hunt, fish, garden,and now planted some grain crops. Peopleharvested the many varieties of wild fruits andberries; they continued to preserve theirgarden produce and dried meat for use in thewinter, engaging in what is sometimes re-ferred to as a subsistence economy TheMandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara essentiallylived off the land. They were an inde-pendent community . The inundation of theMHA homelands brought new challenges tothe Three T ribes. Post-Garrison Dam The Three Tribes had been promised by theUnited States that the lost infrastructurewould be rebuilt; however, neither thehospital nor the bridge connecting T winButtes (South Segment) and White Shield(East Segment) was ever replaced. Schoolswere not in place for children to attendnecessitating that children as young as fiveyears of age be sent off to schools run by thegovernment or religious organizations.Agriculture was difficult to practice on theglacially tilled soils of the bench lands whichwere made up of rocks and heavy clay .Oftentimes, water was not available at siteswhere individual families were relocated.Many hauled their water from long distancesusing a team and wagon. Worst of all, thepeople changed from a highly active lifestyleto being very sedentary. When gardensrefused to grow, gone was the abundantharvesting of the natural foods. Families now relied almost entirely upon commodities, i.e.,surplus foods of the government. Such foodswere extremely high in fats andcarbohydrates, which seriously affected thehealth of tribal members. Health T oday at least 89% of the tribal members canexpect to have some form of diabetes by thetime they reach age 55. Diabetes is attributedin part to a sedentary life style and to a diethigh in fats and carbohydrates. Symptoms ofthe disease include loss of limbs, loss ofvision, loss of teeth, kidney failure, mentalconfusion, and an early loss of life. The tribalgovernment, using i ts own resources and with the help of federal funds, has built adialysis clinic to assist the large number ofdiabetics on the reservation. A health educa-tion program is operated to assist in the careand prevention of diabetes. Many of theadults with diabetes today spent years attend-ing federal Indian boarding schools or missionschools where the daily meals were providedfrom commodities (government issued foodsoften containing excessive fat and carbohy-drates). NPSUnit One History Knife River Indian Villages NHS 13Education in Boarding Schools As early as 1869, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara children were sent to Indianboarding schools in Virginia andPennsylvania. The idea behind thisremoval of the children was to remove alltraces of their Indian culture and turnthem into white people. In the 1860's, theUnited States government was wonderingwhat to do with the Indians. Less than 3%of the 10 million Indians in this country atthe time of contact remained. Concernedpeople in the Eastern part of the UnitedStates suggested the Indians be schooledin an attempt to assimilate them into thewhite culture. Thus, approximately 32children of the Three Tribes were taken toHampton Institute in V irginia, and theCarlisle Industrial School in Pennsylvania.More followed over the years. Indianboarding schools sprang up in North andSouth Dakota, and in many other stateswest of the Mississippi. Children of theMandan, Hidatsa and Arikara werescattered throughout many of theseinstitutions. Impacts of the Schools More than the health of the children sentaway to schools was affected. Children'scommunication with family members was guarded in that both their incoming andoutgoing mail was opened, read, and cen-sored. Letters deemed unacceptable weretorn up and discarded. In the institutionalizedschool settings, children had their hair cutshort. They were stripped and treated withchemicals to ensure they carried no body lice.They were not allowed to speak their Nativelanguage or practice any Native ceremonies.Their Indian clothing was removed and theywere garbed in European-style clothing.Children were beaten if they failed to follow the school mandates. Some of the childrendid not see their parents or family membersagain for up to 8 years or more. Institutional-izing the children meant that they did notgrow up within a normal family setting. Theydid not learn how to parent from within thefamily . They learned that it was acceptable tobeat your children. This was in direct conflictwith the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara valuesused in raising children. Tribal parents did notbeat their children. It was customary forparents to invite an uncle to come and talk toa recalcitrant child so as not to damage thechild-parent relationship in any way . Treating Historical Trauma In recent years, concerned tribal membershave addressed the impacts of the boardingschools. Healing workshops are offereddealing with the intergenerational cycles ofabuse caused by such schools. After years ofremaining silent about their traumatic experi-ences, tribal members are finally able toexpress their grief over having been sent tothe schools. They are finally able to under-stand that what happened to them was nottheir fault and that they did not deserve to bemistreated as children. Traditional methods ofhealing are employed in the workshops.Unit One History Knife River Indian Villages NHS 14Education T oday T oday, K-12 education on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation takes place in schoolswithin the communities. There are threetribal schools that operate under both thestate and federal government: T win Buttes,Mandaree, and White Shield. There are twopublic schools: New T own and Parshall. Analternative school is also located in NewT own. Each of the six districts have Headstartprograms which children may attend prior toelementary school. The Fort Berthold Com-munity College (FBCC) is located in NewT own and has satellites in White Shield,Mandaree, and T win Buttes. Adults of all agesattend this tribal college where they can earnAssociate Degrees or V ocational Certificateschoosing from 34 programs of study . TheFBCC also collaborates with other institu-tions to offer bachelors or masters degrees.The education philosophy of the TAT pro-fesses that education begins with the unbornand continues throughout life, which reflectsthe type of organized learning that existed300 years ago in the earth lodge villages. TheTribal Business Council, which is the govern-ing body of the MHA Nation, requires that allstudents must say in school until they gradu-ate or reach the age of 18. Even so, there is ahigh dropout rate. However, most dropoutseventually earn a General Equivalency Di-ploma (GED) through the Adult Educationprogram at the FBCC. Current Culture Some of the old societies for men and womenstill exist today. Indivi duals belonging to the societies continue to carry on ceremonies andsocial traditions of the Mandan, Hidatsa, andArikara. For example, the Black Mouthsociety was recently reorganized. The CrazyDog Society continues to meet. The AntelopeSociety plans, organizes, and directs theannual Little Shell Pow W ow, which is thelargest event on the reservation. Clans that existed during the Knife River village days arestill in place. People are born into a clan orcan be adopted into a clan. Membership in aclan is passed down through the mother. Women and men continue with some of the same activities that occurred at the KnifeRiver Villages. Families and individualscontinue to plant gardens. W omen annuallydry corn so they can make corn soup, atraditional food. Wild berries are still pickedand dried for use in traditional foods.Earthlodges are still being built (for displayand use) on the reservation using materialsfrom the area. T oday it is the men who arebuilding the lodges with assistance from thewomen, whereas the women built the lodgeswith assistance of the men in the days of KnifeRiver. Native Spirituality T oday Congress passed the American IndianReligious Freedom Act in 1978 allowingNative Americans to once again practice theirspiritual beliefs; however, many individuals onFort Berthold continued to practice their wayof life even during the years it was prohibited.Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people todaycontinue to build and use sweat lodges intheir daily lives. When an individual is sick inbody or spirit, a person considered to be ahealer is contacted to run a sweat for theailing individual. Tribal members believe thata sacred sweat can bring an afflicted personback in balance. The sweat lodge is a dome-like willow structure covered with blankets, canvas, andtarps. It is similar to a sauna in that heatedrocks are placed in a pit inside the lodge. Asthey enter the lodge, participants sit in a circlearound the pit. Water is poured on the rocksUnit One History Knife River Indian Villages NHS 15to create steam. When the door closes, the participants are in the spirit world. Prayersand songs are offered from the time the fire isprepared to heat the rocks until the sweatlodge has ended. The sweat lodge is oftenused for purification to prepare for otherceremonies. Continuity of Mandan, Hidatsa,and Arikara spirituality includes tribalmembers praying with their sacred bundles. Individuals continue to receive their Indian names, some of which are passed down fromtheir ancestors. The Mandan still have theirturtle medicine bundles and carry on theO-kee-pa ceremony; the Hidatsa continue to carry on the ceremonies of the clans.Ceremonies, are still practiced today such asthe Sun Dance. The Arikara continue to praywith their sacred bundles. The teachings ofMother Corn are still practical and taught tothe young. The Mother Corn bundlescontinue as a part of Arikara family traditions.Men and women continue to go out on a hillto fast and pray .
