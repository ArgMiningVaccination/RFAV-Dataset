We are well -positioned in an industry that is rapidly expanding with our scale and diversification across product offerings.\" Dear Shareholders, I begin with the hope that this letter finds you and your loved ones secure and in good health. At Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance, we continue to adapt with gumption to the unpredictable, in the form of an inflationary environment, continued geo -political strains, supply chain disruptions, among others. We persevered amid the unalterable pandemic, and its recurring waves, to embrace every opportunity that could support us in our bounce back and in making the most of the boost in economic activity. Our resourcefulness enabled the delivery of consistent performance, while a gradual market recovery keeps us optimistic of the future. A PROMISING PROSPECT FOR TOMORROW The life insurance industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.3% between 2021 and 2026. India's insurance penetration was pegged at 4.2% in FY21, with life insurance penetration at 3.2%. New individual business premium in India increased by 16% to ` 87,573 Crore in FY22. The pandemic has driven home the importance of insurance among masses. Customers are beginning to see more value in getting insured to cover any capital crunch their family may face during adversities. Digitisation, innovation, and strong distribution channels are also enablers in accelerating this growth. Disposable personal incomes have shown a trend of cash utilisation in covering financial risks among middle and upper middle-class population working largely in the formal employment sector. For the informal and lower income groups, government schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) was instrumental in getting them under the cover of insurance policies with lower premiums. The industry is poised to gain from factors such as retirement planning, expanding middle-class, and a large younger population who are aware and informed. Customisation of life insurance products has become popular among customers and despite increased premium costs, term plans are drawn up based on these tailored needs. This trend confirms the maturing of life insurance from a simple tax-saving instrument to a holistic financial security option for people. 8 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited \"Customisation of life insurance products has become popular among customers and despite increased premium costs, term plans are drawn up based on these tailored needs. This trend confirms the maturing of life insurance from a simple tax-saving instrument to a holistic financial security option for people.\"TECHNOLOGY ENABLED Traditional and digital channels will continue to co-exist in the industry as there will always be customers who would prefer physical mode of transaction. We are strengthening our client servicing process by imbibing digital efficiencies. Technology is integrated into every customer touch point to ensure quicker turnaround and better experience. We adopted digital tools such as e-KYC, integration with payment wallets, and credit check facilities to improve transactional convenience and provide a fair degree of security protection. Machine learning technologies will make significant strides towards helping deliver improved transparency, quick access to transactions, and need-based customised solutions. We leverage the use of decision engines and predictive analytic models to provide meaningful consumer insights. It will eventually allow us to offer appropriate items in line with a person's needs. Our investment in digital infrastructure helped improve the claim settlement process. 52% of our underwriting mechanism is automated and we are working to reach 70% by the end of this year. DELIVERING ON COMMITMENT FY22 had a significant outgo led by Covid related claims. We were amid a once-in-a-century scenario where we settled Covid claims of ` 256 Crore in the shortest span yet. The effect of Covid claims notwithstanding, we maintained profitability for the business and recorded PAT of 127 Crore at the close of the financial year. Advisory and Bancassurance were the most critical channels driving this growth. Our proprietary channel brings in 43% of the business whereas Banca is responsible for generating 57%. We recorded a 14% year-on-year growth in Individual First Year Premium (FYP) while renewal premium increased by 24%. Our gross margins came in at over 43%, while Net VNB margins were maintained at 15%. Our claim settlement ratio stood at 98.08% as compared to 98% in FY21. Renewals premium and collections are being increasingly conducted online. I am glad that our growth trajectory has put us in the league of top players in the industry.PEOPLE While we bring security into the lives of our customers, we are equally concerned for the well-being of our employees. Through their relentless efforts, they have ensured that we stay on top of our business targets. We fully vaccinated our employees and their families and owing to our partnerships with hospital chains, not a single employee or their loved ones faced any problem while securing hospital bed when the caseload was high. ABSLI will keep up its commitment to secure and defend our customer's future with our complete suite of protection solutions. We are well-positioned in an industry that is rapidly expanding with our scale and diversification across product offerings. With effective strategy, we are confident in our ability to create sustained value for all our stakeholders. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to our investors, customers, partners, and community members who continued to invest their trust in us and powered our ability to deliver exceptional returns in the aftermath of the pandemic.

However, global economy is in the throes of a geo-political cataclysm, with heightened uncertainty obscuring the outlook. Globally, monetary policy actions and policies have targeted at unwinding of stimulus and normalisation, albeit at differing paces. An increasing number of central banks are witnessing higher levels of inflation and are rushing to tighten monetary policy across advanced and emerging market economies. Financial conditions are witnessing tightening as markets brace for shifts in liquidity and northward movement in interest rates are triggering wide selloffs in bond and equity markets as well as in currency markets in the emerging world. Hardening of food and energy prices, along with supply bottlenecks are keeping inflation entrenched and broad-based across economies. Accentuating geopolitical tensions provide another layer of uncertainty to the outlook. Global rates jumped higher as FOMC started its rate hike cycle, citing stronger economy, robust labour markets and high inflation. Yield curve inversion in US rates have led to discussions on recessionary fears. As guidance on balance sheet reduction by Federal Reserve has crystallised, curve has steepened. Inflation continues to mount, while turning more entrenched and broad-based across economies. Ongoing geopolitical crisis and the fear of prolonged supply disruptions have accentuated inflationary risks. Accordingly, the OECD has revised its projection for global inflation by approximately 2.5 percentage points for 2022 from its December forecast of 4.2 per cent. Crude oil prices rocketed to a 14-year high of US$ 133 per barrel in the first week of March. Although they eased subsequently, high volatility has characterised their movements. In its Interim Economic Outlook released on March 17, 2022, the OECD projects global growth to be lower by over one percentage point in 2022 from its December forecast of 4.5 per cent. This downward revision presumes that the commodity and financial market shocks seen in the first two weeks of the conflict persist for at least a year. OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ECONOMY After a 6.6 per cent contraction in FY 2020-21, the Indian economy rebounded to 8.9 per cent in FY 2021-22 as per the second advance estimates released by the NSO. The strong Delta wave in the beginning of the fiscal had a significant negative impact on growth in the first half of the fiscal. While economy has shown steady recovery from 2Q FY22 onwards, it has been a K shaped recovery with informal and contact intensive sectors lagging, and industry and agriculture doing much better. The Omicron wave in early 2022 also impacted growth, although to a much lesser extent than the Delta wave. Falling infections, rapid vaccination coverage and quick normalisation of mobility has facilitated the recovery in economic activity over the last year. Rural demand has remained resilient while urban demand has also recovered with pent-up demand supporting the recovery in contact-intensive sectors. Private final consumption expenditure and consumption sentiment survey have been weak. However, recovery has moved much further in industrial sector, construction, and exports. Inflation also rose in India like in much of the world, but remained within the RBI tolerance band. Higher inflation in India has been due to high commodity prices and global supply disruptions. After remaining ultra-accommodative and giving preference to growth over inflation, high inflation has finally resulted in pivot by RBI which now gives more importance to inflation over growth, although remaining accommodative. The Union Budget for FY 2022-23 was focused on growth revival, budgeting for an aggressive capex spending while setting a fiscal deficit target at an elevated level of 6.4% of GDP. Consequently, government borrowing remains elevated. High inflation, hawkish RBI, sharp increase in bond yields and the large borrowing program have caused interest rates in India to rise significantly. Exports and Imports both jumped sharply in FY22 as high oil prices, demand for gold and strong global growth supported both imports and exports. India's trade deficit rose from $102.63 CAD is also expected to have widened to 1.5% of GDP from 0.9% of GDP surplus in FY21. Going forward, oil prices will be the most important variable for the Indian economy as the same impacts India's GDP growth, inflation as well as BOP dynamics. LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW The Life Insurance Industry has gone through a critical transformation in the past two decades after opening the sector for private players. Its journey has been characterised by shifts in product propositions, regulatory changes, and evolution of distribution channels. Despite interim setbacks the industry has grown at a significant pace over the last few years. There has been a recalibration of distribution models, ongoing product innovations and realignment of processes to provide a seamless and better experience to the end consumer. The size of the Indian life insurance sector was 6.3 trillion on a total premium basis in FY'21. The total premium in the Indian life insurance sector grew at a CAGR of approximately 14% between FY'02 and FY'21 outpacing the GDP CAGR of 12% during the same period. For weighted Individual new business premium, industry has grown at a CAGR of 11% during FY'02 to FY'22. FY21 was ended as a mixed performance year for the industry. The industry took a hit in H1FY21 due to COVID impact. As the Management Discussion and Analysis 20 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited economy opened from H2 onwards, the industry has shown a growth traction. In FY'22, overall industry has grown by 13% for total individual and group new business, whereas private players grew by 23%. Considering this, we are expecting a higher growth rate in the coming financial years and ABSLI would leverage business growth along with industry growth. Density / penetration When compared to other developed economies, India remains vastly under-insured, both in terms of penetration and density. Macro-economic factors such as growth in GDP and rise in per capita income, coupled with rising awareness about need for life insurance, higher financial savings as a percentage of GDP, increasing urbanisation and increase in digitalisation would continue to aid the growth of the Indian life insurance sector. India's Insurance penetration has steadily increased to 3.2 percent in 2021. Insurance penetration in some of the world economies like, Canada, EMEA and Emerging EMEA during the same year were at 3.1, 4.6 and 0.7 percent respectively. The insurance density in India has reached USD 59 in 2021. The comparative figures for Canada, EMEA and Emerging EMEA during the same period were at USD 1,878, USD 1,893, and USD 30 respectively. Globally insurance penetration and density were at 3.3 percent and USD 360 in 124Global comparison of US Canada EMEA Emerging EMEAAdvanced Asia PacEmerging Asia PacIndia Source - IRDA handbook 2021Density (USD) Penetration (%)Protection Gap In India, the protection gap - the difference between the resources needed and the resources available - is high amongst those insured under some form of life insurance cover. Lack of awareness around what is an adequate life insurance cover for an individual increases the mortality protection gap. Despite increased awareness about the need for life cover post Covid-19, insurance remains underpenetrated in India with a gap of ~83% demonstrating a large untapped segment. India's GDP In FY'22 the Indian economy advanced at 8.7%, higher than the projected growth rate of 8.5%. Further, RBI estimates a GDP growth rate of 7.2% in FY23 (Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI)). In the past, the Insurance Industry has witnessed positive correlation between GDP growth and growth of Life Insurance Industry and thus the industry is expected to grow in similar direction. Size of the sector Distribution Spread of the Industry 24L+ Individual Agents11,000+ Branches970+ Brokers41 Banks & Report 2021-22FINANCIAL New FY Analysis (Contd.) Rising Pension/Annuity segment The retirement space is an equally large opportunity. Improving life expectancy has increased the post retirement life span to around 20 years. In comparison to global benchmarks, India's pension market is under penetrated at 2.1%1 of the GDP. The number of people above the age of 60 years is expected to triple from 2015 to 2050, thus providing insurers an opportunity to offer long-term income and annuity products. The growth will be driven by changing demographics, increase in life expectancy and lack of a formal social security system for the wider population. 1 Source: World Bank collection of development indicators LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE Individual Life During FY'22, the life insurance industry grew by 16% to garner 876bn of weighted individual new business premiums1 as against 757 bn in the previous financial year. Private insurers grew by 22% in individual business, LIC recorded a growth of 7%. Development of alternate channels of distribution and product innovation have been the key drivers for the growth in market share of private insurers, which has increased from 46% in FY'11 to 63% in FY'22. Distribution arrangements with large banks have been a key driver for most of the large insurers, Bancassurance continues to dominate at 55% channel mix with rising share of web aggregator and direct channels - 30% CAGR over 5 years. The sector's 12 percent growth is being driven by an increase in the average premium earned. However, the growth in number of new policies sold remains a challenge for the industry. The count of Insurance Agents in the Industry has remained stagnant at around 2.45 mn with a 5-year CAGR of 4%. Also, the count of branches has remained at the same level of 11,000 for the last 5 years. 22 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited Composition of Industry Channel Mix for Individual Business Source - Life Insurance Council 1 Weighted Individual New business premium considers Single premium at 10%IndustryFY FY 11 FY 12 FY Life During FY'22, the Group business grew by 15% to 1,890 bn of new business premium as against 1,645 bn in the previous financial year. Private insurers grew by 23%, LIC recorded a growth of 13% dominating the line of business at 75% mindshare. Group is a growing business with 17 Cr+ lives covered. Protecting the employees and securing gratuity and other employee related termination benefits has been a key driver for growth in market share of private insurers, from 21% in FY'11 to 24% in FY'22. Within the private sector, the top 5 insurers accounted for 79% of the private market in FY'22. Credit Life business is a rising segment in this line of business and a few top players continue to focus on the same given high value accretion. Social Security Code initially proposed for implementation in Mar'21 could have given a boost to Group sector. However, its postponement and rising interest rates resulted in reduced inflows of fund business as corporate retirement liabilities reduced. Due to COVID 19, Term business was severely impacted and suffered huge death claims across industry resulting into higher reinsurance prices making the product expensive with upward price revisions.25% 23 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Source: Basis public disclosures of top 7 players in Life Insurance Industry13th month 61st month50%27%85%PrivateFY and Analysis (Contd.) Product Mix While LIC's individual product mix contains largely participating products, private players have a more balanced product mix. The individual product mix for private players has been broadening from market linked products historically to non-linked products offering guaranteed savings, pure life protection, participating products, and rising share of annuities to tap new segments of customers. Diversification within savings products, driven by product innovation, changing customer preferences and evolving regulations, has resulted in private life insurers shifting focus from a largely unit linked dominated product mix to a more diversified one. The pandemic also induced awareness for the need of more insurance and long-term wealth creation which led to further diversification in the savings segment in FY'22. Over the last few years, private insurers have increased their focus on the under-penetrated protection segment. Focus on the retirement space has also increased given the market opportunity. This has been the scenario in the last financial year as well, where the product mix has moved towards traditional business for the private players with high focus on non-par savings and protection. Both these segments were the flavour of FY'22, given the fact that there is hardly any substitute for long-term insurance products which seek to address the risk of loss of life (term protection) and risk of loss of income/ longevity risk (annuities, guaranteed products). This is also accentuated by the fact that during uncertain times, people like to have certainty around their savings. New alternatives like return of premium products, value-added riders and combo products are getting launched to push protection sales growth and expand margins. This, combined with awareness campaigns, is expected to lift growth in the retail protection segment. Predominantly considered a push product, individual protection products have seen faster acceptance by the affluent segment and is becoming a pull product. Private Industry ULIP & Trad Mix is balanced around 39:61 whereas industry mix is at 20:80; the overall shift in mix is due to the dominance of LIC. There has been an industry wide increase in exposure to guaranteed products due to increasing demands from customer due to falling interest rates and safeguarding the return on investment. As the current premium can be invested in long duration bonds, there is a risk that it might not generate a similar or higher return on future premiums. If interest rates continue to trend downward, it will lead to asset-liability mismatch at some point in future, these can be better managed through instruments such as Forward rate agreements and Interest rate swaps. QUALITY OF BUSINESS Average persistency levels Companies are helping consumers take informed decisions and improving the overall experience across their life cycle by making most of the services available online. This has led to increased stickiness of customers which is apparent from the Persistency levels in the industry which have been constantly rising with majority of the players showing consistent improvement in persistency across all cohorts. The average 13th month persistency for top private players is at 86% as at Mar'22. 24 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited As Covid 19 was a rare and disastrous event, the regulator also closely monitored claim settlements. The industry settled a total of 170+ Bn amount of Covid claims during FY'22. ABSLI has also settled 8+ Bn of gross Covid claims and all claims were processed and settled within prescribed timelines by regulator. ABSLI was able to achieve this as it had dedicated SPOCS at the branches who were trained to attend to claimants and capture the right information in the first instance. Claim intimation process was eased through online facility and through WhatsApp. Also, separate teams were created for processing early and non-early claims. The Company continued its operations under its Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and implemented a business normalisation plan thereby mitigating the business impact. While following COVID-19 protocols as mandated by the Government, the Company and its Subsidiary gave utmost importance to the health and well-being of its employees and continued the operations in business continuity mode using technology and digital tools at all functional levels and serving customers at all locations. Vaccination was identified as a key component in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. To safeguard the health of employees and their families, the Company also embarked on a vaccination drive for them and extended complete care and assistance at all levels during the pandemic. Towards the end of the year, COVID-19 infections started ebbing and conditions started normalising resulting in resumption of normal business operations by the Company and its Subsidiary in line with staggered relaxations notified by the Government. The details of BCP with reference to COVID-19 are covered comprehensively under the Business Continuity section. The industry has witnessed a spike in mortality claims among policy holders due to Covid-19. The actual claims paid by Insurers are far higher than estimated by actuaries at the time of pricing the policies. The higher claim experience has resulted in pressure on reinsurers and thus incurring losses and reduced margins. As a result of this, there has been an upward price revision by all reinsurers across product segments majorly impacting term products. This has resulted in term products getting costlier for policyholders. It is estimated that in 1 - 2 years period on attaining normalcy, reinsurance prices will reduce, resetting term product prices at pre covid levels. ABSLI PERFORMANCE - SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS Consistent growth in Individual Business Individual New business Premium (APE) grew by 14% to 2,212 Cr in FY22.

Insurers have embedded technology in their value chain, addressing challenges in areas like underwriting, delayed processing, mis-selling etc. There has been a visible reduction in surrenders and complaints; there has been a fall in customer complaints by more than 20% over the last 5 year period. COVID-19 The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic continued during the financial year 2021-22 with the second wave and third wave during the financial year under review. The second wave hit the insurance companies hard resulting in 2x - 3x times death claims in both lines of business i.e., Individual and Group having impact on net profit of Companies. All major players suffered a degrowth in their Profit Before Tax for Q1 & Q2 of FY'22 when Covid claims were at a peak with some improvement in subsequent quarters as the impact of Covid subsided. Two out of three listed players have shown degrowth in profit for FY'22.Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.) Renewal premium growth Renewal premium has been constantly growing with a 2 year CAGR of 16% & 9M FY22 growth at 12% for the major private players. The growth is on account of higher new business growth in the previous year, and robust collections in the long-term savings products launched last year. With enablement of several digital modes for customers to pay renewal premiums ranging from payment links on website and app, payment apps has led to premiums being collected via digital mode. Several digital modes for payment of renewal premium have been enabled, thereby increasing customer convenience and higher persistency 25 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)

Group Fund business contributes a healthy portion of overall company profit due to charges income earned and low expense model. OYRT (One Year Renewable Term) business grew by 157% over FY'21. The Company strategically re-priced OYRT schemes to negate the negative impact from COVID claims in this segment. Credit Life business grew by 119% over FY'21. The Company sees a huge opportunity in the Credit Life business for the current and next few years as the lending market was rough during COVID phase and has picked up in this financial year. The segment remains very value accretive and the Company is looking at competitive pricing to drive scalability with acquisition of new clients given the above opportunity. The Company will continue to do conscious strategic investments to drive scale and strengthen its rank and market share in this line of business. Group New Business Premium ABSLI Private by 24% from 5,212 Cr in FY'21 to 6,475 Cr in FY'22. The growth was on account of higher new business growth in the previous year, robust collections in our long-term savings products launched last year and continuous demonstration of customer's trust. The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in fewer physical interactions and branch visits by customers however, our technology platforms played a pivotal role in accelerating digital servicing and selling without compromising quality and safety. We also launched the renewal premium collection Bot (ZARA) in FY'22 which has helped us in collecting more than 400 Cr premium and same is expected to grow 2x-3x in FY'23. 26 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited Management Non-Digital DigitalFY 20 FY overall revenue FY22 Total Premium was at 12,140 Cr, a growth of 24% with a solid 5-year CAGR of 16%, FY' 21 FY' 22Total Premium CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY VECTORS AND ADOPTING DIGITAL ADOPTION Persistency improvement 13th Month Persistency grew to 85% (FY'21- 82%) and 25th Month to 73% (FY'21 - 72%).

Adopting digital mindset Adopting new technology is essential for any organisation focusing on faster deliveries, reduced spending, and enhanced customer experience. It has become highly essential as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced organisations to reconsider their strategies. The three-to-five-year digital transformation plan depends on creating a culture of continuous learning and required that employees develop a digital mindset. Higher digital adoption by customers and distributors requires insurers to develop strong technological capabilities and highly efficient platforms, which are powered by analytics, automation, and artificial intelligence. Seamless integration of these platforms and processes with the partners' systems is necessary. Customers' expectation of personalised and improved service experience can be addressed using artificial intelligence, cloud computing, machine learning algorithms and bots. ABSLI has end to end digitalised its front end and back-end processes covering all the major milestones of Policy life cycle. It has Customer acquisition assets like Pre-Sales App for Lead generation management, Prospective App Sales buddy for assisting advisors, E-App for managing new business digitally, etc. Also, during FY'22, the Company has implemented an automated AI driven underwriting system, which enables it to auto underwrite policies and acts as an aid to intelligence for acquiring new risk consciously. The Company will have a significant advantage and an industry- first capability when the Insta Issuance project goes live in Quarter 1 of FY'23. 28 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.) PRODUCT MIX In line with Industry, the Company has also changed its product mix strategy and has reduced contribution of ULIP products in overall topline with a shift to innovative non-Par and protection products. It has also helped the Company in generating a higher margin as non-Par products are more profitable than ULIP. The share of Non savings products is estimated to remain above 50% level due to high demand and lower protection mix. The Company navigated through these challenges through balanced pricing arrangements with reinsurers. The Company continues to have a diversified product portfolio. A diversified product strategy helps in safeguarding against Capital Market Volatility, Regulatory changes and changes in customer behaviour. During the year, the Company has reduced its ULIP share and maintained protection mix. Expected maturity benefits of the guaranteed portfolio are entirely hedged. In the current year, the Company launched 3 products in the guaranteed space and a new Par product with industry best features. The new products contributed to 14% of the overall Individual FYP for FY'22. ULIP Mix in both Proprietary at 37% & Partnership channels at 31% has seen an increase over FY 2020-21. Proprietary channel continues to maintain a healthy protection mix of 9% despite industry-wide challenges with Protection All term policies are 100% medically underwritten to ensure quality of business undertaken. Also, to protect Policyholders' guaranteed benefits in low interest rate scenarios company has entered into Forward Rate Agreements (FRA) to protect 100% expected maturity and survival benefits. The Company has achieved a growth of 28% in Gross Margins through better product mix and interest rate hardening, coupled with better Opex management, Company was able to achieve 15% Net VNB margins for FY'22 (increase by 440+ bps over FY'21), a year ahead of guidance given earlier.

Over the years, the Company and its subsidiary have built a strong Risk Management Framework supported by well-established policies and procedures and a talented pool of Risk Professionals. The Company was able to face the unprecedented challenges during the year and emerged stronger during these turbulent times due to some of these policies and frameworks. The Company and its subsidiary have a well-established Risk Management framework designed to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risks inherent in the business. The framework enables effective risk management through a structure of Committees, policies, internal controls and reporting. The organisational structure to manage the risk consists of \"Three lines of defence\": First is: Line Management (Functional Heads) to ensure that accountability and ownership is as close as possible to the activity that creates the risks; Second is: Risk Oversight including the Risk and Compliance Function and the Risk Management Committee Third is: Independent Assurance through Internal Audits conducted under the supervision of the Audit Committee.

We recognise the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience of incumbents while positioning our executives. We use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector. V. Executive Pay-Mix Our executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits76 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited Annual Incentive Plan: We tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant financial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. We annually align the financial and operational metrics with priorities/ focus areas for the business. Long-Term Incentive: Our Long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long-term growth and act as a retention and reward tool. We use stock options as the primary long-term incentive vehicles for our executives as we believe that they best align executive incentives with stockholder interests. We grant restricted stock units as a secondary long-term incentive vehicles, to motivate and retain our executives. Performance Goal Setting We aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long-term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be achievable and realistic. Threshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall reflect a base-line level of performance, reflecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement. Target performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance. Maximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of achievement, reflecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement. VI. Executive Benefits and Perquisites Our executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans. In addition to these broad-based plans, they are eligible for perquisites and benefits plans commensurate with their roles. These benefits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group. Other Remuneration Elements Each of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration package for our executives including continuity of service across the Group Companies. We limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances of compelling business need or competitive rationale and generally do not provide for any tax gross- ups for our executives. Risk and Compliance We aim to ensure that the Group's remuneration programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. We review our remuneration programs for factors such as remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives, uncapped pay-outs, unreasonable goals or thresholds, steep pay-out cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term decisions to meet pay-out thresholds. Claw back Clause: In an incident of restatement of financial statements, due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies Act 2013 and the rules made thereafter, we shall recover from our executives, the remuneration received in excess, of what would be payable to him / her as per restatement of financial statements pertaining to the relevant performance year. The Group and Business Centre of Expertise teams will assist the Nomination & Remuneration Committee in adopting, interpreting and implementing the Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy. These services will be established through \"arm's length\", agreements entered into as needs arise in the normal course of business.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938 as amended by the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 (the \"Insurance Act\"), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999 (the \"IRDA Act\"), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Preparation of Financial Statements and Auditor's Report of Insurance Companies) Regulations, 2002 (the \"IRDA Financial Statements Regulations\"), circulars/ orders/directions issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (the \"IRDAI\") in this regard and the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (the \"Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006, as amended (\"Accounting Standards\") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, as applicable to insurance companies: i. in the case of the Balance Sheet, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2022; ii. in the case of the Revenue Account, of the net surplus for the year ended March 31, 2022; iii. in the case of the Profit and Loss Account, of the profit for the year ended March 31, 2022; and iv. in the case of the Receipts and Payments Account, of the receipts and payments for the year ended March 31, 2022. Basis for Opinion 3. We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\"ICAI\") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements. Emphasis of Matter 4. We draw attention to Note 49 of the standalone financial statements in which the Company describes the uncertainties arising from the COVID 19 pandemic situation. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. Key Audit Matter 5. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.86 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Information Technology Systems: The Company is dependent on its Information Technology (\"IT\") systems due to the significant number of transactions that are processed daily across such multiple and discrete IT systems. Also, IT application controls are critical to ensure that changes to applications and underlying data are made in an appropriate manner and under controlled environments. Appropriate controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to applications and data. On account of the pervasive use of its IT systems, the testing of the general computer controls of the IT systems used in financial reporting was considered to be a Key Audit Matter.With the assistance of our IT specialists, we obtained an understanding of the Company's IT applications, databases and operating systems relevant to financial reporting and the control environment. For these elements of the IT infrastructure the areas of our focus included access security (including controls over privileged access), program change controls, database management and network operations. In particular: We tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of the Company's general IT controls over the IT systems relevant to financial reporting. This included evaluation of Company's controls over segregation of duties and access rights being provisioned / modified based on duly approved requests, access for exit cases being revoked in a timely manner and access of all users being recertified during the period of audit. We also tested key automated business cycle controls and logic for the reports generated through the IT infrastructure that were relevant for financial reporting or were used in the exercise of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Our tests included testing of the compensating controls or alternate procedures to assess whether there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materiality impact the Financial Statements. Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon 6. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information, comprising of the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board's Report including Annexures to Board's Report, Corporate Governance and such other disclosures related information, excluding the standalone financial statements, consolidated financial statements and auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management's Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements 7. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the Balance Sheet, the related Revenue Account, the Profit and Loss Account and Receipts and Payments Account of the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, the IRDA Act, the IRDA Financial Statements Regulations and circulars/orders/directions issued by the IRDAI in this regard and Accounting Standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, as applicable to the insurance companies. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.Independent Auditor's Report (Contd.)FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS 87 Annual Report 2021-22Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 8. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. 9. As part of our audit in accordance with SAs we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, to design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made in the standalone financial statements by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 10. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters.

The discount or premium which is the difference between the purchase price and the redemption amount of fixed income securities is amortised and recognised in the revenue account, using Effective interest rate method (EIR) over the remaining period to maturity of these securities. Additional Tier 1 (BASEL III) bonds are valued through CRISIL Bond Valuer. Policyholders' linked funds: G-sec and SDL are valued at the CRISIL Gilt prices and SDL prices. All other debt securities are valued through CRISIL Bond Valuer. Money market instruments (including T Bills) are valued at historical cost, subject to amortisation of premium or discount which is the difference between the purchase price and the redemption amount using effective interest rate method over the remaining period to maturity of these securities. b) i) Equity shares/ Non-redeemable Preference shares, Exchange traded funds and Infrastructure Investment Trusts: Listed equity/preference shares, Exchange traded funds and Infrastructure Investment Trusts are valued and stated at fair value, using the last quoted closing prices on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), at the balance sheet date.

Unrealised gain / loss due to changes in fair value of listed equity/preference shares/Infrastructure Investment Trust and mutual funds are taken to the Fair Value Change account for other than linked business and are carried to the Balance Sheet. e) Diminution in the Value of Investments Diminution in the value of investments as at the balance sheet date, other than temporary, is recognised as an expense in the Revenue / Profit & Loss account. f) Social Venture Fund/ Venture Capital Funds Social Venture Fund/ Venture Capital Funds are valued at latest available NAV at each reporting date. If such NAV is not available for more than eighteen months, Social Venture Fund / Venture Capital Fund will be valued at cost. g) Valuation of Derivative Instrument:- i. ABSLI has Guaranteed products where the returns to the policy holders are fixed and the Company is exposed to interest rate risk on account of investment from receipt of subsequent premiums and sum of interest and maturity from investment made out of premiums received. A Forward Rate Agreement ('FRA') transaction is that whereby Company agrees to buy underlying security at fixed yield at future date. Company has entered in FRA to hedge interest rate risk on forecasted premium receivable at future date. As on the date of entering into the FRA, the Company fixes the yield on the investment in a sovereign bond that would take place at a future date. \" For Cash Flow Hedges, hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. The portion of fair value gain / loss on the Interest Rate Derivative that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in appropriate equity account i.e. 'Hedge Fluctuation Reserve'. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of such instruments is recognised in the Revenue Account in the period in which they arise. If the hedging relationship ceases to be effective or it becomes probable that the expected forecast transaction will no longer occur, hedge accounting is discontinued and accumulated gains or losses that were recognised directly in the Hedge Fluctuation Reserve are reclassified into Revenue Account. All derivatives are initially recognised in the Balance sheet at their fair value, which usually represents their cost. They are subsequently re-measured at their fair value, with the method of recognising movements in this value depending on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are negative. IRDAI master circular for Investment Regulations, 2016 allows insurers to deal in rupee denominated interest rate derivatives. The Company has well defined Board approved Derivative Policy and Process document covering various aspects related to functioning of the derivative transactions which are Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)115 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS undertaken to mitigate interest rate risk as per the hedge strategy, thereby managing the volatility of returns from future fixed income investments, due to variations in market interest rates. Mark to market valuation is done independently by both the parties. In case of variation in valuation, the counter party (bank) valuation prevails as the counter party (bank) is the valuation agent as per agreement. However same can be disputed by ABSLI if valuation difference is not agreeable. ii. Derivatives are undertaken by Company solely for the purpose of hedging interest rate risks on account of following: a. Reinvestment of maturity proceeds of existing fixed income investments; b. Investment of interest income receivable; and c. Expected policy premium income receivable on insurance contracts which are already underwritten. iii. Investment transfer Transfers of Investments from Shareholders' funds to the Policyholders' funds are affected at the lower of amortised cost or market value in respect of all debt securities including money market instruments and at the cost or market value whichever is lower in case of other securities. Inter-fund transfer of debt securities relating to Linked Policyholders' Funds is effected at last available market value as per the methodology specified in the Inter Fund transfer policy approved by the Investment committee. Inter fund transfer of equity are done during market hours at the prevailing market price iv. Impairment on Investment The carrying amounts of investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date. If there is any indicator of impairment based on internal / external factors. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in Revenue/ Profit or Loss account, to the extent of difference between the re-measured fair value and the acquisition cost as reduced by any previous impairment loss recognised as expense in Revenue/ Profit and Loss Account. Any reversal of impairment loss, earlier recognised in profit and loss account shall be recognised in Revenue/ Profit and Loss account. h) Loans Against Policies Loans against policies are valued at the aggregate of book values (net of repayments) plus capitalised interest and are subject to impairment, if any. i) Fixed Assets, Capital Work in Progress and Impairment. i. Fixed Assets and Depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the purchase price and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure incurred on fixed assets is expensed out in the year of expense except where such expenditure increases the future economic benefits from the existing assets. Advances paid towards the acquisition of fixed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date and the cost of fixed assets not ready for its intended use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress. Assets costing up to 5 being low value assets are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition. Depreciation on fixed assets is provided using the straight-line method based on the economic useful life of assets as estimated by the management is as below;Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)116 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited Sr. No. Asset Estimated Useful life (Years) 1 Leasehold Improvements and Furniture and fittings at leased premises 5 2 Furniture & fittings (other than (1) above) 10 3 Information Technology Equipment - Server 6 4 Information Technology Equipment - Others* 5 5 Office Equipment 5 6 Intangibles (Software) 5 7 Vehicles 5 * For these class of assets, based on internal and/or external assessment/ technical evaluation carried out by the management, the management believes that the useful lives as mentioned above best represent the useful life of these respective assets, however these are higher than as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Any additions to the original fixed assets are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the original asset.\" ii. Intangibles Intangible assets comprise of software licenses which are stated at cost less amortisation. Software expenses exceeding 1,000 incurred on customisation of software (other than for maintenance of existing software) are capitalised. Software licenses are amortised using Straight Line Method over a period of 5 years from the date of being ready for use. iii. Capital Work in Progress Assets not ready for their intended use and other capital work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. iv. Impairment of Assets At each balance sheet date, management assesses whether there is any indication, based on internal / external factors, that an asset may be impaired. Impairment occurs where the carrying value exceeds the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of the asset and its eventual disposal. The impairment loss to be expensed is determined as the excess of the carrying amount over the higher of the asset's net sales price or present value as determined above. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount, subject to maximum of depreciable historical cost. j) Operating Leases The Company classifies leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership over the lease term, as Operating Leases. Operating lease rentals are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease period. k) Employee Benefits i. Short-Term Employee Benefits All employee benefits payable within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries and bonuses are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. ii. Long-Term Employment Benefits The Company has both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. These plans are financed by the Company. Defined Contribution Plans: The Company defined contribution schemes for superannuation and provident fund to provide retirement benefits to its employees. Contributions to the superannuation schemes are made on a monthly basis and charged to revenue account when due. Defined Benefit Plans: Gratuity liability is defined benefit obligation and is funded. The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity benefits based on independent actuarial valuation under revised Accounting Standard 15 (AS 15) on 'Employee Benefits'. The Company also has deferred compensation plans with the objective of employee retention.Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)117 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS iii. Other Long-Term Employee Benefits Compensated absences are entitled to be carried forward for future encashment or availment, at the option of the employee during the tenure of the employment, subject to the rules framed by the Company in this regard. Accumulated compensated absences entitlements outstanding at the close of the year are accounted on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation. Accumulated entitlements at the time of separation are entitled to be encashed. l) Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the rates existing as at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss for revenue transactions is reflected, in the revenue account or the profit and loss account, as the case may be. m) Segment Reporting As per Accounting Standard 17 (AS 17) on 'Segment Reporting' read with the \"Preparation of Financial Statements, Auditor's Report of Insurance Companies, Regulations 2002\" read with the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015, the Company is required to report segment results separately for linked, non-linked, health and pension businesses. The business is broadly classified as Participating non-linked, Non Participating Unit Linked and Non Linked businesses, which are further segmented into Individual Life, Group Life, Group Life Variable, Individual Pension, Annuity Individual, Group Pension, Group Pension Variable and Individual Health businesses. Accordingly, the Company has prepared the revenue account and balance sheet for these primary business segments separately. Since the business operation of the Company is in India only, the same is considered as one geographical segment. Allocation Methodology: The following basis has been used for allocation of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities to the business segments: Revenues, other Income, expenses, assets and liabilities directly attributable and identifiable to business segments, are allocated on actual basis; and Revenues, other income, other expenses, assets and liabilities which are not directly identifiable though attributable to a business segment, are allocated on the following basis, as considered appropriate by the management: > First Year Premium & 10% of Single Premium; > First year / gross commission; > Sum assured; > Policy liability; > Asset under management; > New Business Policy Count; > Enforce policy count > Employee Cost The method of allocation and apportionment has been decided based on the nature of the expense and its logical co-relation with various business segments. The allocation and apportionment of expenses amongst various business segments is in accordance with Board Approved Policy. n) Taxation i. Direct Taxes The Income-Tax Act, 1961 prescribes that profits and gains of life insurance Companies will be the surplus or deficit disclosed by the actuarial valuation made in accordance with the Insurance Act. Deferred income tax is recognised for future tax consequences attributable to timing differences between income as determined by the financial statements and the recognition for income tax purposes. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognised using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in future. However, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carried forward loss under taxation law, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is virtual certainty backed by convincing evidence that such deferred assets Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)118 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited can be realised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed as at each balance sheet date and written down or written up to reflect the amount that is reasonably or virtually certain, as the case may be, to be realised. ii. Indirect Taxes The Company claims credit of Goods and Services tax for input services, which is set off against tax on output services. The unutilised credits, if any are carried forward to the future period for set off where there is reasonable certainty of utilisation. o) Provisions and Contingencies A provision is recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past event/s and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect current best estimates. A disclosure for contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources or it cannot be reliably estimated. When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. A contingent asset is neither recognised nor disclosed. p) Funds for Future Appropriation The balance in the funds for future appropriations account represents funds, the allocation of which, either to participating Policyholders or to Shareholders, has not been determined at the Balance Sheet date. Transfers to and from the fund reflect the excess or deficit of income over expenses and appropriations in each accounting period arising in the Company's Policyholders' fund. In respect of Participating policies any allocation to the policyholder would also give rise to a shareholder transfer in the required proportion. The FFA was being created for lapsed policies as per the IRDAI Circular No. 041/IRDA/ACTL/Mar-2006.

Unit Reserves Unit reserves are computed by multiplying the number of units with the unit price as on the valuation date. Non Unit Reserves Prospective gross premium cash flow method is used to compute the non unit liabilities in respect of the policies in force as at March 31, 2022. The cash flows are projected based on assumptions that reflect the expected future experience and Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)122 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited have an appropriate allowance for margins for adverse deviations. The major assumptions relate to mortality, interest, expenses, policy persistency and premium persistency. Additionally, for traditional par policies current year bonus rate, future bonus rates and terminal bonuses (wherever applicable) consistent with the valuation interest rate, transfer to shareholders and tax on the surplus are also taken into account while calculating the policy liability. Additional provisions are made towards: I. Investment guarantees for unit linked business II. Substandard lives III. Unearned premium (in accordance with IRDA Circular 50/IRDA/ACTL/CIR/GEN/050/03/2010) IV. Reserves for free look option given to the policyholders Analysis of recent experience has indicated that about 0.5% (Previous Year - 0.5%) of the individual policyholders tend to exercise the option. Accordingly, with appropriate prudence, 0.625% (Previous Year - 0.625%) of the total charges collected (from the 11th to the end of that month) for new policies/coverages issued during a given month is being set aside as the reserve. For traditional products, 0.625% of the modal premiums received (from the 11th to the end of that month) for new policies / coverage issued during the month is being set aside as reserve. V. Lapse policies eligible for revivals (in accordance with IRDA Circular 41/IRDA/ACTL/Mar-2006). VI. New Business Closure Reserve VII. Cash Surrender Value Deficiency Reserve VIII. Premium Waiver Claim Provision IX. Incurred But Not Reported Reserve For yearly renewable group term business, unearned premium method is used to compute the reserves. In addition to the unearned premium reserve, provision is also made for incurred but not reported claims for group business as well. For the valuation as on 31st March 2022, ABSLI has used following valuation assumptions. All these assumptions include margin for adverse deviations. 1 Interest The interest rates used are in the range 5.66% (Previous Year - 5.4%) per annum to 7.3% (Previous Year - 7.6%) per annum. 2 Mortality Rates The mortality rates used for the valuation of assurance benefits under each segment of business are based on the published IALM (2012-14) Ultimate Mortality Table modified to covert it from nearest birthday to last birth day mortality rates. Further to reflect the expected experience for own portfolio, ABSLI has taken multiple of the modified IALM (2012-14) mortality rates. Such mortality multiples are in the range of 22.58% to 292.50% (Previous Year - 22.58% to 309.38%). The mortality rates used for valuation of annuities are based on the 35.44% - 101.25% of the latest standard Annuitant Mortality Rates. 3 Expenses The per policy maintenance expenses assumed for the valuation of liabilities are set looking at our recent experience and expected per policy expenses in future as per our business plan. The per policy maintenance expense is upto 838* (Previous Year - upto 761*) depending on the product. Commission scales have been allowed in accordance with the product filing with IRDA. * in absolute 4 Policy Termination Rates The policy termination rates used for the valuation of liabilities ranges from 0.0% per annum to 48% per annum (Previous Year - from 0.8% per annum to 48% per annum) for the first three policy years thereafter in the range of 0.6% per annum to 14% per annum (Previous Year - 0.6% per annum to 16.8% per annum).Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)123 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS 5 Bonus Rates Regular and Terminal bonus rates, where applicable, are consistent with the valuation discount rate. This takes in to account the policyholders reasonable expectations (PREs) 6 Policyholder's Reasonable Expectations For unit linked products Policyholders know that the returns on such plans are market linked and hence ultimate benefit payout would depend upon the mark to market performance of the underlying funds. Each ULIP proposal form is accompanied by a signed sales illustration illustrating values using gross return of 4% and 8% pa (Previous Year - 4% and 8% pa). For par products the bonus rates are declared consistent with the performance of the par fund and the illustrated rate of bonuses in the sales illustration provided at the time of selling the policy. 7 Taxation and Shareholder Transfers Future transfers to shareholders as 1/9th (Previous Year - 1/9th) of Cost of Bonus and tax on the future surpluses to be distributed between policyholders and shareholders are considered in calculation of policy liability for par products. 8 Basis of Provisions for Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) IBNR for individual life business, one-year renewable group term business and group credit life business is determined using chain ladder method taking into account the claim reporting pattern from past claim experience. 12 Disclosure of Discontinued Linked Policies As required by Para no 2.9.6 of Master circular no.

Basis for Opinion 3) We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Holding Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\"ICAI\") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Emphasis of Matter 4) We draw attention to Note 28 of the consolidated financial statements in which the Holding Company describes the uncertainties arising from the COVID 19 pandemic situation. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. Key Audit Matter 5) Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.279 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Information Technology Systems: The Holding Company is dependent on its Information Technology (\"IT\") systems due to the significant number of transactions that are processed daily across such multiple and discrete IT systems. Also, IT application controls are critical to ensure that changes to applications and underlying data are made in an appropriate manner and under controlled environments. Appropriate controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to applications and data. On account of the pervasive use of its IT systems, the testing of the general computer controls of the IT systems used in financial reporting was considered to be a Key Audit Matter.With the assistance of our IT specialists, we obtained an understanding of the Holding Company's IT applications, databases and operating systems relevant to financial reporting and the control environment. For these elements of the IT infrastructure the areas of our focus included access security (including controls over privileged access), program change controls, database management and network operations. In particular: We tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of the Company's general IT controls over the IT systems relevant to financial reporting. This included evaluation of Holding Company's controls over segregation of duties and access rights being provisioned / modified based on duly approved requests, access for exit cases being revoked in a timely manner and access of all users being recertified during the period of audit. We also tested key automated business cycle controls and logic for the reports generated through the IT infrastructure that were relevant for financial reporting or were used in the exercise of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Our tests included testing of the compensating controls or alternate procedures to assess whether there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materiality impact the Financial Statements. Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon 6) The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information, comprising of the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board's Report including Annexures to Board's Report, Corporate Governance and such other disclosures related Information, excluding the standalone financial statements, consolidated financial statements and auditor's report thereon ('Other Information'). Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 7) The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated Balance Sheet, the related consolidated Revenue Account, the consolidated profit and Loss Account and consolidated receipts and payments Account of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the provisions of the Insurance Act, the IRDA Act, the IRDA Financial Statements Regulations and circulars/ orders/directions issued by the IRDAI in this regard and Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006, as amended (\"Accounting Standards\") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, as applicable to the insurance companies. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going Independent Auditor's Report (Contd.)280 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group. Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 8) Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. 9) As part of our audit in accordance with SAs we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, to design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entity included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entity included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditor, such other auditor remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 10) Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.Independent Auditor's Report (Contd.)281 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Other Matters 11) The actuarial valuation of liabilities for life policies in force and for policies in respect of which premium has been discontinued but liability exists as at March 31, 2022, is the responsibility of the Appointed Actuary and has been duly certified by them. In his opinion, the assumptions for such valuation are in accordance with the guidelines and norms issued by the IRDAI and the Institute of Actuaries of India in concurrence with the IRDAI. We have relied upon Appointed Actuary's certificate in this regard for forming our opinion on the valuation of liabilities for life policies in force and for policies in respect of which premium has been discontinued but liability exists in consolidated financial statements of the Company. 12) We did not audit the financial statements of the subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets of 5,83,500 thousand as at March 31, 2022, total revenues of 24,454 thousand and net cash inflows amounting to 3,831 thousand for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements.

Meaning of Internal financial controls with reference to Financial Statements A Company's internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial control with reference to financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal financial controls with reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Holding Company and its subsidiary company incorporated in India have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the internal control with reference to financial statement criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Other Matter Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements insofar as it relates to subsidiary company incorporated in India is based on the corresponding reports of the auditor of subsidiary company. Our Opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter.Independent Auditor's Report (Contd.) For S. B. Billimoria & Co. LLP For Haribhakti & Co.

ABSLI has Guaranteed products where the returns to the policy holders are fixed and the Group is exposed to interest rate risk on account of investment from receipt of subsequent premiums and sum of interest and maturity from investment made out of premiums received. A Forward Rate Agreement ('FRA') transaction is that whereby Group agrees to buy underlying security at fixed yield at future date. Group has entered in FRA to hedge interest rate risk on forecasted premium receivable at future date. As on the date of entering into the FRA, the Group fixes the yield on the investment in a sovereign bond that would take place at a future date. For Cash Flow Hedges, hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. The portion of fair value gain / loss on the Interest Rate Derivative that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in appropriate equity account i.e. 'Hedge Fluctuation Reserve'. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of such instruments is recognised in the Revenue Account in the period in which they arise. If the hedging relationship ceases to be effective or it becomes probable that the expected forecast transaction will no longer occur, hedge accounting is discontinued and accumulated gains or losses that were recognised directly in the Hedge Fluctuation Reserve are reclassified into Revenue Account. All derivatives are initially recognised in the Balance sheet at their fair value, which usually represents their cost. They are subsequently re- measured at their fair value, with the method of recognising movements in this value depending on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are negative. IRDAI master circular for Investment Regulations, 2016 allows insurers to deal in rupee denominated interest rate derivatives. The Group has well defined Board approved Derivative Policy and Process document covering various aspects related to functioning of the derivative transactions which are undertaken to mitigate interest rate risk as per the hedge strategy, thereby managing the volatility of returns from future fixed income investments, due to variations in market interest rates. Mark to market valuation is done independently by both the parties. In case of variation in valuation, the counter party (bank) valuation prevails as the counter party (bank) is the valuation agent as per agreement. However same can be disputed by ABSLI if valuation difference is not agreeable. ii. Derivatives are undertaken by Company solely for the purpose of hedging interest rate risks on account of following: a. Reinvestment of maturity proceeds of existing fixed income investments; b. Investment of interest income receivable; and c. Expected policy premium income receivable on insurance contracts which are already underwritten. iii. Investment transfer Transfers of Investments from Shareholders' funds to the Policyholders' funds are affected at the lower of amortised cost or market value in respect of all debt securities including money market instruments and at the cost or market value whichever is lower in case of other securities. Inter-fund transfer of debt securities relating to Linked Policyholders' Funds is effected at last available market value as per the methodology specified in the Inter Fund transfer policy approved by the Investment committee. Inter fund transfer of equity are done during market hours at the prevailing market price iv. Impairment on Investment The carrying amounts of investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date. If there is any indicator of impairment based on internal / external factors. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in Revenue/ Profit or Loss account, to the extent of difference between the re-measured fair value and the acquisition cost as reduced by any previous impairment loss recognised as expense in Revenue/ Profit and Loss Account. Any reversal of impairment loss, earlier recognised in profit and loss account shall be recognised in Revenue/ Profit and Loss account.Consolidated Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)311 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS h) Loans Against Policies Loans against policies are valued at the aggregate of book values (net of repayments) plus capitalised interest and are subject to impairment, if any. i) Fixed Assets, Capital Work in Progress and Impairment. i. Fixed Assets and Depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the purchase price and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure incurred on fixed assets is expensed out in the year of expense except where such expenditure increases the future economic benefits from the existing assets. Advances paid towards the acquisition of fixed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date and the cost of fixed assets not ready for its intended use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress Assets costing up to 5 being low value assets are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition. Depreciation on fixed assets is provided using the straight-line method based on the economic useful life of assets as estimated by the management is as below; Sr. No. Asset Estimated Useful life (Years) 1Leasehold Improvements and Furniture and fittings at leased premises5 2 Furniture & fittings (other than (1) above) 10 3 Information Technology Equipment - Server 6 4 Information Technology Equipment - Others* 5 5 Office Equipment 5 6 Intangibles (Software) 5 7 Vehicles 5 * For these class of assets, based on internal and/or external assessment/ technical evaluation carried out by the management, the management believes that the useful lives as mentioned above best represent the useful life of these respective assets, however these are higher than as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Any additions to the original fixed assets are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the original asset. ii. Intangibles Intangible assets comprise of software licenses which are stated at cost less amortisation. Software expenses exceeding 1,000 incurred on customisation of software (other than for maintenance of existing software) are capitalised. Software licenses are amortised using Straight Line Method over a period of 3 / 5 years from the date of being ready for use. iii. Capital Work in Progress Assets not ready for their intended use and other capital work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. iv. Impairment of Assets At each balance sheet date, management assesses whether there is any indication, based on internal / external factors, that an asset may be impaired. Impairment occurs where the carrying value exceeds the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of the asset and its eventual disposal. The impairment loss to be expensed is determined as the excess of the carrying amount over the higher of the asset's net sales price or present value as determined above. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount, subject to maximum of depreciable historical cost.Consolidated Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)312 Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited j) Operating Leases The Group classifies leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership over the lease term, as Operating Leases.

Defined Contribution Plans: The Company defined contribution schemes for superannuation and provident fund to provide retirement benefits to its employees. Contributions to the superannuation schemes are made on a monthly basis and charged to revenue account when due. Defined Benefit Plans: Gratuity liability is defined benefit obligation and is funded.

Accumulated compensated absences entitlements outstanding at the close of the year are accounted on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation. Accumulated entitlements at the time of separation are entitled to be encashed. l) Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the rates existing as at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss for revenue transactions is reflected, in the revenue account or the profit and loss account, as the case may be. m) Segment Reporting As per Accounting Standard 17 (AS 17) on 'Segment Reporting' read with the \"Preparation of Financial Statements, Auditor's Report of Insurance Companies, Regulations 2002\" read with the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act 2015, the Group is required to report segment results separately for linked, non-linked, health and pension businesses. The business is broadly classified as Participating non-linked, Non Participating Unit Linked and Non Linked businesses, which are further segmented into Individual Life, Group Life, Group Life Variable, Individual Pension, Annuity Individual, Group Pension, Group Pension Variable and Individual Health businesses. Accordingly, the Group has prepared the revenue account and balance sheet for these primary business segments separately. Since the business operation of the Group is in India only, the same is considered as one geographical segment. Allocation Methodology: The following basis has been used for allocation of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities to the business segments: Revenues, other Income, expenses, assets and liabilities directly attributable and identifiable to business segments, are allocated on actual basis; and Revenues, other income, other expenses, assets and liabilities which are not directly identifiable though attributable to a business segment, are allocated on the following basis, as considered appropriate by the management: > First Year Premium & 10% of Single Premium;Consolidated Notes forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2022 (Amounts in Thousands of Indian Rupees)313 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS > First year / gross commission; > Sum assured; > Policy liability; > Asset under management; > New Business Policy Count; > Enforce policy count > Employee Cost The method of allocation and apportionment has been decided based on the nature of the expense and its logical co-relation with various business segments. The allocation and apportionment of expenses amongst various business segments is in accordance with Board Approved Policy. n) Taxation i. Direct Taxes The Income-Tax Act, 1961 prescribes that profits and gains of life insurance Companies will be the surplus or deficit disclosed by the actuarial valuation made in accordance with the Insurance Act, 1938. Deferred income tax is recognised for future tax consequences attributable to timing differences between income as determined by the financial statements and the recognition for income tax purposes. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognised using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in future. However, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carried forward loss under taxation law, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is virtual certainty backed by convincing evidence that such deferred assets can be realised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed as at each balance sheet date and written down or written up to reflect the amount that is reasonably or virtually certain, as the case may be, to be realised. ii. Indirect Taxes The Group claims credit of Goods and Services tax for input services, which is set off against tax on output services. The unutilised credits, if any are carried forward to the future period for set off where there is reasonable certainty of utilisation. o) Provisions and Contingencies A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal obligation as a result of past event/s and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect current best estimates. A disclosure for contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources or it cannot be reliably estimated. When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. A contingent asset is neither recognised nor disclosed. p) Funds for Future Appropriation The balance in the funds for future appropriations account represents funds, the allocation of which, either to participating Policyholders or to Shareholders, has not been determined at the Balance Sheet date. Transfers to and from the fund reflect the excess or deficit of income over expenses and appropriations in each accounting period arising in the Group's Policyholders' fund. In respect of Participating policies any allocation to the policyholder would also give rise to a shareholder transfer in the required proportion. The FFA was being created for lapsed policies as per the IRDAI Circular No. 041/IRDA/ACTL/Mar-2006. However, as per the IRDAI (ULIP) Regulations, 2019 issued on 8th July 2019, there was no such requirement to create FFA.
