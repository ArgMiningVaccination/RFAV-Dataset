Firstly, it is approved in Chinese medicine literatures that acupuncture is a major method in prevention of epidemic diseases. Secondly, the mechanism of the functions of acupuncture in reinforcing the mononuclear phagocytic system and in stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of the lymphocyte are similar to the function of adjuvant in reinforcing the immunological effect of vaccine. Thirdly, the experimental research provides evidence to the adjuvant effect of acupuncture. Finally, presupposition is proposed that the adjuvant effect of acupuncture might be brought into play through activation of endogenous adjuvant (heat shock protein) which can strengthen the immunological effect of vaccine.
