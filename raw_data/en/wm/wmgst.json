Hello, My husband and I will be travelling all over [Vietnam](/Tourism-g293921-Vietnam-Vacations.html) Dec/Jan from AUstralia. Is it necessary to get vaccinations? I know there are a number of vaccinations that you can get, but are there any that are crucial? Had my Hep A and typhoid this morning on the advice of two doctors. Don't need anything else. Better safe then sorry. Expensive though! I am a very strong proponent of precautionary health measures when you travel. You are best to consult with a travel health professional at least 3 weeks before venturing abroad (in Canada we call them travel health clinics staffed by medical doctors and other health care workers trained in travel disease prevention.) Vaccines are cheap and effective. Hep A & Hep B are real risks in Vietnam and if you are not preparing ALL of your own food or if you are exposed to blood or bodily fluids, you are at risk. In Canada, the risk/benefit assessment is such that all school children are now immunized against these risks so why would you not want the same protection if you are travelling to regions of the world where blanket immunization is not practised or where immunization is the exception in the general population? Canadian school age children typically obtain immunizations for and becoming more common now Meningococcal Meningitis When travelling in Vietnam and elsewhere in SE Asia, you should be aware of the risks of Malaria, Japenese Encephalitis, Typhoid, etc., for which pharmaceuticals may assist and also of matters such as Tuberculosis, Hep C, Cholera, Dengue Fever, HIV/Aids, STD's, Schistosomiasis, etc., for which ordinary simple precautions can provide a high degree of security. Also note that while many vaccines provide full protection, many other vaccines simply lessen the severity of the symptoms if you are infected. (for example, in endemic parts of Asia, you may take your antimalarials but you still try to avoid getting bitten by mosquitos as you will still become infected with the malaria parasite.) In Vietnam (and even more so in other parts of SE Asia), you may be safest to drink bottled water, and watch where you eat and what you eat. (You may also find that eating local Vietnamese cuisine is better than western fare as the Vietnamese know HOW to cook their local cuisine; generally, you will likely find that pho (a local staple) is very safe (as it is generally boiled for hours) even though the serving dishes it is placed in may not be exactly sterile.) I spent two weeks in January, 2005, eating nowhere other than where locals ate and had no problems whatever; there may be some truth in the old adage, Just eat places where things look very busy. I think PART of the idea of having these immunizations is that it gives you some peace of mind and some protection against the unexpected. Of course, you still have to be smart about where you eat and what risks you take (in Vietnam or anywhere in the world) and no immunization will protect you if you do stupid things. Like sticking your figure into dark holes to see if that really is a scorpion in there. And you may statistically speaking be more likely to be injured as a pedestrian in Vietnam than by hepatitis. But immunizations are just part of the overall risk assessment. Some people travel without medical insurance because the odds of them requiring hospitalization or expensive medical treatment abroad are small. Ultimately, it is all about risk assessment; with very little effort you can access sources of information from easy to navigate websites below, and make your own informed decisions. See some Canadian government websites for some helpful information (as set out below) or goggle the \"Center for Disease Control\" based in Atlanta, U.S.A., and the \"Who Health Organization\" (United Nations) websites for further information. For general Travel Health information on East Asia, see: [http://www.cdc.gov/travel/eastasia.htm](/ExternalLinkInterstitial?redirectTo=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ftravel%2Feastasia.htm) For Travel Health information on other desitinations see: [http://www.cdc.gov/travel/destinat.htm](/ExternalLinkInterstitial?redirectTo=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ftravel%2Fdestinat.htm) and for all current information on outbreaks see: Botton line for me is: Vaccines are cheap and effective. Note also that there IS a difference between the requirement of proof of vaccination in order to enter a country, and the advisability of obtaining a vaccination to protect against disease. From the WHO website: \"Travellers should be warned that the requirement for vaccination ... is not related to the risk of exposure to the disease.\" \"The fact that a country has no mandatory requirement for vaccination does not imply that there is no risk ....\" The following information on Hep A and Hep B is also from the CDC site: Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A can affect anyone. In the United States, hepatitis A can occur in situations ranging from isolated cases of disease to widespread epidemics. SIGNS & SYMPTOMS Adults will have signs and symptoms more often than children. * jaundice * fatigue * abdominal pain * loss of appetite * nausea * diarrhea * fever CAUSE * Hepatitis A virus (HAV) LONG-TERM EFFECTS * There is no chronic (long-term) infection. * Once you have had hepatitis A you cannot get it again. * About 15% of people infected with HAV will have prolonged or relapsing symptoms over a 6-9 month period. TRANSMISSION * HAV is found in the stool (feces) of persons with hepatitis A. * HAV is usually spread from person to person by putting something in the mouth (even though it may look clean) that has been contaminated with the stool of a person with hepatitis A. Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver. The virus, which is called hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. SIGNS & SYMPTOMS About 30% of persons have no signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms are less common in children than adults. * jaundice * fatigue * abdominal pain * loss of appetite * nausea, vomiting * joint pain CAUSE * Hepatitis B virus (HBV) LONG-TERM EFFECTS WITHOUT VACCINATION Chronic infection occurs in: * 90% of infants infected at birth * 30% of children infected at age 1 - 5 years * 6% of persons infected after age 5 years Death from chronic liver disease occurs in: * 15-25% of chronically infected persons TRANSMISSION * Occurs when blood or body fluids from an infected person enters the body of a person who is not immune. * HBV is spread through having s**(relations) with an infected person without using a condom (the efficacy of latex condoms in preventing infection with HBV is unknown, but their proper use may reduce transmission), by sharing drugs, needles, or \"works\" when \"shooting\" drugs, through needlesticks or sharps exposures on the job, or from an infected mother to her baby during birth. Persons at risk for HBV infection might also be at risk for infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV. Glad to hear that in Canada at least, vaccinations are not expensive. In Australia they are, but that should not put anyone off getting them. Thanks for going to the effort with that info Rob1... very useful We are also joing the apparent influx of Aussies heading for [Vietnam](/Tourism-g293921-Vietnam-Vacations.html) in December. OOps... meant to add that we have been advised by our GP to have Rabies injection as well.... apparently medical treatment is not the best for Rabies in Vitenam and if bitten one should head "}
