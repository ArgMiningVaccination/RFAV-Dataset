The workshop included hands-on practice with about 40 students. They worked on implanting metal rods, plates and other devices that orthopaedic surgeons use to restore patients' mobility and alleviate pain. URMC surgeon, Dr. Wakenda Tyler, says that the students were very enthusiastic about seeing things that they wouldn't normally see in the classroom. \"Across the country less than 10 orthopaedic surgeons are female and less than like seven percent are engineers,\" explained Dr. Tyler. \"The purpose of the program was to try to encourage young women to look at these as options for a career in the future.\" The event is a partnership with [The Perry Initiative](http://perryinitiative.org/), a national organization named for one of the U.S.'s first female orthopaedic surgeons, Dr. Jacqueline Perry.
