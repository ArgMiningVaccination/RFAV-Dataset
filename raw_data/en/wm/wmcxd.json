A diverticulitis diet, which is one of the [best diets for health](https://www.athleticinsight.com/diet), can help lower the risk of inflammation in the digestive tract and treat its symptoms if they happen. The most popular diets to treat diverticulitis include the clear liquid diet, BRAT, and a low-fiber diet. The difference between each involves adding easily digestible liquids, foods, and fiber. Each of these diet plans exists as part of a diverticulitis treatment plan, and they can be used to manage the symptoms of diverticulitis and prevent flare-ups. The following is an overview of what it means to have diverticulitis and a sample meal plan for people recovering from this condition. What Is the Purpose of Diverticulitis Diet? In cases of diverticulitis, nutritional treatment is used as a stopgap to give the digestive tract a break. A low-fiber diet and antibiotics are standard treatments for mild instances of diverticulitis. Some doctors recommend resting without eating for a while, transitioning to clear liquids, and finally, a low-fiber diet until the patient's condition improves. Hospitalization is usually necessary for more severe instances. Consuming a low-calorie diet continues until the bleeding and diarrhea stop. A diverticulitis diet initially reduces the frequency of bowel movements, giving the digestive system a chance to rest and heal. What Are the Health Benefits of the Diverticulitis Diet? The health benefits of a diverticulitis diet include a reduction in pain, inflammation, and infection in the colon. A liquid diet for diverticulitis may also help decrease the risk of developing additional health issues. The following are examples of the health benefits provided by the diverticulitis diet. - Good for Heart Health: A diverticulitis diet may help lower the risk of heart disease since it can reduce the fat content in the diet, leading to lower cholesterol levels. - Reduces Cancer Risk: A high-fiber, low-fat diverticulitis diet may help reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer, including colon and rectal cancers. - Prevents Type 2 Diabetes: A low-sugar, high-fiber diet can also help control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. - Lowers Blood Pressure: In addition to lowering blood pressure, improving cholesterol, and regulating blood sugar, a diet high in fiber can help with weight loss. - Decreases Asthma Symptoms: The \"gut-lung axis\" connects the gut microbiome and the lungs. The anti-inflammatory effects of a diverticulitis diet can positively affect asthma symptoms. - Promotes Bone Health: A diverticulitis diet, including bone broth, promotes bone health by adding nutrients and vitamins like iron, vitamin A, and zinc, improving gut health and strengthening bones. Eating a diverticulitis diet for weight loss helps with satiety, thanks to the inclusion of low-fat meats and increased fiber. What Are the Health Risks of the Diverticulitis Diet? Dietary treatment for diverticulitis is generally safe. Because the diverticulitis diet transitions from liquids to easily digestible foods and then low-fiber foods, patients may suffer from constipation. This is a common side effect of the diet, which can be managed by drinking plenty of water and adding fiber back into the diet gradually. In some instances, followers of the diverticulitis diet may have an increased risk of stoke or report hair loss. How To Do a Diverticulitis Diet? The Mayo Clinic diverticulitis diet helps reduce pressure on the colon, which may reduce pain and bleeding. Here are 4 steps to follow when doing a diverticulitis diet. - Pause Digestion: First, a diverticulitis diet helps reduce inflammation in the digestive tract by reducing or eliminating solid foods. Doctors may prescribe IV fluids and antibiotics. - Introduce a Liquid Diet: After a period of rest from solid foods, drinking clear liquids helps to rehydrate the body and start to recover from possible dehydration. Clear liquids include the following water, ice chips and ice pops, fresh fruit juices without pulp (apple or pear juice), sports drinks, gelatin, and broths made with chicken or beef. - Add Bland Foods: A BRAT diet introduces bland foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast to increase the patient's caloric intake and provide more nutrients. BRAT is intended to be a short-term plan that can help reduce the severity of symptoms while encouraging the digestive system to heal itself. Foods on the BRAT diet are lacking in protein, fat, and fiber. Therefore, they will not provide enough nourishment to aid in the recovery of a compromised digestive system. - Include Low-Fiber Foods: After a few days of clear liquids and a BRAT diet, begin to add low-fiber foods such as plain pasta, potatoes, and crackers back into the diet. Clear liquids are all that can be consumed during the outset of the diverticulitis diet, which means that calorie intake will be low. Once solid foods are reintroduced, at least 1500 calories should be consumed daily. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, a diverticulitis diet may need to be followed for anywhere from three days to several weeks. Following a diverticulitis diet means eating small meals throughout the day, drinking plenty of water, and including high-fiber foods once acute symptoms have subsided.
