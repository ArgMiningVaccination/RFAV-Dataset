History Founded by the citizens of DeKalb County and the DeKalb Board of Education under the Junior College Act of 1958, Georgia Perimeter College opened as DeKalb College with its Clarkston Campus in 1964. It was the only public two- year college in the state supp orted and controlled by a local board of education. It was established in order that any resident of the DeKalb School District who held a high school diploma or its equivalent and who desired to seek two years of 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 20 postsecondary education might have the opportunity to do so. The college's Decatur (formerly known as South) Campus opened in 1972. Also beginning in 1972, students enrolled in DeKalb Area Technical School were able to enroll dually in vocational and collegiate programs, and the college was designated DeKalb Community College. As growth continued both for DeKalb County and the college, the Dunwoody (formerly North) Campus was added and began operation in 1979. DeKalb College pioneered in Georgia in open-door admissions, personalized approaches to instruction and community- related curricula and activities. In 1985, DeKalb Vocational-Technical School was placed under the governance of a new statewide board for vocational-technical schools with daily operations remaining under the control of the DeKalb County School System. Students enrolled in specific Associate of Applied Science degree programs continued to enroll dually in the college and technical school, which is now known as Georgia Piedmont Technical College. In 1986, when DeKalb County relinquished its support, the college was accepted by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia as the thirty -fourth member institution. During spring 1993, Georgia Perimeter College in cooperation with Clayton State College, DeKalb Technical Co llege and Rockdale County Public Schools formed the Rockdale Center for Higher Education, which offered credit and non- credit courses. In November 1997, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved changing the name of the college fro m DeKalb College to Georgia Perimeter College to reflect its expanding mission and its service throughout the metro Atlanta area. As part of changing the college's name, the names of the campuses were changed to identify the cities in which they are located. In December 2001, Georgia Perimeter College's Lawrenceville Campus, along with its partners at the Gwinnett University Center, relocated from the MacCleod Industrial Park on Sugarloaf Parkway to a 177-acre campus at 1000 University Center Lane. In 2007, Georgia Perimeter College discontinued offering courses at the Lawrenceville Campus in order for the site to become Georg ia Gwinnett College, a new four- year USG institution. In summer 2007, the Rockdale Campus was relocated to a larger new campus in N ewton County and renamed the Newton Campus. GPC began offering classes in Alpharetta in a building owned by Georgia State University. Through the years, the college has expanded its class and service offerings to citizens in north Fulton County. Georgia Pe rimeter College gained full ownership of the original building in fall 2010. The change not only increases classroom space for GPC students, it also increases services and possibilities for extended educational partnerships with other institutions and organizations in the area. As of fall 2011, Georgia Perimeter College was re -designated as a State College by the University System of Georgia, allowing the institution to offer a limited number of four -year degrees. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 21 The college's academic offerings correspond with curricular content and requirements of the University System of Georgia. Georgia Perimeter College also serves as a community cultural center for the performing arts in music and drama. Curricula feature transfer, learning support, career, continuing and distance education programs, as well as joint educational offerings with other system institutions and state -supported technical institutes. Associate degrees are awarded to graduates who complete the two- year transfer and career programs. Campuses Georgia Perimeter College has mul tiple campus locations and a center conveniently located throughout the Atlanta area. The Clarkston Campus at 555 North Indian Creek Drive in Clarkston is the original campus. The College Center, a new student/conference center, opened in 2007. The Decatur Campus , which opened in 1972, is located at the intersection of Clifton Springs and Panthersville Roads. The Dunwoody Campus , located at 2101 Womack Road, opened as a permanent facility in the fall of 1979. The Newton Campus opened in 2007 on a 100 acre site at Interstate 20 and Georgia Highway 11. The new facility is located at 239 Cedar Lane in Covington. For college students in the North Fulton area, Georgia Perimeter College offers classes at the Alpharetta Center, a full- service facility located off Old Milton Parkway at 3705 Brookside Parkway. Students may also attend classes through GPC Online, Georg ia Perimete r's option for students who want the freedom to take online classes. Except for students enrolled in highly specialized courses, which may be available on only one campus, students on all campuses choose from essentially the same programs of study. A student may attend classes on any campus or online through GPC Online. The overall operation of the college is administered from offices located at 3251 Panthersville Road in Decatur. All locations are easily accessible from a neighboring interstate highway. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 22 Georgia Perimeter College Foundation In July 1983, with the realization that state funds alone were not enough to provide adequate scholarships and programs for its students, the college created the DeKalb College Foundation to assist in raising funds and promoting the college. That Foundation, today known as the Georgia Perimeter College Foundation, is responsible for raising funds for over 90 endowed and non-endowed scholarships and for securing private support for numerous programs and services throughout the college. The GPC Foundation welcomes gifts of ca sh, securities, real estate, life insurance policies , matching gifts and honorary gifts from individuals, corporations and philanthropic foundations. The GPC Foundation staff will work closely with individuals to establish memorial funds or to set up charitable trusts or bequests. Georgia Perimeter College Alumni Association The GPC Alumni Association, originally established in 1970 as the DeKalb College Alumni Association, was reorganized in 1983. The Association was created for the express purpose of establishing, cultivating and stewarding supportive and beneficial relatio nships between the college, its alumni, its students and the community that advance the continued growth and development of Georgia Perimeter College and its alumni. The Alumni Association currently awards a $500 scholarship each spring semester, and awards the Outstanding Faculty of the Year Award (current and retired) as well as the Outstanding Alumnus of the Year Award in three categories: emerging leader, recent alum and distinguished alum. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 23 ADMISSION TO GEORGIA PERIMETER COLLEGE Guar anteed Admission ....................................................................................................24 Application Due Dates .....................................................................................................24 Application Pr ocess ..........................................................................................................25 Freshman - Tradit ional Students ...................................................................................27 Transfer - Traditional Students .....................................................................................28 Freshmen/Transfer - No n-Traditional Students ..........................................................29 Transient Stude nts ...........................................................................................................30 Dual Enrol lment Students ...............................................................................................31 International Student s .....................................................................................................32 Special ( Degreed) Students ..............................................................................................36 Home -Schooled Students .................................................................................................37 Senior Citizen - Prime Timer s Program .......................................................................39 Former Students ...............................................................................................................40 Immunization Requirements and Recommendations ..................................................41 Additional Requirements for Career and Certificate Programs .................................43 Awarding T ransfer Credit - USG Transfer Rules .......................................................43 Credit by Examination ....................................................................................................44 Course Exemption ............................................................................................................45 College Preparatory Curriculum Requirem ents ..........................................................45 Classification of Students for Tuition Purpose s ............................................................47 Petitioning for In- state Tuition .......................................................................................49 Tuition Differential Waivers ...........................................................................................49 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 24 ADMISSION TO GEORGIA PERIMETER COLLEGE Georgia Perimeter College seeks to admit qualified students based on standards set by the University System of Georgia Board of Regents.

Description of Terms Used in the Policy Dependent Student : An individual under the age of 24 who receives financial support from a parent or United States court-appointed legal guardian. Emancipated : A minor who, under certain circumstances, may be treated by the law as an adult. A student reaching the age of 18 shall not qualify for consideration of reclassification by virtue of having become emancipated unless he/she can demonstrate fina ncial independence and domicile independence of his/her parents. Independent Student : An individual who is not claimed as a dependent on the federal or state income tax returns of a parent or United States court -appointed legal guardian and whose parent or guardian has ceased to provide support and rights to that individual's care, custody, and earnings. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 48 Undocumented Student: Undocumented students include those students born outside of the United States who reside here without legal permission of the federal government. Undocumented students are not precluded from admission to public colleges and universities, but are ineligible for federal or state financial assistance and must pay out -of-state tuition fees. United States Citizens Independent Student : An independent student who has established and maintained a domicile in the State of Georgia for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term shall be classified as in -state for tuition purposes. No student shall gain or acquire in- state classification while attending any postsecondary educational institution in this state without clear evidence of having established domicile in Georgia for purposes other than attending a postsecondary edu cational institution in this state. If an independent student classified as in-state for tuition purposes relocates out of state temporarily but returns to the State of Georgia within twelve (12) months of the relocation, such student shall be entitled to retain his/her in -state tuition classification. Dependent Student : A dependent student shall be classified as in-state for tuition purposes if such dependent student's parent has established and maintained domicile in the State of Georgia for at least twel ve (12) consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term and: 1. The student has graduated from a Georgia high school; or, 2. The parent claimed the student as a dependent on the parent's most recent federal or state income tax ret urn.

Such appointment was not made to avoid payment of out-of- state tuition; and, 2. The United States court -appointed legal guardian can provide clear evidence of having established and maintained domicile in the State of Georgia for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term. If the parent or United States court appointed legal guardian of a dependent student currently classified as in -state for tuition purposes establishes domicile outside of the State of Georgia after having established and maintained domicile in the State of Georgia, such student may retain his/her in -state tuition classification so long as such stud ent remains continuously enrolled in a public postsecondary educational institution in this state, regardless of the domicile of such student's parent or United States court-appointed legal guardian. Non-Citizens: A non- citizen student shall not be classif ied as in -state for tuition purposes unless the student is legally in this state and there is evidence to warrant consideration of in -state classification as determined by the Board of Regents.

Petitioning for In -State Tuition A student is responsible for registering under the proper residency classification.

Tuition and fees charged by Georgia Perimeter College are approved by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. The precise amount of a student's tuition and fees for a semester depends upon a number of things, the most important of which are: The number of courses taken The nature of the courses The location at which the courses are taught The number of credit hours assigned to the courses The residence status of the student Actual costs are determined when a student registers for classes each semester. Actual charges can be viewed online at https://sis.gpc.edu/. It is the responsibility of the student to be informed of and to observe all regulations and procedures regarding the payment of fees and the entitlement of refunds. Registration is not complete until all fees have been paid in full. Payment may be either in cash; by check payable in U.S. currency; or with Vis a, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. The college reserves the right to determine the acceptability of all checks. Tuition - On-campus Courses Every student is required to pay tuition. All students are classified as either in-state (resident) or out-of- state (non- resident). For fee purposes, instruction delivered at Alpharetta, Clarkston, Decatur, Dunwoody, and Newton is considered on-campus. Online instruction and courses delivered at other locations are considered off-campus. Tuition rates and fees are determined by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia and are subject to change. The tuition rates below for on -campus courses are effec tive starting with the fall 2012 academic year.

A student's residency status has no bearing on the calculation of tuition for online courses. The tuition rate for online courses is $99 per semester credit hour, regardless of residency status. For tuition calculation purposes only, the credit hours for online courses do not count toward the 15 semester credit hours that are needed to limit tuition charges at the plateau tuition rates. Online students are still required to register their vehicles to park on campus for any reason, such as class, labs, testing, events, library or gym visits, or administrative purposes. The example below illustrates how the online tuition is charged. In this example, the hourly rate used for non-online courses is the hourly rate for a student receiving in- state tuition.

Georgia Perimeter College participates in most major federal and state financial aid programs and offers institutional scholarships as well. There is a Financial Aid office at each college location to assist eligible students in removing the financial barriers that may discourage them from attending college. All students are urged to file an application for financial aid. The Financial Aid office cannot determine eligibility or award financial aid unless the student completes the current Free Application fo r Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is the first step in the financial aid process. Students can use it to apply for federal student financial aid, such as the PELL Grant, student loans, and federal work study. The FAFSA is available on the FAFSA we bsite www.fafsa.ed.gov. Students will need to apply for the HOPE Scholarship or HOPE Grant by completing one of the following: FAFSA; (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) www.fafsa.ed.gov and/or; GSFAPPS, electronic application found on the GSFC we bsite and: GPC Institutional HOPE Scholarship Request Form ( HOPE Scholarship Request Form) or GPC Institutional HOPE Grant Request Form (HOPE Grant Request Form) Financial aid is available in many forms: grants, scholarships, loans, benefits, and employment opportunities. Federal, state, and local guidelines determine the amounts and types of financial aid offered to individual students. Students must reapply each year for most of these programs. Students usually are offered financial aid packages consisting of some combination of loans, grants, scholarships, and employment. Grants and scholarships are considered \"gift\" assistance and need not be repaid. Loans are offered at low interest rates and can be repaid over an extended period of time beginning six months after students graduate or leave the college. If students are offered aid in the form of a job (Federal Work -Study) , they are paid an hourly rate. Eligibility for Financial Aid Eligibility depends on many factors. To receive aid from the student aid programs offered at Georgia Perimeter College, students must satisfy the following: Have a financial need, except for some loan programs which do not require proof of need Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate Be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non- citizen Have a valid Social Security number Not owe a Federal PELL, Academic Competiveness Grant, National Smart, Teach Grant, or FSEOG over - aw ard Not be in default on a Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Direct Loan Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student working toward a degree or certificate in an eligible program of study. Students may not receive aid for correspondence 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 61 or telecommunications courses unless they are part of an associate degree program. In addition, students may not receive aid for auditing classes. Make satisfactory academic progress Register with Selective Service, if required. If the student is a male age 18 -25 and has not yet registered with Selective Service, he can give Selective Service permission to register him by checking a box on the FAFSA. He can also register through the Internet at the Selective Service web site: www.sss.gov . How to Apply for Financial Aid Generally, only one Financial Aid Application must be completed to get consideration for all types of grants, scholarships, and work opportunities at Georgia Perimeter College. Loans and some special awards may require additional forms. T o apply, take these steps: 1. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year. Submit the FAFSA application online at the FAFSA on the w eb site: www.fafsa.ed.gov. 2. When completing the FAFSA, be sure to list Georgia Perimeter College's name and school code 001562. The college address is 555 North Indian Creek Drive, Clarkston, GA 30021. Submit the completed and electronically signed FAFSA to the Central Processor. 3. Students should receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) within 3 weeks after submitting their application to the processor. Students are able to check the status and view the results from the FAFSA application online. Students should maintain SAR in their personal files. 4. If Georgia Perimeter College is listed on the SAR, the Financial Aid office will receive the student's SAR electronically. Three weeks after submitting the FAFSA application, the student should check GPC SIS System and confirm GPC's receipt of electronic SAR. 5. A student's FAFSA may be selected in a process called verification , and the school may request certain financial documents. Verification documents can be obtained from the Financial Aid office or downloaded from the Financial Aid documents section of the Georgia Perimeter College web site. If additional documentation is required, the student will receive a tracking letter listing the required documents, or the student can check the Financial Aid section of the Georgia Perimeter College web site. If there are questions remaining, the student can contact the Financial Aid office at his or her campus to answer all of the student's remaining questions. 6. Students should respond quickly to all correspondence received from the Financial Aid office . Documents are processed in the order they are received. After the Financial Aid office receives a student's SAR and all requested information, the staff will do the following: Review the information. Make an award based on eligibility and availability of funds. Mail an award letter that lists the types and amounts of aid awarded to the student. The award letter may list additional requirements that the student must fulfill before funds can be disbursed. The student should keep this letter with the SAR. The student must keep his or her name, address, e-mail address and telephone number current with Enrollment and Registration Services on campus or on the Enrollment and Registration Services form page on the Georgia Perimeter 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 62 College web site. When a student is determined to be eligible for financial aid, tuition and fees may be covered to the extent of the aid, provided the student's financial aid file is completed by the priority due date. If the aid is not sufficient to cover tuition and fees, the stude nt is responsible for the balance, which is due at the time of registration. If the aid exceeds the cost of actual tuition and fees, a refund will be issued to the student from the Student Accounts office by the end of the fourth week following registration. Priority Due Dates The FAFSA should be completed and submitted to the central processing center by March 1 every year for which a student plans to request aid. Files that are complete (with SAR and all supporting documents) by April 1 will receive priority consideration and should be awarded by May 15. Processing of files completed after April 1 will begin in the order in which they were received. Students who apply after April 1 should allow two to four weeks to receive an award letter. Students who apply after June 1 should be prepared to pay their fees by the posted fee payment due date and be reimbursed based on their eligibility. If a student's file is not completed by the priority processing due date, the student must pay his or her fees by the posted fee payment due date. The Financial Aid office does not process aid applications during registration. Students may be reimbursed once eligibility has been determined. If a student's aid does not cover the full balance, the student must pay any balance due by the posted fee payment due date. The student is responsible for making sure his or her account is satisfied in full. Award Packages Once students have been awarded aid, they will receive an award letter that lists the various types of aid they are eligible to receive during the award year. Awards are based on full -time (12 or more hours) status; some awards may be adjusted if the student does not enroll as a full- time student. However, aid will automatically be prorated at disbursement if the student is not full-time. If it is determined that the student is not eligible for aid after it is awarded, the Financial Aid office is required to adjust the student's award. Students automatically will be reviewed for Federal PELL Grants and FSEOG because th ey are considered gift aid and do not have to be repaid. Students also will be reviewed for Federal Work -Study. HOPE Scholarships are automatically reviewed for freshmen students who have met the HOPE requirements from high school. Continuing students curr ently receiving HOPE are automatically reviewed. Transfer students must submit a copy of their prior institution(s) academic transcript(s) to the Financial Aid office for HOPE to be reviewed. Students may be awarded grant funds up to the cost of college a ttendance. If they still have unmet financial needs, students may apply for loans under the Federal Stafford Loan and/or the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan programs. These loan programs require a separate loan request form in addition to the FASFA. These loan request forms can be picked up from any GPC Financial Aid office or downl oaded from www.gpc.edu/finaid/. Students who apply by the priority processing due date will be considered for all available funds. Some funds are limited and are awarded to eligible students based on greatest need and meeting the April 1 deadline. Loans are NOT automatically awarded . 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 63 Federal Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Federal regulations require institutions to develop policies that insure that students who receive financial aid are progressing toward graduation. The school's satisfactory academic progress policy must include both a qualitative measure (such as the use of a cumulative grade point average) and a quantitative measure (such as a max imum time -frame for program completion) to track student progress. The SAP policy must be at least as strict as the policy for students who do not receive federal student aid funds. Qualitative Measure According to the Federal Student Aid Handbook, a school may establish its own s atisfactory progress standards; however, these standards must at least meet the minimum standards required by law and regulations. For the qualitative standard, the law specifies that by the end of the second academic year (measured as a period of time, not by the student's grade level), the student must, in general, have: a \"C\" average or its equivalent, and an academic standing consistent with the requirements for graduation from the program. If a school determines that a s tudent has maintained standards, even though his or her grade average falls below a \"C,\" the school must be able to document that the student's average is consistent with the academic standards required for graduation from the program. Quantitative Measure According to the Federal Student Aid Handbook, to quantify academic progress, a school must set a maximum time frame in which a student is expected to finish the program. For an undergraduate program, the maximum time frame may not exceed 150% of the published length of the program measured in academic years, academic terms, credit hours attempted, or clock hours completed, as appropriate. For instance, if the published length of an academic program is 60 credit hours, the maximum time frame established b y the school must not exceed 90 attempted credit hours. Students in the Certificate programs --Library and Information Science Technology and Sign Language Interpreting --must also make progress toward the completion of their programs. Students will be revi ewed after each semester to ensure that they are progressing toward graduation. A student must maintain a \"C\" average each term and maintain a 67% completion rate. Maximum timeframe may not exceed 150% of any program. The published length of the Library an d Information Science Technology Certificate program is 18 hours, not to exceed 27 hours. The published length of the Sign Language Interpreting Certificate program is 48 hours, not to exceed 72 hours. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 64 Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) at Georgia Perimeter College Qualitative Standard Any student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.0 will be placed on financial aid probation. If the cumulative grade point average is below the minimum, the student is no longer eligible f or financial aid. The hours used in calculating the cumulative grade point average include transfer hours. Quantitative Measure Georgia Perimeter College offers two -year degrees that require approximately 60 semester hours to graduate. Applying the 150% rule, the maximum credit hours (excluding Learning Support courses and English as a Second Language courses) that a student can attempt at Georgia Perimeter College and receive federal and state financial aid are 90 semester credits (60 credits in a program of study x 150%). Once the student earns 60 semester credits, the student is considered to have earned the equivalent of an associate's degree. For a student to be making progress toward graduation, he or she must complete 67% of the courses attempted. The Financial Aid office monitors students' progress and will cancel all financial aid once a student has earned 60 semester credits or completed less than 67% of attempted coursework. Students who wish to earn a second associate's degree may request that their eligibility be extended to a maximum of 120 attempted semester hours or 90 earned hours, whichever comes first. If a student takes courses that are not required for the first or second degree, the student may be liable for all financial aid received for the ineligible courses. Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Evaluation A student's academic progress will be evaluated at the end of each semester. Once the Financial Aid office has determined that a student is not making SAP, the office w ill attempt to notify the student in writing. Notification from the Financial Aid office is not a requirement. It is the student's responsibility to be familiar with SAP and monitor his or her own progress each semester to protect financial aid eligibility . Learning Support and English as a Second Language Learning Support (LS) and English as a Second Language (ESL) courses are considered remedial courses. Federal regulations limit the maximum hours a student may receive financial aid for remedial courses. Financial aid may be used for a maximum of 30 hours of LS courses. However, ESL courses are not included in the 30 semester hour limit. Once the maximum is reached, students will not be eligibl e for financial aid until they have exited Learning Support. Up to 30 semester hours of LS and all ESL courses will not count toward the maximum hours allowed for a degree. Appeals Process A student who fails to establish good academic standing or to make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) becomes ineligible for financial aid. If students have mitigating circumstances 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 65 beyond their control that affect their ability to meet SAP standards, th ey may appeal the loss of their eligibility. To appeal the loss of eligibility, a student must complete a Georgia Perimeter College \"Financial Aid Appeal Form\" and submit it with appropriate documentation to the Financial Aid office. The Georgia Perimeter College Financial Aid Appeal Form can be obtained either from the Financial Aid office or downloaded from the Financial Aid Forms page. The documentation must be directly related to the events that affected the student's ability to meet SAP standards. The appeal should also include the steps the student is taking to ensure progress in the future. The student will be notified by mail of the outcome of the appeal. If the appeal is approved, it will list specific requirements the student must meet in order to continue to receive financial aid. If the student's appeal is denied, the student may regain eligibility by meeting the conditions listed in the following section. Reinstatement of Financial Aid Eligibility If a student fails to meet standards of academic progress and does not have mitigating circumstances or the student fails to meet the conditions of an appeal, the student may have his/her aid reinstated as follows: Enroll in at least 6 semester hours of courses required for a degree Pay his/her fees with out the use of financial aid, and Complete all courses attempted with at least a grade of \"C\" or \"S\"; if more than 6 semester hours are attempted, all courses attempted must have a grade of \"C\", \"S\", or better. Once the student has met the listed requirements, he/she may submit an appeal form along with a copy of the grade report. Upon receipt of the appeal form and verification of the student's grades, the student may be awarded financial aid on a semester by semester basis. As long as the student complete s all courses attempted with a grade of \"C\", \"S\" or better, he/ she may remain eligible for financial aid. NOTE: Attempted hours include courses at Georgia Perimeter College and transfer hours accepted by Georgia Perimeter College. Refund Process for Stude nts Receiving Federal Title IV Financial A ssistance Students receiving Federal Title IV Financial Assistance who formally or informally withdraw from school are subject to Federal Return of Title IV refund calculation, as specified in the Higher Education Amendment of 1998. The calculation of enrollment length determines the aid earned by the student based on the days enrolled for the semester in relation to the total days in the semester. The aid considered not to be \"earned\" must be returned to the Federal programs in the following order: Direct Unsubsidized Stafford loans, Direct Subsidized Stafford loans, Direct PLUS loans received on behalf of the student, Federal PELL Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, and Academic Competitiveness Grant. Receipt of Federal Title IV Aid in excess of aid earned may be subject to repayment by the student if the student has withdrawn from school. The Financial Aid & Veteran Affairs office 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 66 notifies the student if a repayment is due.

2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 72 ACADEMIC AFFAIRS General Information Academic Year The academic year is divided into two semesters that are each approximately 15 weeks long. Accelerated class terms that last approximately half the semester are offered during the 15 -week semester on some campuses. The academic calendar for 2012-2014 is available on the GPC website. Students who meet published application deadlines may be accept ed to enter Georgia Perimeter College at the beginning of any semester or session. Summer Session The summer session operates on an accelerated calendar. Multiple sessions may be offered within the semester, and students may register for a combination of sessions. Half -Semester Classes Some departments offer accelerated classes that meet for seven weeks during the fall and spring semesters. These classes cover the same material that is covered in the regular full -term 15 -week classes in the fall and spri ng semesters. Academic Credit Units The unit of credit is the semester hour. A semester hour represents one hour of class meeting per week for one semester or its equivalent in other forms of instruction. Two or more hours of laboratory work are considered the equivalent of one semester hour. In the course description section of this catalog, the number of credit hours is listed beside the title of the course. Classification Students at Georgia Perimeter College are classified as freshmen or sophomores. A student who has completed fewer than 30 hours of college- level credit is classified as a freshman. Students are classified as sophomores when they have completed 30 hours of academic work. Catalog Editions Students will normally satisfy the curricular de gree requirements of the catalog in effect at the time they enter Georgia Perimeter College, although revisions to the requirements may be required to provide effective programs. The term \"curricular degree requirements\" refers to the courses and grades re quired to earn the degree. (Changes in academic regulations affect all students, regardless of catalog edition. Examples of possible changes include the student discipline policy, procedures for removing incomplete grades, and appeal procedures.) There are several instances, however, when students will be required to change catalog editions. This means students will be required to satisfy the curricular degree requirements of the catalog in effect when/if they officially change majors or 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 73 re-enter the college after a period of one year in which they have earned no academic credit at Georgia Perimeter College. Students may choose to satisfy the curricular degree requirements of the current catalog rather than the catalog in effect at the time they entered G PC. If they choose to do this, they must meet all the requirements of the current catalog; the curricular degree requirements of more than one catalog edition cannot be combined. A degree will be awarded only to students who have satisfied all the academic and administrative requirements of Georgia Perimeter College. Full-time Status Students who enroll in 12 or more hours are considered full-time students. Students who wish to take more than 18 hours and who have demonstrated exceptional academic achieve ment may apply to the campus Academic Dean for approval for an overload. This approval must be granted before the completion of the registration process. Class Load/Working Students Students who find it necessary to work in order to attend college are rem inded that carrying a normal academic load of 12 or more hours is a full-time job. Some students may be able to work part-time and still do satisfactory work. It is strongly recommended that no full- time student work more than 20 hours per week. Students who do find it necessary to work more than this should not try to carry a full load of academic work. Those students who need financial assistance should contact the Financial Aid office to inquire about the various opportunities for financial aid. Changes to Students' Records Applicants or currently enrolled students who desire to change their program of study (major), address, phone number, email address or other information should complete and submit the appropriate Data Change Form available at any camp us Enrollment and Registration Services office. Documentation to support changes to student's records may be required. Academic Placement The college makes every effort to determine the appropriate level of beginning instruction for each student by requiring that students take appropriate placement examinations in English, reading and mathematics. Placement examinations are given throughout the semester on all campuses. Students who have submitted an application for admission to the college will be emailed testing invitations indicating when they are eligible to take the examinations. After the assessment of strengths and weaknesses in English, readin g, and mathematical skills, student s are placed in the proper s equence of courses. Since entering freshmen may not need the same series of courses, their level of academic placement may vary. Non-native speakers of English should take the ESL Placement Tests in English and reading. They may take the mathematics section of the placement examinations during the same testing session as the ESL Placement Test. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 74 Students with physical disabilities who need special testing assistance should call the Center for Disability Services to discuss their needs. Placement Tests English and Reading All entering students must take the English and reading sections of the COMPASS placement examination, except for the categories of students listed below: Non-native speakers o f English Students with national SAT Reasoning Test - Critical Reading (formerly SAT I Verbal) scores of 480 or above or national ACT English score of 20 or above or GHGST -ELA score taken May 2010 or later of 260 or above within the last 7 years and who do not have a College Preparatory Curriculum (CPC) deficiency in English Students who have exited Learning Support English and reading at another University System of Georgia institution Students who have exempted Learning Support English and reading at another University System of Georgia institution within the last year Students who have passed (grade of \"D\" or better) a transferable course equivalent to ENGL 1101 at any University System of Georgia institution and who do not have a CPC deficiency in English Students who have earned a \"C\" or better in a transferable course equivalent to English 1101 at a non-University System of Georgia institution and who do not have a CPC deficiency in English Students who have begun but not exited Learning Support English or reading at another University System of Georgia institution within the last year and are not on Learning Support suspension from any USG institution Students who attended a SACS- COC accredited DTAE college and passed ENG 191 after January 2002, who me t the minimum test score requirement for exemption from Developmental Studies at that college, and who do not have a CPC deficiency in English Students who attended a SACS- COC accredited DTAE college and successfully completed Developmental Studies, who me t the minimum test score requirements for exit from Developmental Studies English and reading beginning January 2002, and who do not have a CPC deficiency in English Students who took a COMPASS or ASSET placement test in English and reading at a SACS -COC a ccredited DTAE college , who attended tha t college within the last year , and have those placement scores recorded on their transcripts Students who have begun but not exited Learning Support English and reading within the last year must see an advisor to de termine placement.

After three failed attempts to pass the same course, a student will be excluded from the institution and will have one of two options below for readmission. Option I Readmission with Placement Testing: ESL students excluded from GPC may be readmitted after completing one full year of exclusion. Students must re- test on the ESL placement test and may be required to repeat courses or take lower level courses than those they were taking before the exclusion. Option II Readmission without Placement Testing: ESL students excluded from GPC may be readmitted without placement testing and without a designated time frame if they have all of the following: Transfer credit for English 1101 from a regionally accredited college or university, including SACS- COC (Commission on Colleges) accredited technical institutions. and 30 semester hours (or quarter hours equivalent) of acceptable college level credit from a regionally accredited college or university, including SACS- COC accredited technical institutions. Exiting from ESL To exit the ESL program , students must be exemp t from or have earned a \"C\" or better in all required ENSL courses. Any ESL student who does not earn a \"C\" or better in a required ENSL course must repeat that course. Registration Procedure Registration for classes is held prior to the beginning of each semester or term. Registration dates, times, procedures, and deadlines for fee payment are published on the college website. Students are not officially registered for classes until all fees are paid. Prior to registration, continuing/returning students are encouraged to contact an academic advisor for assistance in selection of coursework that will lead to completion of their chosen degree. After advisement, students will register using the online Web registration system. Any student who registers for a course section for which he/she is ineligible will be dropped from the course unless the student has received special permission to take the course. Course Schedule Changes Students may make changes in class schedules during registration periods published on the college website. Students who do not need an advisor's assistance may make changes using the online Web registration system. Students who need an academic advisor's assistance should see the advisor prior to making any changes. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 82 Attendance Students are responsible for regular and punctual attendance at all classes, laboratories and examinations as scheduled and in accordance with the class attendance policy of the instructor. Students who do not plan to attend a class that they register for are responsible to make these changes to their registration during published registration times. All class attendance policies are on file with the appropriate department chair and are part of the course syllabus. Drop/Withdrawal Policies Course Drops Schedule Adjustment After final registration, students may make changes to their schedules during the schedule adjustment period. Students may add classes to or drop classes from their registration. Tuition and fees are not assessed and final grades are not given for dropped classes. Students may view the schedule adjustment dates on the Academic Calendar. Drop for Non-Attendance (No Show) Students shall be reported for non- attendance, also referred to as \"No Show,\" when they never attend an on- campus class or never log -in for an online class during the first full week of classes. Students who do not drop a class during the schedule adjustment period and are reported for non-attendance will be automatically dropped from that course. Neither the course(s) nor any grade(s) will appear on the student's permanent record. Students reported for non-attendance in a required Learning Support or English as a Second Language course will be withdrawn from all collegiate level (1000 or 2000- level) courses in which that student is concurrently enrolled (except HEDS 1011 and activity PE classes) and the grades will be recorded as a \"W.\" Students who fail to attend a science class (BIOL, CHEM, PHYS) with a corresponding co- requisite class will be withdrawn from the co -requisite class with a grade of \"W.\" There will be no reinstatements for students who do not attend class during the \"No Show\" period. Course Withdrawals Georgia Perimeter College encourages students to complete all courses in which they enroll in order to achieve their educational goals. If a student is contemplating withdrawal from one or all courses in a given semester, the first action should always be to talk to a faculty member, department head, or advisor. Alternative solutions may be found in order to avoid the unfortunate decision to withdraw. If all other options have been exhausted, withdrawal is available as a last resort. Two types of withdrawal processes are described below. The first is for students who are withdrawing from individual courses. The second is for students who are withdrawing from the college as a whole. Students who reduce their course load may be jeopardizing their financial aid status and must always consult with the Financial Aid office before making any withdrawal decisions. Due to the federal withdrawal calculation, a student could owe money to the Department of Education, Georgia Perimeter College, or to a lending agency/guarantor. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 83 Students enrolled in required Learning Support, (courses numbered below 1000) or English as a Second Lang uage (those beginning with ENSL prefix) courses have additional considerations described below that may be affected by withdrawal decisions. Student Initiated Withdrawals The responsibility for withdrawal from courses rests with the student . Instructors will not withdraw students except as outlined under the Automatic Withdrawal section of the policy. Students who stop attending a course without formally requesting to withdraw are subject to their instructors' published attendance policies as stated in the course syllabus. In most cases, this will result in receiving an \"F\" for the course. In order to avoid grade reductions or failures, students must follow the procedures specified below: Consult the official Academic Calendar for the current year to determine whether the withdrawal date is before or after the midpoint of the course. Confer with an Academic and Financial Aid Advisor to help determine if a withdrawal is appropriate. If a decision to withdraw is made, the student should log into the Student Information System (SIS) to begin the official request for a Withdrawal. Students are required to read and accept the Advising, Counseling and Retention Services (ACRS) Agreement explaining their rights, responsibilities and consequences of submitting a Withdrawal request. Students are required to read and accept the Financial Aid Agreement explaining their rights, responsibilities and consequences of submitting a Withdrawal request. Prior to midpoint of course Students who officially withdraw from collegiate level (1000 or 2000- level) courses receive a grade of \"W.\" Students taking only Learning Support or English as a Second Language courses who officially withdraw receive a grade of \"W.\" Students taking a mixture of both required Learning Support or English as a Second Language courses and collegiate -level courses will not be allowed to withdraw from any Learning Support or English as a Second Language course unless they also withdraw from all collegiate level courses. After midpoint of course Students who withdraw after the mid -point have until seven days prior to the end of the semester to submit a Withdrawal Request via the Student Information System (SIS) to earn a grade of \"WF.\" During the last seven days, no withdrawal requests will be accept ed for processing. There are circumstances whereby a student can petition for a hardship withdrawal. Withdrawal from All Courses Students withdrawing from all courses for which they are registered are considered to be withdrawn from the college for that s emester. Students' records remain active for three consecutive semesters until their status is considered \"inactive.\" Students considering withdrawing from the college should confer with an advisor. If a decision to withdraw is made, a Withdrawal Request must be completed in the Student Information System (SIS). Course withdrawal policies are also applicable to college withdrawals. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 84 Instructor Initiated Withdrawals GPC no longer recognizes the practice formerly known as \"Instructor- Initiated Withdrawals,\" except for automatic withdrawals resulting from co - and pre- requisite violations in Learning Support, English as a Second Language courses, and Drops for Non-Attendance (No Show). Automatic Withdrawals Learning Support courses English as a Second Language courses Science co -requisites (withdrawal from either lecture or lab will necessitate automatic withdrawal from the co -requisite in BIOL, CHEM, PHYS.) Students enrolled in both required Learning Support courses (those numbered below 1000) or English as a Second Language courses (those beginning with ENSL prefix) AND collegiate level (1000 or 2000-level) courses must adhere to published attendance policies for Learning Support and/or English as a Second Language courses in orde r to remain enrolled in their collegiate level courses. Any student who violates the published attendance policy of a required Learning Support course in English or reading or English as a Second Language course before midterm will be automatically withdrawn with a grade of \"W\" from that course, along with all collegiate level (1000 or 2000-level) courses in which that student is concurrently enrolled. Students Attending on Student Visas A student attending GPC on an F- 1 (student) Visa/Status may not withdr aw from any class unless (a) the student will still remain registered full-time (12 credit hours) for courses following the withdrawal, or (b) the student receives permission from an advisor in the International Student Admissions and Advising office. Military Withdrawals Students who are called to active military duty during a term may be withdrawn from all courses with a 100% refund. Students in this situation must submit a copy of their orders indicating activation along with the Withdrawal request in the Student Information System (SIS). These students may return to the college with no penalty. Standards for Academic Honesty In accordance with policies and procedures regarding Academic Honesty, cheating and plagiarism are unacceptable in attempting to fulfill academic assignments. (See the Student Guidebook for definitions and examples, procedures followed as a consequence of cheating or plagiarism, and possible disciplinary actions.) The college has established this policy to ensure due process in s uch cases. State and federal laws involving computer fraud, software piracy, etc., as well as institutional policy, govern the use of the college's computer systems. (See the Student Guidebook for a full explanation of these standards.) Special regulations are listed in the Student Handbook as these relate to usage of the Internet other than in support of research and educational objectives. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 85 Academic Records Grades At the close of the semester, students are responsible for viewing their final grades online through the Student Information and Registration System on the college website. Request for Official Georgia Perimeter College Transcript Upon written request, an official Georgia Perimeter College transcript is available to the student as required by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations. Instructions are available on the GPC transcript page or in the Enrollment and Registration Services office. Confidentiality of Student Records See Family Education Rights and Privacy Ac t (FERPA) in the Student Affairs section of this Catalog. Grading System The grading system used at Georgia Perimeter College is as follows: A 90-100 Excellent B 80-89 Good C 70-79 Average A grade of \"C\" is the minimum grade required for certain courses, as specified in the programs of study and Course Descriptions section of this catalog. D 60-69 Poor A grade of \"D,\" while giving hours credit, will not apply toward the degree in courses requiring a \"C\" or better. F Below 60 Failure WF Withdrawal/ Failing \"WF\" indicates that the student withdrew from the course while doing unsatisfactory work. (See Course Withdrawal in this section of the Catalog.) No credit toward graduation is given for a course in which a grade of \"F\" or \"WF\" is received. Special Note: All grades issued to Dual Enrollment students will be recorded as letter grades based on the college grading system. College instructors will not issue numerical grades. For the grading system for Nursing and for Dental Hygiene, please refer to the departments. The following symbols are used in the cases indicated, but will not be included in the determination of the cumulative grade point average: W Withdrawal This symbol indicates that a student was permitted to withdraw from the course without penalty. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 86 WM Military Withdrawal - No grade IP In Progress This symbol applies to Learning Support and under certain circumstances is assigned in lieu of grades below \"C.\" I Incomplete This symbol indicates the student has satisfactorily completed a substantial portion of the course work, but for non- academic reasons beyond the student's control, the student has not been able to complete some specific part or amount of the wo rk required (for example, the final examination). An \"I\" not satisfactorily removed by the end of the following semester will automatically be changed to an \"F.\" The time allowed for completing work may be extended to a maximum of 12 months when circumstan ces prevent the student from completing the work during the following semester. To obtain an \"I,\" the student and his or her instructor must complete the Petition for \"I ,\" which will include a description of the work to be completed and the completion date . Copies of the Petition for \"I\" will be filed with the instructor and the appropriate department chair . Learning Support students may not receive an \"I\" in any required Learning Support course. S Satisfactory U Unsatisfactory These symbols (\"S\" and \"U\") are not used except for certain courses in the technical programs and other special credits where a grade point average is not computed, such as credits by examination. K This symbol indicates credit granted by examination. NR No Grade This symbol is used when no grade is submitted. V Audit No credit is given to a student who audits a course. (See Audit ing Courses.) RGTR and RGTE courses only: S Pass Regents' Test U Unsatisfactory Audit ing Courses College -level students may choose to register for a class for an audit grade. Audit is a grade status selected at the time of course registration. An auditor of a course must meet all admissions requirements and be officially accepted to the college. A stu dent's placement must be college- level to audit a Learning Support course. By registering as an auditor and paying fees and non-resident fees (if applicable), a student is permitted to audit a course and attend classes without meeting all requirements of the course and without receiving credit. Exceptions to this policy are 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 87 clinical courses, certain laboratory courses, and supervised work experience. A student is not permitted to change from audit to credit or from credit to audit after the add/drop period. (Note: Students auditing Learning Support courses may be withdrawn for excessive absences. When college-level students audit a Learning Support course, the course is counted as an attempt in that Learning Support area.) Academic Grade Point Average Determinations of scholastic standing are generally based upon a cumulative academic grade point average (GPA), which appears on each student's permanent record. This average is computed by multiplying the credit hours assigned a course by the grade points earned. The sum of grade points divided by the total number of credit hours attempted at Georgia Perimeter College produces the cumulative academic grade point average. Credits earned in Learning Support and ESL courses, credits earned at other institutions, credit by examination and other courses where symbols such as \"S\" or \"K\" are assigned are not used in calculating the cumulative academic GPA. However, these credits are used to determine Financial Aid and HOPE eligibility. How to calculate term GPA Use t he following steps to calculate a term GPA: 1. Multiply the number of credit hours for the course by the number of grade points for the corresponding letter grade to get the number of quality points for the course. (Credit hours \u00d7 Grade Points = Quality Points) Repeat this for each course in the term. Grade Grade Points A 4.0 B 3.0 C 2.0 D 1.0 F 0.0 WF (Withdrawal Fail) 0.0 Note: Courses with any other letter grade (W, V, etc.) or grades followed by % (Learning Support, ESL, Regents' Prep), $ (Transfer Credit), and # (Academic Renewal) are not used in the GPA calculation. 2. Total the credit hours for each course used in the GPA cal culation. 3. Total the quality points for each course used in the GPA calculation. 4. Divide the total quality points by the total credit hours to obtain the GPA. (Term Quality Points \u00f7 Term Credit Hours = Term GPA) 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 88 EXAMPLE Course Letter Grade Credit Hours Grade Points Term Quality Points ENGL 1101 B 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 MATH 0098 C% 0 \u00d7 0 = 0 (not used) PSYC 1501 C 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 COMM 1201 A 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 PHED 1063 W 0 \u00d7 0 = 0 (not used) Totals 9 27 GPA 27 \u00f7 9 = 3.00 How to calculate cumulative GPA To calculate a cumulative GPA, divide the total number of quality points earned by the total number of credit hours using the guidelines in item #1 above. (Total Quality Points \u00f7 Total Credit Hours = Cumulative GPA) Dean's List At the end of each semester, students who have achieved a grade point average of 3.5 or better while carrying an academic load of nine semester credit hours or more of courses numbered 1000 or higher will be placed on the Dean's List. Grade Appeal Policy Georgia Perimeter College sh all provide students with a timely pr ocess of appealing grades that they believe were incorrectly determined. In cases where a student is appealing a grade on the basis of alleged discrimination, the student must elect between the College Grade Appeal procedure and the Student Discrimination Grievance Procedures, but cannot use both for the same grade appeal. (See Student Discrimination Grievance, Georgia Perimeter College Policy Manual, Section 401.02 ) Grade Appeal Procedure The Grade Appeal Procedure is the method by which a student may challenge a grade issued by an instructor at Georgia Perimeter College. The following procedure is required: 1. The student must contact the instructor after the grade is issued to discuss a change in the grade. This contact should occur as soon as possible, but no later than the second week of the term following receipt of the disputed grade. If a student is unable to contact the instructor, the appropriate department chair should be asked for assistance. Under extenuating circumstances and with supporting documentation, exceptions may be made by the Academic Dean. 2. If the student disputes the instructor's decision, the student may then initiate the appeal process by obtaining a Student Grade Appeal Statement Form from the appropriate department chair. The student must complete this form according to the directions and provide the necessary documentation and pertinent information. The student should return the complete packet to the department chair within one week. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 89 3. Upon receipt of the student's request for a Grade Appeal Form, the department chair will have the instructor complete the Instructor Grade Appeal Statement Form. This form must be returned to the department chair within one week of notification. 4. The department chair will render a decision regarding the grade appeal. Prior to making a decision, the department chair may schedule a meeting with the student and/or the instructor. After making a decision, the department chair will notify in writing both the instructo r and the student. 5. Either the instructor or the student may appeal the decision of the department chair. This appeal must be made in writing, directed to the Academic Dean and delivered within five working days from the receipt of the department chair's decision. 6. The Academic Dean will determine the validity of the grade appeal. If the Academic Dean rules that the issue is not a valid grade appeal issue, the appeal goes no further. If the Academic Dean rules that the issue is valid, then the grade appeal p rocedure will continue according to the following steps. The decision of the Academic Dean regarding continuation of the grade appeal procedure is final. 7. The Academic Dean shall appoint a Grade Appeal Committee comprised of: Voting Members (five members) A committee chairperson appointed by the Academic Dean. The Campus Dean of Student Services or his/her designee. A faculty member appointed by the department chair to represent the department/discipline involved in the appeal. A faculty member appointed by the Academic Dean. This person should be from an academic division/discipline other than the division/discipline in which the appeal is made. The selection will be from a pool of faculty, each member elected by and representing a department on campus. A student representative from the Campus Student Government Association. (Note: If the appealing party holds an SGA office, then the committee member will be from a campus other than the one on which the appealing party holds office.) Non-Voting Members (t wo members) The student making or involved in the appeal may choose someone (faculty/staff) from the college to represent him or her on the Grade Appeal Committee. The faculty making or involved in the appeal may choose someone (faculty/staff) from the college to represent him or her on the Grade Appeal Committee. 8. Recognizing that the Grade Appeal Committee is an in -house procedure, and not a court of law, no legal counsel or any other person may be present besides the student, the instructor, and appointed members of the committee. Exceptions to this would be granted by the Academic Dean and only for the following reasons: (1) students with disabilities requiring some highly extraordinary assistance that could not be routinely provided by the chair or another member of the committee and (2) a student whose first language is not English and whose English is not sufficiently fluent so as to allow him/her to represent himself/herself adequately at a committee hearing. In these cases, the appointment will be left to the discretion of the Academic Dean. 9. After receiving the student's or the instructor's written appeal, the Academic Dean will schedule a meeting of the Grade Appeal Committee. It is the intent of the college to process all grade appeals in a timely manner. Grade appeals will be processed no later than the end of the term in which the appeal was filed. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 90 The committee examines written materials presented by both the student and the instructor. The voting committee members will also discuss the case with both the instructor and the student. During this discussion, the non- voting committee members will advise and consult with the individual they represent. The committee may call other witnesses. The student and instructor have the right to be present at a ll meetings where evidence is presented. The committee chair will be responsible for recording the session. The voting committee members will meet privately to confer and arrive at a decision. Every effort should be made to reach a consensus finding. If not, then a private ballot shall be taken with the chair of the committee voting only in the event of a tie vote. This decision is reported to the Academic Dean who presents the findings and the decision to the student, instructor and department chair. The A cademic Dean will implement the decision of the Grade Appeal Committee unless one of the parties wishes to appeal the grade appeal procedure. The committee maintains and forwards informal minutes of all proceedings to the Academic Dean. These shall be available to the Academic Discipline Dean, the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the President. 10. If the parties are not satisfied with the procedure followed by the Grade Appeal Committee, they may appeal, in writing, within 5 working days to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. The Vice President for Academic Affairs will determine if the grade appeal procedure was followed appropriately. The Vice President for Academic Affairs may at his/her discretion return the grade appeal to the committee for further consideration. The decision of the Vice President is final. Repeating Courses If a student repeats a course, both grades count toward the GPA, and both appear on the transcript, even though the course can be counted for credit only once. The grade received on the final attempt will be used for the purpose of graduation requirements. Grade Forgiveness Policy Students who have retaken courses and earned a higher grade may request to have the first recorded grade excluded from their institutional grade point average (GPA). Excluded grades will still appear on the official transcript. This policy does not supersede financial aid policies for Satisfactory Academic Progress or other GPA requirements set by federal or state laws or regulations or transfer institutions. Such policies and laws use a different GPA calculation which is unaffected by this policy. This policy applies to courses where the retaken course was attempted in the Fall Semester 2011 or thereafter. Students who have repeated courses prior to this term will not be allowed to exclude earlier attempts. Students requesting to have a grade excluded from their Georgia Perimeter College (GPC) GPA must submit a Grade Forgiveness Request available in the campus Enrollment & Registration Services office. Approval of the request is subject to the following conditions: A student must have retaken the same course (or the renumbered substitute for that course) at Georgia Perimeter College (GPC) and earned a higher grade. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 91 No more than a total of four course grades (from four different courses) may be forgiven and excluded from the student's GP A. Requests must be submitted prior to the first day of the term of graduation. Once a request has been approved the request will not be revoked or reversed. A student may only exclude the first grade earned in a course. For example, if a student takes a course three times, the student may use the second or third grade to exclude the first grade. The student may not use the third grade to exclude the second grade. Only grades that are included in a student's GPA calculation may be replaced. For example, grades of W, S, and U cannot be replaced. The original grade was not assigned as a result of a violation of the Academic Honesty policy. Students requesting grade forgiveness must be pursuing a degree at GPC. This policy does not apply to transient students, special students, or dual enrollment students. (See Policy 121 Grade Forgiveness in the college Policy Manual.) Academic Renewal University System of Georgia policy (USG Academic Affairs Handbook, Section 2.5.1) allows degree -seeking students who have experienced academic difficulty to make a fresh start and have one final opportunity to earn an associate degree at Georgia Perimet er College after an absence of five calendar years. The granting of academic renewal does not supersede financial aid policies regarding Satisfactory Academic Progress nor does it supersede the admissions requirements of certain programs, for example, Dental Hygiene and Nursing, which require a specific minimum grade point average based upon all coursework. Students seeking Academic Renewal should contact their Campus Registrar for additional information. Academic Status Students attending Georgia Perimeter College are expected to meet certain academic standards. These standards stress the importance of successful performance by students to maintain an academic status of good standing at the college. Students are considered to be in good standing if they are not on academic warning, academic probation or academic exclusion. Students who hold office in any college club or organization or who participate in athletics must be in good academic standing. Students can check their academic status through the Student Information & Registration System at the end of each semester. Academic Warning Students who have failed to achieve a term grade point average of 2.0 or better shall be given an academic warning and alerted that further deterioration in academic performance may lead to probation. Students should see an advisor to implement a plan for improvement. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 92 Academic Probation Students are placed on academic probation if (1) they are on academic warning and their cumulative grade point average is less than 1.75 or (2) if they pass no collegiate- level course work and have one or more \"F\" or \"WF\" during a term and their cumulative grade point average is less than 1.75. Students on academic probation should see an advisor to plan for improvement and should take a reduced academic load. Students remain on probation until they earn a cumulative grade p oint average of 1.75 or better. Academic Exclusion Students on probation shall be excluded if the cumulative grade point average is less than 1.75 and the term grade average is less than 2.0. Students on academic exclusion for the first and second time can appeal the exclusion. Returning from Academic Exclusion For the first exclusion, students will be eligible to request to return after one semester. After the second exclusion, students will be eligible to return after one calendar year and reapplication to the college will be required. Academic Exclusion Appeals Students on academic exclusion for the first and second time may appeal the exclusion as follows: Upon notification of the exclusion to their GPC student email account at the end of the term: ON -CAMPUS Students: Visit a campus Advising, Counseling, and Retention Services (ACRS) office to complete and submit an Academic Exclusion Appeal form. ONLINE ONLY Students: Access the 'Request for Assistance' web form at www.gpc.edu/online/assistanceform.htm to begin the appeal process. Complete the form (including your GPC student email address) and indicate that you are requesting an Academic Exclusion Appeal. Students will receive additional information at the time they submit their appeal regarding the Appeal Committee process. Readmission for Health Sciences Students should see the Program of Study section of this Catalog for information on readmission to the Dental Hygiene and Nursing program s. Regents' Test Once a student has passed ENGL 1101 and ENGL 1102, he or she will be considered exempt from taking the Regents' Test. Other Exemptions Students will be considered to have fulfilled the reading comprehension requirement of the Regents' Test if they have: SAT -I Verbal scores of at least 510 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 93 ACT R eading scores of at least 23 (Scores must be from a national administration of these tests.) Students will be considered as having fulfilled the essay requirement of the Regents' Test if they have: AP English scores of at least 3 IB higher level English scores of at least 4 SAT -II English Writing scores of at least 650 SAT I Writing scores of at least 560 SAT Reasoning, Writing Section Test: 500 for students who also have at least 510 on the SAT Reasoning, Critical Reading Section. ACT Combined English/Writing test: 22 for students who also have at least 23 on the ACT Reading Test. (Scores must be from a national administration of these tests.) Requests for Transient Permission Students currently enrolled in classes at Georgia Perimeter College who have a cumulative grade point average on record may request permission to take courses at another institution. Students can pick up a Request for Transient Permission form from the Enrollment and Registration Services office at each location. All requests must be approved by the campus Registrar. Students need to understand that grades obtained in the courses taken at another institution will not be calculated into the cumulative grade point average (GPA) at Georgia Perimeter College that is used towar d graduation. Transient permission to another institution will only be granted for one semester/term. Subsequent semesters/terms must be requested separately with a new Request for Transient Permission form. Any student who has signed a TAG agreement is not eligible to be a transient student within their last 30 credit hours of transfer to their TAG institution. In order to receive transient permission, the GPC student: Must be degree seeking at Georgia Perimeter College Must be in good academic standing Must have completed all Learning Support and/or English as a Second Language requirements Must have completed all College Preparatory Curriculum (CPC) requirements or required high school curriculum requirements. Must make sure that the program of study listed with the college matches the program of study listed on the Request for Transient Permission form. If they do not match, the student must submit a Change of Major form to the Enrollment and Registration Services office Must enroll in courses appropriate to his/her major, at the proper level, and in the proper sequence in accordance with GPC prerequisites 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 94 Must register for courses at the transient institution that are of equivalent nature to those offered at GPC. Reference the Transfer Equivalency Web pag e for tran sfer equivalency information Must see a Financial Aid counselor after submitting a request form for transfer of aid if financial aid is given Must see an International Advisor after submitting a request form if the student holds an F-1 visa Must complete an application and meet the admissions requirements and deadl ines at the institution that he/she plans to attend as a transient student Must satisfy all financial obligations to Georgia Perimeter College prior to submitting the request form In or der to receive credit for the course(s) taken at another institution, the GPC student: Must have the course approved by submitting a Request for Transient Permission form. Courses for which approval was not received may not be accepted back as transfer credit by Georgia Perimeter College Must complete the courses with a grade of \"C\" or better Must submit an official transcript to GPC at the end of the transient term. A transcript will not be automatically sent from the transient institution. Student must follow the procedure to request an official transcript from the transient institution . If a student completes a prerequisite course at the transient institution, this may impact his/her eligibility to take the next sequential course until the grade is pos ted at GPC. It is recommended that students are aware of the start and end dates of the semester/term at the transient institution. A student completing a course at the transient institution in the semester of his/her graduation must allow time for process ing of the credit at GPC. Depending on the end of term at the transient institution, this may delay graduation. Graduation Students are encouraged to fulfill all requirements for graduation to earn an associate degree in arts, science, or applied science. Students who earn associate degrees enhance their chances of being accepted into the senior institution of their choice. Students with associate degrees also enhance their employment opportunities after they graduate. Students who are within a few hours of earning an associate degree but transfer to a four- year institution before completion may, in many cases, transfer the necessary hours back to Georgia Perimeter College from the four -year institution and earn the associate degree. Students should consult the campus Enrollment and Registration Services Office to explore this option. The annual formal commencement ceremonies are held in December and May of each year. Students completing degree requirements at the end of the summer or fall semesters may participate in the December commencement. Students completing degree requirements at the end of spring semester may participate in the May commencement ceremony. 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 95 Graduation Requirements Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, and Associate of Applied Science degrees and certificates are awarded each semester to those students who meet all graduation requirements. All students who have earned 30 semester hours are eligible for a graduation evaluation.

No person shall, on the basis of age, race, religion, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, disability or veteran status, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity of the college. Any individual with a grievance related to the enforcement of any of the above provisions should contact the Director of Human Resources for Compliance and Affirmative Action (DHRCAA). Student Discrimination Grievance Policy Discrimination as prohibited by law is a matter of particular concern to Georgia Perimeter College. The college 's policies and procedures for dealing with discrimination have been designed to protect all individuals while ensuring academic freedom to teach , learn and work. Students at Georgia Perimeter College have the right to free expression in the classroom and the right to express political ideology and other personal beliefs of intellectual diversity. The policy is in accordance with the University Sy stem of Georgia Board of Regents Policy 401.02 and the law. The policy has the support of the college 's President and administration. Discrimination means to treat a person adversely because of race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, creed, national origin, age, disability or veteran status or to implement policies or practices that intentionally or unintentionally adversely impact a person on the basis of race, color, gender, religion, creed, national origin, age, sexual orientation, disability or veteran status. Confidentiality will be mainta ined insofar as it does not interfere with the college's legal obligation or ability to investigate allegations of misconduct when brought to its attention and to take corrective action when it is found that misconduct has occurred. Throughout the process, every effort will be made to protect the complainant from reprisals and to protect the accused from irresponsible complaints. The Student Discrimination Grievance procedure encourages and provides guidelines for informal resolution of disputes by communication between the parties involved. Procedure This procedure provides a means by which students who are aggrieved by actions taken by college personnel (faculty , staff or administration) that they feel are discriminatory, including 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 99 assignment of grades so long as the basis of the grade appeal is alleged discrimination, can voice their grievances and be heard in a meaningful manner. This procedure is in no way intended to discourage or supplant the informal resolution of disputes by communication between the parties involved, and in fact, no written grievance will be considered and no hearing will be granted by the Grievance Committee unless an aggrieved p arty can show that he or she has made genuine efforts to resolve the dispute informally, by means specified herein. Neither is this procedure intended to supplant Georgia Perimeter College procedure section 304.50 entitled \"Student Appeal Regarding Grades\" in cases where a student is appealing an assigned grade on grounds other than alleged discrimination by a faculty member. In cases where a student is appealing a grade on the basis of alleged discrimination, the student must elect between the College Grade Appeal procedure at Section 304.50 of the Georgia Perimeter College Policy Manual and the Student Discrimination Grievance Procedure, but cannot use both for the same grade appeal. (See Student Appeal Regarding Grades, Georgia Perimeter College Policy Manual, Section 304.50) All proceedings pursuant to thi s procedure will be conducted as confidentially as is practical. All time limitations are not to exceed the specified number of days. All references to days are to working days. Campus Dean of Student Services' Roles An aggrieved student shall meet with the campus dean of Student Services at the earliest opportunity afte r the most recent incident that is the subject of the grievance.

The determination shall include specific findings of fact based on evidence presented at the hearing and a course of optional courses of action for the institution. The determination may include a dissenting opinion or opinions if the committee members are unable to reach consensus. The DHRCAA will then report the results of the hearing to the parties involved in writing or in person.

However, if a student later 2012 - 2014 Archived CopyGPC 2012- 2014 Catalog 129 chooses to register for courses offered on campus, the exemption becomes void with the student required to provide proof of immunization. It is recommended that distance learning students who choose to come to campus, for example, to use the library, also submit the required immunization information. Online courses are offered over the Internet. Consequently, basic computer skills requiring a web browser and word processor and regular online participation are essential for success. Using a computer and Internet access, students can access course materials, discussions, assignments, and assessments using iCollege, the lear ning management system. These may be supplemented with DVDs and online resources. Students can also interact with the instructor and classmates electronically using a combination of communication tools. Instructors maintain online office hours to converse directly with individual students via text or voice. Additional information and details about GPC's online course offerings can be found at the GPC online website ( www.gpc.edu/online/ ) or by calling GPC Online at 678-891-2805. Hybrid Courses Hybrid courses are courses in which many of the learn ing activities are online with on- campus classroom time reduced but not eliminated. The goal of the hybrid course is to combine the best features of in -class teaching with the best features of online learning. Using computer- based technologies, instructors use the hybrid model to redesign lecture or lab content into new online learning activities, such as case studies, tutorials, self -testing exercises, and onl ine group collaborations.

Note : Courses marked with * next to their title indicate the course is not required for the associate degree at the college, but this course will be required in order to transfer to most four-year institutions at the junior level. Music Theory Placement Examination Every student registering for MUSC 1611 for the first time who has not completed MUSC 1708 will be given the Music Theory Placement Examination to ensure that he or she begins in the course best suited to background and prior study. In addition, upon request by the student, the Music Theory Placement Examination may be given for the purpose of exempting specified music theory courses. Passing the examination allows the student to enroll in the next sequential course, but no credit is given for exempted courses. Arrangement and Scheduling of Music Courses Students who desire to become professional musicians and are accepted as music majors must begin their musical studies the first semester they enroll. Because the music curriculum must continue throughout an entire four- year college program, it is necessary that general education cours es be met over the four -year period instead of during the first two years, as is the usual procedure. Students whose program of study is music are strongly urged to consult a music advisor prior to each semester of registration to ensure they register for the necessary courses to complete the associate's degree program in two years.

Atlanta, GA 30334 The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia was created in 1931 as a part of a reorganization of Georgia's state government. With this act, public higher education in Georgia was unified for the first time under a single gov erning and management authority. The governor appoints members to the Board, who each serve seven years. Today the Board of Regents is composed of 18 members, five of whom are appointed from the state- at-large, and one from each of the 13 congressional dis tricts. The Board elects a chancellor who serves as its chief executive officer and the chief administrative officer of the University System. The Board oversees 35 colleges and universities : four research universities, two regional universiti es, 13 state universities, 14 state colleges, and two two -year colleges. These institutions enroll approximately 302,000 students and employ over 40,000 faculty and staff to provide teaching and related services to students and the communities in which they are located. As part of the mission of the University System, public service and continuing education ac t as an interface between the 35 institutions and the communities which they serve. Such activities are an extension of the traditional on-campus learning process and have been established to improve the welfare of Georgia's citizens and serve business, industry, government, and professional organizations.
