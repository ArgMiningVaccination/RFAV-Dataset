Yet because of barriers segregating the professional worlds of scientists and healers, research on thistopic has not met its potential. Even the most sympathetic of scientic investigators have failed to treat healers as full re-search partners, neglecting to take seriously healers' informedperspectives in formulating study questions and in makingkey decisions regarding assessment and outcomes. Likewise,some of the most gifted healers exhibit antipathy towardscientic research that is uninformed and works at cross pur-poses with efforts to validate the efcacy of healing and to integrate its practice into conventional medical settings. Forthis situation to improve, scientists and healers must recog-nize that each party has critical gaps in knowledge and skillsthat the other party possesses. Only through true collabora-tive partnerships can the potential benets of research onhealing be realized. Key words: Healing, healers, scientists, research, salutogenesis (Explore 2008; 4:302-310. \u00a9 Elsevier Inc. 2008) It is ironic, perhaps even tragic, how little the healing professions actually understand about healing. We all know that healing issomething good, something that we want, for ourselves and forour clients, but no one has ever satisfactorily explained just whatit is, how it happens, and how to get there. There could be nomore worthy scientic enterprise than nding answers to thesefundamental questions about healing. Yet, for all the writing onthis topic, both popular and scholarly, there is still considerableconfusion. For one, there is no more misunderstood term in all of com- plementary and alternative medicine (CAM) than \"healing.\" Tosome, healing is an intervention, as in Therapeutic Touch orReiki. Healing is something done by healers\u2014a therapeutic mo-dality delivered by a practitioner to a client. To others, healing isan outcome, such as recovery from illness or curing of a disease.As a result of treatment, whether conventional or alternative, wehope to experience a healing. To still others, healing is a pro-cess\u2014for example, Antonovsky's concept of salutogenesis. 1 When the pathogenic process is halted, we then ideally maybegin healing\u2014moving from a state of disease to a state of re-newed health. In some unfortunate pieces of writing, healing is all three of these things at the same time. Healing is something practiced byhealers that initiates a healing process so that we may obtainhealing. All things to all people, healing, so used, as a constructfor systematic research is thus close to worthless.This paper does not seek to resolve this issue, nor to offer any kind of a denition. That remains for another day. From a bio- medical perspective, the word healing probably is best reservedfor the third usage\u2014the salutogenic process. Research on saluto-genesis is almost nonexistent but holds considerable promise forunlocking the secrets of how the pathogenic process is coun-tered. Healing, understood in the context of salutogenesis, rep-resents the foundation for a \"natural history of health\" 2formu- lated as an alternative to existing models of the pathogenicallyoriented natural history of disease. The study of healing, in thatsense of the word, ought to be a major focus of basic scienceresearch, and perhaps will be someday. For purposes of the comments that follow, however, the word healing is mostly used in the more familiar rst context: as aclass, or metaclass, of therapeutic interventions using touch(contact healing) or not (noncontact healing). Numerousschools and philosophies of healing exist, besides the Therapeu-tic Touch and Reiki mentioned above. These have been taxo-nomically described in various ways, such as on the basis ofwhether healers rely on ordinary or altered states of conscious-ness and on naturalistic or metaphysical belief constructs. 3 Therefore, no implication is being made that all healing modal-ities are equivalent, either in their practices or beliefs or in theenergies that they purport to work with or utilize. The onlycommonalities, as far as the types of healing work being consid-ered here, are these three constituent elements: (1) therapeuticuse of the hands, (2) functional proximity to the client's body,and (3) engagement of subtle bioenergies of variant conceptionsand descriptions. FROM CONFLICT ... Investigation of the efcacy of healers and of healing work has sparked some interest within the CAM eld, although it lagsbehind most other areas. Important conceptual and theoreticalwriting of recent vintage, including nice summary statementsfrom Benor, 4,5Dossey6(the executive editor of this journal), and from the Samueli Institute,7are encouraging of thought-1 Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC An earlier version of this manuscript, \"Scientists Don't Have All theAnswers (And May Not Have the Right Questions Either),\" was pre-sented at The Co-Creation Process in Energy Medicine: A Synergy of theSciences and Healing Arts, the 12th Annual Conference of the Interna-tional Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine,June 17, 2002, Boulder, CO. #Corresponding author.

Serious scholarly attention to this topic actually dates back to even before the important re-search and writing of pioneers like Grad, 8LeShan,9Solfvin,10 and Krippner and Villodo.11As long ago as 1926, JAMA published a fascinating three-part series of articles on \"reli-gious healing,\" 12as comprehensive and reflective a piece of writing as has ever appeared on the topic. Nonetheless, propo-nents of contemporary biomedicine exhibit, by degrees, reac-tions ranging from apathy and disinterest to disdain and evenrabid denunciation. Such views typically have been uninformedby any of the scholarly writing that exists on this topic, and alsotypically have confused this topic with absent prayer or faithhealing or more lurid topics such as channeling or occult pow-ers. Such historical and theoretical ignorance is embarrassingand inexcusable, in light of the excellent writing available on thetopic of healing. It also, sadly, is undeniable. Scientists offer many excuses for ignoring the work of healers. Many people reading this article, especially those with expertiseon this topic, will be familiar with some or all of the followingexcuses: (1) All healers are fakes, frauds, charlatans, hoaxers,quacks, etc. (2) There is no empirical evidence supportive ofhealing. (3) There are no posited theories of healing. (4) There isno consensus mechanism for healing, thus it cannot possiblyhappen. (5) Features of purported explanatory models for heal-ing either do not exist (eg, bioenergy) or are solely epiphenom-ena of the functioning of physical structures such as the brain(eg, consciousness). One personal favorite rears its head every now and then: the assertion that, no matter the evidence, healing is impossiblebecause it violates the laws of science, which are typically leftunstated. Accordingly, biomedical research should not waste itstime on this topic, as it is nothing but \"mysticism masqueradingas science,\" a newish buzz phrase latched onto by skeptics andused in reference to anything to which they object. 13 All of these assumptions are false.This posture is exemplied nicely in an infamous science fair project seeking to discredit Therapeutic Touch, purportedly de-signed by a nine-year-old fourth-grader, which was published inJAMA as conclusive proof that energy healing is \"groundless.\" 14 This amateurish attempt at a scientic paper, which it turns out was sponsored by an organization of self-described \"quack-watchers\" and coauthored by a delicensed physician, 15Key features of the as- sumptions, design, data collection methods, statistical analysis,and conclusions\u2014were faulty, and the authors ignored existingscientic work contrary to their own presumptions. Nonethe-less, their write-up was published, accompanied by a coordi-nated public relations blitz, and was heralded as having perma-nently discredited and \"falsied\" the work of healers. These sorts of exercises are as pointless as they are predictable. What skeptics fail to realize is that so many of the battles thatthey continue to ght are part of a war that they have already lost. One of the great underpublicized truths of modern scienceand medicine is that many of the presumably controversial phe-nomena disparaged by skeptics, notably Einstein's \"spooky ac-tions at a 16which, in theory, can account for noncon- tact healing,17have long ago been empirically validated. So much of what is purportedly controversial really is not, at leastamong those physicians and scientists who bother to keep up with the literature. Perhaps if healers themselves were more con-versant with research ndings in the physical sciences, then theywould contextualize their work in ways less likely to provoke theattacks of skeptics. 17 As for the work of healers purportedly violating science, what- ever that means, efcacious healing either happens or it doesnot. If it happens, then it is a part of reality. Who, when con-fronted with plain evidence of healing, could then assert some-thing so strange as that it violates science, presumably science'sinviolate laws? Are we not to believe our own observations? Asfor the crack about mysticism, a National Institutes of Healthexpert panel concluded over a decade ago that so long as aconcept can be operationalized in some way, no matter howunconventional the concept, then it can be empirically stud-ied. 18Yes, even \"mysticism\"\u2014to wit, the existing sociological literature on the topic19as well as ongoing scientic investiga- tion of the transcendent experience within academic psychol-ogy, neuroscience, and other disciplines. 20 Aside from disparagement by those few vocal physicians and scientists guilty of wearing blinders, issues related to the practiceof medicine and the conduct of clinical research also impedeprogress toward scientic study of healing. For one, Westernmedicine and its basic-science foundations focus almost exclu-sively on pathogenesis, the process by which healthy or at-riskpeople or populations, exposed to pathogenic agents, cross theclinical horizon into symptomatology and, potentially, ad-vanced disease states. Salutogenesis, or the process by whichpeople or populations recover from illness or attain a state ofhigh-level wellness, is a term used only by a few maverick socio-medical scientists. As a result of a specic biological or psycho-social therapy or intervention, the body mobilizes a coping re-sponse that moderates or buffers a respective pathogenic threat,leading to greater host resistance and decreased susceptibility,and thus amelioration of disease or disease risk. 2 To Western medicine and biomedical science, salutogenesis does not exist. Most physicians and bench scientists, moreover,may never have heard of the concept or been exposed to it intheir training. Where healing is considered at all, it is almostalways in the familiar but limited context of wound healing andgranulation of a focal lesion. On a whole-person level, the con-cept of healing is not really engaged at all, at least not typically asa unique process with unique determinants. Getting better ismostly seen as a matter of reversing or undoing the discreteprocesses implicated in becoming ill. Healers, with their focuson restoring balance and fostering wholeness and wellness moreso than on solely curing pathology, may not emphasize out-comes that are valued by the mainstream of biomedicine. Western medicine tends to prioritize quantiable improve- ments in observable signs and biomarkers, which are \"objective,\"over improvements in symptoms and patient perceptions ofgeneral well-being, which are labeled as \"subjective.\" This is in keeping with an innate bias toward the professional pronounce-ments of those doing the treating over the self-reports of theactual people experiencing the illness. Statuses observed by theclinician and especially validated by laboratory work thus countfor more than the reported experiences of the patient. Indeed,they may count for everything, and patient perceptions not at 303 Scientists and Healers EXPLORE September/October 2008, Vol. 4, No. 5all. Etic, biomedically sanctioned categories of experience are real; emic, lay denitions are just something to work around, orare invisible. For study of the work of healers, much of whoseimpact is often validated by self-reports of improvements infunction, affect, and symptomatology, the normative biomedi-cal perspective thus may militate against acknowledging much ofwhat healers and clients would afrm as evidence of therapeuticefcacy. What impedes valuation of the realities perceived by the peo- ple who have come seeking care? Are there perhaps deeper,intrapsychic issues involved in disvaluing patients' or researchsubjects' perceptions of their own status? As difcult as this is toconfess, we cannot dismiss the possibility of professional hubrisand conceit. This should not be overstated, but let us be honest,many medical and scientic professionals are skilled at exercis-ing control and domination over their little corners of the worldand will brook no resistance to their pronouncements. Authorityand power are two of the perks of the white coat. In response,passivity is expected, questioning is a nuisance to be endured,and challenges are experienced as a threat, rather than a need forassurance. Situations that expose the fallibility or uncertainty ofthe biomedical worldview with respect to a given phenomenonare liable to provoke strong, protective reactions. In the clinic,patients whose behavior does not t within acceptable boundsmay be tarred with all sorts of disparaging labels that populatethe medical lexicon: \"crock,\" \"gomer,\" \"Camille.\" 21In the lab, incongruous or unacceptable values may be labeled as outliersand discarded. In such a context, it is not surprising that thegatekeepers of biomedicine would tend to deride or disregard thework of healers whose successes are measured, in part, by im-provement in outcomes that are considered \"soft.\" Structural factors in the practice of medicine also inhibit con- sideration or investigation of the work of healers. Turf issues anddisciplinary boundaries are obvious concerns. Where healinghas insinuated itself into clinical settings, such as in the case ofTherapeutic Touch, the healer role may be perceived as princi-pally female and primarily lled by nurses. Negative attitudes orsanctions justied on the basis of a presumed lack of evidencefor efcacy may really be more about fear of encroachment by acompeting class of caregivers presumably \"lower\" on the totempole of authority and intellect. This may indeed exemplify atraining or educational disparity, but not in the expected direc-tion. Undergraduate and postgraduate medical education, in-creasingly dominated by scientic models grounded in molecu-lar-biological models of pathogenesis, is unlikely to haveexposed future physicians to anything related to healing. Thepsychic grids reinforced by the physician's world, perhaps alongwith a subtext of gender and class status conflict, as well as thepressures of conforming to \"normal science\" among clinical re-searchers, thus operate to marginalize more humanistic ap-proaches to care. And what is more humanistic a modality thanhealing? Distrust of those outside of the professional community, and especially of laypeople, may result in rash and uninformed judg-ments about phenomena that may be quite a bit more familiar toother professionals. Because one has never been exposed to cer-tain concepts and ideas about healers or healing, these ideasmust necessarily be wrong or false. Worse, this lack of knowledgeabout certain topics, such as healing work, may itself be invisible to those with the power to sanction its practice and study. Notonly do some physicians not know about healing, but they donot know that they do not know. This kind of ignorance can bedifcult to endure for healers and proponents of healing. But thesad truth, which many reading this article will recognize, is thattoo many people known for ponticating on this subject, such ascertain professional debunkers, simply have no idea what theyare talking about. A case in point: in 2001, the present author published a schol- arly trade book, God, Faith, and Health, 22that summarized exist- ing epidemiologic and clinical research on religion, spirituality,and health. Alongside chapters on social, behavioral, and bio-logical mediators or cofactors involved in understanding thesendings was a chapter entitled \"Energy, Consciousness, andMysticism.\" This chapter sampled some of the more interestingpsychophysiological, neurophysiological, and health-related re-search and associated theoretical writing that have addressedtopics such as nonlocal healing, spontaneous remissions, thetherapeutic effects of meditation and yoga, and the psychoener-getic and bioenergetic systems postulated by many CAM thera-pies. In a snide review that appeared on an Internet magazine siteand was subsequently reprinted in various skeptical outlets, onephysician-reviewer condently declared, \"This stuff is decidedlynon-Cartesian and backed up by zero evidence.\" 23He was espe- cially outraged by mentions of chakras ,na/H6126dis,subtle energies, and acupuncture meridians, but, helpfully, he assured readersthat \"most of it is bunk.\" 23 Now for the truth. The second edition of the Institute of Noetic Sciences report on 65 years of published empirical re-search studies, theoretical papers, and review articles on physicaland psychological correlates of meditation and altered states ofconsciousness contains a 125-page bibliography of over 1,500scholarly references. 24An earlier bibliography from the Institute of Noetic Sciences on the topic of spontaneous remission con-tains 1,385 medical journal articles reporting the seemingly mi-raculous remission of cancers and other serious chronic diseasesfollowing inadequate or no treatment. 25Benor's ongoing anno- tated bibliography of experimental research on the healing ef-fects of distant intentionality, bioenergy work, and prayer nowtotals around 200 studies. 4A nearly 20-year-old bibliography of clinical, theoretical, and empirical papers on yoga and meditationtotals over 1,000 scientic publications. 26The Samueli Institute's thorough summary of research and writing just on the topic of\"spiritual healing, energy medicine, and mental intention effects,\"compiled by Jonas and Crawford, uncovered over 2,200 published reports, including 122 laboratory studies, 80 randomized con-trolled trials, 128 summaries or reviews, 95 reports of obser-vational or nonrandomized studies, and 271 descriptive stud-ies or case reports. 7The National Library of Medicine's PubMed27database of published peer-reviewed medical jour- nal articles contains a separate \"complementary medicine\" por- tal that, at the time of this writing, indexes 593,596 scienticpapers, including 17,511 matching solely on the term \"bioener-getic,\" 2,165 on the phrase \"spirituality and health,\" 182 on theterm \"bioelectromagnetics,\" and 42 on the phrase \"energy heal-ing.\" This exercise could continue for another page, but will endnow with a nal observation: the thousands of years of A /H6126yurveda 304 EXPLORE September/October 2008, Vol. 4, No. 5 Scientists and Healersand Traditional Chinese Medicine practiced on hundreds of millions of patients in billions of clinical encounters, focusingon their chakras and Qi and meridians and other \"bunk\" for which there is \"zero evidence.\" Besides psychological and professional characteristics of phy- sicians and scientists, certain existential and spiritual issues maycome into play here as well. So many clinicians, it has beenobserved, are personally disconnected from any sense of higherself or spirit, perhaps a reflection of their nonreliance uponwellsprings of religious faith relative to the general population. 28 Nurses, by the way, are not immune. As members of the nursingprofession buy into the prevailing mechanistic model of a hu-man being and ultratechnological model of healthcare, they riskbecoming \"specialists without spirit,\" 29just as so many of their physician colleagues already have become. This can be under-stood as a state of \"ungrounding,\" with much the same implica-tions as in the term's electronic usage. Without a grounded pathfor an electrical current, a fault will not cause a breaker to tripand a fuse can overload and burn down a structure. This is as truefor one's psyche as for one's home. One consequence of such a disconnect from spirit, from the source or ground of being, thus may be an overload of harmfulpsychological energy, resulting in hypercritical, overly judgmen-tal, and reactive mental states. Propositions counter to one'sprofessional beliefs or values (or absence of values) must beridiculed and trivialized lest one's own uncertainty or confusionor lack of understanding be exposed. Perhaps some may see thiscondition as developmentally adaptive in the intellectual train-ing of scientists or physicians, even admirable, but it is notproductive of emotional well-being nor does it prepare one forcollegial relations with laypeople or patients. It certainly doesnot bode well for a cordial response if the proposition in ques-tion threatens the very hegemony and exclusivity of one's pro-fessional status and knowledge, as the existence of efcacioushealers seems to do to some physicians and scientists. Healers, interestingly enough, have taken note of this with some sympathy. The individuals upon whose terrain they appar-ently have trespassed may themselves be \"wounded healers,\" 30 no less wounded than the patients they are treating. Thus theyare as much in need of empathy and respect as anybody else.But, given considerable differentials in political status and legit-imacy, healers are powerless to intervene, except to offer com-passionate care to those wounded biomedical professionals whohappen to seek them out. Dossey has reflected on this situation,with some sadness and frustration: Modern medicine has become one of the most spiritually malnourished professions in our society. Because medicinehas so thoroughly disowned the spiritual component tohealing, most healers throughout history would view theprofession today as inherently perverse. 31 Underlying this \"perverse\" state most of all, it seems, is fear. Unchecked, gut-wrenching fear is not hard to discern among somany denouncers of healers, healing, and healing research. Theoften Inquisition-like reaction to those heretics that dare to carefor suffering people without ofcial sanction must be comingfrom somewhere more primordial than some sort of protectivebusiness instinct. Healing, according to an insightful essay byStambolovic, 32is perceived as an assault on the optimistic, sci- ence-worshipping dogma of modernity, which constitutes afoundation of Western medicine. The limits of ofcial sciencecan never be acknowledged, much as certain churches neverallow deviation from adherence to their foundational myths.Heresy, in fact, is a reasonable metaphor here: healers and heal-ing are \"outside the pale,\" as are those who research these mys-terious phenomena. 33Their continued existence threatens tacit assumptions about what constitutes real or good science, andthus they must be stopped\u2014or at the very least\u2014marginalized. The antihealing contingent likes to cast its critique in terms of Science, with a capital \"S,\" whose integrity is apparently threat-ened by the study of healing. This is subterfuge, a misdirectionplay. Furthermore, any justication for healing, it is declared,must be in terms of \"hard\" outcomes and biomarkers, since theyare the only legitimate ones\u2014a position taken perhaps because itis assumed that healing cannot pass muster according to theseparameters. The many positive ndings in the scientic litera-ture cited earlier say otherwise. But this notion of \"hard\" science is itself faulty. Social scien- tists have long been interested in phenomena related to healersand have successfully applied a variety of reliable and validobservational, phenomenological, and ethnographic methodsto the study of healers and healing for many decades. 34-37The tacit assertion that healers and healing somehow cannot be le-gitimately researched in this way is just a canard. It is nothing butthe same old objective-versus-subjective issue cloaked in a dif-ferent garment. Not coincidentally, perhaps so-called objectiveoutcomes are favored because they are most familiar to clinicaland biomedical scientists, who may be largely unexposed to anyof the broader health-related research enterprise under the aegisof other professions and disciplines, such as epidemiology andthe medical social and behavioral sciences. Philosophers of sci-ence remind us, too, that objectivity is as socially constructed asthe much-derided subjectivity so dismissively condemned bythe 38The vitriol underlying the con- demnation of studies of healing with positive outcomes basedon subjective evaluations, self-reports, or qualitative observa-tions may reflect an unspoken paranoia over maintaining con-trol of this discourse, lest it slip into the hands of the differentlycredentialed. ...TO COLLABORATION How do we work around these issues and begin to advance thestudy of healing? What is needed most of all is collaboration between scientists and healers. But this collaboration can proceed only without thearrogant presumption that scientists must be in charge and mustset the agenda\u2014dening terms, selecting outcomes, imposing areality grid upon the healing transaction. This collaboration alsorequires healers to let go of their own negative preconceptionsabout science and medicine. Each partner, scientist and healer,brings something unique to the table. Each needs the other.Without either one, this collaborative effort is doomed. With-out both scientist and healer working together, or at least notworking at cross-purposes to each other, this research will notbe\u2014and cannot be\u2014done. 305 Scientists and Healers EXPLORE September/October 2008, Vol. 4, No. 5These comments may seem reasonable enough, but fair warn- ing: this is not the model that scientists are used to, and somewill conjure up all manner of excuses to resist it. Multidisci-plinary conversation has proved elusive for CAM\u2014with practi-tioners of conventional medicine across CAM modalities andbetween practitioners and researchers\u2014and there is no reason toexpect that it will not be a challenge here as well. But withoutsuch conversations, healing research and healing itself will nevergain full credibility within the medical community, like it ornot. 39 A major barrier to full collegiality with healers can be found in the professional culture of academic medical science. Biomedi-cal scientists, and academic clinical investigators even more so,tend to act like little eld marshals, operating under a militarymodel of authority and control. They set the agenda, theychoose the players, they direct the project, they author all schol-arly products, they have nal say on interpreting and spinningthe results. That will not work here. What are required, instead,are open ears, open minds, and open hearts; investigators needto listen to what healers tell them and show them, and they mustask questions and observe. Contrary to the commonly heardassumption that there are no useful theoretical or explanatorymodels for healing, there actually are many\u2014put forth by healersand consonant with numerous emic perspectives. 4,40-44So, sci- entists, do not presume that you know more than healers! Similarly, healers must not presuppose that they can get by without scientists. Scientic validation has much to offer heal-ers. It is through science\u2014through systematic empirical investi-gation of theoretical hypotheses\u2014that we can determine whatworks, what does not, and how and why. Successful evaluationthus holds out the promise of eventual political, legal, and -nancial sanction. For healers, as with other alternative practitio-ners, this brings with it the possibility of credentialing stan-dards 45that could serve to open doors to full integration into conventional medical practices.46But this may not be a simple task, and not just because of resistance from mainstream bio-medicine. It is a commonly observed conceit among practitioners of unconventional therapies that their respective modality requiresno evaluation\u2014its effectiveness is self-evident, having come fromon high. A variation on this theme is that the modality is actuallyunable to be evaluated due to imaginary limitations inherent inall existing research designs or methods, which prevent evalua-tion of this one extra special therapy. This is uninformed andharmful nonsense. Unfortunately, this latter myth still plaguesthe CAM eld. 18Some healers may be as reticent as some phy- sicians and scientists to acknowledge uncertainty, resistant ofany systematic investigation of what they do for fear of ndingout that what they do does not work. One function of research iscull out the wheat from the chaff, and no one wishes to discoverthat they are chaff. As is true for practitioners of other alternativetherapies, some practitioners of healing thus may be just as op- posed to collaborating with researchers as vice versa. Practitioners of alternative therapies\u2014including healers\u2014must recognize and accept that careful and rigorous scientic study ishow society is able to evaluate innovations, and is thus a neces-sary condition for subsequent adoption. If efcacious methodsof healing are to become accepted within medicine and amongthe larger client community, to the greater good, one presumes, then this is how it will happen. Scientists doing science arerequired to achieve this end; healers working in isolation cannotdo so, no matter their good intentions. In collaboration betweenscientists and healers, the big winner stands to be the ailingpublic, not just the reputations of healers. If healers are as selflessand altruistic as so many purport to be, then they would do wellto take these words to heart. Among proponents of healing research, Hufford 47speaks in a more guarded tone about the desirability of an eventual accep-tance of healing into the mainstream of Western medicine. Hewarns of the danger of co-optation, which has occurred for otheralternative modalities, inevitably resulting in an \"unacceptabledistortion of healing.\" 47(p305)Still, he argues that initiating rig- orous programs of systematic research remains the best and onlyway to break down barriers that continue to marginalize healers.I would agree. Too many healers, though, disparage scientists and are guilty of condemning science on the basis of the grossest stereotypes ofthe scientic method, making light of the difcult constraints oflife in the academic community, constraints that so many ear-nest scientists courageously struggle against every day to survivein that environment. This response is disturbingly similar to thedisparagement of healers by biomedical professionals based onuninformed and supercial stereotypes. There is a valid critiqueto be made of the biomedical science establishment and of aca-demic medicine, but not by healers. Unless they double as cre-dentialed medical professionals or scientists (and some do, to befair), healers are not competent to criticize. Healers criticizingphysicians and scientists without understanding just what it isthat physicians and scientists do, and why, is as arrogant asskeptical physicians and scientists expressing condescending dis-dain for the life's work of healers. So, healers, do not presumethat you know more than scientists! In sum, each partner\u2014scientist and healer\u2014brings something useful to the table and something useful to the other partner.Each side needs the other, and we all need both, if we are ever tounderstand healing. What do scientists bring to the table? Scientists bring substan- tive knowledge of the natural history of disease. They bring anunderstanding of how to frame and test hypotheses. They (ide-ally) bring methodological skill, knowledge of how to design anappropriate study, and a capability to intelligently analyze em-pirical data. The best among them also bring experience in nav-igating the straits of institutional science, with all of its nuancesof grant writing and funding and publishing. In sum, scientistsknow howto conduct research. What do healers bring to the table? Healers bring substantive knowledge of healing modalities, at least their own particularschool or philosophy of healing. This is no small contribution.Without this substantive knowledge, it is impossible to knowwhat questions to ask, what to assess, and what to expect in terms of outcomes. Healers bring expertise in conducting healing,something scientists will not possess unless they also havetrained in a respective healing modality. Healers bring an under-standing of the healing process\u2014perhaps not the same under-standing that scientists bring, but in light of biomedicine's ne-glect of salutogenesis, some healers may be quite a bit more 306 EXPLORE September/October 2008, Vol. 4, No. 5 Scientists and Healersinsightful on this topic than all but the most creative and well- read scientists. Healers also bring the sum total of their ownprofessional training, which will include all of the pertinentwhat, where, when, how, and why issues related to their practice,such as sensitivity to innumerable nuances related to treatingclients. Scientists must learn to recognize and respect this fact\u2014that healers may be just as well trained, credentialed, and expe-rienced as they are, and thus bring categories of professionalexpertise that scientists have no exposure to at all. In sum, heal-ers know what to research. Healers also have something to offer clinicians. Physicians may be generally unaware of the considerable upside that heal-ing work offers to their own clinical practice. One accomplishedpractitioner and teacher of bioenergy healing has nicely articu-lated the benets of integrating healers into conventional pri-mary care practices, hospitals, and pain treatment centers. 48 These include follow-up care for patients with chronic and pro-gressive diseases; cost-effective, safe, and noninvasive treatment;hands-on human contact and compassionate support, a second-ary outcome that may offer considerable therapeutic benet;and the ability to provide medical colleagues with useful feed-back regarding patients' bioenergetic well-being. Some cliniciansmay not see the value in these potential contributions. So be it.But let it be known that the inclusion of healers among theprovider base of integrative primary care practices is a phenom-enon that is expanding across the United States. 49 There is reason then to be hopeful. The divide separating scientists and physicians, on the one hand, and healers, on theother, can be bridged. The wounds can be healed. This willrequire that scientists reframe their ideas about healing and thathealers reframe their ideas about science. To this end, severalprerequisites must be met. These include rethinking how weconceive of healing, how we train clinicians, and what we prior-itize in our research agendas. An immediate need, but liable to be overlooked, is something that social scientists refer to as theory building. We must con-tinue to develop theoretical models of what has been termed the\"natural history of health,\" 2so that the practice of healing can be conceptually put in context in terms of a salutogenic, and notpathogenic, framework. Such models ought to start with a moreholistic understanding of healing as multifactorial in its determi-nants and multidimensional in its outcomes. The work of heal-ers is not necessarily about attacking and destroying pathology,but restoring wholeness and equilibrium\u2014reequilibrating the hu-man system, often through an input of some type of bioenergy,and almost always accompanied by positive intentionality. Itwould behoove us to begin considering what factors might facil-itate this process, what factors might interfere, and what theresults might be for respective physiological systems. Medical, nursing, and health sciences education would do well to include material on philosophies and techniques of heal-ing, if for no other reason than to better inform and prepare future practitioners for what awaits them (and their patients) outin the world. So many clinicians, even staid academic physi-cians, have had their own experiences of unconventional heal-ing, yet there may be great reticence to share these experienceswith others, whether students or colleagues. 50This is under- standable, but these anxieties will still have to be met head-on iffuture generations are to be educated about healing. This will require, for many, a basic shift wherein the phenomenon ofanomalous or unexplained recovery is something to embraceand explore, rather than something to deny or denigrate or dis-miss. To generalize, nurses are farther ahead in this regard, butthere is little in the way of uniformity. Most nursing students,just like most medical students, are never exposed to this topic. Most critical of all for advancing scientic understanding of healing is development of programs of collaborative researchwith healers. Clinical, health services, basic-science, and epide-miologic studies of healing would all benet from such partner-ships. Detailed research agendas for the study of healing alreadyhave been proposed. But, as mentioned, their success will de-pend upon collaborative partnerships among scientists and heal-ers, each partner deferring to the other on matters in which thegreatest expertise lies with one or the other. The place for healers in efcacy studies such as clinical trials is obvious, but need not be limited to performing the intervention.Emic models of what happens during healing work, and how ithappens, can usefully inform identication of study variablesand covariates as well as subsequent efforts to interpret ndings. Health services research, such as utilization studies, would also benet from the input of healers. The capacity of healers todeconstruct the normative clinical encounter for their modalitywill enable more precise documentation of client experiences, as well as more realistic expectations as to what outcomes to antic-ipate from what types of encounters for what clinical presenta-tions in what clients. Basic-science research, such as laboratory studies of anatomi- cal features of the bioenergy system and of physiological effectsof healing, requires healers not just as study subjects but asguides. Healers will know what to look for, where to look, andunder what conditions to expect changes in form or function. Finally, in clinical-epidemiologic research, such as popula- tion-based outcomes studies of healing, healers can valuablyidentify categories of study variables to be included in data col-lection instruments. The training and professional expertise ofhealers will enable unique insights into what long-term out-comes to expect and into the anticipated determinants of theseoutcomes. The longitudinal impact of healing work on popula-tion-health indicators is another especially exciting researchfrontier, but the present author is admittedly biased, as he is anepidemiologist. If healing is what healers say it is, and if it doeswhat they say it does, then it would surely be a phenomenon ofconsiderable importance for public health. Two common themes run through these summaries of pro- spective research: (1) the healer as an interpreter of realities andexperiences that may be far less familiar to the scientists oversee-ing the research, and (2) the scientist as methodologist and cre-ative partner who can use the expertise of healers as input informulating testable study questions and interpretable outcomemeasures. Reliable and valid measurement or assessment ofstudy variables and parameters is a foundation for all empiricalresearch and a sine qua non for producing useful results. Itstands to reason that scientists would willingly consult experts inwhat they intend to study, in this case healers, to get a handle onpertinent concepts and on how they are conceived of and iden- 307 Scientists and Healers EXPLORE September/October 2008, Vol. 4, No. 5tied by practitioners. But oftentimes, scientists, just like physi- cians and skeptics, do not know that they do not know. A couple of decades ago, the early history of the religion, spirituality, and health eld, a couple of decades ago, was repletewith egregious examples of biomedical and clinical scientistsventuring blindly into a foreign land\u2014namely, religious assess-ment\u2014with predictable results. These investigators, apparentlyunaware that entire academic elds of study, accepted theoriesand constructs, and scores of validated instruments had existedfor decades, devoted themselves to positing illogical study ques-tions and crafting study variables whose wording and responsecategories were, to put it mildly, absurd: inquiries into thechurch attendance patterns of Jews, classication of Baha'is andSus and Mormons as Protestant Christians, failure to differen-tiate between transcendental meditation and liturgical prayer,costly development of 200-plus-item batteries of unusable ques-tions assessing religious constructs for which dozens of validatedbrief indices already existed. Such an unfortunate situation canbe avoided for healing research only if healers are included in theearliest discussions of proposed research projects. Some of these points, though not all of them, have been made by others. Good examples of collaborative involvement evenhave made it into print in top-line scientic journals. The workof Kiang and colleagues 51,52at the Samueli Institute has already been productive of successful basic-science research exemplify-ing thoughtful scientist-healer collaboration. Yet, despite suchsuccesses, a brave new era of healing research seems ever emerg-ing, but never quite emerged. This is because investigators stillhave been largely unwilling to accept healers as full professionalcolleagues. Researchers must be willing to share some of theleadership, and limelight, with those who may know much morethan they do about the topics that they purport to study. At thevery least, they must be humble enough to seek consultationfrom healers and strongly consider their views, even where theirown presuppositions might differ. The types of consults spelledout above, especially related to assessment issues, will do muchto enhance the validity of empirical research on healers andhealing. In all of this, the insights of healers must inform scientists' conceptual understandings of what it is that goes on when heal-ers ply their trade. Further, characteristics of healers as well ashealer-dened parameters of the transaction between healer andhealee, dened in terms of bioenergy or consciousness or some-thing else, may be critical variables to consider in the design ofstudies and in the analysis of data. This cannot be accomplishedunless healers are partnered closely with scientists in developingstandards and guidelines for the empirical study of healing. Sim-ply put, scientists need to work closely with healers to know whatquestions to ask\u2014or at least where to begin asking. As of yet,however, this call remains largely unfullled. Even in the thoughtful and comprehensive recommendations offered for healing research by the Samueli Institute, 53healers themselves seem almost invisible. Over 200 helpful and verydetailed questions are provided to guide prospective investiga-tors in designing and conducting rigorous studies. These guide-lines touch on issues related to study design, subject selection,research methods, randomization, masking, placebos, controls,assessment, data collection, analysis, and much more. This is atruly commendable product, and by far the nest attempt to date to standardize empirical research on healing. But, like mostexisting research on the topic, the focus is on modalities ofhealing rather than on the characteristics (or professional opin-ions) of practitioners of healing. As recently observed by Suth-erland and Ritenbaugh, 54research to date \"has paid relatively little attention to the voices, states, or traits of the healers them-selves in relation to their work.\" In fairness, as the authors admit,this may be a situation of easy-to-criticize-but-hard-to-x untilsuch time that healers can \"come together to nd commonlanguage to describe their own experiences during healings.\" Despite these difculties, successful efforts have been made to foster true collaborative relationships between scientists andhealers. The Institute of Noetic Sciences has been involved indeveloping strategic partnerships with academic medical scien-tists to build funded research programs around topics such asdistant healing, subtle-energy medicine, and the health impactof intentionality. A highlight of this effort, according to Schlitz,\"involves inclusion of energy healers and intuitives as full par-ticipants in the formulation of research questions and design.\" 55 Through standard qualitative research methods, such as use ofgrounded theory and structured interviews, investigators alreadyhave drawn on the collective wisdom and expertise of healers todetermine conceptual categories useful for respective researchprojects. 56The Samueli Institute, too, has endeavored to vali- date assessment of one of the most personal and subjective as-pects of the healer's work, namely the existence of a hypothetical\"healing presence,\" drawing on the perspectives of healers fromdiverse traditions. 57 Collaborative research partnerships between scientists and healers thus are possible, are not unprecedented, and remain anunfullled potential only on account of our collective lack ofeffort. If scientists can overcome their inertia, and any otherpreexisting professional and psychological barriers, and if heal-ers can overcome their own resistance to critical evaluation, thentrue scientist-healer collaboration can happen. Only then mayhealing someday earn a place at the table along with all of theother therapeutic options sanctioned by modern medicine. If this ever comes to pass, it will be a good thing for healers, to be sure. But the insights that we gain through scientic valida-tion of healing may be a source of great learning for us about thetherapeutic efcacy of all medical practices, including those ofallopathic physicians. Remarkable experimental research bySchlitz 58provides evidence that the expectations of investiga- tors\u2014their beliefs and attitudes\u2014are a determining factor inwhether positive results are obtained. In her study, an investiga-tion of distant mental interaction with living systems (DMILS),subjects were monitored while being stared at via closed-circuittelevision from another room. She observed greater electroder-mal activity during these remote staring periods than duringcontrol conditions. The same experiment, replicated by a non-believer in the possibility of DMILS effects, found nothing. The only nonconstant across these two trials, Schlitz concluded, wasthe mental expectation of the investigator. These results mayexplain why the studies done by skeptics fail to identify thera-peutic effects for healers: they are literally hoping that no onegets healed. More provocatively, these results also may explainsome of the therapeutic effects demonstrated for conventional 308 EXPLORE September/October 2008, Vol. 4, No. 5 Scientists and Healerstherapies in which mainstream clinical investigators have con- dence. If consciousness can impact on the physical world in this way, then there is a more signicant implication of this research.Perhaps we have been given powerful conrmation of the po-tential salience of positive intentionality for the effectiveness notjust of psychobiological experiments, but of human interactionin general. This would include, presumably, the work of healersas well as of conventional medical practitioners. Clearly, this isan issue of profound and immediate importance for those of usconcerned with how compassionate and efcacious care can beoffered to sick and suffering people. In an essay published several years ago, Dossey addressed the theme of \"how healing happens.\" 59\"The short answer,\" he stated, \"is: Nobody knows.\"59(p347)The scientic quest to an- swer this question, one would think, should be a high priority forbiomedical scientists and healers. Both healers and scientists areexperts in their respective realms. Both realms are essential toadvancing the enterprise of evaluating and understanding thework of healers. The obvious requirement is that both scientistand healer recognize the expertise of the other, and recognizethe critical need for that expertise in the successful attainment ofthis objective. But until healers shed their distrust of scientists,and scientists release their presumption of authority, nothingmeaningful will happen. It is high time for this situation tochange.
