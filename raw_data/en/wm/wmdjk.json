Among influenza viruses typed since week 40, virtually all have been influenza A , with about 70% subtyped as A(H1N1)pdm09 overall since season start. More recently, however, A(H3N2) viruses have comprised a greater share of influenza A detections, accounting for about 70% of subtyped influenza A viruses in week 12. For this second influenza A wave (due to A(H3N2) ), the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza A in week 12 (32%) is comparable to that during the peak of the first wave (due to A(H1N1)pdm09) in week 51 (34%). However, it is still too early to determine whether this second influ enza A wave has peaked. Ongoing monitoring is needed. In week 12, ten laboratory -confirmed long- term care facility (LTCF) outbreaks of influenza A (all with subtype still pending) were reported . The cumulative tally of LTCF influenza outbreaks to date this A(H1N1)pdm09- dominant season remains below that of prior A(H3N2) -dominant seasons in 2017- 18 and 2016- 17 (66, 169, and 192 outbreaks, respectively). However, the number of LTCF outbreaks report ed in weeks 8 through 12 represent more than a 60% increase over the cumulative tally of LTCF outbreaks reported since the beginning of the season (week 40 to week 7) , consistent with the increase in influenza A( H3N2) contribution in recent weeks.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 2 BC Children's Hospital Emergency Room Following a peak in week 52, the proportion of visits to BC Children's Hospita l Emergency Room (ER) attribut ed to ILI has shown a secondary increase beginning from week 9, with levels well above the historical average for this time of year maintained through week 11 (23%) and week 12 (22%) ( Figure 2 ).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 3 Medical Services Plan The Medical Services Plan (MSP) indicator monitors general practitioner claims for influenza illness (II) as a percentage of all submitted MSP claims. Following an overall provincial p eak around week 52, and a relative plateau between weeks 5 and 10, this indicator increased in week 11 and has remained elevated through week 1 2, now trending above the 10- year maximum (Figure 3 ). Some regional variation is apparent, with the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority showing a notable increase (Figure 4).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 4 Figure 4 Interior Fraser Vancouver Coastal Vancouver Island Northern BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 5 British Col umbia Laboratory Reports Methodological explanation With expanded influenza testing by additional laboratories across British Columbia (BC) , adjustments to data analysis methods have been required in order to reliably interpret trends in laboratory findings . Derivation of the percentage of respiratory specimens testing influenza positive has been revised to enable more reliable comparison from week to week. The percentage influenza positivity is now presented, by influenza type, based on primary specimens submitted for influenza testing at the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory (PHL) and other external sites that share complete testing data with the BCCDC PHL. It should be recognized that this report does not include data from all influenza test ing sites across the province. The BCCDC PHL conducts the majority of influenza subtype characterization for the province, including for primary specimens submitted directly to the BCCDC PHL for influenza diagnosis, as well as for specimens that have tested positive for influenza at other external sites and for which secondary subtyping is requested of the BCCDC PHL. Laboratory surveillance observations To date, of 13,559 known specimens tested for influenza across BC, 3322 (25%) tested positive for influenza A and just 77 (0.6%) tested positive for influenza B since week 40 (s tarting October 1, 2018) . Virtually all (98%) influenza detections have therefore been influenza A so far this season . In week 12, 309/951 (32%) specimens tested positive for i nfluenza A, comparable to week 11 (273/804; 34%) and consistent with a n unusual late-season wave of influenza A . In week 12 , influenza B positivity remained stable at 2% ( 18/951), maintaining the unusual ly low levels of influenza B observed this season (Figure 5 ). Since week 40, a mong influenza A viruses successfully subtyped at the BCCDC PHL , (2592/3503; 74%) and consistent with increasing A(H3N2) contribution in recent weeks. Of the 353 influen za viruses typed in week 12, 335 (95%) were influenza A and 18 (5%) w ere influenza B. In week 12 , among the influenza A viruses, 92 (27%) were identified as A(H3N2), 39 (12%) as A(H1N1)pdm09, and for 204 (61%) subtype was still pending. Among subtyped influenza A viruses in week 12, therefore, the majority ( 92/131; 70%) were A(H3N2) , also comparable to week 11 (165/227; 73%) (Figure 6). Note that subtype remains pending for over half (61%) of influenza A specimens in week 12; therefore, these proportions may change as subtyping becomes more complete. Nevertheless, these findings continue the trend of greater A(H3N2) contribution relative to A(H1N1)pdm09 observed in recent weeks. Of note, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing influenza A positive in week 12 (32%) of this second back -to-back influenza A wave (predominantly A(H3N2) subtype) remained comparable to that at the peak of the earlier influenza A wave (predominantly A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype) in week 51 (34%). I t is still too early to determine whether this second influenza A wave has peaked. Ongoing monitoring is needed. Since week 40, approximately half (52 %) of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were among adults 20- 64 year s of age (Figure 8 ). Twenty -two percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were observed among children 9 years who comprise about 10% of the BC population 1. Children aged 10-19 years comprised a smaller proportion of cases (5%). Twenty two percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been among elderly adults 65 years of age. Conversely , the majority ( 55%) of A(H3N2) detections have been among elderly adults 65 years of age, despite comprising about 18% of the population in BC1. The BCCDC PHL also conducts testing for other respiratory viruses (ORV) among specimens from select sites across the province. Other external sites perform their own ORV testing and this report does not include data from all sites across the province. A mong ORV testing at the BCCDC PHL during week 1 2, respiratory syncytial viruses (n=38) were the most commonly detected (excluding influenza) (Figure 6 ). 1 Government of British Columbia, BC Stats.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 8 BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory In week 12, 139 tests for influenza and 124 tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were conducted at the BC Children's and Women's Health Centre laboratory. Of these, 36 (26%) were positive for influenza A (not subtyped), 3 (2%) were positive for influenza B, and 13 (11%) were positive for RSV. Influenza A positivity remained comparably elevated between week s 11 and 1 2 (24% versus 26%, respectively ) while i nfluenza B and RSV positivity have both decreased between weeks 11 and 12 (influenza B: 6% versus 2%; RSV: 15% versus 11%, respectively) 9). Figure 9: Influenza and other virus detections among respiratory specimens submitted to BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory, 2018-19 * Positive rates were calculated using aggregate data. The denominators for each rate represent the total number of tests; multiple tests may be performed for a single specimen and/or patient. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 9 Influenza -like Illness (ILI) Outbreaks One laboratory -confirmed acute care outbreak (influenza A subtype unknown) and 10 laboratory -confirmed long-term care facility (LTCF) out breaks of influenza A ( all subtype unknown) were reported in week 12. Since week 40, a total of 66 LTCF outbreaks (21 A(H3N2), 18 A(H1N1)pdm09, 26 subtype unknown, and 1 B), 19 acute care facility outbreaks, 32 school outbreaks, 1 correctional facility out break, and 1 mental health facility outbreak have been reported ( Figures 10 and 11 ). The cumulative tally of LTCF influenza outbreaks to date this A(H1N1)pdm09- dominant season has been far below that of prior A(H3N2) -dominant seasons in 2017 -18 and 2016- 17 (66, 169, and 192 outbreaks, respectively). However, the number of LTCF outbreak s reported between weeks 8 and 12 represent more than a 60% increase over the cumulative tally of LTCF outbreaks reported since the beginning of the season (week 40 to week 7), consistent with increased A(H3N2) contribution in recent weeks.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 10 National FluWatch (week 11, March 10 to March 16, 2019) Influenza activity in Canada continues to be reported. While most western regions have past peak activity, influenza continues to circulate at higher level s in eastern regions. In week 11, the proportion of laboratory tests that were pos itive for influenza remained stable in comparison to week 10 at 21.4%. To date, i nfluenza A is the most common influenza virus detected in Canada (98%); the vast majority of these viruses are A(H1N1)pdm09 (83% of subtyped influenza A viruses). However, detections of influenza A(H3N2) have been steadily increasing since mid -January and accounted for the majority (64 %) of subtyped influenza A detections in week 11 . There is currently very little influenza B circ ulation compared to previous seasons. The majority (84%) of lab- confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been reported among individuals under the age of 65. Conversely, the majority (59%) of influenza A(H3N2) detections have been reported among adults 65 ye ars of age and older. Details are Strain Characterization From September 1, 2018 , to March 28, 2019, the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has characterized 1700 influenza viruses [233 A(H3N2), 1415 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 52 B (22 Yamagata lineage and 30 Victoria lineage )] received from Canadian laboratories. Influenza A(H3N2): 82 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were considered antigenically similar to A/Singapore/INFIMH - 16-0019/2016, the WHO -recom mended A(H3N2) component of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. However, 27 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against egg- propagated A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016. 63 influenza A (H3N2) viruses characterized belonged to genetic group 3C.2a1, 17 belonged to genetic group 3C.2a, and 29 belonged to genetic group 3C.3a. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: 1375 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were found to be similar to the A/Michigan/45/2015 virus: the WHO -recommended influenza A(H1N1) component of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. However, 40 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against cell culture- propagated A/Michigan/45/2015. Influenza B: 22 influenza B viruses antigenically characterized were considered similar to the B/Phuket/3073/2013 virus, which belongs to the B Yamagata lineage: the WHO -recommended influenza B component of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccine. The WHO -recommended influenza B component of the trivalent vaccine is a B/Colorado/06/2017- like virus of the B Victoria lineage. 18 influenza B viruses characterized were antigenically similar to B/Colorado/06/2017. 12 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against cell culture- propagated B/Colorado/06/2017. National Microbiology Laboratory (NML): Antiviral Resistance From September 1, 2018 , to March 28, 2019, the NML received influenza viruses from Canadian laboratories for drug susceptibility testing. Amantadine: Of the 388 influenza A viruses [ 64 A(H3N2) , 324 A(H1N1)pdm09] tested against amantadine, all were resistant. Oseltamivir: Of the 1017 influenza viruses [ 103 A(H3N2), 879 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 35 B] tested against oseltamivir, 1013 were sensitive, and 4 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with an H275Y mutation were resistant. Zanamivir: Of the 1016 influenza viruses [ 103 A(H3N2), 878 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 35 B] tested against zanamivir, all were sensitive. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 11 International USA ( week 11, March 10 to March 16, 2019) In week 11, influenza activity remained elevated in the United States (US), with i nfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses continuing to co- circulate . Influenza A( H3N2) viruses have been reported more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in week 11. The majority of influenza viruses characterized antigenically are considered similar to the cell -grown reference viruses of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vac cine; however, an increasing proportion of influenza A(H3N2) viruses are antigenically distinguishable from the A(H3N2) component of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. All tested viruses showed susceptibility to zanamivir and greater than 99% of the viruses tested showed susceptibility to oselt amivir and peramivir. In week 11, t he proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza fell below the system -specific epidemic threshold. Eight influenza -associated pediatric deaths were reported in week 11 . The proportion of outpatient vis its for ILI has remained stable since week 10 at 4.4%, but remains above the national baseline of 2.2%. The US CDC has posted a summary of influenza activity in the United States and elsewhere, available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm WHO There have been no new WHO global influenza surveillance updates since our last bulletin . The latest report is available at: https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/en/ In other news, on 11th March 2019, the WHO released a Global Influenza Strategy for 2019- 2030 aimed at protecting people in all countr ies from the threat of influenza. The strategy aims to reduce the burden of seasonal influenza, minimize the risk and control the spread of zoonotic influenza, and prepare for (and mitigate the impact of) the next influenza pandemic. The new strategy has t wo overarching goals: 1. To develop better tools to prevent, detect, control and treat influenza, such as more effective vaccines and antiviral treatments, with the goal of making these accessible in all countries; and 2. To strengthen country capacities for influenza surveillance , prevention and control, and preparedness. To achieve this, it calls for every country to develop a tailored influenza programme that contributes to national and global preparedness , response, and health security. The Global Influen za Strategy 2019- 2030 is available INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 12 2018/19 Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates Canadian Mid -Season 2018- 19 Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates On January 24th, 2019, the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) published the first mid- season estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2018- 19 season in the northern hemisphere. The Canadian SPSN reported substantial VE of 72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 60- 81%) against medically - attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness . Substantial vaccine protection was observed across all age groups, notably young children, who also appear ed to be disproportionately affected by this year's A(H1N1)pdm09- dominant epidemic. The Canadian interim estimate for 2018- 19 is comparable to preliminary estimates of VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 using the same vaccine component reported fr om Australia (78%; 95%CI: 51- 91%) for their 2018 season. It is substantially higher than reported for Canada during last year's A(H3N2) -dominant epidemic (for which VE against A(H3N2) viruses was less than 20%). Consistent with global trends, sequencing analysis of viruses collected by the Canadian SPSN showed considerable genetic diversity among circulating clade 6B.1 viruses of A(H1N1)pdm09; however, a dominant drift (immunologic escape) variant was not identified. The full report is available as an open- access publication in the online journal Eurosurveillance : https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560 -7917.ES.2019.24.4.1900055 Hong Kong Early Season Estimates - 2018/19 Vaccine Effectiveness Against Pediatric Hospitalization On January 31st, 2019, i nterim VE estimates for the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine were reported from Hong Kong for the prevention of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization in children. Authors report substantial VE of 92% (95% CI: 82-96%) against A(H1N1)pdm09- attributed hospitalisation in children (aged 6 months -17 years). This estimate is comparable to the VE estimate reported earlier by the Canadian SPSN for the prevention of medically attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness in children 1- 8 years of age (91%; 95%CI: 67- 98%). The full report is available as an open- access publication in the online journal Eurosurveillance: https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560- 7917.ES.2019.24.5.1900056 United States (US) Interim Estimates of 2018 -19 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness On February 14th, 2019, mid- season VE estimates for the prevention of laboratory -confirmed influenza associated with medically -attended acute respiratory illness (ARI) were reported from the US CDC. Authors report an overall VE of 46% (95% CI: 30- 58%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, which is lower than the recently reported interim VE estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09 of 72% in Canada during the 2018- 19 season and 78% in Australia during the 2018 southern hemisphere influenza season (see above). A hi gher VE of 62% (95% CI: 40- 75%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 among those aged 6 months to 17 years was reported in this study. Discrepancies in VE estimates across studies may be attributed to multiple factors including differences in the stage of the influenza ep idemic relative to the initiation of the immunization campaign, variation in circulating viruses, as well as methodological differences including contributing sample sizes (and statistical power), participant profiles, and clinical outcomes assessed.

VE estimates were generally higher against A(H1N1)pdm09 than against A(H3N2) for which no vaccine protection was suggested among 3/4 studies in the outpatient setting; however, wide confidence intervals require cautious interpretation.
