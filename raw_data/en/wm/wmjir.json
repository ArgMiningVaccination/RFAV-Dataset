Note that this sub is not the official voice of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith on reddit. For an official site check out: https://www.bahai.org. Firstly let me link to the [Compilation on Health, Healing, and Nutrition](http://bahai-library.com/compilation_health_healing_nutrition). Have you read all that? Good. Now, there seems to be some misunderstanding among a small group of people as to what constitutes a \"competent physician.\" Because that is the only reason I can see for my Baha'i friends to ignore modern medicine and instead try to cure themselves through the use of herbs, diet, and prayer. Yes, Baha'is are exhorted to use the minimum amount of medicine to cure disease, and to embrace \"natural\" remedies. However, just because you are a Baha'i does not give you some inside track to panacea. Unless you have graduated from medical school, you are not a doctor. And just because the healthcare industry has been compromised by capital interests does not mean that there's no such thing as a competent physician. The miracle of modern medicine, particularly through pharmacology, is inherently based in \"natural\" healing. The basic reagents and active ingredients for all pharmaceuticals are completely natural. Just because it was made in a lab does not make it evil. These drugs and their treatments have been rigorously tested using well-established methods accepted by the scientific community. If a doctor prescribes for you a pill instead of some herbs does not make him incompetent, nor does it go against Baha'i teachings. Of course, the full potential of medicine has yet to be unlocked, and eastern medicine has merits that western medicine has traditionally eschewed. However, the line that separates these two is rapidly disintegrating. It is not up to medical laypeople to decide what medicine works. It is in the best interests of physicians to find remedies by any means necessary, and you are not going to discover something that medical science hasn't already uncovered. Going to a conference where people are selling you herbs and roots and whatever else that \"doctors don't want you to know about\" doesn't mean you've bested the medical industry, it means you're a fool who's been scammed by charlatans. The reason I am writing this is because I have seen so damn many Baha'is going around selling herbs and juices, going vegan or gluten free, or using colored lightbulbs or sound machines to cure people of their physical ailments, using the Baha'i Writings as justification for these actions, instead of going to freaking doctor. I just found out that a dear Baha'i friend of mine has been sent to hospice, his body completely consumed with cancer, that metastasized from a single case of very treatable skin cancer. But instead of going to the doctor, he treated himself with this junk (oh, and \"rigorous prayer\"). He only went to the doctor for the first time last week! His wife previously died from pancreatic cancer, which she also chose to treat \"naturally.\" They're not the only ones. I personally know many Baha'is who are armchair doctors, who sell bottles of herbs and tubes of ointment, who roll their eyes and smirk at the advice of licensed physicians. My own father considered himself a homeopath, despite not having any training whatsoever. This is despite the numerous other Baha'is who are doctors. As a religious community, we certainly aren't lacking for doctors of all kinds. Even in America, we have \"osteopathic physicians\" who do treat patients holistically and understand the science behind \"natural\" remedies. They're still doctors, and will prescribe pharmaceuticals when necessary. It's seemingly the best of both worlds, the sort of physician described in the Baha'i Writings. Yet these people I've described above will still ignore them. Please, friends, find the right nutritional balance that suits your lifestyle. Attempt a regimen of physical activity unless it is impossible for you. And please, for God's sake, go to the doctor and do what they say. TL, DR: Baha'is can't outsmart medical science. Listen to your doctors. "}
