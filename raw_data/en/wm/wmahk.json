Interested in self-empowerment classes where you learn to trust your intuition? We offer Spiritual Wellness Sessions, Classes and Workshops to help you Live your Life on Purpose! We each have a life purpose, have you found yours? Did you know your Spiritual Healing & Wellness refers to how you feel about yourself, your life and how you see yourself interacting with the world around you. Our Spiritual Wellness is as important as our Emotional, Physical and Mental Well being. When one of these is out of balance it can throw us off course, we can become sick and unwell. I invite you to take part in our classes and see how to improve how you feel about your self, connect with others and improve your attitude, thoughts, intuition and actions. Evidential Readings Readings are meant to help people heal emotionally, spiritually and provide you with evidence that life carries on.
