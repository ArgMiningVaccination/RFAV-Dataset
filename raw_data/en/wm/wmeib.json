While some of the most common seasonal complaints (runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing, headaches, and low energy) are often associated with Spring, when you are sensitive to the environment, every season brings challenges. If you find that these issues have been keeping you indoors and reaching for tissues, rather than exploring the great outdoors, Nettle could be the perfect herbal ally for you.* Discover more about Nettle and why it should be considered an herbal essential all year round.* What is Nettle [Nettle (Urtica dioica)](/blogs/herbs/nettle) is a perennial herb, which means that it can grow for at least two years, and is native to Europe, Asia, Northern Africa, and North America. While you can cultivate this herb in a garden or field, as we do on our 350-acre Certified Organic farm in Brevard, North Carolina, this herb is also commonly found growing in forests and alongside roads and meadows. It is known for its ability to grow quickly and to spread swiftly to other areas. If you start Nettle on your own, you can begin the seeding process indoors and transplant the seedlings outdoors during the Spring. The harvesting period typically begins in the early Summer, but you can continue to harvest Nettle throughout the season.1 The aerial parts (the leaves and seeds) and the roots are the parts of the plant used in herbal remedies. An interesting fact about Nettle is that it is often referred to as \"Stinging Nettle.\" This is because the Nettle plant has \"trichomes,\" or hollow hairs, on its leaves and stem, which act like needles that inject histamine, formic acid, and other chemicals that produce a stinging sensation. If you've had the experience of walking through a meadow or trail in the woods and found yourself with a bristly rash on exposed parts of your limbs, you may have brushed up against Nettle. History of Nettle Nettle use has been recorded as far back as the Bronze Age (3000 BCE - 1200 BCE), and it is still used in herbalism today. Between 58 and 45 BCE, there are records of Nettle's stinging properties assisting Julius Caesar's troops in helping them stay awake and alert during the night.2 Aside from its use in herbal supplements, Nettle has also been popularly used as a textile. Similar to textiles made from Flax, Nettle can be made into different textures, from silky to coarse. Nettle fabric also has the ability to be dyed or bleached like cotton. It was a common household textile in Scottish households during the 16th and 17th centuries.2 And during the First and Second World Wars, Nettle fiber was used as a substitute for cotton yarns, when this material was unavailable. Because of its strong and sturdy fibers, Nettle would be a great ally if you were ever stranded in a forest, as it can be used to make natural cordage. This natural cordage could then be used to help build a shelter, start a fire, fashion clothing, make tools, and more, making it the ideal plant to have around in a survival situation. Consuming Nettle Nettle is an incredibly versatile herb. In addition to its uses in botanical formulas, cordage, and textiles, it can also be consumed. Nettle's high nutritional content and low calories have made it popular in the kitchen. Per cup, these dark, leafy greens contain 37 calories, two grams of protein, and six grams of dietary fiber. In addition, they contain more than one-third of your daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for Vitamin A, eight percent of the RDA of iron, and 42 percent of the RDA of calcium. Nettle leaves can be easily steamed and have a taste similar to spinach. When cooked, the leaves do lose their \"sting\" and turn a vibrant shade of green. You can use cooked Nettle leaves as you would any other cooked green.
