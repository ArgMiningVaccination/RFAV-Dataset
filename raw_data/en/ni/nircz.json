ABSTRAC T (Maximum 200 words) The U.S . C oast Guard proposes to increase oil spill removal c apacity (C aps) requir ements for tank vessels and m arine transportation-related (M TR) fa cilities a nd a dd requirements for ne w response tec hnologies. Five a ction alte rnatives consisting of one or increasing on-water mec hanical ation capability, establishing an on-water in situ bur n credit, and r equiring a erial tracking ca pability, a nd the no-ac alter na tive considered respe ct to their impac ts to the environme nt. The a lternatives were analyzed with scientific knowledge, litera t ure searches, modeling, r isk assessm ent and other research to determ ine their e ffects on air and water quality, biological resource s, habitats area s of spe cial concern, socioeconomics and environmental justic e, safety, and cultural r esources in six ge ogra phic Re gions of Influence (ROI) in the wa ter s of the United States and its ter ritories. Based on the analysis, the alternatives pro vide varying estimated levels of im pact, ranging from insignif ica nt to signific ant adverse impact, with ne t be nefic ial or adve rse im pacts acc or ding to differe nt regions and oil spill size s. The pre ferred alternative is to maintain mecha nical r ecovery capability, es tablish on-wa ter dispersant application c apability (a ccording to the se cond of two c he mic al dispersion options), and establish and ma intain aerial tracking c apability. 15 .

We published those regulations in 1996, requiring the owners and operators of tank vessels and MTR facilities to have certain oil spill response capabilities available by contract or other approved means. These regulations also state that we will periodically review oil removal equipment requirements to determine if increases in equipment and additional requirements for new response technologies are practicable. The USCG Response Plan Equipment Caps [capability] Review in 1999 concluded that there had been major technological advances and co nsiderable improvements in the e ffectiveness and availability of on-water mechanical oil recovery equipment. In 2000, we increased existing mechanical recovery requirements by 25 percent and bega n evaluating the potential for a dditional capabilities increases, including stockpiling dispersant and in situ burn equipment. That resulted in our proposed changes to increase the minimum available oil spill remova l equipment required for tank vessels and MTR facilities, add requirements for ne w response technologies, and clarify methods and procedures for responding to oil spills in coasta l waters (this rulemaking). We examined the feasibility of a program to implement these proposed regulations that co uld include any one or more of the following elements: increase on-water mechanical recovery equipment levels, require on-water dispersant application capability, establish on-water in situ burn credit, and require aerial tracking capability. Since the action area covers regions throughout waters of the U.S. and its territories, we prepared a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) according to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In September 2000, we published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare and circulate the Draft PEIS (DPEIS) for regulations to increase the oil spill removal capacity. We requested public input on environmental concerns related to the alternatives and suggestions regarding analyses or methodologies to include in the PEIS. We evaluated comments on the NOI and on a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), and collected input from public workshops. The information obtained from the public, in combination with Area Committee and Regional Response Team (RRT) investigations, led to our determination that mechanical recovery, in situ burning and chemical dispersion meet the criteria to increase the response plan equipment capability requirements, potentially reducing the amount of sp illed oil reaching sensitiv e marine resources. We Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -1 2009 Executive Summary then published the DPEIS and held four public hear ings in 2005. As a result of further analysis and public comments on the DPEIS, we decided not to include in situ burning or burn credits in the regulatory scheme, because allowing such a credit may reduce the amount of mechanical recovery response equipment available in areas where in-situ burn pre-authorizations are in place. Therefore, we modified DPEIS Alternative 5 to remove in situ burning, and it is the preferred alternative. We retained the original alternative, with in situ burning, as Alternative 6 for our analysis. This FPEIS describes the reasonable alternatives that were evaluated, the affected environment, and the environmental impacts associated with the alternatives on the resources analyzed. We would implement the action under the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which was modified under OPA 90 to encourage active government planning at the local and regional levels, and to develop and implement environmentally appropriate oil spill response strategies. The public raised several concerns about the DPEIS through their comments. Many of the commenters disagreed with the Coast Guard's methodology, assumptions, terminology, and conclusions, and some comments resulted in changes to the FPE IS. Some comments are also addressed in the final rule and regulatory analysis for this rulemaking. The DPEIS comments and Coast Guard's responses are in cluded in Appendix L. PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION The purpose of the propos ed action is to increase the oil remo val capability (Caps) requirements for tank vessels and MTR facilities an d thus increase the available spill removal capability for oil discharges. This action is needed to ensure the abil ity to mitigate the adverse impacts of oil spills on the environment to the extent practicable, as mandated by the Clean Water Act, by optimizing the uniform availability of oil spill response capabilities. ALTERNATIVES We identified five action alternatives for oil spill response options that meet the Purpose and Need or are required by NEPA. The alternatives are based on public input, Coast Guard experience, and evaluations by technical consultants. Options for response within each alternative include mechanical recovery equipment (containment booms and skimmers that block the spread of oil, concentrate it in one area, and physically remove it from the water surf ace); chemical dispersion, in which dispersants are applied by aircraft or vess el to break the oil into small droplets and disperse it down into the water column to rapidly dilute and naturally degrade; and in situ burning and burn credits. Alternative 1\u2014No Action Although Alternative 1 does not meet the Purpose and Need, it is required by NEPA to form the basis of a comparison for other alternatives. Under this alternative, also known as the basic response scenario, the Coast Guard would not change response plan regulations, continuing current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit for the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania regions. For the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, this alternative is the basic response scenario with or without the addition of chemical dispersion. This basic response scenario does not include aerial tracking capability. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -2 2009 Executive Summary Alternative 2\u2014Twenty-five Percent Increase in Mechanical Recovery Equipment, Plus Aerial Tracking Capability Alternative 2 would require a 25 percent increase in the amount of mechanical recovery equipment that tank vessel and MTR planholders must have available under contract to respond to an oil discharge. This alternative would also require aerial tr acking capability. Alternative 3\u2014 Twenty-five Percent Increase in Mechanical Recovery Equipment, Option A Dispersant Application Capability, In Situ Burn Credit, Plus Aerial Tracking Capability Alternative 3 would require a 25 percent increase in available mechanical recovery equipment; establish a dispersant application capability specified by Option A of Table ES-1, establish an in situ burn credit, and establish aerial tracking capability. Alternative 4\u2014 Twenty-five Percent Increase in Mechanical Recovery Equipment, Option B Dispersant Application Capability, In Situ Burn Credit, Plus Aerial Tracking Capability Alternative 4 would require a 25 percent increase in available mechanical recovery equipment; establish a dispersant application capability specified by Option B of Table ES-1; establish an in situ burn credit, and establish aerial tracking capability. Alternative 5\u2014 Preferred Alternat ive \u2014 Current Mechanical Recovery Capability, Option B Dispersant Applicatio n Capability, Plus Aerial Tracking Capability The preferred alternative would require planholders to maintain on-water mechanical recovery capability at current levels, establish a dispersant application capability specified by Option B of Table ES-1, and establish aerial tracking capability. This modifies DPEIS Alternative 5 by removing in situ burning, as a result of further analysis and in response to public comments on the DPEIS. Alternative 6\u2014Current Mechanical Recovery Capability, Option B Dispersant Application Capability, In Situ Burn Credit, Plus Aerial Tracking Capability Alternative 6 would require planholders to maintain on-water mechanical recovery capability at current levels, establish a dispersant application capability specified by Option B of Table ES-1, establish an in situ burn credit, and establish aerial tracking ca pability. This is the original alternative 5 from the DPEIS. It is retained as Alternative 6, for analysis. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -3 2009 Executive Summary Table ES-1 Tiers for Effective Daily Application of Di spersant Capability (Options A and B) under the Proposed Regulations Response Time for Completed Dispersant Applies (gal) : Oil Treated (bbl) Tier Application (hr) Gulf of Mexico Region Non-Gulf of Mexico Regions 1 Option A 12 5,500:110,000 2,750:55,000 1 Option B 12 8,250:165,000 4,125:82,500 Source: Adapted from FR 67, No. 198, October 11, 2002. Note: Gulf of Mexico region Tier 1 (Options A and B) are higher than non-Gulf of Mexico region Tier 1 (Options A and B) because of greater potential spill size and frequency in the Gulf region; it is assumed that dispersant stockpiles would be centralized in the Gulf region. The 1:20 dispersant-to-oil application ratio is a planning assumption that relies on the generally agreed on estimate of the effectiveness of current dispersant formulations. None of the alternatives would require the use of a particular technology or dictate the methods or circumstances for use of any oil spill removal tec hnology for any specific oil spill incident. That would remain the discretion of the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), in accordance with the Regional Contingency Plans an d Area Contingency Plans. Under current regulations, vessel planholders with di spersant capability and ca rrying certain oil cargoes can apply for a credit of up to 25 percent against their mechanical equipment requirements if certain requirements are met. The proposed requirement that planholders establish dispersant application capability under Alte rnatives 3, 4, and 5, and 6, however, woul d replace the existing dispersant credit provisions. AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT Alternative 1 (No Action) represents the baseline of existing conditions and current response practices by which the other alternatives are assessed. Due to the programmatic scope of th e analysis, the area of influence for this action was broken down into 6 geographic regions for impact determinations. The regions are: Alaska, Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, Oceania and Pacific (Figure ES-1). Neither this FPEIS nor the proposed regulations consider or anticipate extending the requirement s to the Great Lakes or rivers and canals. We assessed those environmental and socioeconomic conditions relevant to the project scope and programmatic-level discussion, including resources in the physical, biological, and socioeconomic environments. Since the FPEIS is programmatic, it is limited to a discussion of the general impacts resulting from implementing the action. Specific resources that were analyzed in each region were: physical environment ( coastal water quality; marine water quality; air quality); biological environment (marine mammals; marine and coastal birds; plankton and fish; threat ened, or candidate species; and subtidal habitats; sea turtles; areas of special concern; essential fish habitat); socioeconomic environment (coastal communities, demography, and employment; economic status; vessel transportation and ports; fisheries; subsistence; historic resources; recreation and tourism; and public safety and worker health). The proposed regulations apply only to waters wher e dispersant pre-authorization area agreements currently exist, which are waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore, with the exception of Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -4 2009 Executive Summary some coastal State and island Territory areas with dispersant pre-authorizati on agreements covering different distances from shore, and some states which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements. Some Pacific Territories waters where dispersant pre- authorization agreements are not currently in effect are included for completeness only, and not because we intend to apply the propos ed regulations to those areas. The proposed regulations do not affect the d ecision whether to pre-authorize the use of chemical dispersion or to authorize its use in a specific incident--those decisions pr operly remain with the local area response community and RRTs in the area at risk. Although the affected en vironment includes both nearshore and offshore areas, the PEIS emphasiz es nearshore and onshore resources, as the risk analysis shows those areas to be most vulner able to the impacts of spilled oil and response operations. Figure ES-1 Areas of Influence Considered in This PEIS Note: Map is not to scale. The areas of influence depicted in the map are the six geographic regions considered in this PEIS. In addition, the map shows the breadth of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in each region. http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES The environmental consequences (impacts) were determined for the resources discussed in the affected environment, using modeling results, risk assessment, scientific literature reviews, and qualitative analysis. The objective of the evalu ation is to compare the overall impacts of each alternative for each resource. The impacts of the alternatives are based on the application of the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -5 2009 Executive Summary response options, as well as the effects from residual oil that remains after current response practices have been applied. To make these comparisons, a standard basis was established, and a risk matrix approach was used to define levels of concern (as an indicator of significance) for the ecological effects. The levels of concern are based on the consensus of the project senior professional staff using their experience with oil spills, damage assessment studies, and local ecological risk assessments. The risk matrix (Figure ES-2) is based on an evaluation of (1) the proportion of the resource affected by the action and (2) the time for the resource to reco ver, for each ecological resource included in the model. Thus the model al so accounts for whether the impacts were judged to be short or long term. The discussion for the determinations of level of impact (insignificant, minor, moderate, and significant) is found in Chapter 4 of the EIS and the response option impacts are shown in Table ES-3. A representative area within each region was selected as the modeling area. However, in the Caribbean and Oceania regions, there was no readily available modeling data, so representative areas in other regions were used. The modeling and risk assessment focused on the direct effects of removing the spilled oil, and are based on the assumption that a spill has already occurred. Hence, the assessment of each alternative includes both the impact of the spilled oil and an y impacts caused by the response action. Potential impacts on all resources within each region are based on the analysis of three representative spill sizes: small (200 bbl), medium (2,500 bbl), and large (40,000 bbl). The determination of the severity of potential impacts under each alternative was based on the use of a concentration threshold for adverse impact: 10 g/m 2 for oiled shoreline and 0.01 g/m2 for oiled surface water (technical report , French McCay et al., 2004). On-water mechanical recovery is currently available in all regions with pre-authorization agreements. Dispersant equipment is currently approved for us e only in the Alaska and Gulf of Mexico regions. The impacts of the action alternatives are the same with or without dispersant use, except where stated otherwise. The incorporation of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil treated, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse effe cts in most scenarios. It might slightly increase the risk of oil residue sinking to the bottom, but th is residual oil is expected to have little or no adverse effect because the majority of its toxic co mponents either evaporate or are destroyed during burning. Chemical dispersion redu ces both shoreline oiling and surface- water oiling for both medium and large spills. Thus, in general, chemical dispersion will decrease the severity of social or economic effects, but this is of greatest potential benefit on a local, rather than on a regional, basis. The environmental consequences focus on the impacts that result under Alternatives 2 and 3. The action Alternative 2 is equivalent to Alternative 1, the no action alternative, from the standpoint of the oil spill fate and effects mo deling and risk assessment method ology used in our analytical approach for determining the environmental consequences, with respect to potential adverse impacts: Alternative 2 would not result in increased recovery efficiency or produce an increase in oil treated; it only increases mech anical recovery equipment, and adding more equipment will not increase the amount of oil treated (additional equipment would not increase the number of opportunities to actually use it). Alternative 3 represents Alternative s 3, 4, 5, and 6 from the standpoint of our analytical approach, with respect to potential impacts. Alternatives 3 and 4 include a 25 percent increase in available mechanical recovery equipment, but as discussed ab ove for Alternative 2, this does not result in increased efficiency or produce an increase in oil treated compared to Alternatives 5 and 6 (no increase in mechanical recovery equipment). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -6 2009 Executive Summary Regarding dispersant delivery capacity, Alternative 3 would produce an increase in oil treated compared with Alternative 2 because Alternative 3 adds dispersant application capability requirements that potentially result in treating a larger quantity of oil. For this analysis, we estimated the amount of oil that could be treated during response operations for Alternatives 3 through 6 based on Option B of Table ES-1, even though Alternative 3 requires only Option A (slightly less delivery capacity). Thus the impacts from the fate and effects model for dispersants associated with Alternatives 4, 5, and 6 are equivalent to those for Alternative 3. Th is is a conservative approach which considers the highest potential levels of exposure of affected reso urces to dispersants and th e residual dispersed oil in the water column (when compared to the no action alternative). Alternatives 5 and 6 would produce the same increase in oil treated as Alte rnative 4, with the same quantity of dispersant application equipment, but at less cost because they would maintain me chanical recove ry capability at current levels, while Alternative 4 would require a 25 percent in crease. Alternatives 3 through 6 would ensure the uniform availability of dispersant capability in the four regions (Atlantic, Caribbean, Oceania, and Pacific) where appropriate response times cannot currently be met. For the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, the dispersants impacts under Alternatives 3 through 6 are the same as those under Alternative 2, due to dispersant use, as shown in Table ES-2. Table ES-2 Response Options for Each Region under Alternative 1 Region Mechanical Recovery Chemical Dispersion Atlantic Yes No Caribbean Yes No Gulf of Mexico Yes Yes Pacific Yes No Alaska Yes Yes Oceania Yes No Source: Adapted from USCG, 2002. The potential adverse effects from mechanical recovery and dispersants include impacts from hydrocarbon emissions and impacts from operating equipment, including noise. Although the hydrocarbon emissions from dispersants would be in addition to those from the spilled oil, exposure to modern approved dispersants (which use low-toxic ity solvents and are also less volatile than spilled oil) or from equipment for dispersant delivery an d mechanical recovery is minimal relative to emissions from the spilled oil. Dispersants have the potential to liberate toxic volatile components of the oil, but most or all of these components evaporate during the few hours prior to application of dispersant. Dispersants also work synergistically to reduce the toxicity of their mixture with oil because they act to encapsulate individual oil dropl ets and disperse those dr oplets making them more bioavailable to natural occurring bacteria and less threatening to organisms. There are also concerns about overspraying dispersants beyond the area of floating oil. Appendix G addresses dispersant exposure and concludes that, while dispersants can cause adverse environmental impacts, these impacts are limited in extent, very short term, and minimal in comparison to the potential effects of the dispersed oil. The amount of dispersant is re latively small, the risk of exposure is low (if overspray is avoided), and although dispersants show a low level of toxicity in the laboratory, any dispersant that is oversp rayed is rapidly diluted to levels below toxicity. Physical damage to habitat or organisms can occur when oil recovery equipment is operated in shallow water, but is not a substantial concern in the deeper water scenarios considered here. Noise impacts from response operations are a concern ar ound sensitive organisms, particul arly marine mammals, marine and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -7 2009 Executive Summary coastal birds, and sea turtles. Mini mizing noise and dispersant exposure impacts on sensitive organisms should be addressed under Area Contingency Plans. Thus, the potential adverse impacts of dispersants and mechanical recovery are minimal or can be controlled. Potential additional impacts related to the storage and maintenance of response equipment and its actual use in training exercises are not expected to occur and are not analyzed in this FPEIS. M echanical recovery is the only response option that removes oil from the marine environment and places it under containment. Any subsequent disposal of recovered oil is subject to a controlled decision process that must meet a variety of requirements to protect the human environment; therefore any environmental consequences of the subsequent disposal are not addressed in the assessment of the alternatives. Physical Environment Potential adverse impacts of oil spills on water quality and air quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination. The water quality criterion we used for the residual of oil spills after current response practices were applied was \"volume of water contaminated,\" applying a conservative time weighted concentration, i.e., less than all established water-quality cr iteria and thresholds for effects on aquatic biota. The impacts of the action alternatives are in consideration of the residual oil remaining after the current response and cleanup ca pabilities are applied. Al ternative 3 represents Alternatives 3, 4, 5, and 6 for the impacts analysis. For water quality (coastal and marine), the alternatives would have an insignificant influence on the volume of water adversely affected. Contamination leve ls would decrease rapidly, even for the residual from large spills, due to natural dilution, evaporati on, biological processes, and recovery. Adverse impacts could be important locally in coastal waters for medium and large spills if the oil moved into shallow and confined areas under conditions where it is mixed into the water by strong turbulence or in areas where it collects for we eks to months after a spill and cu rrent response practices did not reduce it sufficiently. In marine waters that are 3 or more statute miles offs hore, natural dispersion of contamination would be very rapid after a spill, and recovery time wo uld be on the order of hours to days. The impacts on water quality (coastal and marine) from Alternative 2, based on response options, range from insignificant-advers e to moderate-beneficial. Under Alternative 3, the impacts determination includes the factor that chemical dispersion would not be a res ponse option in estuaries and coastal waters within 3 nm 1 of shore, so mechanical-only recovery would be used. If dispersants were applied offshore, the dispersed oil plume could move into nearshore areas, but the level and duration of exposure would be negligible due to dilution. Potential impacts on water quality from Alternative 3 range from insignificant-adverse to moderate-beneficial. Under Alternative 3, the volume of water contam inated by a small spill remains unchanged because dispersants could be applied only after most of the spill has already dispersed naturally. Chemical dispersion of medium or large oil spills increase s the volume of water contaminated, but does not change the level of concern. The addition of chemical dispersion would disperse some of the volatile hydrocarbons into the water; causing them to enter the atmosphere over a larg er area, further diluting their concentrations. 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorization agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, and large portions of Alas ka, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements (http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -8 2009 Executive Summary For air quality , concentrations of hydrocarbo ns of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared to air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects. Spilled oil is not a major source of air pollutants relative to other hydrocarbon sources (NRC, 2003). Except for the very largest sp ills, the presence of volatile compounds is localized and of short duration. Ten substances of possible concern to human and environmental health have been identified from in situ burning: particulates, PAHs, VOCs, dioxins and dibenzofurans, carbonyls, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, other gases (oxides of nitrogen), and \"hidden\" compounds. Although chemical disp ersion could increase soluble aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations if applied, this would occur after much of the to xic components have evaporated (more than 12 hours after a spill), so any resulting increase in concentr ations of toxic components wo uld be relatively small. The addition of chemical dispersi on would disperse some of the vo latile hydrocarbons into the water, where they would enter the atmosphere over a larger area, further diluting their concentrations in the air. Under Alternative 2, based on response options, impacts on air quality range from insignificant-adverse to minor-beneficial. The potential impacts under Alternative 3 also range from insignificant- adverse to minor-beneficial, however Alternative 5 does not include in situ burning, so its impacts range from insignificant-beneficial to minor-beneficial. Biological Environment The impacts of the action alternatives are in consideration of the residual oil remaining after the current response and cleanup capabilities are applied. Alternative 3 represents Alternatives 3, 4, 5, and 6 for the impacts analysis. Marine mammals are vulnerable to the toxic effects of spilled oil because they spend considerable time at the water's surface. The mechanical recovery and (if used) dispersant response options could reduce the amount of oil below current response levels. Potential regional impacts on both marine mammals and sea turtles under Alte rnative 2, based on response options, range from insignificant- adverse to moderate-beneficial. Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts also range from insignificant-adverse to moderate-beneficial, although the addition of chemical dispersion would reduce the amount of oil that strands onshore. Marine and coastal birds are highly susceptible to the acutely toxic effects from oil. High concentrations of birds may be found in many areas in each region. The mechanical recovery and (if used) dispersant response options could reduce the amount of oil below current response levels. Potential impacts on marine and coastal birds under Alternative 2, based on response options, range from insignificant-beneficial to moderate-beneficial. The potential impacts under Alternative 3 range from insignificant-beneficial to moderate-beneficial. However, the addition of chemical dispersion is expected to reduce the amount of oil that strands on shore in most regions, thus reducing the adverse effects on shoreline nest ing and staging areas. Plankton and fish are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. These species are adversely affected either directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column. The mechanical recovery and (if used) dispersant response options could reduce the amount of oil below current response levels , but dispersant may cause additional oil to go into the water column. Potential impacts on plankton and fish under Alternative 2, based on response options, range from insignificant-adverse to insignificant-beneficial. The potential impacts under Alternative 3 range from insignificant-adverse to minor-beneficial. Intertidal habitats can take many years to recover from a spill, especially if they are heavily oiled and are difficult to access for spill response (natural reco very often becomes the primary response). Potential regional impacts on intertidal habitats under Alternative 2, based on response options, range from Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -9 2009 Executive Summary insignificant-beneficial to minor-beneficial. The potential impacts under Alternative 3 range from insignificant-beneficial to minor-beneficial. The a ddition of chemical dispersion, which decreases the amount of oil that strands on shore, can be beneficial. Subtidal (benthic) habitats consist of the bottom substrate below the low tide level and the species that live in, on, and near the substrate. Exposure risk is primarily from sinking oil or dispersed oil that is deposited onto the ocean floor. However, substantial natural dispersion of oil and sediment into the water column occurs only during storms or from ne arshore oil spills. The potential regional impacts on subtidal habitats under Alternative 2, based on response options, are insignificant-beneficial. The potential impacts under Alternative 3 range from insignificant-beneficial to minor-beneficial. Chemical dispersion is only expected to have a minor influe nce on the adverse effects associated with subtidal habitats - although there would be an increase in the amount of oil dispersed into the water column, the available depth for mixing makes it unlikely that oil would concentrate in subtidal sediments. Areas of special concern are set aside for their uniqueness and are given particular protection. These include National Marine Sanctuaries an d National Wildlife Refuges. The risk to areas of special concern is based on the risk to intertidal habitats in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Oceania regions for small, medium, and large oil spill sizes. In the Caribbean region, the risk is based on intertidal habitats for small and large spill sizes, but on subtidal habitats for medium spill sizes. Overall, the potential risks and adverse effects associated with shoreline areas and su btidal areas of special concern are identical to those discussed for intertidal habitats and subtidal habitats, respectively. Additionally, fo r this analysis, the habitat type with the higher risk ranking is assumed to indicate the risk to areas of special concern. Thus, the potential regional impacts on shoreline areas of special concern under Alternative 2, based on response options, range from insignificant-beneficial to minor-beneficial, and under Alternative 3 also from insignificant-beneficial to minor-beneficial. The potential regional impacts on subtidal areas of special concern under Alternative 2 are insignificant-beneficial, and under Alternative 3 range from insignificant-beneficial to minor-beneficial. Each region has a variety of threatened, endangered, or candidate species , and adverse effects on these species for any spill size depe nd on location and season, and are difficult to predict. Although the overall regional risk that a threatened, enda ngered, or candidate species would be adversely affected or even present in the area of a spill is lo w, the mortality of a single individual of such a species can be considered a severe adverse effe ct. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, or fish that are threatened, endangered, or candidate species are identical to those discussed in the preceding paragraphs regard ing those species resources. For this analysis, the resource with the highest risk ra nking was used as a conservative estimate of the potential adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species: the risk to marine and coastal birds in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Oceania regions and the risk to marine mammals and marine and coastal birds for the Pacific region. The risk to threatened, en dangered, or candidate species of sea turtles is discussed in Chapter 3. Potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, or candidate species under Alternative 2, based on response options, range from insignificant-beneficial to moderate-beneficial. Potential regional impacts on threatened, endangered, or candidate species under Alternative 3 also range from insignificant-beneficial to moderate-beneficial. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse effects by reducing the amount of oil that strands onshore and the amount of floating oil. No additional risk from chemical dispersion is expected for fish. Virtually all waters in each region are considered essential fish habitat (EFH) . Areas such as bays, river mouths, and harbors are designated EFH for at least one life stage of at least one species and are protected by legislation. The primary issue with respect to EFH is either (1) exposure of sensitive resources in the water column to hydrocarbon concentrations of concern, or (2) the contamination of bottom sediments, both of which could lead to either acute or chronic exposures. Adverse effects Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -10 2009 Executive Summary would include either the death of individual orga nisms, the possibility of sublethal effects on long- term population viability, and degradation of habita t that reduces its availab ility to managed species. For this analysis, the risk to EFH is assumed to be defined by the risk to plankton and fish or to subtidal habitat, whichever is greater; specifically, the analysis was on the ri sk to plankton and fish and to subtidal habitats for the Atlantic and Cari bbean regions, and to pl ankton and fish for the Pacific and Oceania regions. The potential region al impacts on EFH under Alternative 2, based on response options, range from insignificant-beneficial to moderate-beneficial. Potential regional adverse impacts on EFH under Alternative 3 range from insignificant-beneficial to moderate-beneficial. With the addition of chemical dispersion, there would be an increase in the proportion of the water column exceeding 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons. This is expected to have a minor influence on the adverse effects associated with EF H because the proposed regulations apply only to waters with established pre-authorization agreement areas where chemical dispersion is allowed because prevailing depth and hydrod ynamic conditions provide reason able dilution over a shorter distance. Socioeconomic Environment The impacts of the action alternatives are in consideration of the residual oil remaining after the current response and cleanup capabilities are applied. Alternative 3 represents Alternatives 3, 4, 5, and 6 for the impacts analysis. Oil spills can produce a variety of adverse soci al and economic effects that are generally not substantial at the regional level, but instead are typically felt in communities located near resources oiled by the spill. The analysis used for socioeconomic impacts ev aluates the effects of the alternative response capabilities based on the risk of adverse effects on various aspects of the socioeconomic environment rather than changes in monetary benefits. This incremental change analysis assumes that the risk to the socioeconomic environment posed by oil is directly relate d to the extent to which coastal resources are oiled above selected thresholds of concern, and assesses the economic and social effects of enhanced spill response in terms of the degree of risk posed to economic and social factors. The analysis generates estimates of the degree of risk reduction achieved. The environmental impacts for most of the socioeconomic resources are the same for Alternatives 2 and 3. The exception is subsistence, for which the im pacts in each region for Alternative 3 are slightly different from those of Alternative 2. However, th e range of impacts for both resource areas remains the same. The potential regional impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment and economic status under Alternatives 2 and 3 for small, me dium, and large spill sizes range from insignificant-beneficial to moderate-beneficial. On average, under both Alternatives 2 and 3, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized. The overall impacts from the response options in the action alternatives are likely to be insignificant to moderate beneficial. For vessel transportation and ports , oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore are not likely to cause substantial adverse effects, and any adverse effects would likely be of short duration. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commerce if it occurs in or around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on wa tercraft movement as a means of facilitating spill response. The overall impacts from the response options in the action alternatives are likely to be insignificant- beneficial. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -11 2009 Executive Summary Historic resources are likely to be found in each region. Historic properties and sites can be located on land or near the shoreline and may be protected from oiling by bulwarks or other barriers, or can be submerged archaeological sites or other historic sites that may consist of shipwrecks, The underwater properties and sites may or may not be well preserved due to strong currents and wave action, or may be buried under sediments and coral formations. Mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline. The overall impacts from the response options in the action alternatives are likely to be in the range of insignificant-adverse to insignificant-beneficial. The recreation and tourism assets of coastal communities can be adversely affected by oil spills, both directly and indirectly. For example, visitors may be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill. The recreational assets vary by region and include parks, seashores, beaches, recreational fishing areas, and scenic vistas. The overall impacts from the response options in the action alternatives are likely to be insignificant-adverse to moderate-beneficial. Potential adverse effects on public health and worker safety are defined as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill. In each region, there are areas with high population concentrations along the coast. However, adve rse effects on public safety from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore for any of the spill sizes considered are un likely, regardless of the response options. Potential adverse effects on worker he alth are related to direct exposure to oil during response operations, including inhala tion of fumes, and operating oil sp ill response equipment. The risk increases as the spill size and the co rresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. The overall impacts from the response options in the action alternatives are likely to be insignificant- adverse to moderate-beneficial. Overall, the potential regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports, historic resources, recreation and tourism, and public health and worker safety in each region under Alternatives 2 and 3 are expected to be insignificant-adverse to moderate-beneficial. Commercial and recreational fisheries are vulnerable to oil spills because of both closures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operati ons in the wake of an oil spill can lead to considerable revenue losses for the commercial fish ing and related industries . For both Alternatives 2 and 3, any adverse impacts are expected to be loca lized\u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. The overall impacts from the response options in the action alternatives are likely to be insignificant-adverse to moderate-beneficial. Subsistence use of marine species is especially important in the Pacific, Alaska, and Oceania regions, where there is a traditional use of these resources. A particular effect from oil spills would be tissue tainting. The overall impacts from the response options in the action alternatives are likely to be insignificant-adverse to moderate-beneficial.

COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES AND CONCLUSIONS The action alternatives have varying potential beneficial or adverse impacts on environmental and socioeconomic resources, ranging from insignificant to moderate, depending on the resource and oil spill response options, in consideration of the resi dual oil remaining after the current response and cleanup capabilities are applied. The impacts are summarized in Table ES-3. An assessment of the beneficial or adverse impacts of a particular response alternative can be determined by comparing the effects of oil spill response options on a particular resource under that alternative to those impacts under the no action alternative, Alternative 1, the difference being the net environmental impact, which is an indication of the beneficial or adverse impacts of a particular response option. Based on the modeling and risk assessment methodology, the potential adverse impacts on environmental resources from the action alternatives, with the exception of Alternative 2, are less than impacts from Alternative 1, while the socioeconomic resource impacts for both are similar. The areas of greatest environmen tal impact identified in the FPE IS for oil spill response options under Alternative 2 are: to water quality; marine ma mmals; marine and coastal birds; areas of special concern; endangered species / essential fish habitat; coastal communities, demography, and employment; economic status; fisherie s; subsistence; recreation and tourism; and public safety and worker health. Those impacts are all moderately beneficial. The adve rse impacts for oil spill response options under Alternative 2 are all insignificant. For Alternatives 2 - 5 the beneficial impacts of the oil spill response options increase from insignificant beneficial to minor beneficial for plankton and fish; intertidal habitats and subtidal habitats. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil ES -13 2009 Executive Summary While the analysis shows that mechanical recovery can provide some environmental benefits, there is still the potential for oil spills to cause signific ant adverse impacts on physical, biological, and socioeconomic resources. Overall, the analysis sh ows that the uniform availability of dispersant capability has the potential to provide additional pr otection to certain biological and socioeconomic resources, including sensitive resources that recover relatively slowly such as intertidal habitats, sea turtles, and marine and coastal birds. Alternative 5 is the USCG's preferred alternative because of its increased effectiveness in removing or treating spilled oil, based on an examination of historical oil spill data (USCG, 1999)). Alternative 5 meets our objectives to increa se the response plan equipmen t capability requirements for tank vessels and MTR facilities at reasonable cost and with substantial benefit. This alternative would produce the same increase in the amount of oil treated as Alternatives 3, 4, and 6 because it requires the same quantity of dispersant application equipmen t. Since the increase in mechanical recovery equipment (under Alternatives 2, 3, and 4) would not increase the quantity of oil removed or treated, requiring those additional capabilities does no t offset the costs incurred in establishing and maintaining them. The net adverse and beneficial impacts depend on the size and location of the oil spill, and the effectiveness of the response option used. Alternatives 2 through 6 ar e compared to Alternative 1 to ascertain the net adverse or beneficial impacts of each alternative. For example, an improvement in the level of concern from a significant adverse impact to a minor adverse impact indicates that the response option employed had a net beneficial impact on re ducing the adverse impact of the oil spill. Net Beneficial Impacts A net beneficial impact occurs under Alternatives 3 through 6 (which would ensure the uniform availability of dispersant capability in each region). Net Adverse Impacts The adverse impacts from the oil spill response alternatives on residual oil that remains after current response practices have been applied were determined to be at the insignificant level for the action alternatives. National Net Beneficial and Adverse Impacts of the Alternatives Oil spill impacts on U.S. waters are mostly localized and generally short lived; therefore, the potential benefits associated with a reduction in oil spill im pacts would also be localized and short lived. The national-level impacts are extrapolated from the regional-level findings. Any change in the net beneficial or adverse impact levels can be attributed to a particular region and are expected to be localized; therefore, national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Cumulative Impacts Cumulative Impacts to all environm ents and resources: The action alternatives for oil spill response in this PEIS would be expected to result in insign ificant cumulative beneficial impacts to the physical environment; biological resources; coastal, aqu atic and marine resource s; and socioeconomic resources in the United States.

Final PEIS for Mechanical Recovery and Alternative Removal Technologies ES -15 CHAPTER 1 PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR THE PROPOSED ACTION 1.1. I NTRODUCTION Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Public Law 101-380) and Executive Order 12777 (\"Implementation of Section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution C ontrol Act of October 18, 1972, as amended, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990,\" 56 FR 5457), the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is authorized to issue regulations requiring the owners and operators of tank vessels and marine transportation-related (MTR) facilities to prepare and submit response plans. In 1996, the USCG published final tank vessel and MT R facility response plan regu lations (33 CFR parts 155 and 154, respectively). These regulations contai n requirements for on-water oil removal 1 capacity that planholders transporting or transferring petroleum oil are required to meet in planning for an oil discharge. These regulations also state that the USCG period ically will review the existing response plan equipment capabilities requirements to determine if increases in mech anical recovery systems, plus additional requirements for ne w response technologies, are pr acticable. In 1999, the USCG completed an in-depth Response Plan Equipment Caps Review , and subsequently increased existing mechanical recovery requi rements by 25 percent, ef fective April 5, 2000 (65 FR 710). This review also concluded that the USCG should begin another regulatory project to evaluate additional increases in on-water mechanical recovery and new requirements for other response technologies. 1 The term \"remove\" or \"removal\" is used throughout the PEIS as it is defi ned by section 311(a)(8) of the Clean Water Act, and refers to containment and removal of oil from the water and shorelines or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary to minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, public and private property, and shorelines and beaches) or to the environment. While the use of dispersants, which break an oil slick into small droplets that then disperse into the water column, renders further manual removal attempts infeasible, the use of dispersants increases the opportunity for the oil to undergo natural bioremediation. Th e terms \"removal\" and \"treatment\" are used interchangeably throughout this PEIS. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 1-1 2009 1. Purpose of and Need for the Proposed Action Preliminary scoping indicates that there may be both beneficial and adverse effects to the environment. The USCG believes the effects on the environment, as a whole, will be significantly beneficial. However, the implementing regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ's) National Envi ronmental Policy Act of Law 91-190, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) state that a significant environmental impact may exist even if an agency believes that the net balance of environmental effects are beneficial. Therefore, the USCG has decided to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). The PEIS for developing these proposed regulations will examine the possible impacts to the environment on the regional and national levels. In addition, the PEIS will be limited in scope to a discussion of the general impacts resulting from implementing the action, and will be prepared in accordance with (1) NEPA, (2) CEQ's \"Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA\" (40 CFR part 1500), and (3) USCG's NEPA procedures and policies (COMDTINST M16475.1D, \"National Environmen tal Policy Act Implementing Procedures and Policy for Considering Environmental Impacts\"). 1.2. P URPOSE OF PROPOSED ACTION The purpose of the propos ed action is to increase the oil removal capability (Caps) requirements for tank vessels and MTR facilitie s and thus, increase the availabl e spill removal capability for oil discharges. 1.3. N EED FOR PROPOSED ACTION One of the USCG's primary missions is protection of the marine environment, including implementing a variety of oil pollution prevention, preparedness, and response strategies, as mandated by OPA 90 and other statutes. In carrying out this responsibility, the USCG promulgated regulations (33 CFR parts 155 and 154) requiring the owners an d operators of tank vessels and MTR facilities to have certain oil sp ill response equipment available by contract or other approved means. Based on a review of th ose regulations (USCG, 1999), and adoption of regional and local area pre-authorization agreements for chemical dispersion and in situ burning and in accordance with the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) (40 CFR part 300), the USCG must examine the prac ticability of the pr oposed regulations that could do any one of, or a combination of, the following: Increase on-water mechanical recovery equipment levels Require on-water dispersant application capability Establish in situ burn credit Require aerial tracking capability. The need for this action is to ensure the ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of oil spills on the environment to the greatest extent practicable, as mandated by the Clean Water Act, by optimizing the uniform availability of oil spill res ponse capabilities. The need for this action is further outlined below. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 1-2 2009 1. Purpose of and Need for the Proposed Action 1.3.1. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 This public law was enacted in response to the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill in Alaska and other oil spills. One of the important goals of OPA 90 was to increase overall spill response capability in the United States. The USCG was one of several agencies tasked with implementing OPA 90. The USCG must monitor and oversee the oil transportation industry's capability to respond to oil pollution incidents from vessels and facilities engaged in transport of oil by water. To implement OPA 90, the USCG promulgated regulations that require vessels and facilities to develop plans describing how they will resp ond to an oil pollution incident, including a worst case oil discharge. In addition, OPA 90 requires changes in the National Response System (NRS) (described in 40 CFR part 300), including the establis hment of Area Committe es. In cooperation with existing Regional Response Teams (RRTs), Area Committees were tasked with determining potential oil spill risks and devising strategies to mitigate oil spills in the most environmentally protective manner practicable. 1.3.2. Regulatory Requirements In response to the OPA 90 mandates, the USC G published response plan regulations as Interim Final Rules on February 5, 1993 (for tank vessels, 58 FR 7376; for MTR facilities, 58 FR 7330) and as Final Rules on January 12, 1996 for tank vessels (33 CFR part 155) and on February 29, 1996 for MTR facilitie s (33 CFR part 154). The goal of these regulations was to ensure prompt response to and clean up of oil discharged anywhere within U.S. waters. The regulations required vessel and MTR facility pl anholders to have available, by contract or other approved means, mech anical recovery equipment suit able for removing spilled oil from the environment. In establishing mechanical recovery equipment standards, the USCG recognized that there were technological as well as availability limits on mechanical recovery equipment. Therefore, the regulations established requirements for equipment capabilities in response plans regarding the am ount of mechanical recovery resources that planholders were required to ensure were available. The regulations did not impose capability requirements to employ alternatives such as dispersants and in situ burning because of the lack of availability. However, the regulations did allow certain planholders to apply for a reduction in the amount of required mechanical recovery equipment if the planholders could establish a dispersant capability based on certain conditions. These conditions were proven to be too restrictive, and no planholder applied for the \"dispersant mechanical recovery offset.\" The regulations recognized that changes in technology, equipment availability, and general acceptance of certain alternative technologies might occur over time. Therefore, the regulations required the USCG to review the original response plan equipment capabilities requirements to determine whet her the mechanical recovery capabilities should be increased and whether other response technologies in addition to mechanical recovery were practicable. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 1-3 2009 1. Purpose of and Need for the Proposed Action 1.3.3. Response Plan Equipment Caps Review In conducting the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), the USCG evaluated improvements in te chnology, availability, and general acceptance of mechanical recovery equipment and other response technologies. As a result, existing on-water mechanical recovery requirements increased by 25 percen t, effective April 5, 2000 (65 FR 710). The review also concluded that there have been sufficient improvements in these areas to initiate a new regulatory project. The new regulatory project would aim at increasing oil removal capacity even further, thus ensuring that planholders have ev en better capabilities available to respond to oil discharges in the future. 1.3.4. National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan The NCP was modified in accordance with OPA 90 mandates to encourage more active government planning at the local and regional levels, and focused on developing and implementing environmentally appropriate oil spill response strategies. Specifically, the NCP directs Area Committees and RRTs to consider, as part of their planning activities, the desirability of using other response technologies in addi tion to mechanical recovery. The NCP also directs that the employed re sponse technologies are those that best minimize the overall impact to the environment. 1.3.5. Pre-Authorization Agreements In carrying out the NCP mandates, Area Committees and RRTs around the country have engaged in intensive examination of the envi ronmental tradeoffs involved in responding to oil spills using mechanical recovery, dispersants, and in situ burning. Based on local and regional environmental evaluations, almost every coastal Area Committee and RRT has adopted dispersant and in situ burn pre-authorization agreemen ts for oil spill response. All these agreements are limited in geographic extent and conditions for use, and were developed and approved through a concurrence of appropriate federal and state natural resource trustees. The general acceptance of these response options imposes on the USCG the responsibility to ensure these options' availability in the event of a spill incident where their actual use may provide environmental benefit. 1.4. S COPE OF THIS PEIS The PEIS for developing the pr oposed regulations will examine the possible impacts to the environment on the regional and national levels and will be limited in scope to a discussion of the general impacts resulting from im plementing these pro posed regulations. The PEIS will also serve to encourage public involvement and to address agency and public concerns. The proposed action could potentially affect all areas in which oil spill response operations could occur, including marine waters of the U.S. Exclus ive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the coasts of the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. The proposed regulations only apply to waters where dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore with the exception of several areas with dispersant pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef <20 ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, and large portions Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 1-4 2009 1. Purpose of and Need for the Proposed Action of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements2. The underlying rationale for the establishment of dispersant pre-au thorization agreements for waters closer than 3 nm from shore is the ability of the environment in these locations to provide reasonable dilution over a shorter distance due to depth and hydrod ynamic conditions. This PEIS also addresses waters where dispersant pre-authoriz ation agreements are not currently in place\u2014 American Samoa, Guam, and Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). These non -pre-authorization agreement areas are included for completeness, and their inclusion does not signify intent to apply the proposed regulations to those areas. In addition although the Notice of Proposed Rule-Making (NPRM) (67 FR 63331, October 11, 2002) states that the al ternatives will address the inland operating environment, this PEIS does not consider the inland operating environment because there are currently no dispersant pre-authorization agreem ents for the inland operating environment. If dispersant pre-authorizat ion agreements are adopted for the inla nd operating environment (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [USEPA] has pr imary responsibility for deciding whether a dispersant pre-authorizati on agreement is appropriate in this operating environment), a supplemental NEPA process would be extended to this operating environment. The decision whether to pre - authorize the use of chemical dispersion and in situ burning or to authorize their use in a specific incident is unaffected by these proposed regulations and this PEIS . Those decisions properly remain within the purview of the local area response community and the RRTs in the area at risk. The baseline environment, to which the alternatives are applied, includes the spilled oil. Since the response alternatives \u2014on-water mechanical recovery, on-water in situ burning, and on-water chemical dispersion \u2014are only applied after there has been an oil spill, the assessment of each alternative includes both the impact of the spilled oil and any impacts caused by the response action. The scope of the PEIS will include a description of the proposed action and the environmental impacts associated with its possible implementation. The PEIS for developing these proposed regulations will examine the possible impacts to the environment on the regional and national levels. Only those environmental and socioeconomi c conditions relevant to the project scope and programmatic-level discussion will be assessed, including resources in the ph ysical, biological, and socioeconomic environments . 1.5. O RGANIZATION OF THIS PEIS Chapter 1 Purpose of and Need for the Proposed Action is a NEPA-required discussion and action overview. It also describes th e PEIS content, approach, and scope. Chapter 2 Alternatives describes oil spill response strate gies, the alternative development process, public involvement, alternatives cons idered in this PEIS including the no action alternative and the preferred alternative, historical spill data, mitigation for the adverse potential environmental impacts associated with a spill, the environmental legal framew ork applicable to oil spill response operations, and the Endanger ed Species Act Section 7 consultation. 2 http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 1-5 2009 1. Purpose of and Need for the Proposed Action Chapter 3 Affected Environment , also known as the environmental setting, provides a general description of existing conditions or resources for analysis that might be affected by the action in the areas of influence and a brief discussion of the resources dismissed from further analysis. Chapter 4 Environmental Consequences identifies the consequences of oil spills and on-water response options of the proposed alternatives to each resource in the physical, biological, and socioeconomic environments. Direct and indirect impacts are identified on the broad regional and national scales as appropriate in this PEIS, along with a comparison of the alternatives, unavoidable adverse impacts of the proposed action, irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources, relationship between the short-term use of man's environment, and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity and cumulative impacts. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 1-6 2009 CHAPTER 2 ALTERNATIVES 2.1. I NTRODUCTION This chapter summarizes the fate and effects of oil spills in ocea n ecosystems; reviews different response technologies1 available to minimize the effects of those spills; examines the way in which these technologies alter that fate; and briefly desc ribes oil spill response effo rts. This chapter also discusses how the response alternatives were selected and reviews those alternatives that are effective, practicable, and retained for detailed analysis in this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). In addition, this chapter discusses response alternatives considered but eliminated from further analysis. Historical oil sp ills are analyzed to provide information regarding the potential use of the pr oposed alternatives for future oil spill incidents. The proposed alternatives would require the inclusion of equipment and logistics planning for chemical dispersion, in situ burning, and aerial tracking in spill response plans by establishing a requirement whereby the regulated planholders would be required to have oil resp onse capability available based on a combination of mechanical recovery, chemical dispersion, and in situ burn techniques. However, the proposed alternatives would not require the actual use of any particular response alternative, nor would they dictate the circumstances under which a specific oil spill response strategy should be us ed for an oil spill incident. Th e actual use of the response mechanisms would continue to be at the discretion of the Federal On-Scene Coordinators (FOSCs) in accordance with the guidelines fo r considering spill response alternatives that are outlined in Regional Contingenc y Plans (RCPs) and local Area Contingency Plans (ACPs), both of which are developed under the National Oil an d Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP).

Regional and local representatives of federal, st ate, and local environmental and response agencies, with full participation of potentially affected communities, prepare RCPs/ACPs.

The FOSC and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regional representative with jurisdiction over the incident, in consultation with the affected state(s) and the federal natural resource trustees, must approve the potential use of chemical dispersion and in situ burning for a given spill incident. Oil spill response decisionmakers \u2014federal, state, and local government agencies; oil-transportation and -handling industries; the oil spill response in dustry; environmental and other public interest groups; and the general public \u2014are commonly referred to as the local response community. Oil spilled in the marine enviro nment (see Append ix B) can result in a variety of adverse environmental impacts. The main objective of o il spill response technologies is to reduce and mitigate these adverse impacts on marine ecosys tems. Careful consideration of environmental tradeoffs and the selection of appropriate response options through the required planning process will have a positive environmental impact when compared with the impacts associated with an untreated oil spill. A primary objective of the pollution response planning requirements is to ensure the availability of the most favorable response technique based on operational, weather, logistical, and ecological concerns to mitigate or to minimize the environmental impact of the spill. 2.2. O VERVIEW OF OIL SPILL RESPONSE STRATEGIES There are five major response options to oil spills: On-water mechanical recovery On-water chemical dispersion On-water in situ burning Shoreline cleanup and other countermeasures Natural removal (no cleanup action). Other options \u2014including gelling agents and enhanced bioremediation \u2014are less widely used or have major limitations. In determining th e best possible response option for a specific situation, availability and applicability must be carefu lly weighed against potential envi ronmental damage and potential removal success. As mentioned in Section 2.1, selectin g the response option to be used for a specific oil spill event is at the discretion of the local resp onse community, who has the responsibility for considering which option or combination of options provides the largest benefit and is the most effective in minimizing potential environmental impacts. This process requires appropriately trained personnel who are familiar with each strate gy's application, benefits, and tradeoffs. 2.2.1. On-Water Mechanical Recovery The primary tools for mechanical recovery includ e barriers (booms) to contain and divert oil, and skimmers to recover or remove the contai ned oil from the water's surface. Containment booms concentrate spilled oil and divert it to skimmers for collection. They are typically constructed of an oil-resistant polymer, and cons ist of a flotation chamber that floats on the water surface and a weighted \"ski rt\" that extends down into the water. Since oil usually floats on the water's surface, the chamber and the skirt trap the oil when the oil encounters the barrier, while the water flows un der the skirt. Deployment of containment barriers is typically done from boats, and, depending on water depth and current conditions, barriers may be held in place by anchors placed on the bottom, along the shoreline, or by the vessels from Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-2 2009 2. Alternatives which they are deployed. Skimmers, on the other hand, are mechanical devices that are set to operate on the surface of the water in the oil water interface zone. Primary mechanisms for skimmers include gravity feed; suction; or oil ad hesion to a rope, mat, or belt. Once oil is collected in the skimmer, it is transferred to a temporary storage device for shipment to shore for recycling or disposal; thus, skimmers usua lly require pumps and hoses for oil transfer. Some dedicated skimmers are built into the hulls of oil spill response vessels, and many require one or more support ve ssels to hold them on station at the apex of containment booms. Storage devices usually include floating oil storage bladders, tank barges, or tank ships designed to carry oil. The rate at which oil can be collected (encounter) in open-water, offshore operations is a function of relative speed of advance through an oil slick (generally 1 kt or less) and sweep width of the boom/sk immer combination. Collection rates generally decrease with increasing sea s tates. Depending on boom characte ristics, sea states of 3 to 4 (waves 4 to 8 ft) generally re present the upper limits of boom effectiveness (USCG, 1999). Mechanical recovery as a response to an o il spill does not require the establishment of a pre-authorization agreement. As stated in 33 CFR 153.305(c), mechanical recovery is a default response option for mitigating adverse impacts of an oil spill when authorized by the FOSC. 2.2.2. On-Water Chemical Dispersion The objective of chemical dispersion is to tr ansform oil slicks floating on the surface of the water into tiny oil droplets that are \"dispersed\" throughout the water column. The primary tools for effective chemical dispersion in response to an oil spill include sufficient quantity of a dispersant, appropriate application tools, and capability to monitor the effectiveness of the dispersant. Dispersant application tools include spray booms and nozzles fitted to fixed-wing aircraft or wate rborne vessels, fire monitors on waterborne vessels, and specially designed dispersant buckets carried underneath helicopters. Dispersant delivery aircraft may range in size from small, single-engine helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft to large multiengine carg o aircraft. Monitoring may be visual or may involve electronic monitoring devices as determined necessary by the responders. In marine waters, application by aircraft is often preferred to application by vessel since aircraft traveling in excess of 100 kt can cover a much larger area than a vessel, which is typically limited to speeds of 5 kt or less. The effectiveness of dispersant application is limited by environmental conditions such as fog, darkness, and high winds, so trained personnel and specially outfitted aircraft or vessels are necessary to ensure effective application. Chemical dispersion may be an appropriate response alternative in treating 2 oil on the water surface in an effort to redu ce or prevent damage to marine life (including birds, mammals, and other natural resources), fouling of shorelines and boats, and contamination of drinking water supplies. Effective chemical dispersion requires that the wa ter, into which the oil is dispersed, is sufficiently deep and has sufficient mixing energy to dilute or reduce the volume of oil in the water column to a level that does not produce a significant ecological effect. If the oil 2 The terms \"removal\" and \"treatment\" are used interchangeably throughout this PEIS. The term \"remove\" or \"removal\" is used throughout the PEIS as it is defined by section 311(a)(8) of the Clean Water Act, and refers to containment and removal of oil from the water and shorelines or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary to minimize or mitigate damage to the public h ealth or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, public and private property, and sho relines and beaches) or to the environment. While the use of dispersants, which break an oil slick into small droplets that then disperse i nto the water column, renders further manual removal attempts infeasible, the use of dispersants increases the opportunity for the oil to undergo natural bioremediation. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-3 2009 2. Alternatives is dispersed in a small volume of water with poor circulation, there could be an increase in adverse ecological impacts. Chemical disper sion effectiveness\u2014th e percentage of spilled oil that can be dispersed\u2014depends on a number of factors, including the type of oil, the time the oil has been in the water, and weather conditions. In general, oils that are recoverable using mechanical recovery are also chemically dispersible. However, chemical dispersion is only effective during the first 1 to 3 days of the spill, since after that time period the oil becomes too viscous and/or emulsi fied for the dispersants to be effective. Dispersant application requirements are base d on 3 tiers for effective daily application capability, which consist of response times (12, 36 and 60 hours respectively) for completed application. The requirements assume 12 hours of daylight in each tier period as a planning standard, not a performance standard. The 12 hour assumption permits practical planning for an oil spill; however seas onal variance should be taken into account during actual response operations. \"Effectiveness monitoring\" prov ides a qualitative indicator of how much oil is being dispersed by monitoring oil c oncentrations in the water column . The Special Monitoring of Applied Response Technologies (SMART) protocol 3, which was developed by the USCG, USEPA, National Oceanic and At mospheric Administration (NOAA), and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as NRT me mbers, provides criteria and guidelines for monitoring both chemical dispersion and in situ burning during spill response operations. SMART relies on small, highly mobile teams to deploy to the scene of dispersant applications or in situ burn operations. Monitoring teams collect real-time data using portable, rugged, and easy-to-use instruments, and channel the data to the Unified Command (UC), a group made up of representatives from th e USCG, the state, and the responsible party. The monitoring data provided by these teams assist the UC in answering the following critical questions: When dispersants are used, are the disper sants effective in dispersing the oil? When in situ burning is used, are particulate co ncentration trends exceeding the level of concern? Dispersants must be listed on the NCP Product Schedule, which is maintained by the USEPA, before they can be used in the United States4. Criteria for listing a product on the NCP Product Schedule are contained in the NCP. This includes submission by the manufacturer of toxicity and effectiveness test data to the USEPA. The FOSC and the USEPA regional representative with jurisdiction over the incident, in consultation with the affected state(s) and the federal natural resource trustees, must approve the application of dispersants before their potential use. The NCP authorizes and encourages the ACP process to include completion of USEPA and state approvals and consultation with the appropriate federal and state authorities responsible for managing natural resources in advance through a pre-authorization agreement that defines the conditions and restrictions placed on the FOSC for ma king a dispersant use decision. The NCP prescribes that these pre-authorization agr eements allow the FOSC to approve incident- specific chemical dispersion without additional consultation. The reason for establishing pre-authorization agreement areas is to allow timely and, therefore, more efficient dispersion of oil. The timely application of dispersants can reduce spreading of oil on the water surface, thus reducing or eliminating shoreline impacts where the majority of 3 http://response.restoration.noaa. gov/oilaids/SMART/SMART.html 4 Currently there are thirteen different dispersants with vary ing toxicity and efficacy values on the NCP Product Schedule. More information can be found at www.epa.gov/oilspill under NCP Product Schedule and Notebook. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-4 2009 2. Alternatives threatened, endangered, or ca ndidate species exist and where human use is high, and reducing impacts to species that are highly susceptible to oiling (e.g., marine and coastal birds). Current dispersant pre-authorization agreements around the country generally extend seaward from 3 nm from shore with the exception of several areas that have dispersant pre-authorization agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or re ef, if reef <20 ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements 5 (Figure 2.2-1). The underlying rational e for the establishment of dispersant pre-authorization agreements for waters closer than 3 nm from shore is the ability of the environment in these locations to provide reasonable dilution over a shorter distance due to depth and hydrodynamic conditions. This PE IS also addresses waters where dispersant pre-authorization agreements are not currently in place \u2014American Samoa, Guam, and Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). 5 http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-5 2009 2.

For regional information, see Appendix C. Note: Map is not to scale. 2.2.3. On-Water In Situ Burning The primary tools for in situ burning include barriers (booms) to contain and concentrate oil, and a means to ignite the oil and sustain the burn. In situ burn containment barriers are similar in design and function to those used fo r mechanical recovery, except that they are constructed of fireproof or fire-resistant materials. This is important to note from a practical standpoint, because it means that in situ burn containment barriers are subject to all the same operational limitations discussed for mechanical recovery containment barriers. For example, containment booms usually become ineffective in currents in excess of 1 kt and in waves in excess of 3 to 4 ft. It can also be inferred that the initial number of incidents where in situ burning and mechanical recovery are viable as response options is identical. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-6 2009 2. Alternatives Oil is gathered in the containment barrier's chamber and trapped in the skirt, while water flows under the skirt. Because of the size an d weight of the boom, deployment is typically done from large boats operating in tandem. Once the oil is contained, it is ignited with an ignition device, typically a helitorch delivered by a helicopter. The burn is allowed to continue for as long as ignition can be sustained inside the boom; the fire goes out almost immediately if the containment boom is breached or remo ved. Most of the oil within the boom is consumed in the fire and is converted to smoke and ash that is carried away by the prevailing winds. In situ burning can result in the production of a significant smoke plume that contains particulate matter, which may be harmful to human health and safety. Appropriate precautions must be taken to ensure that smok e plumes will not affect responders and/or the general public. Some small portion of the oil \u2014approximately less than 10 percent \u2014usually will not burn (Allen, 19906) and will remain on the water surface as residue that must be collected by mechanical means and disposed of onshore. Some studies have shown, however, that oil residue from ce rtain types of oil will sink when burned (Buist and Trudel, 1995). Effectiveness monitoring, carried out for the same purpose as for dispersants, is done visually from spotter aircraft or surface vessels, and is further enhanced through specialized electronic detection devices. In addition, similar to chemical dispersion, in situ burning is significantly more effective on recently spilled oil; oil that has been in the water for more than 3 or 4 days typically does not contain enough volatile hydrocarbons to sustain an effective burn. In situ burning could be an appropriate response alternative for removing oil from the water surface in an effort to reduce or prevent damage to marine life and other natural resources, as well as to prevent fouling of shorelines and boats and contamination of drinking water supplies. In marine waters, it can potentially be used to supplement mechanical recovery when capacity to st ore oil recovered by skimmers is limited. In situ burning is especially beneficial as a response tool in treating oil trapped in icebound waters where conventional mechanical recovery methods are rendered ineffective because of the ice. In general, in situ burning is as effective as mech anical recovery since they both depend on boom effectiveness. The FOSC and the USEPA regional representative with jurisdiction over the incident, in consultation with the affected state(s) and the federal natural resource trustees, must approve the potential use of in situ burning for a given spill in cident. The NCP authorizes and encourages the ACP process to include completion of USEPA and state approvals and consultation with the appropriate federal and state authorities responsible for managing natural resources in advance through an in situ burn pre-authorization agreement that defines the conditions and restrictions placed on the FOSC for making a decision. The NCP prescribes that these pre- authorization agreements allow the FOSC to approve incident-specific in situ burning without additional consultation. Current in situ burn pre-authorization agreements are in place in every region of the country and are generally restricted to waters of at least 3 nm from shore (Figure 2.2-2). In no case does the NCP or a pre-authorization agreement empower any responsible party to use in situ burning without the incident-specific permission and oversight of the FOSC. Figure 2.2-2 Summary of In Situ Burn Pre-Authorization Agreements, 2004 6 Tests were conducted and reported on during the EXXON VALDEZ spill, in which a controlled test burn was conducted on 15,000 to 30,000 gal of Prudhoe Bay crude oil. After the bu rn approximately 300 gal of taffy-like oil clods remained. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-7 2009 2.

For regi onal information, see Appendix C. Note: Map is not to scale. 2.2.4. Shoreline Cleanup and Other Countermeasures Shoreline cleanup and other countermeasures include other chemical and biological countermeasures that enhance the removal proces s. Specifically, these include dispersants, surface-washing agents, surface-collecting agents, bioremediation, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents. Prior to using these countermea sures, chemicals are subject to USEPA review and listing on the NCP Product Schedule, and must be approved by the FOSC, USEPA, and affected state(s) in consultation wi th the natural resource trustees. Herding agents push or compress oil on the wate r surface and can direct the movement of oil to produce a thick oil film and enhance recove ry. Emulsion-treating agents include emulsion inhibitors that prevent the formation of emulsions and emulsion breakers that break emulsion into discrete phases. Solidifiers mix and immobilize oil, facilitating removal. Elasticity modifiers impart elasticity to oil by changing the mechanical properties of oil, so that oil remains liquid and can be recovere d by skimmers. Oxidation agents enhance the photo-oxidation of oil. Bioremediation agents enhance the natural biodegradation of oil and include fertilizing agents that provide nutrient s to stimulate bacterial growth and oil-eating bacteria. Shoreline-cleaning agents increase effi ciency of oil removal when water is used to Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-8 2009 2. Alternatives flush the shoreline, and include hydrocarbon solv ents that lower oil viscosity by dilution and surface-active agents that make oil float so that it is recoverable rather than dispersed. Oil not removed through natural weathering processes or any on-water recovery strategy described in Sections 2.2.1 through 2.2.3 will eventually be stranded along the shoreline. Techniques involved in removal of stranded oil vary de pending on the type of shoreline habitat. For example, cleanup on sandy beaches may involve tractors' scraping oil off the sand's surface and piling it for removal and disposal. It ma y also involve response personnel raking and shoveling oil along the shoreline. In rock y shorelines, responder s may use high- or low-pressure water washers to wash oil back into the water, where it can be recovered using skimming devices. It may also involve usin g personnel on the shoreline to apply sorbent materials. In marshy areas, fire hoses or simila r devices may flush oil out of marshes. 2.2.5. Natural Removal (No Cleanup Action) Natural removal is \"used\" when responders determine that the use of any available response options would be ineffective or that the environmental tradeoffs are less favorable when compared to weathering by natural removal. Natural removal relies on the weathering processes described in Appendix B to remove the oil from the environment. 2.2.6. Aerial Tracking of Spilled Oil Aerial tracking of spilled oil is an auxiliary res ponse strategy that is appropriate for use in conjunction with all on-water response technologies, as it provides responders with oil movement and spill characterist ics that allow response managers to more effectively and efficiently deploy the appropriate response resources for removal. As explained in Appendix B, winds and currents te nd to spread oil spills quickly over wide areas. Aerial tracking provides the opportunity for responders to track the movement of oil in the ocean environment, and to collect information on several important characteristics of the spill that allow response managers to more effectively and effi ciently deploy the appropriate response resources for removal. Aerial tracking also supports effectiveness monitoring efforts by providing indicators of the effectiveness of the removal efforts. Aerial tracking relies on fixed-wing or rotary aircraft capable of sustained operations over water and on trained oil spill monitoring personnel. For more effective response support, aircraft should be equipped with communications equipment that allows continuous communication with response managers and operations personnel on the ground. 2.3. O IL SPILL RESPONSE As envisioned in the NCP, the NRS is intended to facilitate the reaction of the response community to an oil spill incident to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. The response community includes federal, state, and local government agencies; the oi l-transportation and -handling industries; the oil spill response industry; environmen tal and other public interest groups; and the general public. In carrying out this intent, the NCP assigns specific tasks to various respon se community members in both the planning and response phases documented within an ACP. Appendix A provides an overview of the NRS, including the federal agencies involved in and general action of the NRT. In the planning phase, the lead federal response agency in an ACP area (either a USCG or USEPA pre-designated FOSC) chairs an Area Committee responsible for producing the ACP. The ACP provides documentation of community consensus on the response strategies and tactics most appropriate for mitigating oil spill impacts and incorporat es them into the planning process. The Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-9 2009 2. Alternatives Area Committee includes federal and state natural resource trustees and invites public participation in assessing oil spill risks and the potential enviro nmental costs and benefits of applying various response options to mitigate those risks. This op en and public planning process is intended to satisfy requirements for endangered species and Essential Fish Habitat protection, among other important issues. The Area Committee is ultima tely responsible for ad opting dispersant and in situ burn pre-authorization agreements in a give n area. The government-sponsored, community- consensus ACPs dictate which response options will be employed in a given area during a specific response effort. In addition, during the planning phase, the oil-transportation and -handling industries are required to identify the response resources necessary to carry out strategies specified in the ACPs. Each planholder is required to ensure through contract or other approved means the availability of all the resources (up to the limits sp ecified in the regulations) necessary to carry out the ACP strategies as they apply to the planholders operating locations. When a spill actually occurs, both the FOSC and the responsible party activate their plans. In most spill incidents, the responsible party carries out all response activities under the supervision of the FOSC. If the spill is large enough to represen t a significant and substantial harm to the environment, the FOSC will assume control for di recting all resources. Th e primary response tools are on-water mechanical recovery and shoreline cleanup. Whether the responsible party or the FOSC is directing the response, options such as dispersants, in situ burning, and other chemical- or biological-mitigating agents are never used unless ordered by the FOSC, under the conditions set forth by the USEPA, affected states, and natural resource trustees. There are practicable limits to how much oil ca n be effectively treated by any method. The weathering effects on oil discussed in Appendix B largely govern those practicable limits. Immediately after the spill, the oil is too closely bunched together to allo w effective employment of more than one or two mechanical recovery or in situ burn systems. Within hours \u2014due to spreading, evaporation, and natural dispersion\u2014 the oil is spread in widely separated, thin patches that must be tracked down and corralled using slow-moving skimmers and containment booms or in situ burn booms. No matter how much equipment is put on the water, mechanical recovery and in situ burn systems are forced to sear ch for smaller and smaller patches of oil spread over wider and wider areas. As discussed in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.3 above, mechanical recovery and in situ burn booms have essentially the same operational restrictions. To put it in simpler terms, spill responders can only recover or burn oil on the water that they corral and contain in sufficient quantity using bo oms to allow for effective recovery or burning. They can recover or burn 10 to 90 percent of the oil they contain in sufficient quantity (USCG, 2009), but they only contain at most 30 percent of the total oil spilled. Thus only a limited amount (generally considered to be less than 15 percent) of the oil is likely to be recovered on water using mechanical recovery or in situ burning, regardless of how much equipment is employed. In Coping with an Oiled Sea , the Congressional Office of Technology reports, \"Even under ideal conditions, with equipment and trained personnel nearby, and good weather, it is not realistic to expect to recover more than 30 percent from a major spill. Probably less than half that amount is more likely\" (OTA, 1990, p. 16). Dispersant removal capability is much higher than mechanical recovery and in situ burning because application by aircraft tr eats a much greater portio n, up to 100 percent, of the spilled oil. Aircraft are much more mobile than boats used for dispersant application as well as boats used to operate mechanical recovery systems. Aircraft can move quickly to treat even widely scattered patches of oil. Theoretically, dispersant treatment can approach 100 percent, but a more reasonable expectation is 45 to 80 percent (USCG, 2009), gi ven the potential for decreased dispersant efficiency from weathering of oil, misapplication, etc. For the purposes of this PEIS, the USCG Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-10 2009 2. Alternatives has estimated efficiency rates. Appendix D provides the calculated efficiency rates for mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion. 2.4. A LTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT PROCESS The preferred environmental option for protecting marine resources from environmental damage associated with oil spills is preventing the oil fr om reaching the resources of concer n (NRC, 1989). The focus of the alternatives development proces s is similar in that it considers alternative response strategies that would improve the ab ility of the response community to minimize potential adverse environmental impa cts of oil spills by reducing the amount of spilled oil reaching sensitive marine resources. The USCG analyzed the potential effectiveness of all oil spill response strategies, including mechanical recovery, chemical dispersion, in situ burning, shoreline cleanup, herding agents, emulsion-treating agents, solidifiers, elasticity modifiers, oxidation agents, bioremediation agents, and shoreline-cleaning agen ts. Aerial tracking, as a complement to any of the above mentioned response strategies, was also analyzed (USCG, 1999). As part of USCG's goal to ensure a prompt re sponse and cleanup of oil spills in U.S. marine waters, the USCG published Final Rules for tan k vessels on January 12, 1996 (61 FR 1052) and for marine transportation-relat ed (MTR) facilities on Februa ry 29, 1996 (61 FR 7890). These regulations required tank vessel and MTR facility planholders to have available, by contract or other approved means, mechanical recovery equipment suitable fo r removing spilled oil from the environment. Based on the recognition that technological and scientific developments, equipment availability, and general acceptance of certain other response technologies could occur over time, these regulations required the USCG to determine whether the mechanical recovery capability requirements should be increased and whether other response strategies in addition to mechanical recovery were practicable for mitigating th e environmental impacts of an oil spill. The guidelines for considering all spill response stra tegies are outlined in the NCP and described in detail in local ACPs, which are developed under the NCP. In carrying out the NCP mandates, Regional Response Teams (RRTs) and Area Co mmittees around the country have engaged in intensive examination of the environmental tradeoff s involved in responding to oil spills using all potential oil spill response strategies. These ef forts were motivated by the local response community's awareness of the potential benefits and advantages \u2014from technical, operational, and environmental standpoints \u2014that could be rendered by the potential use of any or all of the oil spill response strategies included in the NCP. Based on these local and regional environmental evaluations, almost every RRT and Area Committee has now adopted dispersant and in situ burn pre-authorization agreem ents for oil spill response (USCG, 1999). These agreemen ts represent a consensus understanding by the oil spill response community of the value and limitations of chemical dispersion and in situ burning as response strategies. These agreements also detail the circumstances under which each pre-authorized strategy enhanc es the responders' ability to mitigate potential adverse enviro nmental impacts associated with the spill in an efficient and effective manner. 2.5. P UBLIC INVOLVEMENT In addition to the alternative development process inherent to the assembly of local ACPs, the USCG has used public scoping as an integral part of its effort to develop the oil response alternatives to be analyzed in this PEIS. Public scoping has been critical to understanding public concerns over the potential operational, economic, and environmental benefits and tradeoffs Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-11 2009 2. Alternatives surrounding different spill response strategies. Pub lic workshops were held in Oakland, California, on July 24, 1998; Houston, Texas, on August 19, 1998; and Washington, D.C., on September 16, 1998. The workshops were wide ly publicized through a Federal Register notice, the USCG vessel response plan (VRP)/shipboard oil pollution plan (SOPEP) Web site7, trade journals, and written notice to individuals and organizations representing interested members of the public and the response community from around the country. These workshops were intended to elicit input on potential changes to the equipment requirements within the current response plan regulations for mechanical recovery, chemical dispersion, in situ burning, shoreline cleanup, herding agents, emulsion-treating agents, solidifiers, elasticity mo difiers, oxidation agents, bioremediation agents, and shoreline-cleaning agents. The workshops served as forums to discuss issues relevant to establishing practicable alternatives to existing spill response equipment capability requirements. Discussions focused mostly on technological, operational, econo mic, and environmental concerns related to mechanical recovery and chemical dispersion because the USCG perceived these options to be the most promising in rapidly treating large volumes of spilled oil in open-water marine environments. In situ burning was also discussed as having significant potential for large-volume oil spill response. In addition, based on the information received during the development of the local ACPs, other response strategies were also discussed, including other chemical and biological strategies such as herding agents, emulsion-treating agents, solidifiers, elasticity mo difiers, oxidation agents, bioremediation agents, and shoreline-cleaning agents. The results of the workshops demonstrated that, based on current oil spill response technolo gy, there was significant public, go vernment, and industry support for increasing the on-water mechanical recovery equipment requirements im posed by the current regulations, while also imposing dispersant and in situ burn capability re quirements. Summary reports of the workshops are available on the USCG VRP/SOPEP Web site8. Based on inputs received from the workshops, in 1998 the USCG commissioned an independent study to assess the practicability of spill response requirements. The study focused on the advances in technology, policy, an d equipment availability for the remova l of on-water oil discharges with the goal of determining whether changes to current removal equipment requirements were warranted. The study co ncluded with a report \u2014Response Plan Equipment Caps Review \u2014published in May 1999, which found that, since 1993, there have been vast technologi cal advancements and considerable improvements in the effectiveness an d availability of on-water mechanical recovery equipment, and that local or regional determinations related to chemical dispersion and in situ burning have been comp leted nationwide (USCG, 1999). Therefore, the report recommended that the USCG consider amending the current regulations to require industry to increase its on-water mechanical recovery equipment capability and to establish and maintain both dispersant and on- water in situ burn capability. The report's general conclusi ons and recommendati ons (USCG, 1999) found, based on the potential for spills in excess of both current and projected response plan equipment capability requirements and availability in the marketplace and in existing spill response organizations' stockpiles, that it is practicable to consider: Increasing the current mechanical recovery capability requirements by 25 percent at this time and again in 5 years; 7 http://www.uscg.mil/vrp 8 http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/reg/response.shtml Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-12 2009 2.

After receiving public comment on the alternatives and considering the historical context of alternatives, the USCG decided to explore public opinion on expanding the scope of the proposed regulations to inland and coastal waters. On October 11, 2002, the USC G published a Notice of Proposed Rule-Making (NPRM) (67 FR 63331) announcemen t that expanded the altern atives to include chemical dispersion and in situ burning in the inland operating environment. Although the NPRM states that the alternatives will address the inland operating environment, this PEIS does not consider the inland operating environment because there are currently no pre-authorization agreements for the inland operating environment. If pre-authorization agreements are adopted for the inland operating environment (the USEPA has primary responsibility for deciding whether a pre-authorization agreement is appropriate in this operating environment), a supplemental NEPA process would be extended to this operating environment. The Draft PEIS was available for public review and comment for 60 days after the Notice of Availability (NOA) was published. Actions during this public involvement phase included the following: A NOA was published in the Federa l Register on June 1, 2005, an nouncing the availability of the Draft PEIS for review and comment. This publication date started the 60-day review period. The USEPA published a Notice of Receipt of the Draft PEIS in the Federal Register on May 27, 2005. A Notice of Public Hearing was published in the Federal Register on June 15, 2005. The purpose of the Notice of Public Hearing was to state that the U.S. Coast Guard would hold four public hearings to solicit comments on the Draft PEIS. The locations, dates, and times of the public hearings were as follows: - Houston, Texas - July 11, 2005 - 12:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. - Sacramento, California - July 13, 2005 - 12:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. - Anchorage, Alaska - July 15, 2005 - 12:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. 9 http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/reg/capsreview.shtml Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-13 2009 2. Alternatives - Washington, D.C. - July 19, 2005 - 12:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. The Draft PEIS was mailed to agencies and inte rested members of the public for review and comment. Requests for a national consistency determinatio n pursuant to section 307(c)(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) were sent to thirty-four State Coastal Zone Management Programs. The U.S. Coast Guard received twelve formal responses concurring with the federal consistency determination. Nonresponses were also considered as concurring with the federal consistency determination. A Notice of Availability and Re quest for Comments was publishe d in the Federal Register on August 5, 2005, announcing that the review and comment period had been extended for an additional 30 days. A total of nineteen commenters provided comment on the Draft PEIS. These comments and USCG responses are provided in Appendix H. The USCG has decided to eliminate the credit for in situ burning because allowing such a credit may reduce the amount of mechanical recovery response equipment available in areas where in-situ burn pre-authorizations are in place. As these areas are typically more than three miles from shore, there will be no reduction in mechanical re covery equipment available in near shore areas. The Coast Guard acknowledges the limited opportunities to employ in-situ burning in open waters. Those limitations are so severe, and the cost of in-situ burn equipment so high, that the Coast Guard cannot justify requiring stockpiling of in-situ burn equipment in addition to required mechanical reco very stockpiles. 2.6. A LTERNATIVES CONSIDERED IN THIS PEIS Based on the knowledge and information developed through the Area Committee investigations, public input from workshops, the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review study, and responses from the PEIS NOI and the NPRM, the USCG has concluded that mechanical recovery, chemical dispersion, and in situ burning meet the criteria for potentia lly reducing the amount of spilled oil reaching sensitive marine habitat. These response options have the potential to effectively remove large quantities of oil from the water when used in the first several days after a spill incident occurs (NAS, 1989; USCG, 1999). The alternatives proposed in the NOI and refined in the NPRM determined the alternatives that are considered and analyzed in detail in this PEIS. Thus, these alternatives will be analyzed in this PEIS and will be covered in more detail in Chapter 4. The proposed regulations would increase the oil removal capacity requirements for tank vessels and MTR facilities, and thus would increase the available oil remo val capability for oil spills. The reasonable alternatives proposed in the NOI and refined in the NPRM met the purpose and the need that were to be considered and analyzed in detail in this PEIS. This PEIS examines the six refined alternatives (Figure 2.6-1): Alternative 1 \u2014no action, whereby no change in response plan regulations would be implemented. Alternative 2 \u2014increase on-water mechanic al recovery capability an d establish and maintain aerial tracking capability *. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-14 2009 2. Alternatives Alternative 3 \u2014increase on-water mechanical recovery capability, esta blish on-water dispersant application capability (Option A), establish in situ burn credit, and establish and maintain aerial tracking capability. Alternative 4 \u2014increase on-water mechanical recovery capability, esta blish on-water dispersant application capability (Option B), establish in situ burn credit, and establish and maintain aerial tracking capability. Alternative 5 [Preferred Alternati ve]\u2014 maintain on-wat er mechanical reco very capability at current levels, establish on-water dispersant a pplication capability (Option B), and establish and maintain aerial tracking capability. Therefore, DPEIS Alternative 5 is modified to remove in situ burning as a result of further analysis and in response to public comments on the DPEIS.. Alternative 6\u2014 maintain on-water mechanical r ecovery capability at curre nt levels, establish on-water dispersant application capability (Option B), establish in situ burn credit, and establish and maintain aerial tracking capability. Thus the original alternative 5 from the DPEIS is retained as Alternative 6 for analysis. Under all alternatives except Alternative 1, planholders would be required to have aerial tracking capability available by contract or other approved means. Aerial o il spill tracking is routinely used in oil spill incidents and has proven to be very effective in directing on-water response activities; thus, it will not be considered sepa rately but will be analyzed as an integral part of Alternatives 2 through 6. Implementing proposed Alternatives 3, 4, 5, or 6 would require planholders to have available, by contract or other approved means, dispersant equipment and supplies for responding to a spill incident. In Alternatives 3, 4, and 5, there are two chemical dispersion options, Options A and B, which are defined in Table 2.6-1. Under Option A in a non -Gulf of Mexico region, within the first 12 hours of response, 2,750 gal of dispersant are a pplied to treat 55,000 bbl of oil. Under Option B in a non -Gulf of Mexico region, a larger volume of dispersant is applie d to treat a larger volume of oil. For the Gulf of Mexico region under both Opti ons A and B, larger volumes of dispersant are applied to treat larger volumes of oil as compared with any of the other regions. Under Alternatives 3, 4, and 6, an in situ burn credit would be extended to planholders where in situ burn pre-authorization agreements currently are in pl ace (Figure 2.2-2). If a planholder opted to establish and maintain an in situ burn capability, the planholder wo uld receive credit against their mechanical recovery equipment and would be able to reduce their mechanical recovery capability by an equal amount up to the limit specified in the NPRM and discussed in Section 2.6.3. The proposed regulations would apply in all areas with dispersant and in situ burn pre-authorization agreements (Figures 2.2-1 and 2.2-2). A pre-authorization agreement represents a consensus among the local response community of the circumst ances under which the alternative enhances responders' ability to mitigate en vironmental impacts of an oil spill event. When the conditions \u2014 oil type, water temperature, water depth, distan ce from shore, proximity to environmentally sensitive habitat \u2014specified in the pre-authorization agreement are met, the FOSC can order the use of the response alternative immediately.

Alternatives Tier Application (hr) Gulf of Mexico Region Non-Gulf of Mexico Regions 1 Option A 12 5,500:110,000 2,750:55,000 1 Option B 12 8,250:165,000 3 60 23,375:467,000 23,375:467,000 Source: Adapted from FR 67, No. 198, October 11, 2002. Note: Gulf of Mexico region Tier 1 (Options A and B) are higher than Non-Gulf of Mexico region Tier 1 (Options A and B) because of greater potential spill size and frequency in the Gulf region; it is assumed that dispersant stockpiles would be centralized in the Gulf region. The 1:20 dispersant-to-oil application ratio is a planning assumption that relies on the generally agreed on estimate o f the effectiveness of current dispersant formulations. The baseline environment, to which the alternatives are applied, includes the spilled oil. Since the response alternatives \u2014on-water mechanical recovery, on-water in situ burning, and on-water chemical dispersion \u2014are only applied after there has been an oil spill, the assessment of each alternative includes both the impact of the spilled oil and any impacts caused by the response action. The spilled oil that is not removed by one of the al ternatives would be stranded on a shoreline, where it could be removed using mechanical means such as hot or cold water flushing to re-float the oil and recover it with a skimmer, manual pickup, burning, or removing and replacing the affected substrate. Hard surfaces, such as rocks or bulkheads, could be sandblasted or steam cleaned. It is important to consider that, in general, shoreline cleanup is ex tremely labor intensive, costly, and environmentally damaging to sensitive resources. Oil on beaches tends to be washed throughout the intertidal zone following the tide cycles, resulting in frequent re-o iling of sensitive habitat. As an example, marshes affected by oil spills are frequently left to recover naturally because the impact of human intervention has been found to be sometimes more environmentally damaging than letting the oil disperse by natural processes. 2.6.1. Alternative 1\u2014No Action (No Change in Response Plan Regulations) Under this alternative, the USCG would not implement any changes to the current regulations. Mechanical recovery equipment requirements would remain at current levels as determined using the calculations for MTR facilities in 33 CFR part 154, Annex C, and for tank vessels in 33 CFR part 155, Annex B. Dispersant and in situ burn capability and equipment would not be required, so their po tential use as respon se strategies would continue to be severely limited because most tank vessel and MTR facility planholders do not currently contract for these capabilities. Planholder s would not be required to establish and maintain aerial tracking capab ility although the majority of planholders currently have aerial tracking capability as a standard practice. In addition, as is the current and historical practice, the local response community would continue to determine the actual use of the response capa bility in an oil spill event. Responders would continue to use mechanical recovery equipment to remove as much oil from the water's surface as possible. Oil that is not removed by this method would be removed either through natural recovery or shoreline-cleaning methods. Chemical dispersion and in situ burning would be approved for use infrequently in areas where pre-authorization agreements are in place. Chemical dispersion would be approved for use almost exclusively in the Gulf of Me xico and Alaska regions (Table 2.6-2). Table 2.6-2 Response Options for Each Region under Alternative 1 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-16 2009 2. Alternatives Region Mechanical Recovery Chemical Dispersion In Situ Burning Atlantic Yes No Yes Caribbean Yes No Yes Gulf of Mexico Yes Yes Yes Pacific Yes No Yes Alaska Yes Yes Yes Oceania Yes No Yes Source: Adapted from USCG, 2009. As required in 33 CFR parts 154 and 155, MTR facility and tank vess el planholders must have contracts with response pr oviders to deliver the specifie d recovery capability to the scene and be operational within certain time periods. These time periods or tiers allow planholders to maintain a certain level of locally available equipment and to supplement that equipment by importing equipment from other re gions over time (Table 2.6-3). Tier 1 for mechanical recovery is the first operational pe riod of a response that begins anytime from 12 to 24 hours after the discovery of the spill, depending on proximity to major port areas. Tier 2 for mechanical recovery is the second operational period that begins anytime from 36 to 48 hours after discovery of the spill, depend ing on proximity to major port areas. Tier 3 for mechanical recovery is the third operationa l period that begins anytime from 60 to 72 hours after the discovery of the spill, depe nding on proximity to major port areas.

Reverted levels are shown in parentheses. Under existing conditions, the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions currently have dispersant pre-authorization agreements in place, as well as dispersant capability. In situ burn capability currently is available in a ll regions with pre-authorization agreements. Therefore, in this PEIS the impacts of chemical dispersion for the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions and in situ burning for all six regions consider ed in this PEIS will be part of Alternative 1 (USCG, 1999). In the current regulations (33CFR 155. 1050 (j) and 33 CFR 155.1225(h)) tank vessel planholders, with established dispersant capability and carrying certain oil cargoes are authorized to apply for a credit against their mechanical equipment requirements if: Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-17 2009 2. Alternatives The tank vessel operates in an area with year-round pre-authorization agreement for chemical dispersion; and The planholder ensures availability of disper sant and dispersant delivery resources by contract or other approved means. This credit provision allows planholders to reduce mechanical recovery equipment by up to 25 percent. 2.6.2. Alternative 2\u2014Increase On-Water Mechanical Recovery Capability and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability Under this alternative, the USCG would change the current regulations to increase the amount of mechanical recovery equipment that planholders would be required to have available to respond to an oil discharge. Planholders would also be required to establish and maintain aerial tracking ca pabilities. The curren t credit for dispersant capability would be removed. No other change to the current regulations would be mandated, so no dispersant or in situ burn capabilities would be requi red. Chemical dispersion and in situ burning would continue to be approved for use infrequently in areas where pre-authorization agreements are in place. Chemical dispersion would continue to be approved for use almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions (Table 2.6-2). In addition, as is the current and historical practice, the local response community would determine the actual use of the response capabilities; thus, this alternative would only require the availability of the response ca pabilities but would not mandate the actual use of any particular capability in response operations. Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in a 25 percent increase in the amount of mechanical recovery equipment an individual planholder would be required to have available under contract. Realistically, many planholders share the same equipment, and there are stockpiles of equipment well in excess of the current mechanical recovery equipment capability requirements. It was also estimated that a 25 percent increase in mechanical recovery equipment will not result in an increase in recovery efficiency, meaning no additional barrels of oil would be removed from the water (USCG, 2009). Proposed maximum mechanical recove ry equipment requirements (USCG, 2009) \u2014the equipment a planholder would be required to have under contract\u2014are listed in Table 2.6-3. 2.6.3. Alternative 3\u2014Increase On-Water Mechanical Recovery Capability, Establish On-Water Dispersant Application Capability (Option A), Establish In Situ Burn Credit, and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability Under this alternative, the USCG would change the current regulations to increase the amount of mechanical recovery equipment as required in Alternative 2 and to establish dispersant application capabilit y that tank vessel planholders would be required to have available to respond to an oil discharge. Option A would require planholders to have a dispersant application capability as shown in Table 2-5.1. The planholders would also have the opportunity to apply for an in situ burn credit. The dispersant credit in the current regulations would be eliminated. Planholders would also be required to establish and maintain aerial tracking capab ility. As is the current and hi storical practice, the local response community would determine the actu al use of the response capabilities; thus, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-18 2009 2. Alternatives this alternative would only require the availa bility of the response capabilities but would not mandate the actual use of any part icular capability in response operations. The USCG would also amend the current regulations to require the tank vessel planholders to maintain dispersant equipment (Option A) to respond to an oil discharge. This requirement would apply only to owners/operators of tank vessels operating more than 3 nm from shore where chemical dispersion has been pre-authorized 10 in accordance with the NCP. Most MTR facilities would not be required to meet th is requirement since they are assumed to be outside areas where pre-authorization agreements are in place. Currently, there is adequate dispersant capa bility (i.e., dispersant supply and delivery vehicles) in the United States, although only a very limited number of tank vessels and facilities actually have that capability unde r contract at this time. According to the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), current dispersant stockpiles are adequate to meet the levels anticipated in this PEIS. There are numerous aircraft and vessels available that could serve as adequate dispersant platforms. There are also suitable airport and vessel facilities available throughout the coasta l United States to allow the establishment and maintenance of effective dispersant capabilities. The proposed regulations would require the uniform availability of dispersant capability in all regions . For the purpose of this PEIS, it is assumed that requiring the re gions to have the capability would make them more inclined to consider using these techno logies. This would eventually result in the actual use of those response technologies in all regions. If Alternative 3 were implemented, it is like ly that planholders would have to arrange for contracts to share several dispersant stockpile s on the East, West, and Gulf Coasts of the United States, and possibly in Alaska an d Hawaii (USCG, 1999). In addition, these operators would have to contract for a numb er of dedicated small- and medium-sized aircraft (fixed-wing or rotary), stationed at airports around the country and outfitted to transport and apply thousands of gallons of dispersants up to 50 nm offshore (Table 2.6-1). Cost-benefit estimates are described in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999) and Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans (USCG, 2009). In addition to the proposal for dispersant capability, this alternative would also amend the current regulations to provide the tank vessel planholders with an opportunity to maintain in situ burn equipment to respond to an oil discharge through an in situ burn credit (Table 2.6-4). Specifically, if a planholder opted to establish and maintain an in situ burn capability, the planholder would receive credit against th eir mechanical equipment and would be able to reduce their mechanical recovery capability by an equal amount up to the limit specified in Table 2.6-4. This is based on the assumption , discussed above, that the primary limiter is the same for both in situ burning and mechanical recovery \u2014the ability to contain the oil. Therefore, as noted in Alternative 2, the increase in mechanical recovery equipment and/or the addition of credit for in situ burn equipment will not increase the amount of oil treated. Table 2.6-4 Maximum Anticipated In Situ Burn Equipment Required under the Proposed Regulations 10 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizat ion agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements (http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004).

Alternatives may be cons idered based on submission to the USCG of peer-reviewed scientific evidence of improved capability. When using in situ burn boom, additional deployment of vessels or auxiliary equipment would be required for the implementation of Al ternative 3. In addition, in the event that equipment is acquired, co sts would be offset to a certain extent by reductions in the amount of mechanical recovery equipment a planholder would need to have available.

Alternative 4\u2014Increase On-Water Mechanical Recovery Capability, Establish On-Water Dispersant Application Capability (Option B), Establish In Situ Burn Credit, and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability Under this alternative, the USCG would amend the current regulations to require planholders to increase mechanical recovery capability to the levels required under Alternative 2 or 3 and establish dispersant appl ication capability equipment to respond to an oil discharge. Option B would requi re planholders to have a dispersant application capability as shown in Table 2-5.1. The planholders would also have the opportunity to apply for an in situ burn credit. The dispersant credit in th e current regulations would be eliminated. Planholders would also be required to establish and maintain aerial tr acking capability. The USCG would also amend the current regulations to require the planholders to maintain dispersant equipment (Option B) to respond to an oil discharge. This requirement would apply only to owners/operators of tank vessels operating more than 3 nm from shore where chemical dispersion has been pre-authorized 11 in accordance with the NCP. In addition, this alternative would also amend the current regulations to provide the planholders with an opportunity to maintain in situ burn equipment to respond to an oil discharge through an in situ burn credit (Table 2.6-4).

Alternatives against their mechanical equipment and would be able to reduce their mechanical recovery capability by an equal amount up to the limit specified in Table 2.6-4. This is based on the assumption, discussed above, that the primary limiter is the same for both in situ burning and mechanical recovery \u2014the ability to contain the oil. Therefore, as noted in Alternative 1, the increase in mechanical reco very equipment and/or the addition of credit for in situ burn equipment will not increase the amount of oil treated. As is the current and historical practice, the local response community would determine the actual use of the response capabilities; thus, this alternative would only require the availability of the response capabilities but would not mandate the actual use of any particular capability in res ponse operations. These requirem ents would apply only to the sections of the regulated community operating in areas where dispersants and in situ burning has been pre-authorized in accordance with the NCP, so it would apply only to owners/operators of tank vessels operating more than 3 nm from shore. Most MTR facilities would not be required to meet these requirements except for mechanical recovery, since they are assumed to be outside areas where pre-authorization agreements are in place. When using in situ burn boom, additional deployment of vessels or auxiliary equipment would be required for the implementation of Al ternative 4. In addition, in the event that equipment is acquired, co sts would be offset to a certain extent by reductions in the amount of mechanical recovery equipment a planholder would need to have available.

Alternative 5\u2014Maintain Mechanical Recovery Capability, Establish On-Water Dispersant Application Capability (Option B), and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability [Preferred Alternative] Under this preferred alternative, the USCG would amend the current regulations to require planholders to maintain mechanical recovery capability and establish dispersant application capability (Option B). Option B would require planholders to have a dispersant application capability as shown in Table 2.6-1. The dispersant application capability requirement would apply only to owners/operators of tank vessels operating more than 3 nm from shore where chemical dispersion has been pre-authorized 12 in accordance with the NCP. The dispersant credit in the current regulations would be eliminated. Planholders would also be required to establish and maintain aerial tracking capability. Therefore, this alternative is a modification of DPEIS Alternative 5, to remove in situ burning as a result of further analysis and in response to public comments on the DPEIS. As is the current and historical practice, th e local response community would determine the actual use of the response capabilities; thus, th is alternative would only require the availability of the response capabilities but would not mandate the actual use of any particular capability in response operations. The actual use of the response mechanisms would continue to be at the discretion of the FOSC in accordance with the controlling guidance contained within the RCP and ACP. These requirements would appl y only to the sections of the regulated 12 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-21 2009 2. Alternatives community operating in areas where dispersants ha ve been pre-authorized in accordance with the NCP, so it would apply only to owners/ope rators of tank vessels operating more than 3 nm from shore. Most MTR facilities would not be required to meet these requirements except mechanical recovery, since these facilities are assumed to be outside areas where pre-authorization agreements are in place. This is the USCG's preferred alternative be cause it increases the available oil spill capability requirements for tan k vessels and MTR facilities, which is the USCG's purpose and intent for these proposed regulations. In addition to increasing the response plan equipment capability requirements for tank vesse ls and MTR facilities this alternative also meets the objectives of the USCG to protect the marine environment and promote maritime safety at reasonable cost and with substantial benefit. This alternative includes the largest dispersant equipment stockpile and no change in mechanical recovery requirements. As pointed out in the discussion of previous alternatives, making changes to mechanical recovery equipment would not result in increased spilled oil recovery. However, the larger quantity of dispersants would allow for treatment of a larger quantity of oil, should such treatment be determined to be appropriate. The Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans (USCG, 2009) found that national benefit is driven by the effectiveness of dispersant application and aerial tracking. Alternatives 4, 5, and 6 are the most beneficial because they in clude the largest requirements for dispersant application capability. There is essentially no benefit from increasing response requirements for mechanical recovery. The re gulatory analysis (USCG, 2009) determined that the cost of Altern ative 5 is $92.92 million. 2.6.6. Alternative 6\u2014Maintain Mechanical Recovery Capability, Establish On-Water Dispersant Application Capability (Option B), Establish in situ Burn Credit, and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability Under this alternative, the USCG would amend the current regulations to require planholders to maintain mechanical recovery capability and establish dispersant application capability (Option B). Option B would require planholders to have a dispersant application capability as shown in Table 2.6-1. The dispersant application capability requirement would apply only to owners/operators of tank vessels operating more than 3 nm from shore where chemical dispersion has been pre-authorized 13 in accordance with the NCP. The dispersant credit in the current regulations would be eliminated. The planholders would also have the opportunity to apply for an in situ burn credit. The dispersant credit in the current regulations would be eliminated. Planholders would be required to establish and maintain aerial tracking capability. Thus the original alternative 5 from the DPEIS is retained as Alternative 6 for analysis. This alternative would also amend the current regulations to provide the planholder with an opportunity to maintain in situ burn equipment to respond to an oil discharge through an in situ burn credit (Table 2.6-4) . Specifically, if a planhold er opted to establish and 13 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-22 2009 2. Alternatives maintain an in situ burn capability, the planholder wo uld receive credit against their mechanical equipment and would be able to reduce their mechanical recovery capability by an equal amount up to the limit specified in Table 2.6-4. This is based on the assumption, discussed above, that the primary limiter is the same for both in situ burning and mechanical recovery \u2014the ability to contain the oil. Therefore, as noted in Alternative 1, the increase in mechanical recovery equipment and/or the addition of credit for in situ burn equipment will not increase the amount of oil treated. As is the current and historical practice, th e local response community would determine the actual use of the response capabilities; thus, th is alternative would only require the availability of the response capabilities but would not mandate the actual use of any particular capability in response operations. The actual use of the response mechanisms would continue to be at the discretion of the FOSC in accordance with the controlling guidance contained within the RCP and ACP. These requirements would appl y only to the sections of the regulated community operating in areas where dispersants and in situ burning has been pre-authorized in accordance with the NCP, so it would a pply only to owners/oper ators of tank vessels operating more than 3 nm from shore. Most MTR facilities would not be required to meet these requirements except mechanical recovery, since these facilities are assumed to be outside areas where pre-authorization agreements are in place. When using in situ burn boom, additional deployment of vessels or auxiliary equipment would be required for the implementation of Al ternative 6. In addition, in the event that equipment is acquired, co sts would be offset to a certain extent by reductions in the amount of mechanical recovery equipment a planholder would need to have available. Cost-benefit estimates are described in detail in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999) and Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans (USCG, 2009). 2.6.7. Summary of the Effectiveness of the Alternatives Considered in This PEIS The following is a summary of the effectiveness of the alternatives: Alternative 1 is the baseline or current state and produces no change. Alternative 2 would not result in increased efficiency or produce an increase in oil treated compared with Alternative 1. This alternative only increases mechanical recovery equipment. As Section 2.6.2 conc ludes, adding more mechanical recovery equipment will not increase the amount of oil treated as the additional equipment would not increase the number of opportunities to actually use that equipment. This alternative also includes aerial tracking capability. Alternative 3 would produce an increase in oil treated compared with Alternatives 1 and 2 because this alternative adds dispersant equipment requirements. This alternative allows a reduction in mechanical recovery equipment based on the addition of in situ burn equipment. Because in situ burning is at best as effective as mechanical recovery, adding in situ burn equipment to or substituting in situ burn equipment for mechanical recovery equipmen t will not increase the amount of oil treated. This is based on the assumption that the primary limiter is the same for both mechanical recovery and in situ burning \u2014the ability to contain the oil. The addition of dispersant capability, however, results in treating a larger quantity of oil. This alternative also includes aerial tracking capability. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-23 2009 2. Alternatives Alternative 4 would produce an increase in oil treated compared with Alternative 3 because Alternative 3 dispersant Option A (Table ES.5-1) requires slightly less delivery capacity under Tier 1 (0 -12 hours) than Alternative 4 dispersant Option B. For the purpose of this analysis, however, the USCG estimated the amount of oil that could be treated during response operations based only on Option B (Appendix D). This was done to simplify the analysis and ensure that the highest potential levels of exposure to dispersants and dispersed oil in the water column were considered. The increase in mechanical recove ry equipment will not increase the amount of oil treated because as noted in Section 2.6.2, adding more mechanical recovery equipment would not increase the number of opportunities to actually use that equipment. This alternative allows a reduction in mechanical recovery equipment based on the addition of in situ burn equipment, which, as discussed above, is considered at best equivalent in effectiveness to mechanical recovery and will not increase the amount of oil treated. This alternative also incl udes aerial tracking capability. Alternative 5 would produce the same increase in oil treated as Alternative 4 because it requires the same quantity of dispersant application equipment. For Alternatives 4 through 6, dispersant Option B (Table ES.5-1) requir es slightly greater delivery capacity under Tier 1 (0 -12 hours) than Alternative 3 dispersant Option A. For the purpose of this analysis, howeve r, the USCG estimated the amount of oil that could be treated during response operations based only on Option B (Appendix D). Thus, for the purpose of this analysis, the changes resultin g from Alterative 5 are identical to those reported for Alternative 4. Since the increase in mechanical recovery equipment will not increase the quantity of oil tr eated, requiring those capabilities does not add any value to offset the costs incurred in establishing and maintaining them Alternative 6 would produce the same increase in oil treated as Alternative 4 because it requires the same quantity of dispersant application equipment. For Alternatives 4 and 5 dispersant Option B (Table ES.5-1) requires sl ightly greater delivery capacity under Tier 1 (0-12 hours) than Alternative 3 dispersant Opti on A. For the purpose of this analysis, however, the USCG estimated the amount of oil that could be treated during response operations based only on Option B (Appendix D). Thus, for the purpose of this analysis, the changes resulting from Alterative 6 are id entical to those reported for Alternative 4. Since the increase in mechanical recovery equipment or the credit for in situ burn equipment will not increase the quantity of oil treated, requiring those capabilities does not add any value to offset the costs incurred in establishing and maintaining them. Under all alternatives except Alternative 1, planholders would be required to have aerial tracking capability available by contract or other approved means. Aerial oil spill tracking is routinely used in oil spill incidents and ha s proven to be very effective in directing on-water response activities; thus, it will not be considered separately but will be analyzed as an integral part of Alternatives 2 through 6. 2.7. A LTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT ELIMINATED The USCG and local Area Committee investigations concluded that, based on current technology and scientific knowledge, herding agents, emulsion-treating agents, solidifiers, elasticity modifiers, oxidation agents, bioremediation agents, and shorelin e-cleaning agents are no t considered effective in treating oil with the goal of preventing oil from reaching and affecting sensitive marine resources in the event of an oil spill. Some of th ese strategies were not co nsidered because they are Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-24 2009 2. Alternatives ineffective in treating large quantit ies of oil in the water, while others \u2014solidifiers and shoreline- cleaning agents \u2014were not considered because they can only be used once the oil has reached the shore, thus conflicting with the NCP's goal of protecting marine-sensitive resources by preventing oil from reaching these resources in the first pl ace. In addition, the chemical and biological substances associated with these strategies are su bject to 33 CFR part 400, subpart J, so emergency on-water use would require a pre-authorization agreement or incident-specific approval. The current absence of pre-authorization agreements re flects the lack of consensus on parameters for emergency use at the regional and local levels. Th erefore, approval for incident-specific use is complicated and unlikely, rendering consideration of a requirement for industry to stockpile these materials, and their associated application equipment, inappropriate. Thus, the USCG does not intend to require planholders to stockpile any of the materials necessary to conduct response operations using these chemical and biological strategies in advance of a spill. Therefore, herding agents, emulsion-treating agen ts, solidifiers, elasticity modifiers, oxidation agents, bioremediation agents, and shoreline-cleaning agents are removed from further analysis as alternatives and will not be considered in th is PEIS. However, the USCG will continue to encourage the NRT, RRTs, Area Committees, and pl anholders to continue to assess potential use of all response options to decide on the be st response strategy in an oil spill event. The NOI of September 1, 2000, solicited public an d agency input into the development of the scope of the PEIS, and advised the public that outreach activities conducted by program participants would be considered in the preparation of the PEIS. Afte r the release of the NOI, several comments were received through the U.S. Department of Transpor tation's (DOT's) electronic document management system and via faxes. These comments suggested that the USCG consider two additional alternatives: one that would require equipment and personnel to arri ve on the scene more quickly than is currently required, and another that woul d require the USCG to offer incentives for preventive actions. The USCG examined the issue of quicker response times. The current regulations require that initial response resources for an average most probable sp ill (approximately 50 bbl) be on the scene, ready to deploy within 1 hour of receiving the notific ation of a discharge. Si milar response times are established for bringing in larger quantities of equipment over time. The most likely strategy to reduce these response times woul d be to require the equipment to be available on board every regulated tank vessel. The USCG in vestigated this in 1998 in a re port on response equipment on tank vessels (USCG, 1998). The research concluded that while it may be technologically feasible to carry and to deploy oil spill response equipment aboa rd a tank vessel, the practical limitations of such equipment would make it economically, environmenta lly, and technologically unfeasible to require tank vessels to carry the equipment. Thus, the USCG concluded that tank vessel-carried equipment should not be required onboard tank vessels. The US CG also analyzed the i ssue of providing credit to a responsible party who responds more quickly than mandated by regulatory standards. The USCG rejected the concept of incentives for fast er response because the response times in the current regulations are established as the maximum response time at the mandated tier, and not as a suggested response time. Thus, the USCG expects that in most cases, response will be quicker than established by the current regulations. The USCG also considered the issue of incentives for preventive actions. This suggestion was previously considered in the VRP rulemaking process, in which the USCG stated its goal to prepare for response to oil spills to mitigate the environmental effects of oil pollution. Mitigation of oil pollution falls under the prevention catego ry, so all spill response efforts are by nature preventive actions. Further, the USCG position remains that while preventive measures such as double hulls, double bottoms, pr otective cargo, and ballast pump ing could reduce the likelihood of an oil spill, they do not eliminate the possibility of a release, nor do they reduce the total quantity Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-25 2009 2. Alternatives that would be released in the event of a discharge. In addition, a worst case discharge (WCD) is defined as the loss of all oil cargo on a vessel regardless of preventive measures in place, and the response equipment requirements are based on that scenario, independent of reductions in the probability of occurrence. Therefore, incentives in the form of reductions in response standards because of enhanced prevention efforts would not be justified. 2.8. P OTENTIAL USE OF RESPONSE OPTIONS IN THE ALTERNATIVES BASED ON HISTORICAL SPILL DATA The USCG analyzed a period of historical oil spill data to provide a snapshot of information regarding the potential use of the proposed alternatives for future oil spill incidents (USCG, 1999). Since the analysis is based on historical data, the conclusions presented here are only illustrative of potential future spill and response scenarios, and are not derived from any rigorous statistical analysis. The historical USCG spill data set cont ains information on 231 oil spills that occurred between 1993 and 1998 in U.S. marine waters and were of at least 1,000 gal in size (see Table A-1 in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review [USCG, 1999] for details of these 231 spills). Of these, 79 spills occurred in marine waters at a distance of more than 3 nm from shore (see Appendix E, Table E.1-1 for details of these 79 spills). Only spills larger than 1,000 gal are considered since weathering factors make it unlikely that response actions would be feasible for smaller spills in an open-water marine environment. It was initiall y planned to consider only spills larger than 1,000 bbl (42,000 gal), since response action using the proposed strategies would be more feasible at this scal e. However, there were less than 10 spills in the historical USCG spill data set of that magnitude in U.S. marine waters between 1993 and 1998, providing too small a sample set for analysis. The specific characteristics of the type of oil sp illed and the environmental conditions are critical factors in determining the potent ial frequency of use for each response alternative. Some of the most important factors th at determine the effectiveness of oil spill response strategies include oil density, wind speed, water depth, and distance from shore. These characteristics were established for the historical USCG spill data set to determine the potential effectivene ss of oil spill response strategies for similar future sp ills. In particular, the percentage of historical events where the proposed alternatives would have been potentially useful or the only viable response alternative was determined for the 79 spills occurring more th an 3 nm from shore. Only the spills occurring more than 3 nm from shore were considered. Thus, assuming th at the historical USCG spill data set is indicative of future spill ch aracteristics (oil type and enviro nmental conditions), Figure 2.8-1 provides information on potentia l future applications of each oil spill response option. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-26 2009 2. Alternatives Figure 2.8-1 Potential Future Applications of Each Oil Spill Response Option for Oil Spills 1,000 gal and 3 nm from Shore 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Mechanical Recovery Dispersants In Situ Burning Mechanical Recovery, Dispersants, or In Situ Burning No Action Feasible Option Only Option Source: USCG, 2009. The examination of the historical oil spill data focused on individual spill response options. However, each alternative consists of one or more of these spill response options (see Section 2.6). Alternative 1 is potentially useful in response to 71 percent of all spills occurring beyond 3 nm from shore (Appendix E, Table E.2-1 and Figure 2.8-1), while it would be ineffective in 29 percent of these spills. The Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans (USCG, 2009) determined that increased mechanical recovery would not result in incr eased recovery of oil compared to capabilities mandated in 2000 ther efore Alternative 2 would have the same effectiveness as Alternative 1 (71 percent of all spills occurring beyond 3 nm from shore). Dispersants are the only viable alternative for 16 percent of the spills occurring beyond 3 nm offshore (Appendix E, Table E.3-1). Thus, Altern ative 3 would increase the effective response capability to 87 percent of all spills, leaving only 13 percent of all spills in the offshore environment for which there is no effective on-water response. Since only mechanical recovery and chemical dispersion offer uni que opportunities to tr eat spilled oil and since there are no spills where in situ burning is feasible when mechanical recovery is not, Alternatives 4 and 5 has the same effectiveness as Alternative 3 (87 percent of all spills occurring beyond 3 nm). Overall, the no removal action is the only spill response option for approximately 13 percent of spills beyond 3 nm from shore (Appendix E, Table E.5-1). 2.8.1. Alternative 1\u2014No Action (No Change to Response Plan Regulations) Alternative 1 would rely on mechanical recovery only. As noted above, mechanical recovery is potentially suitable in 71 percent of all spills of 1,000 gal or greater occurring beyond 3 nm from shore. From 1993 to 1998, there were 79 such spills, so mechanical recovery might have been useful in 56 spill re sponses around the country, an average of 9.3 oil spill responses per year. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-27 2009 2. Alternatives 2.8.2. Alternative 2\u2014Increase On-Water Mechanical Recovery Capability and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability As noted in Section 2.6.2, adding more mechanical recovery equipment would not increase the number of opportunities to potentially use that equipment. The Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans (Table 5-1 in USCG, 2009, and Appendix D in this PEIS) also concluded that adding additional mechanical equipment to an individual spill would not result in a measurable increase in the quantity of oil recovered in the incident. Therefore, Alternativ e 2 would not result in any changes relative to Alternative 1. 2.8.3. Alternative 3\u2014Increase On-Water Mechanical Recovery Capability, Establish On-Water Dispersant Application Capability (Option A), Establish In Situ Burn Credit, and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability The Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans (USCG, 2009) estimated that a spill size of 40 bbl (1,680 gal) is the lower threshold at which dispersant operations might be considered practicable. Based on that estimate and data in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), from 1993 to 1998 there were a total of 52 oil spill responses around the country (App endix E, Table E.3-2) where dispersants might have been useful in response, for an average of 8.7 oil spill responses per year. Of the 52 spills, 32 spills occurred in the Gulf of Mexico or Alaska regions. As indicated in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), dispersant capability is already maintained in these regions at levels similar to those anticipated in the proposed regulations. Therefore, no increase in chemical dispersion is anticipated in these regions as a result of this action, and there will be no in crease in dispersant operations or aircraft emissions in these regions over and above Alternative 1. Impacts from chemical dispersion in these regions are estima ted as part of Alternative 1. Under Alternative 3, the key change would be to ensure the uniform availability of dispersant capability in the four regions \u2014Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania \u2014 where appropriate response times cannot currently be met. Alternative 3 requires dispersant Option A (Table 2.6-1), which requi res slightly less delivery capacity under Tier 1 (0-12 hours) than Option B. For the purpose of this analysis, however, the USCG estimated how much oil could be treated during response operations based only on Option B (Appendix D). This was done to simplify the analysis and to ensure that exposure to dispersants and dispersed oil in the water column was considered at the highest potential levels. For Alternatives 3, 4, and 5, there are 20 potentially dispersible spills occurring outside the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, for an av erage of 3.3 spills per year. The largest of these spills was 25,200 gal, with the average spill size being 6,723 gal. As noted in Section 2.6.2, a dding more mechanical recovery equipment would not increase the number of opportunities to poten tially use that equipment. The Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans ((USCG, 2009)), and Appendix D in this PEIS) also concluded that adding additional mechanical equipment to an individual spill would not result in a measurable increase in the quantity of oil recovered in the incident. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-28 2009 2. Alternatives The Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans (USCG, 2009) estimated that a spill size of 563 bbl (23, 646 gal) is the lower threshold at which in situ burn operations might be considered practicable. Based on that estimate and data in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), from 1993 to 1998 there were a total of four oil spill responses around the co untry (Appendix E, Table E.4-1) where in situ burning capability might have been useful in response, for an average of 0.7 oil spill responses per year. There are no spills where in situ burning is feasible when mechanical recovery is not, as they are applied to the same spill subset. Thus, rather than requiring in situ burn equipment to be added, credit (reduction in required mechanical recovery equipment under contract) is offered to planholders operating in areas where in situ burning is pre-authorized. 2.8.4. Alternative 4\u2014Increase On-Water Mechanical Recovery Capability, Establish On-Water Dispersant Application Capability (Option B), Establish In Situ Burn Credit, and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability Based on the previous sections, only the establishment of on-water dispersant application capability as discussed under Alternative 3 would result in any change to historical use patterns. Thus, the changes resulting from Alterative 4 are identical to those reported for Alternative 3 in Section 2.8.3. Adding more mechanical recovery equipment, as noted in Section 2.6.2, would not increase the number of opportunities to potentially us e that equipment. Despite the addition of in situ burn capabilities, there would not be any spills where in situ burning is feasible when mechanical recovery is not, as both are applied to the same spill subset. An option to maintain an in situ burn credit for planholders operating in areas where in situ burning is pre-authorized may result in a reduction in required mechanical recovery equipment under contract; however, the ability to respond to a spill would remain unchanged. 2.8.5. Alternative 5\u2014No Increase in Mechanical Recovery Capability, Establish On-Water Dispersant Application Capability (Option B), and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability [Preferred Alternative] Based on the previous sections, only the establishment of on-water dispersant application capability as discussed under Alternative 3 would result in any change to historical use patterns. Thus, the changes resulting from Alterative 5 are identical to those reported for Alternative 3 in Section 2.8.3 2.8.6. Alternative 6\u2014No Increase in Mechanical Recovery Capability, Establish On-Water Dispersant Application Capability (Option B), Establish In Situ Burn Credit, and Establish and Maintain Aerial Tracking Capability Based on the previous sections, only the establishment of on-water dispersant application capability as discussed under Alternative 3 would result in any change to historical use patterns. Thus, the changes resulting from Alterative 6 are identical to those reported for Alternative 3 in Section 2.8.3. A spill response situation could arise \u2014for example, in rotten Arctic ice or in certain wetland situations \u2014where, because of physical problems or safety concerns, mechanical Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-29 2009 2. Alternatives recovery might not be possible, but in situ burning would be feasible. The option to maintain an in situ burn credit for planholders operating in areas where in situ burning is pre-authorized may result in a reduction in required mechanical recovery equipment under contract; however, the ability to respon d to a spill would re main unchanged. 2.9. M ITIGATION The main goals of response effort are (1) ensuring public and responder safety, (2) securing the spill source, and (3) mitigating actual and potential adverse impacts. Final determination of which response strategy \u2014or combination of alternatives \u2014to use in an oil spill response is made jointly by the FOSC and State On-Scene Coordinators working in cooperation with the responsible party in the UC managing the response effort. This process in itself serves as a mitigation strategy since response actions and decisions are the result of the interaction among response experts, environmental professionals, and natural resource trustees, focusing on mitigating the adverse environmental impact of a specific spill. In addition, as previously described, in most cases chemical dispersion, in situ burning, or other chemical countermeasures are specifically prohibited without the incident-specific approval of USEPA and the affected state resource agencies, in consultation with the natural resource trustees. This incident-specific approval requirement process (40 CFR 300.910) is intended as a mechanism to mitigate any potential or actual adverse impacts of the oil spill and the response measure for which approval is being sought. The NCP recognizes, however, that as with any emergency response activity, advanced planning has the potential to significantly enhance the effectiveness of response actions and thus mitigate potential unintended damages. In doing so, th e NCP makes the response community responsible for planning for potential chemical dispersion, in situ burning, and other chemical countermeasures in advance of a spill incident. In addition, it charges the response community with pre-planning for the potential use of those alternative response st rategies if the natural resource trustees in that community determine that such a pre-authorization agreement could enhance protection of public health and welfare, and the en vironment (59 FR 178, September 1994). Thus, a pre-authorization agreement represents an endorsement by the technical experts of the local natural resource trustees for the potential use of the pre-authoriz ed strategy in minimizing environmental damage when used in accordance with the procedures of a pre-authorization agreement. On the other hand, absence of a pre-authorization agreement represents evidence that the natural resource trustees have not determined general circumstances in which a particular response alternative is expected to provide significant environmental bene fit, as related to endangered species and other environmental concerns. In addition, the SMART protocol, which was developed by the USCG, USEPA, NOAA, and CDC as members of the NRT, describes a specific methodology for conducting both dispersant and in situ burn monitoring activities. These activities are intended to monitor the ongoing effectiveness of individual resp onse strategies in mitigating spill impacts in a specific event. Monitoring the effectiveness of the response alternative could mitigate potential environmental impacts since it allows the response team to eval uate the effectiveness of the response efforts and assess the viability and potential effe ct of its continued use. This is particularly important for those cases in which response efforts do not produce projected results, and monitoring allows the response team to redirect response efforts accordingly. Finally, in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 300, the NCP has allowed most regions in the United States to pre-authorize chemical dispersion and in situ burning under certain circumstances. As previously mentioned, these pre-authorization agreements are generally restricted Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-30 2009 2. Alternatives to oil spills occurring more than 3 nm from shore and require the dispersant to be listed on the NCP Product Schedule. In addition, all pre-authorization agreements in place within the United States require the use of SMART or similar monitoring protocols to assess the effectiveness of the response alternative in a specific incident (USCG, 1999). In the few regions of the United States where pre-authorization agreements are not in place, the local response o fficials generally do not actually use dispersants and in situ burning, since consensus approval by the response community usually cannot be achieved in a timely fashion to a llow for effective use. See Appendix A for more information. 2.10. E NVIRONMENTAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK APPLICABLE TO OIL SPILL RESPONSE OPERATIONS Oil spill response operations are subject to environmental protection requirements of federal legislation, Presidential Executive Orders, and inte rnational treaties that the United States has signed and ratified. Appendix K summarizes the major international and federal environmental laws and executive orders that the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) must comply with or implement during oil spill response. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2-31 2009 2. Alternatives ENDNOTE * By mandate, USCG considered a 1998 response capabilities target of 25 percent increase in mechanical recovery capability above the 1993 levels (OPA 90). The Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1998) resulted in the decision for a 25 percent increase for on-water mechanical recovery response capabilities fo r tank vessel and MTR facility response plans. This decision became effective in 2000 (65 FR 710, January 6, 2000) and represents the current level of mechanical recovery capability. This 2000, 25 percent increase was considered feasible because of the potential to remove more oil from the environment and provide greater environmental protection. In accordance with this decision and OPA 90, the USCG was al so obligated to consider via the regulatory process, an additional 25 percent increase for on-water mechanical recovery capability and requirements for other removal technologies. The USCG regulatory process included a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), a regulatory analysis, and a PEIS, all leading to an appropriate final rule. The USCG determined that while the regulatory analysis (USCG, 2002) needed to be completed prior to publication of the NPRM, the PEIS only needed to be completed prior to the pub lication of a final rule. Both the regulatory analysis and PEIS were initiated in 2000 (February and October, respectively), and each used a common set of five alternatives on which to base their analysis. The regulatory analysis\u2014Regulatory Analysis for Changes to Vessel and Facility Response Plans\u2014 was completed in February 2002. The analysis of the alternatives in the regulatory analysis conclude d that there would not be any benefit to the environment derive d from an additional 25 percent increase in on-water mechanical r ecovery above the current capability. This was based on the conclusion that more oil could not be removed from the en vironment by requiring a 25 pe rcent increase in mechanical recovery. Thus, the NPRM proposed Alternative 5 as the preferred alternative rather than Alternative 2 based on economic, environmental and practicable operational considerations. The PEIS, which was initiated prior to the NPRM, continued to consider all original alternatives equally from an environmental impacts perspective. Thus, the PEIS considers the impacts to the environment of a 25 percent increase in mechanical recovery capability equal to the current mechanical recovery capability with the addition of aerial tracking. To prevent redundancy in the current alternatives, Altern ative 2 also represents the curr ent mechanical recovery capability plus aerial tr acking because the scoping process, Area Committee investigations, public input, Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), and public responses to th e NOI were already developed and the preliminary PEIS was already drafted upon obtaining this information.

Resources for Analysis This chapter provides the environmental baseline physical, biological, social, and economic conditions that occur within the regions where the use of the proposed alternatives can be applied1. The information in this section provides the basis for potential impact analysis at a programmatic level. Only those environmental and socioeconomic conditions relevant to the programmatic-level discussion are presented \u2014 including water resources, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, marine transportation, and public health and safety \u2014and are analyzed in Chapter 4 for environmental impacts. Although ocean currents and climates are discussed in Chapter 3, these environmental characteristics are not analyzed in Chapter 4. 3.1.2. Resources or Elements Dismissed from Analysis Geology\u2014None of the proposed alternatives would impact geological formations since the majority of response actions would take place on the surface of the water. Soils\u2014None of the proposed alternatives would impact soils since the majority of response operations would take place on the surface of the water. Visual\u2014 Response operations would take place in marine waters, away from the majority of the viewing public. In addition, these response operations are likely to be short in duration and unlikely to impose long-term visual problems. Environmental Justice (element of the Socioeconomic Environment) \u2014None of the proposed alternatives would cause disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on low income, minority and tribal populations in the 1 The response options analyzed and discussed in this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) \u2014mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion\u2014are for on-water recovery.

Affected Environment: Introduction United States, as defined by Executive Order 12898 (\"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,\" 59 FR 7629). 3.1.3. Areas of Influence The proposed action could pot entially affect all areas in which oil spill response operations could occur, including marine waters of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the coasts of the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories (Figure 3.1-1). The proposed regulations that this PEIS supports only apply to waters where dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore with the exception of several areas with dispersant pre-authorization agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (> 0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm and >60 ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef <20 ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements 2. Although the affected environment includes both nearshore and offshore areas, the PEIS emph asizes nearshore and onshore resources, as the risk analysis shows those areas to be most vulnerable to the impacts of spilled oil and response operations. The underlying rationale for the establishment of dispersant pre-authorization agreements closer than 3 nm from shore is the ability of the environment in these locations to provide reasonable dilution over a shorter distance due to depth and hydrodynamic conditions. This PEIS also addresses marine waters where dispersant pre-authorization agreements are not in place \u2014American Samoa, Guam, and Commo nwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). These areas are included for completeness, and their inclusion does not signify intent to apply the proposed regulations to these areas. In addition although the Notice of Proposed Rule-Making (NPRM) (67 FR 63331, October 11, 2002) states that the alternatives will address the inland op erating environment, this PEIS does not consider the inland operating envir onment because there are currently no pre-authorization agreements for the inland operating environment. If pre-authorization agreements are adopted for the inland operating environment (the USEPA has primary responsibility for deciding whether a pre-authorization agreement is appropriate in this operating environment), a supplemental NEPA process would be extended to this operating environment. The decision whether to pre-authorize in situ burning and chemical dispersion or to authorize their use in a specific incident is unaffected by the proposed regulations and this PEIS. Those d ecisions properly remain within the purview of the local area response community and the Regional Response Team in the area at risk. To address the substantial differences within different geographical regions and to maintain the programmatic scope of the analysis, the area of influence is delineated into the following regions: The Atlantic region covers the waters extending from the Gulf of Maine to the east coast of Florida terminating at the Florida Straits and out to the EEZ. 2 http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-2 2009 3.1.

Background on the Aquatic Ecosystem This section provides a general description of the ecology of aquatic ecosystems to highlight the inherent difficulty in evaluating the potential impacts associated with human activities on marine and coastal resources. Firstly, it describes the structure, function, and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, highlightin g their complexity and dynamic nature. This section also portrays the importance of unders tanding the interactions among the physical, chemical, and biological components and processes of the system to understand aquatic ecosystem dynamics, and thus the potentia l impacts associated with anthropogenic influences, such as those caused by oil spills . Lastly, it provides the rationale for the division of resources (within each region analyz ed in this PEIS) into physical, biological, and socioeconomic categories to aid in the analysis of the environmental consequences presented in Chapter 4. Aquatic ecosystems are dynamic in nature, cons isting of interdependent relationships among the physical, chemical, and biological components and processes that compose and characterize the system. Analys es of aquatic ecosystems and anthropogenic impacts involve consideration of the structure (species composition and relative abundance) and function (energy flow and nutrient cycling) of these ecosystems, as well as the ecological value and roles played by specific habita ts and organisms, and their interactions within the ecosystems. Together, ecosystem structure and function desc ribe the complex processes that define the ecology of a system, including predator -prey relationships, grazing, nutrient cycling, and other interactions of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Aquatic organisms are not static, isolated units that merely occupy space in the water column and the benthic environment of aquatic ecosystems; they interact with the physical, chemical, and biological environment. Although aquatic ecosystems differ widely in terms of size, complexity, and species composition, they are characterized by the continuous exchange of energy and matte r. In simple terms, aquatic plants and chemosynthetic organisms, which obtain energy from the sun and chemicals, respectively, and transform simple inorganic chemicals into food, are grazed by herbivores that are consumed, in turn, by predators. Other types of organisms \u2014principally microbes (fungi and bacteria)\u2014decompose and convert organic tissue into simpler inorganic compounds that can be taken up by aquatic plants in ph otosynthesis. Microbes may also be consumed as food by other organisms. Microorganisms play a significant role in the aquatic ecosystem, and have been estimated to be gr eater movers of energy and matter than plankton because of their higher metabo lic rates per unit mass (Pomeroy, 1974). The interaction between aquatic organisms results in the flux of energy and matter through aquatic ecosystems. The recycling of chemical substances among various groups of organisms implies that aquatic ecosystems are basically self-contained from the standpoint of matter. In contrast, the flux of energy is characterized by the input of energy from an external source that must continually be replenished, as it cannot be reused. Unlike matter, which is recycled, energy flows in one direction through the various levels of the ecosystem and is dissipated at each stage as heat. Since most aquatic animals have varied diets and feed at two or more trophic levels, the trophic dynamics of aquatic ecosystems are highly complex and best represented as a food web \u2014a network of interconnected and interdependent food chains . Many species select prey on the basis of size rather than type, are omnivorous, or change food type as individuals grow. There are many organisms that feed on detrital matter from various sources. Food webs are further complicated by trophic \"loops\" in which a species feeds on organisms normally classified Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-4 2009 3.1. Affected Environment: Introduction as its consumers. Finally, the diversity in size, behavior, life history, distribution, and habitats of aquatic organisms, makes it difficult to make generalizations about the trophic dynamics within aquatic ecosystems. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-5 2009 3.1. Affected Environment: Introduction Aquatic populations can be affected by action of consumers (top-down control) and by supply of resources (bottom-up control). For example, resources (e.g., nutrients) affect marine producers (e.g., phytoplankton), producers affect consumers (e.g., zooplankton and fish), and consumers alter the abundance of their nutritional resources (e.g., phytoplankton and zooplankton) (Valiela, 1995). The species compositions and relative abundance of species in aquatic environments are determined by a tight intertwining of bottom-up and top-down controls (Valiela, 1995). The relative importance of the controls varies seasonally and depends on changing features of aquatic ecosystems, for example, nutrient supply, abundance of fish and prey organisms, light, temperature, and wave action. Abundance of prey and predators, and their growth rates, are tightly coupled, but are continually changing in response to external variables such as light and temperature and to the natural, evolutionary history of the organisms. An extensively studied example of the complex biological interactions that o ccur in aquatic ecosystems is provided by the interactions among the kelp forest, sea urchins, and sea otters in the Pacific coast of the United States (Valiela, 1995). The structure, function, and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems can only be understood by considering biological processes at the level of individual populations acting in concert with processes at the level of the entire community (Mann, 1988). Lo cal processes at the species level permanently change macroscopi c properties of the system, which then impose new constraints on the species them selves (Mann, 1988). As described above, biological interactions in aquatic ecosystems are highly complex. An additional layer of complexity to the understanding of the structure, function, and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems results from the close interaction of physical and biological processes, which plays an important role in structuring aquatic biological communities (Daly and Smith, 1993). Physical and biological processes prod uce and maintain the te mporal and spatial patterns of abundance, distribution, and species composition of organisms in aquatic ecosystems, thus directly influencing the pr ocesses that determine primary production and the flux of energy and matter in the ecosystem (Daly and Smith, 1993). Given the spatial and temporal variability of aquatic ecosystems and the complexity and interconnectedness of biological and physical interactions within these systems, human impacts to physical and chemical properties or to specific biological components of the system can have cascading effects throughout aquatic food webs, altering habitat structure, species composition at various trophi c levels, energy flow, and nutrient cycling. Thus, an understanding of the interactions among the physical, chemical and biological components and processes that compose and characterize these systems is crucial to understand both the ecology of the system and the potential impacts associated with anthropogenic influences, such as those caused by oil spills. The waters of the United States are a diverse assemblage of aquatic \u2014marine, estuarine, and freshwater \u2014ecosystems spread over diverse geographical regions. This Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) fo cuses on the regional- and national-level environmental and socioe conomic implications of oil spills under the alternatives. Oil spill impacts are mostly localized an d generally short lived. Thus, the analysis of physical and socioeconomic resources and of specific biological organisms and habitats provides relevant information to determine the potential impacts to marine and coastal resources and ecosystems in the event of an oil spill. In addition, the U.S. regulatory framework focuses on the protection of specific resources \u2014water quality; air quality; threatened, endangered, and candidate species; fisheries; and socioeconomi cs. Therefore, describing U.S. marine and coastal resources by dividing them into the physical, biological, and socioeconomic Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-6 2009 3.1. Affected Environment: Introduction categories, as presented in Chapters 3 and 4, allows for the evaluation of potential impacts on resources of concern from a regulatory standpoint. The regional dynamics and functional characteri stics of marine and coastal resources are identified and summarized in Sections 3.2 through 3.7. The biological resources presented for each region analyzed in this PEIS are orga nized according to biological groups that form the functional food web within each habitat. Th e description of resources provided for each region presents a general discussion of aquati c ecological principles, as well as a description of the basic functional components and regional variations that constitute the aquatic ecosystems of the United States. It includes a general description of the biological structure (organisms) and the basic functional components (food web and habitat interactions) within aquatic ecosystems. It also describes the econom ic importance of thes e ecosystems to the U.S. economy, including coastal communi ties, vessel transportation and ports, archaeological and cultural resources, recreational and commercial fishing, subsistence, coastal tourism, and public health and safety. 3.1.5. Essential Fish Habitat Congress recognized the importance of fish ha bitat to the productivity and sustainability of U.S. marine fisheries, and in 1996 added a new habitat conservation provision known as Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the federal law that governs U.S. marine fish eries management. The renamed Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Manageme nt Act (MSFCMA, Public Law 94-265, as amended through Octobe r 11, 1996; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) mandated the identification of EFH for all federally managed species for each of their life stages. The statute defines EFH as \"those waters and substrates necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity\" (16 U.S.C. 1802(10)). This definition is further interpreted under the EFH guidelines (50 CFR 600.10). The act mandates the designation of specific geographic areas as EFH and the subsequent conservation of these areas to minimize adverse effects on habitat caused by fishing and nonfishing activities. In Section 303(a)(7) of the amended MSFCMA , Congress directs the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) an d the regional Fish Management Councils, under the authority of the Secretary of Commerce, to Describe and identify EFH for all federally managed fisheries species for each of their life stages Minimize, to the extent practicable, the adverse effects of fishing on EFH Identify other actions to encourage the conservation and enhancement of EFH EFH designations can be found within each Fishery Management Plan (FMP) developed by the regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) and implemented by NMFS. The EFH Web site 3 contains links to pages that present th e Secretary-approved council EFH textual descriptions and identifi cations, and available geographical representations. The life history information provided by these pages will aid federal agency's further understanding of an action's ecological impacts on EFH. 3 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/habit atprotection/efh/fish_manage_c.htm Final PEIS for VRPs and Oil 3-7 2009 3.1. Affected Environment: Introduction 3.1.5.1. Habitat Areas of Particular Concern The EFH regulations encourage regional FMCs to identify Habitat Areas of particular Concern (HAPCs) within areas designated as EFH to focus conservation priorities on specific habitat areas that play a particularly important role in the life cycles of federally managed fish species. The intent of NMFS in encouraging the designation of HAPCs is to help focus conservation efforts on localized areas that are vulnerable to degradation or especially important ecologically. HAPCs should be subsets of the total area necessary to support healthy stocks of fish throughout all of their life stages. The EFH regulations require that designation of specific HAPCs be based on one or more of the following c onsiderations (50 CFR 600.815(a)(8)): The importance of the ecological function provided by the habitat The extent to which the habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradation Whether and to what extent development activities are or will be stressing the habitat The rarity of the habitat type The location of any HAPCs and the pote ntial impact of oil spill response techniques on these areas should be taken into account when planning or implementing oil spill response strategies. If oil spill response activities should occur within a HAPC, or will likely im pact a HAPC, special considerations should be made that reflect the importance of these areas for maintaining sustainable fisheries and those species contribution to a healthy ecosystem. 3.1.5.2. Consulting on Impacts to EFH Section 1855(b)(2) of the MSFCMA require s federal agencies to consult with NMFS with respect to \"any action au thorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken, by such agency that may adversely affect any Essential Fish Habitat identified under this act.\" Adverse effects to EFH are defined further as \"any impact that reduces the quality and/or quantity of EFH,\" and may incl ude \"site-specific or habitat-wide impacts, including individual, cumulative, or synergistic consequences of actions\" (50 CFR 600.810(a). The consultation process allows NMFS to make a determination of the project's effects on EFH and provide conservation recommendations to the lead agency on actions that would adversely affect such habitat ( see 16 U.S.C. 1855(b)(4)(A)). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-8 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region 3.2. A TLANTIC REGION 3.2.1. Physical Environment For the purpose of this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS), the Atlantic region will specifically cover the wate rs extending from the Gulf of Maine to the Florida Straits (Figure 3.1-1). This extensive region comprises the waters of the Gulf of Maine, the estuarine-dominated waters of so uthern New England and Mid-Atlantic Bight, to the waters off the east coast of Florida. Fifteen states border this region: Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Co nnecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Caroli na, Georgia, and the east coast of Florida. See Appendix F.2 for mo re information on currents of the Atlantic region 3.2.1.1. Water Quality Coastal The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USE PA, 1998a) compiled state assessments of the Atlantic region water quality within estuaries and coastal waters in its 305(b) report. Maine was found to be the state with the highest water quality with greater than 99 percent of all estuaries and coastal waters having good water quality able to fully support aquatic life. Delaware had the lowest water quality, with 86 percent of all estuaries and coastal waters having poor water quality unable to support aquatic life. The remainder of the states within this region varied greatly in the level of water quality exhibited within estuaries and coastal waters. Primary activities that contribute to the degradation of coastal water quality include those associated with agricultur e, urban runoff, septic tanks, storm sewers, industrial plants, and wastewater treatment facilities. Secondary activities include land modifications for flood contro l, river development, harbors, docks, navigation channels, and pipelines. The resulting environmental degradation may be manifested as diseased fishes, turbid and oily waters, noxious odors, hypoxic conditions, pathogenic contamination of bathing waters and shellfish beds, degraded benthic communities, restri cted distributions of fishes, and fish and shellfish tainted with bacteria and hydrocarbons (USEPA, 1998a). Marine Marine water quality in the Atlantic region is controlled by ocean circulation that, in the Mid-Atlantic, is dominated by gyres. The water quality in this area generally is good, principally because marine waters are quite a distance from the sources of shore-based pollution and because of the Gulf Stream's influence. For the most part, Gulf Stream water is relatively unpolluted oceanic w ater; only some slope water, with its higher pollutant load, is entrained by, and becomes part of, Gulf Stream waters. Pollutants that do occu r in the Gulf Stream originate from atmospheric rainout and from the discharg e of bilges and bunker washings by ships (MMS, 1990). Ambient conditions supporting marine life in the offshore waters are affected to only a small degree from manmade inputs. The Atlantic region covers a very broa d area with several major ports located throughout its coastal area. Maritime vessels transport millions of tons of cargo Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-9 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region each year. The large volume of vessel traffic causes marine transport in this region to be responsible for 1.7 percent of all oil spills reported in the United States. In 1999 alone, there were 148 reported oil spills (USCG, 2000a). 3.2.1.2. Meteorology and Air Quality Climate Meteorological conditions on the Atlantic coast are dominated by two semipermanent pressure centers: Ic elandic Low and Bermuda High. The location of these centers varies by seas on and they alternate in dominating the pressure and circulation patterns of the region (USCG, 1996). Wind speeds fluctuate depending on the time of year. For example, in the summer months the average wind speed for the region is 4 to 21 nm/hr, whereas in the winter the average wind speed increases to 4 to 33 nm/hr (MMS, 1990). Tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes), tropical storms, and northeasters are the most significant and powerful meteorological phenomena affecting the Atlantic region. Tropical storms and hurri canes impact the coast on the average of once every 10 years. Strong northeasters impact the coast more frequently than hurricanes and supply much of the rain or snow in late autumn, winter, and spring (NOAA and GaDNR, 1997). Air Quality Air quality of coastal counties 4 is measured against National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), resulting from the Clean Air Act and its 1977 amendments (40 CFR 50.12), or it is measured against more restrictive adopted state standards. These standards are designed to protect human health. The USEPA requires states to report ambient air quality leve ls for six major pollutants: particulate matter (10 microns or larger [PM10]), su lfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone. NAAQS have be en adopted by each of the Atlantic region's states except Florida, which amended these standards to make sulfur dioxide emission levels more restrictiv e than the federal standard. Appendix F, Table F.1-1 summarizes federal ambient air standards in detail. All coastal counties of the Atlantic regi on are considered to be in compliance with the NAAQS attainment levels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. However, there were many counties that were not in compliance for the remaining three pollutants: sixty-four counties were not in compliance for ozone, seventeen for carbon monoxide, and two for particulate matter (PM10) (USEPA, 2000a). 4 The Office of Ocean Resources, Conservation and Assessment (ORCA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce classifies counties as coastal \"because they meet one of the following criteria: (1) at least 15 percent of their total land area is located within the nation's coastal watersheds (as defi ned by ORCA's Coastal Assessment Framework [ http://spo.nos.noaa.gov/projects/caf/caf.html], or (2) the county accounts for at least 15 percent of the land area of a coastal cataloging unit (a U.S. Geological Survey-defined drainage basin)\" (http://spo.nos.noaa.gov/projec ts/population/population.html). The U.S. Bureau of the Census also uses ORCA's coastal counties list. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-10 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region 3.2.2. Biological Environment5 3.2.2.1. Marine Mammals The Atlantic region is expansive and co ntains a wide variety of environments. These environments allow a diverse group of marine mammals to inhabit the region. A variety of marine mammal species \u2014twenty-three cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), five pinnipeds (seals), and one sirenian (manatee) reside or migrate along this coast. There are ninety-one stocks and thirty-nine species of marine mammals in this region, of which the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus ) is the most common cetacean and is found in coastal and offshore environments from the northe astern Atlantic region down to the southeastern tip of Florida (NMFS, 1999). In the north, the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata ) is the third most commonly sighted whale along the East Coast of the United States. Appendix F, Table F.2-1 lists twenty-one recognized nonendangered marine mammals in this region. 3.2.2.2. Marine and Coastal Birds Migrant and resident marine and coastal birds are found throughout the Atlantic region because of extensive habitats. Th e majority of these species are nearly year-round residents in one or more areas along the coast. In the winter, southern populations of shorebirds are augmented by large numbers of wintering marine, freshwater, or terrestrial birds from more northern ecosystems. A variety of marine and coasta l bird species are also identified. At least twenty marine bird species nest regularly in the northern Atlantic region, while nine others irregularly nest there or in the near vicinity (USGS, 1998a). Schneider and Heinemann (1996) complete d a recent overview of predominant marine birds inhabiting this region. Gulls, terns, and herons are important species breeding within the ecosystem. Other species of marine birds that do not breed in the ecosystem are nevertheless important and occupy two ecological regi mes within the ecosystem, coastal and pelagic. In the coastal zone, plovers, sandpipers, and other shorebirds are important predators of beach and intertidal invertebrates. Sixty-three nearshore and pelagic birds were found during dozens of birding trips off the coast of Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina (USGS, 1998a). Twenty-five species of seabirds were observed off east-central Florida (USGS, 1998a). The presence of six Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) sites, seven Ramsar sites, and seventy- nine National Wildli fe Refuges in the Atlantic region indicates that large numbers of shorebirds (WHSRN sites) and wetland birds (Ramsar sites) concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. The WHSRN main tains a network of monitoring sites comprising critical habitat for shorebird species. These sites are categorized as hemispheric with an annual count of 500,000 shorebirds or 30 percent of a species flyway population; international with an annual count of 100,000 shorebirds or 10 percent of a species flyway population; and regional with an annual count of 20,000 shorebirds or 5 percent of a species flyway population. 5 Only nonendangered species will be included in Section 3. 2.2, Biological Environment. Threatened, endangered, and candidate species will be discussed separately in Section 3.2. 3, Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species. For this reason, sea turtles will only be discussed in Sect ion 3.2.3, as they are a threatened/end angered species in the Atlantic region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-11 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region The six WHSRN sites in the Atlantic region include one hemispheric, two international, and three regional sites (WHS RN, 2004). The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands designates Ramsar sites as wetlands of international importance. These wetlands are selected based on criteria such as supporting 20,000 or more waterbirds and regularly supporting 1 percen t of the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of waterbird (Wetlands International, 2004). The National Wildlife Refuge sites are established under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 with the aim of protecting wildlife and preserving biological diversity (USFWS, 2004). Marine birds are showing signs of stress. Probably the most pressing issue regarding the health of bird populations is the continued rapid development of the region due to increased human populations, resulting in the destruction of habitat for both birds and the organisms supporting their food chain. For the purpose of this PEIS, marine and coastal birds are categorized into five major groups, as detailed in Appendix F, Table F.2-2: seabirds, shorebirds, wading and marsh and raptors. 3.2.2.3. Plankton and Fish Plankton Plankton are organisms that float at or near the surface of marine waters and are unable to swim against tides, winds, or currents. Plankton species, which represent nearly all major aquatic phyla, can be roughly classified as phytoplankton (microscopic plant life), zooplankton (microscopic animals), and ichthyoplankton (fish eggs and larvae). Because the temperate waters of the Atlantic region provide a sufficient habitat for these organisms, these plankton species are distributed throughout the region from the coastal waters of Maine to the water off the southeastern tip of Florida. Phytoplankton are microscopic floating algae, which form the base of the food web. They are responsible for approximat ely one-half of global photosynthesis and play a vital role in stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide. These plants can only survive in the shallower, sunlit wate rs of open-ocean and estuarine areas. Phytoplankton communities in the Atlantic region consist of diatoms, dinoflagellates, and flagellates, which phytoplankton, spend either part (meroplankton) or all (holoplankton) of their life cycle as plankton. Their temporal and spatial distributions depend on a number of factors including currents, water temperature, and phytoplankton abundance (Loeb et al., 1983). Zooplankton are a critical link in the transfer of energy from primary producers (phytoplankton) to apex predators, so any process influenc ing the abundance and distribution of zooplankton can ultimately have an im pact on fisheries. The most common classes of zooplankton found in the Atlantic region for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-12 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: present year-round within the region; however, the annual distribution and abundance of their eggs and larvae may be highly variable depending on the season and location (Smith et al., 1981). Larvae of commercially and recreationally important estuarine-dependent species, such as croaker dominant components of the ichthyoplankton community. Genera lly there are two different kinds of ichthyoplankton denoting different life history types \u2014mesopelagic (marine waters) and estuarine-dependent species. Included in these categories are the families Bothidae, Clupeidae, Gadi dae, Gonostomatidae, for Oil 3-13 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region Fish The New England Fishery Council, Mid-Atlantic Fishery Council, and South Atlantic Fishery Council (see Section 3.2.4) manage the commercial fisheries of the Atlantic region. The commercial yield of fish by weight in the Atlantic region was 685,695 metric tons in 2000 (NMFS, 2003a). Large numbers of groundfish, pelagic, reef fish, several ty pes of tuna and billfishes an d shellfish species occur in this area including many migratory and transboundary species, such as Atlantic lists the commercially important fish sp ecies of the Atlantic region. In addition to fish species, shellfish are an important component to the fisheries industry. From Maine to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, approved shellfish growing areas cover more than 1,000 mi 2 in 1998. Further south, the area from Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, to Chesapeake Bay, Virg inia, has an approved shellfish growing area of approximately 6,300 mi2. From this area alone, approximately 1.1 billion l b s of s ea food w e re lan de d i n 1 9 89 . See Appendix F, Table F.2-2 for a list of commercially important fish species in the Atlantic region. Commercially important marine arthropods include lobsters, crayfish, crabs and shrimp. Mollusks, or members of the ph ylum Mollusca, are also important to the region. Mollusks are bilaterally symmetrical invertebrates such as clams, octopuses, and squid. Fish stocks in the Atlantic region have declined \u2014in some cases severely \u2014over the past 20 years. Pollution, coastal development, and overexploitation have taken a large toll on the fishery stocks of this region (SAFMC, 2002). Improved fishing technology, coupled with habitat-degrad ing fishing techniques, a high age of breeding maturity for certain species (e.g., cod), and overexploitation of spawning grounds in international waters have had additional detrimental impacts to the fish stocks of the region. As such, there are a variety of species that are managed through permitting and quotas, as well as a series of state and federal management plans geared to increase population levels. 3.2.2.4. Intertidal Habitats Beaches and Coastal Barrier Islands The Atlantic region has 25,108 mi of shoreline (Good et al., 1998). Parts of the Atlantic coast are lined with barrier island s, with the largest concentration located from the Cape Cod segment of the Massachusetts coast to islands off the coast of Georgia, with a very heavy concentration off the shores of No rth Carolina. These coastal barriers are elongated landforms consisting of unconsolidated materials (typically sand) that shift frequently and rapidly in response to storms, winds, and tides. These landforms provide important habitat for many species and protect inland areas, wetlands, and estuaries from the brunt of ocean storms (Congressional Research Servi ce Report 97-588 ENR, 1997). Except for some northern portion of the Atlantic region (such as Maine where only 1 percent of the coastline is sandy beach), much of the region's oceanfront consists of sandy beach-dune areas. Beach areas are particularly important in providing protection from storms, high tides, and wave action for the lagoons, sounds, wetlands, and low gr ound located landward of most beaches. Natural dune areas found landward of sandy beaches often support seabirds, shorebirds, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-14 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region waterfowl, and a dune grass or shrub community. The coastal beaches are also important for their economic integrity in terms of tourism and recreation. However, because of natural forces and human activities such as seawall and channel jetties, the average shoreline retr eat for the Atlantic region seaboard is reported at about 2.0 ft /yr (Heinz Center, 2000). Estuaries, Wetlands, Mud Flats, and Mangroves Estuaries are important habitats for both resident and transitory species, providing spawning or nursery habitats and foraging areas for numerous species, including invertebrates, fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. High organic productivity, high detritus production, and extensive nutrient recycling characterize estuaries. Some familiar examples of estuaries in the Atlantic region are the Boston Harbor and Chesapeake Bay. Many different habitat types are found in and around estuaries, including wetlands, mud and sand flats, mangroves, and submerged grass beds. See Appendix F, Table F.2-3 and F.2-4 for estuary locations in the north and south Atlantic regions, respectively. Wetland habitats are associated with estu arine areas. These habitats may occupy only narrow bands along the shore, or they may cover larger expanses at the mouths of bays, rivers, or coastal streams. Wetland habitats occurring along the Atlantic coast include salt marshes (colonized by salt-tolerant grasses and bushes), tidal mud flats (areas that are exposed at low tide and are densely packed with shellfish, invertebrates, crabs, and other organisms), freshwater marshes, forests, and shrub lands. Coastal wetlands and estuaries are highly productive, yet fragile, environments that support a great diversity of fish and wildlife species. The Atlantic region has 22,907 mi 2 of wetlands along the Atlantic seaboard, most of which are located predominantly south of New York because these coastal areas have not been glaciate d (Good et al., 1998). The Mid-Atlantic wetlands are composed of two-thirds salt marshes; the majority of the remaining balance is tidal mud flats. Because of widespread urbanization of the Atlantic coastline, the loss of wetland ranges from 31 percent in New England to 47 percent in the southeast Atlantic (Good et al., 1998). Mud flats and swamps occur in areas of low-wave energy. These areas tend to act as sediment sinks, trapping nutrient s that support a variety of plants, fish, birds, and mammals. Mud flats exist along the shores of many of the bays and sounds; the most extensive mud flats are found along the shores of the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Mangroves are found in tropical and subtr opical tidelands in specific areas of the Atlantic region. They primarily grow al ong the coast of central and southeast Florida, beginning near St. Augustine an d continuing down into the Gulf of Mexico. The three most important specie s of mangroves in this area are red protect habitats and nurseries for fish, crustaceans, and shellfish; provide food for marine species; and provide shoreline protection from wind, waves, and floods. Mangrove s are sensitive to cold temperatures and can take 5 to 10 years to reestablish their presence Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-15 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region following a freeze. In addition to freezing, several human activities \u2014ditching or impounding for mosquito control, reduci ng freshwater input, and clearing and filling\u2014 lead to the degradation of mangrove quantity and quality. 3.2.2.5. Subtidal Habitats Submerged Grass Beds The subtidal (benthic) areas of the Atlantic region consist of either soft or rocky substrates. These areas support a variety of marine life and habitats, including seagrass beds and coral reefs. Seagrass be ds provide critical food, shelter, and nursery grounds for many species of w aterfowl, shellfish, fish, and other organisms. They also stabilize shifting sediment and generate oxygen. Seagrass communities also support several threatened and endangered species, including sea turtles and manatees. Seagrass beds are fo und throughout the Atlantic region in shallow coastal areas except Georgia and South Carolina, where freshwater inflow, high turbidity, and tidal amplitude combine to inhibit growth (ASMFC, 1997). Appendix F. Figure F.2-5 provides the range of submerged grass beds in this region. Within the Atlantic Region the dominant species are eelgrass of Halophila . The first three species occur primarily from North Carolina northward, while the rest occur predomin antly in Florida (T hayer et al., 1997). In one area of the Mid-Atlantic re gion, seagrass beds cover 200,000 acres (MMS, 1990). On the east coast of Florida \u2014Bayton Beach to New Smyrna Beach (Ponce de Leon Inlet) \u2014nearshore seagrass coverage is appr oximately 100,000 acres (Florida Department of Community Affairs, 2000). Increasing human use of coastal areas throughout the Atlantic region has resu lted in loss of seagrass beds through construction, recreation, harbor and ch annel maintenance, and water pollution. Coral Reefs Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive communities on earth. They buffer adjacent shorelines from wave action, thus protecting coastal environments and reducing erosion. Reefs also provide economic benefits in terms of pharmaceutical research, commercial and recreational fisheries, and cost reduction through the miti gation of property damage. Thirty-nine designated coral reefs, ranging from southern tip of South Carolina to the Upper Florida Keys, are located in this region (Appendix F). The northernmost reef in this region is Gray's Reef (a designated National Marine Sanctuary), and the southernmost reef in this region is Coffins Patch in the Upper Florida Keys. Gray's Reef is one of the largest nearshore live-bottom reefs of the southeastern United States. Located off the coast of Georgia, it encompasses 17 nm 2 of live-bottom habitat. In the Upper Florida Keys (part of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary), the most common coral reef species are Boulder star coral (Montastrea annularis ), star FRPs for Oil 3-16 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region Coral reefs are vulnerable to environmental changes, including the impacts of human activities. Environmental influences, such as temperature changes, sea- level fluctuations, and storm events, can negatively impact reefs via coral bleaching, lack of sunlight, and ph ysical damage. Vessel groundings and anchorings, dredging, destructive fishing practices, overfishing, pollution from poor land use, chemical loading, marine debris, and invasive alien species each contribute to the loss of coral reefs. Wi despread loss of nearshore and offshore corals in the southern Atlantic Oc ean is well documented, as is their replacement with fleshy algae, which are known to flourish in elevated concentrations of phosphate and nitrate. See Appendix F, Figure F.2-6 3.2.2.6. Areas of Special Concern Executive Order 13158 (\"Marine Protecte d Areas\") defines marine protected areas as \"any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cu ltural resources therein\" (65 FR 34909) . There are many different types of marine protected areas within and bordering U.S. waters; some examples include National Marine Sanctuaries, National Seashores, National Parks, National Monuments, National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, and many others (NOAA, 2002a). They have different shapes, sizes, and mana gement characteristics and have been established for different purposes. The Atlantic region has three National Marine Sanctuaries, eleven National Park units, seventy-nine National Wildlife Refuges, eleven National Estuarine Research Reserves, twelve National Estuary Programs, and two National Estuarine Research Reserve-National Estuary Programs located in coastal or near-coastal areas. For more details rega rding history, purpose, and specific site locations pertaining to this region, see Appendix F, Tables F.2-3 through F.2-5 and Figures F.2-1 through F.2-4. 3.2.3. Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) an d National Marine Fish eries Service (NMFS) have classified eight threatened, seventeen endangered, and seven candidate species within the Atlantic region. These consist of seven mari ne mammals, nine marine and coastal birds, seven fish species, six sea turtles, one plant species, and two coral species. Six cetaceans and one sirenian are endangered and reside in and migrate through this region (Appendix F, Table F.2-6). They are ob served frequently in nearshore waters along the U.S. Atlantic coast at different times of year depending on migration and breeding patterns. Nine species of threatened and endangered ma rine and coastal birds reside in selected habitats provided by the Atlantic region (Appendix F, Table F.2-7). In the winter, the southern Atlantic region's populations of endangered shorebirds are augmented by large numbers of wintering individuals from northern ecosystems. Other endangered species reside temporarily along their route to South America. Bay, estuary, wetland, and coastal beach habitats provide the necessary biological diversity for a variety of protected migratory and indigenous bird species. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-17 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region Two endangered and five candidate fish specie s are supported in this region (Appendix F, Table F.2-8). In eight rivers, the wild Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) is at an all-time low and faces a number of threats that could driv e it to extinction. Shortnose sturgeon ( Acipenser brevirostrum ) is distributed as far south as Florida and as far north as New Brunswick, Canada. It once supported a substantial commercial fishery, but like other anadromous species, industrial use of rivers (beginning in th e 1800s) and overfishing adversely affect its population. Highly sought after for it s valuable caviar, Atlantic sturgeon ( Acipenser oxyrhynchus ) was typically found along the entire East Coast. Because of overfishing, it is now illegal to commercially fish Atlantic sturgeon, and retention as by-catch is prohibited. Six species of sea turtles have been observed along the entire East Coast (Appendix F, Table F.2-9). Although sea turtles live most of their lives in the ocean, adult females must return to land to lay their eggs. Most nesting occurs fr om North Carolina to the middle-west coast of Florida (Dodd, 1995). Their populations have de clined because of many factors, but human disturbance is the main cause of the decline of sea turtle numbers. Incidental capture in shrimp trawls, loss of habitat from coastal de velopment, artificial light on coasts causing disorientation of nesting females, and beach sa nd mining also harm population growth. Many also are lost in storms after being thrown onto beaches entangled in seaweed. Johnson's seagrass ( Halophila johnsonii ), a threatened plant species, exists in only a few narrowly defined locations along the east coast of Florida, from Northern Virginia Key to Sebastian Inlet (USCG, 2002). It forms extensive meadows of vegetation, which serve as an important food source for grazing marine animals such as the green sea turtle ( Chelonia of its location, Johnson's seagrass is particularly susceptible to storm surges. In addition, this species is threatened by human trampling attributable to increasing land use, reduced water quality because of nutrient overenrichment from urban and agricultural land runoff, activities related to inlet maintenance, channel dredgi ng, anchor mooring, and vessel traffic with resulting propeller scouring. There are two species of Acropora coral that are in candidate status (Appendix F, Table F.2-10). A variety of causes have forced a decline in the diversity of coral reefs and the degradation of coral reef habitats: diseases (e.g., white band), natural phenomena (e.g., hurricanes and temperature fluctuations), tourism (e.g., boat anchorings and ship groundings), sedimentation, land clearance, coastal development, and sewage discharges. 3.2.4. Essential Fish Habitat The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (FCMA) established eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs), charged with developing Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) to achieve optimum fishery yields within their respective regions. In subsequent years, additional legislation was formulated to increase the effectiveness of this act. Two examples are the NMFS \"602 Guidelines\" (\"Guidelines for the Preparation of Fishery Management Plans under the FCMA,\" 50 CFR part 602), which provided an official definition of overfishing an d required each FMP to includ e measurable definitions of overfishing for each managed species, and the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-297; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ), which was passed and integrated into the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996 (M SFCMA, Public Law 94-265, as amended through October 11, 1996; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). This later act required FMCs and the Secretary of Commerce to identify and describe Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species specified under each respective FMP. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-18 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region There are three regional councils that are responsible for implementing the MSFCMA through FMPs in the Atlantic region: New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), and South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC). Cumulatively, these three councils have developed twenty-four FMPs covering fish, shellfish, and coral habitats for this region. FMPs contain EFH designations for federally managed species. A list of commercially important fish species in the Atlantic region is contained in Appendix F. It is important to identify habitat areas essential to each life stage of a federall y managed species to ensu re sustainable fisheries and the ability of managed species to contribu te to a healthy ecosystem. EFH designations vary by species life-history requirements and comprise numerous habitat types, including coral, coral reefs, live-/hard-bottom, grav el, cobble, sand, submerged grass beds, and estuarine habitats. NMFS is currently reviewing EFH designation methodology and considering options to revise existing EFH designations, which will be available on-line upon completion 6. 3.2.5. Socioeconomic Environment 3.2.5.1. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment This socioeconomic impact area, based on NOAA's definition of coastal counties, comprises 285 coastal counties in the fifteen states listed in Section 3.2.1 (including the District of Columbia). The coastal counties in the socioeconomic impact area extend from Washington County, Maine, to Miami-Dade County, Florida. The coastal populati on of the Atlantic region is 65,615,354 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a), which is calculated by combining population statistics for the region's 285 coastal counties, as identified by NOAA. Appendix F, Table F.2-6 lists these coastal counties and their populations. The Atlantic region's coastal population makes up 23 percent of the total U.S. population, of which the majority is located in New York, New Je rsey, and Florida (Appendix F, Figure F.2-7) (NOAA, 2002b; U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). The Atlantic region varies substantially in socioeconomic patterns ranging from low-density rural areas to high-density urban centers. The range is from 4,149 people in Tyrrell County, North Caroli na, to 2,465,326 people in Kings County, New York. The East Coast of the United States holds some of the largest population centers in the country. Appendix F, Table F.2-11 lists the populations of coastal counties of the Atlantic Region. In 2000, the coastal counties within this region had a to tal civilian labor force of 35,541,083, with an average unemployment rate of 5.5 percen t, compared with the national average of 5.8 percent. Income levels rank on par with the national average of per capita income and higher than the national average of median household income at $21,090 and $44,116, respectively. (The national average per capita and median household incomes are $21,587 and $41,994, respectively.) The levels of income va ry throughout the region. For example, Allendale County, South Carolina, the poorest county in the region, has a per capita income of $11,293, while New Yo rk County, New York, the wealthiest 6 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/habit atprotection/efh/fish_manage_c.htm Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-19 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region county in the region, has a per capita income of $42,922 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). 3.2.5.2. Economic Status There are a variety of sectors that make up the foundation of the Atlantic region's economic system. Major population centers \u2014such as New York, New York; Boston, Massachusetts; and Miami, Florida \u2014provide financial and consumer services, as well as coordination and capital for large-scale wholesale, retail, and manufacturing in other Atlantic coastal areas. Foreign and domestic transportation, commerce, and communications industries are very prominent players in regional income, as are tourism and commercial fishing, which exist in many areas throughout the coast. All along the Atlantic coast, there are public beaches, boardwalks, amusement parks, hotels, and resort areas for tourists that frequent the area, usually between the months of April and September, with the exception of Florida, which has peak tourism during the colder months of the year. For the Atlantic region, the American Coastal Coalition (ACC, 1998) estimates that the annual average revenue collected for tour ism was more than $74 billion. Commercial fishing activities in the region bring in a large portion of the total U.S. seafood catch. The American lobster catch alone is worth just over $300 million per year with scallops, goosefish, quahogs, and crab bringing in another estimated $360 million (Appendix F, Tabl e F.2-12). This industry has an extensive onshore service sector, including warehousing and transportation companies, canneries and packaging plan ts, sales and marketing firms, marine maintenance and support operations, and many other associated services. About 98 percent of the labor force of the region is employed in nonfarm activities (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). The largest economic activi ties in this sector are lodging, health, legal, education, retail and wholesaling, transportation, financial services (includes banking), and entertainm ent. In many areas, particularly in Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, and Florid a, there are heavy concentrations of U.S. military and government activities. 3.2.5.3. Vessel Transportation and Ports Commercial, recreational, and federal agency vessels all contribute to vessel traffic along the Atlantic coast of the United States. There are many commercial ports receiving vessels from all over the world that serve as entry and exit points for millions of tons of commercial goods per year. In 1999, there were more than 511,000 vessel trips measured along wa terways associated with major ports throughout the region (USACE, 1999a). Th e Port of New York and New Jersey is the third largest in the nation and the largest port on the East Coast of North America. Appendix F, Table F.2-13 lists the major ports of the Atlantic region. In 1999, the Atlantic region received or shipped from its ports more than 605,000 thousand short tons of foreign an d domestic cargo: domestic shipping and receiving accounted for 96,164 and 160,025 thousand short tons, respectively, while foreign shipping and receiving accounted for 85,183 and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-20 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region 219,144 thousand short tons, respectivel y. In addition, there were 45,078 thousand short tons of intrastate waterborne commerce (USACE, 1999a). The majority of the commodities being tran sported to Atlantic ports are petroleum based. Ports on the Delaware River r eceive the highest volume of petroleum products and crude oil on the eastern coast of the United States (Ford et al., 1992). More than 58 percent of all incoming sh ipments to the Port of New York and New Jersey are petroleum or a petroleu m-based derivative (USACE, 1999a). In 1999, there were more than 148 oil spills in the Atlantic region (USCG, 1999a), which accounted for 2.5 percent of all oil spills in U.S. waters. 3.2.5.4. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries The commercial fishing sector is an important component of the Atlantic region's economy. During 2000, fisheries off the At lantic region produced more than 1.5 billion lbs, valued at over $1.25 billio n (NMFS, 2003a) that provided nearly 55 percent of all commercial fish landings in the continental United States. Appendix F lists the top commercial landin gs for the Atlantic region. Recreational Fisheries A major recreational activity is offshore fishing. The most commonly caught species by anglers in the region are Atlantic mackerel, croakers, cod, striped bass, sea bass, summer flounder, and bluefish. Although the number of anglers in certain areas depends on the proximity of population centers to the coast (e.g., Florida), anglers gene rally can be found throug hout the region. In 2001, 6.2 million marine recreational fishing participants took 53 million trips and caught 244 million fish (NMFS, 2002). The eastern coast of Florida accounted for the highest number of trips at 24 percent, while Maine, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Georgia accounted for on ly a total of 6 percent (NMFS, 2002). For this region in 2001, the economic ex penditures due to this fishery were approximately $8.6 billion (ASA, 2002) 7. 3.2.5.5. Subsistence Information on subsistence use of fish and shellfish in the Atlantic region is limited. While some resident s may supplement their diets with these resources, subsistence is not known to be a prominent activity in this area, as compared to Alaska, where Native communities may suff er substantial economic and cultural losses due to contamination of subsis tence seafood during an oil spill. 3.2.5.6. Archaeological/Historic Resources Lowering sea levels at the height of the last glacial epoch resulted in the lower sea levels of today, which exposed large areas of the continental shelf. Prehistoric people were present in the eastern United States as early as 12,000 years ago, at which time sea level along the East Coast was approximately 98 ft below present levels. Sea level reached its present stand sometime between 6000 and 3000 years B.P. (Before Present). A literature survey of inundated prehistoric sites in North America indicates that there are at least twelve known prehistoric sites below present sea level along the East Coast between 7 This includes the total dollar amou nt from both coasts in Florida. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-21 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region Penobscot Bay, Maine, and Long Island , New York (Stright, 1990). These sites range in age from late Paleo-In dian to Woodland (ca 9000 to 3000 B.P.), and in elevation from 31 ft below present sea level to mean low tide. Many such inundated prehistoric sites may exist on the Atlantic Oute r Continental Shelf (OCS) but have not yet been discovered. For any possible prehistoric sites on the OCS to be preserved intact, they would have to have been buried beneath sufficient sediment to protect them from the forces of erosion. Environments capable of such burial include the marsh-lagoon-barrier system and the floodplain-marsh-estuary system. Evidence of the buried remains of these environments has been found offshore New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, an d Georgia. For example, of Georgia's nearly 30,000 recorded archaeologic al sites, less than 2 percent are within 1,000 ft of a shore or coastline, and only 222 sites are submerged cultural resources (GaDNR, 1998). Most historic sites located in the coastal region are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or eligible for nomination to the register. These are ports, coastal fortifications, historic districts, and lighthouses that are frequently protected from the sea by bulwarks or other barriers. The thousands of known shipwrecks along the Atlantic coast are concentrated in areas of shoals, historic ports, and areas of major hurricane occurrence. Locations of the vast majority of shipwrecks are only approximations and are listed in general terms, such as \"off Cape Hatteras.\" The state of preservation of shipwreck sites depends on a number of factors, including sea state, water depth, bottom type, nature of adjacent coast, strength and direction of storm waves and currents, and size and type of construction of the vess el. The preservation potential for historic shipwrecks along much of the Atlantic coas t is low, primarily because of the strong current and wave regimes. The heavy wave action that often causes ships to wreck also causes damage to the wrecks or destroys the remains. This is especially true of the Georges Bank, Nantucket Shoals, an d Cape Hatteras areas where sediments are frequently reworked by strong currents. 3.2.5.7. Recreation and Tourism The Atlantic region contains the largest population base of the regions in this PEIS, along with one of the longest coastlines. This equates to a major recreational region for the United States, particularly in connection with marine fishing and beach-related activities. Tourists from domestic and foreign locations come to the coastal beaches, barrier islands, estuarine bays and sounds, and tidal marshes. Publicly owned and administered areas (such as national seashores, parks, beaches, and wildlife lands), as well as designated preservation areas (such as historic and natural sites, landmarks, wilderness areas, wildlife sanctuaries, and scenic rivers), attract residents and visitors throughout the year. Co mmercial and private recr eational facilities and establishments, such as resorts, marinas, amusement parks, and ornamental gardens, also serve as primary areas of interest. For 1996, the ACC (1998) stated tourism totals for the Atlantic region were $74,871,590,000. In this region, Florid a had the highest coastal tourist expenditures at $30,232,090,000, while Rhode Island had the lowest coastal tourist expenditures at $794,300,000. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-22 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region 3.2.5.8. Public Safety and Worker Health Oil spill response is one of the U.S. Co ast Guard's (USCG's) many missions. In responding to oil spills, the USCG is aware of public safety and the effects that alternative response technologies \u2014chemical dispersion and in situ burning \u2014 could have on human health. Under the guidelines established by the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), steps have been taken to protect both the public and oil spill responders. Whether compensated workers or volunteers, responders are required to be certified under either the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard or USEPA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard. These standards ensure that responders unde rstand the hazards of oil spill response and how to protect themselves. To assist in public safety, the USCG has the maritime safety authority to establish a safety zone around oil spill cleanup operations. This zone is established to safeguard the public and responders from the hazards associated with cleanup. In addition, USCG standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to protect responders, as well as the public, from the hazards associated with chemical dispersion and in situ burning. These procedures are outlined in SOPs in each Area Contingency Plan's (ACP's) Site Safety Plan. In addition, training exercises such as PREP (Preparedness for Response Exercise Pr ogram) and SONS (Spill of National Significance) train USCG response personnel to avoid safety hazards. Dispersants are a liquid chemical used to disperse oil spills from the ocean surface (see Section 2.2.2). During an oil spill, dispersant application can be done from either an aerial or a shipboard platform. In both cases response personnel have the potential to be accide ntally exposed to the dispersant, and in extreme cases exposure to the public could occur. The two types of dispersants with use allowed in the United States have OSHA-established, permissible exposure limits of 50 ppm on skin. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for these dispersants makes clear the human health concerns from excess exposure. In situ burning of an oil spill entails setting contained or boomed oil on fire (see Section 2.2.3). This action has been acknowledged as having potential human health and safety effects. Besides the physical hazards to responders, there is the potential for inhalation of airborne burn products. In situ burning emits a plume of black smoke laden with particulates (PM10, soot), the main public health concern. Response personnel working close to the burn may be exposed to levels of gases and particulates that would require them to use personal protective equipment. Occupational standards such as OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) are applicable . For the general public, NOAA (2000a) reported that particulate concentrations in a smoke plume remain the only agent of concern past 1 or 2 mi downwind , with the gases created in a burn dissipating to levels close to background. Public exposure to smoke particulate from the burn is not expected to occu r unless the smoke plume travels down to ground level. Since the general public may include sensitive individuals, such as the very young and very old, pregnant women, and people with pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, this population's tolerance to particulates may be significantly lower than that of the resp onders. There is little data concerning the effect on humans of particulates from the in situ burning of oil. Based on chemical analysis of soot particulates and their physical behavior, the hazard is Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-23 2009 3.2. Affected Environment: Atlantic Region expected to be similar to that of better-known particulate emissions that are now regulated by the NAAQS. In 1997, the Special Monitoring of Applied Response Technologies (SMART) protocol8 was created, in part, to address the particulates concerns and to better aid the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) in making decisions related to initiating, continuing, or terminating in situ burning. 8 http://response.restoration.noaa. gov/oilaids/SMART/SMART.html Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-24 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region 3.3. C ARIBBEAN REGION 3.3.1. Physical Environment For the purpose of this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS), the Caribbean region consists of the tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and is enclosed to the south by Venezuela, Colombia, and Panama; to the west by Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica; and to the north, it wraps toward the southeast with the Greater and Lesser Antilles Islands, beginning with Cuba and ending with Trinidad and Tobago. The tropical waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean are off the north shores of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the U.S.-affiliated islands discussed in this section), and the tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea are off their south and west shores. See Appendix F, Figure F.3- 1, for the major currents of the Caribbean region. The North Equatorial Current , at an average speed of 0.7 kt (NIMA, 2003), is the dominant hydrological driving force in the Caribbean region, entering from the Atlantic Ocean in the east through passages between the Lesser Antilles Islands (Appendix F, Figure F.3-1). It becomes the Caribbean Curre nt, which travels west, and combines with the Guiana Current, which flows along the northern coast of South America and moves northwest into the Gulf of Mexico (Andrade and Barton, 2000; Murphy et al., 1999). The Guiana Current is highly infl uenced by the freshwater discharges of the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers. The Amazon River is the larges t point source of fresh water entering the Atlantic Ocean (Morrison and Smith, 1990), so variations in riverine contributions may play a major role in altering the Caribbean region's marine water. Off the north coast of Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands, the Antilles Current flows northward from east of the Lesser Antilles Is lands and joins the Florida Current past the outer Bahamas. Its waters are concentrated into a strong northward jet approximately 50 to 62 mi wide and centered at about 1,312 ft (Lee et al., 1996). traverses the Caribbean Sea and flows at an average speed of 0.5 to 1.0 kt. Currents in the nearshore areas of Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands are complex as a result of the interaction among the dominant North Equatorial Current and local winds, waves, tides, coastal configuration, bathymetry, and coastal stormwater discharges (USEPA, 1992a). One of the factors affecting the chemical char acteristics of the marine waters of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is the large freshwater input to the region from the Orinoco River plume, which originates in Venezuela. This plume can carry high concentrations of suspended particles, unique chemical properties, and biota near the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The plume, enriched with nutrients, can be responsible for events of high turbidity and algal blooms that usually occur in the eastern Caribbean basin in October. The result is a large seasonal variation in the surface salinity levels with 36.3 parts per thousand (ppt) in June and 34.1 ppt in September. Coastal surface water temperatures remain fairly constant throughout the year averaging between 79\u00b0 and 86\u00b0F (Steel, 1994). 3.3.1.1. Water Quality Coastal The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA, 1998a) compiled assessments of the Caribbean region wate r quality within estuaries and coastal Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-25 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region waters in its 305(b) report. Approximately 62 percent of this region's estuaries were surveyed, of which 10 percent were classi fied as fully supporting use and another 11 percent were classified as having good quality. However, the survey also showed that 27 to 40 percent of the region's o cean shoreline were classified as either threatened or impaired by so me form of pollution or habitat degradation for their designated uses (aquatic li fe, swimming, and fishing). Data gathered by the Caribbean Oil Pollution Database indicates that concentrations of dissolved/dispersed petroleu m hydrocarbons are generally low in offshore waters, while relatively high levels are found in enclosed coastal areas (UNEP, 1994). Primary activities contributing to the de gradation of coastal water quality include those associated with metals and wastes fr om land disposal si tes, pathogens from unknown sources, industrial and municipal discharges, collection system failures, spills, marinas and marine waste (cruise sh ips), urban runoff, human biosolids, and general beach pollution. Although the Caribbe an region's water quality is relatively good, it has been declining because of point and non-point source pollution discharges. Municipal wastewater treatment plants pose a particular point source problem to this region because of pipe breakages, efficiency problems, and bad management. Lack of erosion control measur es during coastal development, failing septic systems, and urban stormwater ru noff are the primary non-point sources of coastal pollution in the region. Heavy metals, chlorinated hydrocarbons, petroleum hydrocarbons, and wastewater discharge prod ucts are noticeable problems in a few areas according to the most recent 305(b) reports for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USEPA, 1998a). Marine One of the factors affecting the chemical characteristics of regional marine water quality is the water advected to the region from the freshwater discharges of the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers. The Orinoco River, with one of the largest discharge zones in the world, has been estimated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 1994) to have an average annual sediment discharge of 85 \u00d7 10 6 tons. The Amazon River discharges between 80,000 and 250,000 m3/s of fresh water, which results in a plume of brackish surface water that extends hundreds of miles seaward and northwest along the coast of South America to the Ca ribbean Sea (Geyer et al., 1991). Because of its important location along the Mona and Anegada Passages (key shipping lanes for the Panama Canal), the Caribbean region experiences large amounts of vessel traffic. It is estimated that 25 percent of the world's sea\u00ad borne oil travels through this region every year (Roach, 2002). In 1999, this traffic was responsible for seventy-nine spills and 2,939 gal of spilled oil within U.S. territorial waters (USCG, 2000a). The cruise industry is integral to the Caribbean economy. Hundreds of thousands of tourist arrive every year on cruise ships, with the cruise industry expanding at a steady rate of 8 percen t per year (Schmidt, 2000). Cruise ships emit large amounts of point source pollution that has the potential to affect marine water quality in adverse ways. On a 1-week voyage, a typical cruise ship generates an estimated 210,000 gal of se wage and can legally discharge this waste into the water as long as it is beyond the 3-mi limit of U.S. navigable waters. In addition, this cruise ship produces 1,000,000 gal of gray water, which Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-26 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region contains detergents, cleaners, oil, grea se, metals, pesticides, and medical and dental wastes. According to existing regulations, gray water can be discharged anywhere outside the U.S. Great Lakes (USEPA, 2000a). 3.3.1.2. Meteorology and Air Quality Climate Because of their locations in the tropics, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are highly affected by the predominatel y easterly trade winds and by the north- south migration of the inter-tropical convergence zone. The trade winds blow consistently from the east (east-south-east, east-north-east) at 10 to 15 kt but can vary in magnitude as the relative strength of the Bermuda High (to the north) and the Equatorial Trough (to the south) vari es with the seasons (Steel, 1994). Winter months are designated the dry season, when easterly trade winds are relatively shallow and are generated by relatively weak and cold migratory high-pressure cells that move off the North American continent, displacing the semipermanent Bermuda ridge south of its normal summertime position. The air mass during the winter is maritime tropical, with very brief periods of extremely modified continental polar air. Summer months are designated the wet season. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are in the tropical hurricane region of the eastern Caribbean Sea. As a result, tropical stor ms and hurricanes, while infrequent, can bring brief heavy rains and winds to this region. Air Quality Air quality of the Caribbean region is measured against National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), resulting from the Clean Air Act and its 1977 amendments (40 CFR 50.12). These standards are designed to protect human health. The USEPA requires states and territories to report ambient air quality levels for six major pollutants: particulate matter (10 microns or larger [PM10]), sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone. Appendix F, Table F.1-1 summarizes fede ral ambient air standards in detail. Although there are limited numbers of ambi ent air monitoring stations located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, it is generally held that the region has some of the best air quality in the United States because of location and prevailing weather conditions. In 2001, only one U.S.-a ffiliated island county in the Caribbean region exceeded NAAQS for particulate matter (PM10); none of the remaining federal criteria air pollutants exceeded NAAQS (USEPA, 2000b). Recent studies have attempted to link blowing dust from the plains of Africa to an increase in asthma and other respiratory disease cases within the Caribbean region. This dust contains beryllium-7, le ad 210, elevated mercury, arsenic, and other airborne pollutants that remain within the dust during its trip west across the Atlantic Ocean. This dust has also been associated with Red Tide and amphibian diseases (Ballingrud, 2000). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-27 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region 3.3.2. Biological Environment9 3.3.2.1. Marine Mammals Twenty-three animal species including, cetaceans (whales and dolphins), two pinnipeds (seals), and one sirenian (manat ee) have been spotted in the Caribbean region. Whales and dolphins are an intricate part of the marine and coastal fauna of the northeastern Caribbean Sea, with some of the islands serving as primary habitat for the mating and calving of endangered species. However, the majority of information on marine mammals in this region comes from strandings and opportunistic sightings; as such, data on basic biology, life history, and distribution is lacking (M ignucci-Giannoni, 1998). Appe ndix F, Table F.3-1 lists nineteen recognized nonendangered marine mammals in this region. 3.3.2.2. Marine and Coastal Birds The offshore waters, coastal beaches, wetlands, and mangrove areas of the Caribbean region provide habitats for both migrant and resident marine and coastal birds. A combined to tal of 247 native bird species are located in Puerto Rico (239 species) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (199 species) (USGS, 1998b) although not all occur within the area covered by this PEIS. In addition, thirty- seven nonindigenous species have been introduced to the region, and, in the winter, native populations are augmented by large numbers of migratory wintering birds that arrive from more northern habitats. The presence of ten Ramsar sites and eight National Wildlife Refuges in the Caribbean region indicates that large numbers of wetland birds concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands designates Ramsar sites as wetlands of international importance. These wetlands are selected based on criteria such as supporting 20,000 or more waterbirds and regularly supporting 1 percent of the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of waterbird (Wetlands International, 2004). The National Wildlife Refuge sites are established under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 with the aim of protecting wildlife and preserving biological di versity (USFWS, 2004). For the purpose of this PEIS, marine and coastal birds are categorized into five major groups, as detailed in Appendix F, Table F.3-2: seabirds, shorebirds, wading and marsh and raptors. 3.3.2.3. Plankton and Fish Plankton Plankton are organisms that float at or ne ar the surface of marine waters and are unable to swim against tides, winds, or currents. Plankton species, which represent nearly all major aquatic phyla, can be roughly classified as phytoplankton (microscopic plant life), zooplankton (microscopic animals), and ichthyoplankton (fish eggs and larvae). Be cause of the relatively oligotrophic, or 9 Only nonendangered species will be included in Section 3. 3.2, Biological Environment. Threatened, endangered, and candidate species will be discussed separately in Section 3.3. 3, Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species. For this reason, sea turtles will only be discussed in Sect ion 3.3.3, as they are a threatened/endangered species in the Caribbean region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-28 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region nutrient-poor, marine waters of the Caribbean region, plankton communities are primarily distributed near highly productive coral reefs and estuarine zones. Phytoplankton are microscopic floating al gae, which form the base of the food web. They are responsible for approximate ly one-half of global photosynthesis and play a vital role in stabilizing atmospheri c carbon dioxide. These plants can only survive and produce in the shallower, sunl it waters of open-ocean and estuarine areas. Phytoplankton in the Caribbean region is highly influenced by the advection of the nutrient-rich Orinoco River plum e, which increases the abundance and species diversity of the Caribbean Sea's phytoplankton during periods of high outflow (usually August through October) . This plume also actively transports coastal diatom populations into the Caribbean Sea, as well as into the immediate waters south of Puerto Rico. In the tropi cal bays surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the phytoplankton community is predominantly composed of diatoms (82 percent) and dinoflagellates (12 percent), with the blue-green algae of the genus Trichodesmium and other algae forms making up the other 6 percent (EcoEl\u00e9ctrica, 1996). Zooplankton, which consume phytoplankton, spend either part (meroplankton) or all (holoplankton) of their life cycle as plankton. Their temporal and spatial distributions depend on a number of factors including currents, water temperature, and phytoplankton abundance (Loeb et al., 1983). Zooplankton are a critical link in the transfer of energy from primary producers (phytoplankton) to predators, so any process influencing the abundance and distribution of zooplankton can ultimately have an im pact on fisheries. The most common phylum of zooplankton within the Caribbean region are Coelenterata, Mollusca, Chaetognatha, Caridean (shrimp), and Br achyuran (crab) larvae (EcoEl\u00e9ctrica, 1996). It has been observed that the highest density of fish eggs and larvae are generally in waters less than 131 ft deep . There are seventy-seven fish families, including at least ninety-five species. Dominant ichthyoplankton groups in the Because of the oligotrophic waters of the Caribbean region, most commercially important fish resources are located in or around the highly productive tropical coral reefs or in enclosed bays and estu arine areas. These fish resources consist of reef fish and shellfish. The Caribbean Fishery Management Council manages the fisheries in this region. In 2000, the commercial yield of fish by weight in the Caribbean region was over 2 million lbs (NMFS, 2001). Appendix F, Table F.3-3 lists the commercially important fish species of the Caribbean region. Because of their close proximity to shor e, coupled with their long lives, slow growth, ease of capture, large body size, delayed reproduction, and other factors, reef fish within the Caribbean region are very vulnerable to overfishing and habitat destruction. Spiny lobster populations, which are an important fish resource for both recreational and commercial fisherman in the region, have Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-29 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region declined in inshore areas because of the destruction of numerous mangrove estuaries for coastal development, overfishing, and pollution, which has lowered water quality at several lobster nu rsery sites (Quinn and Kojis, 1997). 3.3.2.4. Intertidal Habitats Beaches The Caribbean region has 875 mi of shor eline (Good et al., 1998), containing a mix of sand and gravel beaches, salt ponds, rock cliffs, and mangroves. The coastal beaches are important not only for the ecological systems of the islands, but also for their economic integrity in terms of tourism and recreation. Beaches in the region are threatened by erosion from both manmade and climatic sources. Hurricanes and other weather ev ents have removed sand from some beaches while adding sand to others . Coastline development and bad soil management practices have contributed significantly to erosion in the region. In addition, beach sand and gravel are illega lly harvested for construction purposes in Puerto Rico (USGS, 1996). Estuaries, Wetlands, and Mangroves Estuaries are important habitats for both resident and transitory species, providing spawning or nursery habitats and foraging areas for numerous species, including invertebrates, fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. High organic productivity, high detritus production, and extensive nutrient recycling characterize estuaries. Examples of estuaries in the region are San Juan Bay and Jobos Bay in Puerto Rico. Many different habitat types are found in and around estuaries, including shallow marine wate rs, freshwater and salt marshes, sandy beaches, mud and sand flats, rocky shor es, mangrove forests, tidal pools, and seagrass beds. Wetland habitats are associated with estuarine areas. These habitats may occupy only narrow bands along the shore, or they may cover larger expanses at the mouths of bays, rivers, or coastal streams. There are 242 mi 2 of wetlands in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (Good et al., 1998). The prominent types of wetlands in this region include mangrove forests, herbaceous marshes, freshwater swamps, and riverine forests. These wetlands provide habitats that sustain commercial fisheries and many endangered species, as well as reduce the impacts of floods to adjacent areas. Wetlands in the Caribbean region have been reduced by more than 50 percent, mostly from drainage for agriculture, flood control projects, and urban and in dustrial development (Good et al., 1998). A significant amount of mangrove forest remains in the Caribbean region; nearly 25 mi 2 of mangrove forest is scattered around Puerto Rico's coastline. While scattered mangrove trees occur along the coast of the U.S. Virgin Islands, mangrove forests have only survived at Sa lt River, St. Croix, and Jersey Bay, St. Thomas; the larger mangrove areas have been cleared for development (OTA, 1987). Only four of the eighty observed sp ecies of mangrove in the world occur in the Caribbean region. They consist of several salt-tolerant tree species, including black mangrove erectus ). Important to the region are the small islands formed by clumps of red mangrove trees that extend landmasses seaward because of the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-30 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region trees' ability capture sediments and debris . This network of mangrove islands, cays, and channels provide inland areas with an important buffer from the action of stormy seas (EcoEl\u00e9ctrica, 1996). Mangroves also serve as nurseries for many reef and marine fishes, whic h are economically important commercial species. Mangrove ecosystems of the Caribbean region are also important to birds and other animals that depend on the high concentrations of fishes and invertebrates located in these areas. Despite their ecological importance, mangrove forests are under intense pressure from human activities. Nearly 75 percent of previously existing mangroves in Puerto Rico and 40 to 50 percent of pr evious mangroves in the U.S. Virgin islands have been destroyed over the pa st 50 years (USEPA, 1998b; USVI DPNR, 2001). Because of their high occurrence in protected bays, mangrove forests are ideal sites for marinas and boat facilities. Coastal development has greatly reduced the amount of mangrove forests througho ut the region even though they have been protected under law for the last two decades. 3.3.2.5. Subtidal Habitats Submerged Grass Beds The subtidal (benthic) areas of the Caribbean region consist of either soft or hard-bottom substrates. These areas support a variety of marine life and habitats, including seagrass beds and coral reefs. Submerged grass beds are highly productive ecosystems that ar e located extensively throughout the Caribbean region and often occur in close association with shallow-water coral reefs. Submerged grass beds contribute to both the physical and biological aspects of estuarine and nearshore marine habitats and play an important role in reducing coastal erosion by trapping and consolidating bottom sediments with their extensive root and rhizome systems. There is a high level of diversity and abundance among marine species that are associated with submerged grass beds, especially in tropical regions such as the Caribbean. Many vertebrates and invertebrates, including a substantial amount that are of commercial importance, occur in submerged grass beds at some point in their life history (CFMC, 1998). These beds are also important grazing areas for some endangered species, such as the green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas manatus ). Within the surrounding coastal waters of the Caribbean region, there are more than 16,358 acres of submerged grass beds . They are highly diverse, consisting of seven different species. These include Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass), Turtle grass, manatee grass, and shoal gr ass are the three most abundant species (CFMC, 1998). Among the current threats to submerged grass beds are intensive recreational use, siltation from coastal development, and dredge and fill operations for the creation of ship channels and dockin g accommodations. Appendix F, Figures F.3-2 and F.3-3, show the locations of known submerged grass beds in this region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-31 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region Coral Reefs Coral reefs are the most import ecological (and economic) coastal resources in the Caribbean. They act as barriers to storm waves, provide habitat to a wide variety of marine organisms including most of the economically important species of fish and shellfish, are the pr imary source of carbonate sand, and serve as the basis for much of the tourism in the Caribbean region. The Caribbean regi on has 168,032 acres of coral reefs consisting Acropora, star coral Montastraea annularis) are generally the most numerous sp ecies, although in some areas other species such as staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis ) may be more common. Almost all coral resources of this region are fringing reefs, except a small barrier reef off St. Croix and several offshore patch reefs and bank structures (Spalding et al., 2001; USEPA 1992b). There are 30,080 acres of reefs in the region that are in protected areas, including Boquero n, Cayos in Puerto Rico. See Appendix F.3-4 for the areas where coral reefs are found in Puerto Rico. Buck Island, Green Cay, Hind Bank, and Virgin Islands National Park in the U.S. Virgin Islands are also among the protected areas in the Caribbean region. See Appendix F, Figure F.3-5 for the areas where coral reefs are found in the U.S. Virgin Islands region. Well-known areas of pinnacles are found in southwestern Puerto Rico (specifically to the southeast of Turromote Reef in La Parguera) and are reported for the area south of St. John . These structures submerge and extend from depths of about 16 ft from the surface. Generally associated with these structures are pillar coral (Dendrogyra cylindrus ) and/or Boulder star coral (Montastraea annularis ), which are live corals that constitute very attractive sites for recreational diving (CFMC, 1998). Similar to surrounding areas, the Caribbe an region's reefs have been heavily affected by disease, coral bleaching, and manmade disturbances. Diadem (a coral disease) and two coral-blea ching events (1986 through 1989 and 1998) resulted in significant amounts of mortality for the discontinuous reefs along the eastern, western, and southern shores of Puerto Rico. Other negative impacts have been from the clearing of Puerto Rico's mangrove forests along with dredging, agricultural runoff, pollution from untr eated sewage, sedimentation from coastal runoff, and oil spills. The coral reefs of the U.S. Virgin Islands have been affected heavily by disease, hurricanes, and tourism. Hurricanes incl uding the most recent Hugo, Luis, and Marilyn have had various impacts on the surrounding reefs. White band disease has killed many acroporid corals, especially the elkhorn coral (Acropora palmate ) one of the primary reef-building cora ls in the Caribbean (USGS, 1998c). Tourism has caused significant harm via boat anchorings and ship groundings. The Virgin Islands National Park on St. Jo hn attracts 1 million visitors per year, most of whom arrive on cruise ships or smalle r boats adding numerous anchorage impacts in a single year (USGS, 1998c). Other threats include sedimentation, land clearance, coastal development, and sewage discharge from septic systems. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-32 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region 3.3.2.6. Areas of Special Concern Executive Order 13158 (\"Marine Protecte d Areas\") defines marine protected areas as \"any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cu ltural resources therein\" (65 FR 34909) . There are many different types of marine protected areas within and bordering U.S. waters; some examples include National Marine Sanctuaries, National Seashores, National Parks, National Monuments, National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, and many others (NOAA, 2002a). They have different shapes, sizes, and mana gement characteristics and have been established for different purposes. There are four National Park units, eight National Wildlife Refuges, one National Estuarine Research Reserve, one National Estuary Program, and one Marine Conservation District. For more details regarding history, purpose, and specific site locations pertaining to this region, see Appendix F, Tables F.3-4through F.3-6 and Figu res F.3-6 through F.3-11. 3.3.3. Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS ) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have classified three threatened and thirteen endangered species in the Caribbean region; in addition, they are currently evaluati ng the status of six candidate species. These consist of seven marine mammals, five marine and coastal birds, four fish species, four sea turtles, and two coral species. Five cetaceans, one sirenian, and one pinniped are endangered and reside in and migrate through this region. Appendix F, Table F.3-7, lists the threatened, endangered or candidate marine mammals of the Caribbean region. Th e protected bays and coastal areas of the Caribbean region, with their warmer water temp eratures, lure these species and sightings are frequent. The West Indian manatee ( Trichechus manatus ) moves to different areas in the winter and summer depending on the temperature regime; the manatee's breeding cycles, slow mobility, and friendly nature, plus increased human activity within its habitual areas, impact and endanger this specie s. The Caribbean monk seal ( Monachus tropicalis) is listed as endangered, but it is believed to be extinct beca use of a lack of sightings in recent years. Five species of threatened and endangered ma rine and coastal birds reside in selected habitats provided by the Caribbean region. Ap pendix F., Table F.3-8, lists the threatened, endangered or candidate marine and coastal birds of the Caribbean region. In the winter, populations of shorebirds are augmented by large numbers of wintering individuals from northern ecosystems. Other species reside only temporarily along their route to South America. This region's system of mangrove, wetland, estuary, and coastal beach habitats provides the necessary biological diversity for a variety of bird species. In addition, National Wildlife Refuges provide protected habitats for these birds. There are no threatened or endangered fish species in the Caribbean region; however, four species of reef fish are on the candidate list. Appendix F, Table F.3-9, lists the threatened, endangered or candidate fish of the Caribbean region. Nearly all productive fish habitats are located in nearshore areas associated with coral reefs, submerged grass beds, and estuarine-type environments because of the oligotrophic nature of the offshore Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-33 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region water areas of this region. These important nearshore habitats are decreasing because of human exploitation and natural phenomena, the primary reason for the decline in these fish species. The Nassau grouper ( Epinephelus striatus ) was once among the most abundant fishery species in the Caribbean region, but since the 1970s, landings, mean size, and catch per unit of effort have all fallen sharply for both Nassau grouper and Goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara) (NOAA, 1999). Four threatened or endangered sea turtles are found in the Caribbean region. Appendix F, Table F.3-10, lists the threatened, endangered or candidate sea turtles of the Caribbean region. They require open nesting beaches wi th no nearshore reef; such beaches are found on the Isla de Culebra and all along the northern shore of the island of Puerto Rico. The submerged seagrass and coral reef areas of the U.S. Virgin Islands provide habitat for juvenile sea turtles until they reach sexual maturity. Populations in the region declined significantly in the last 100 years because of the ha rvesting of shells and eggs, coastal development, non-point pollution, ingestion of entanglement in marine debris, and as by-catch in other fishing operations. There are two species of Acropora coral that are in candidate status. Appendix F, Table F.3-11, lists the threatened, endangered or candidate coral of the Caribbean region. A variety of causes have forced a decline in the diversity of coral reefs and the degradation of coral reef habitats: diseases (e.g., white band), natural phenomena (e.g., hurricanes and temperature fluctuations), tourism (e.g., boat anchorings and ship groundings), sedimentation, land clearance, coastal development, and sewage discharges. 3.3.4. Essential Fish Habitat The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (FCMA) established eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs), charged with developing Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) to achieve optimum fishery yields within their respective regions. In subsequent years, additional legislation was formulated to increase the effectiveness of this act. Two examples are the NMFS \"602 Guidelines\" (\"Gu idelines for the Prep Management Plans under the FCMA,\" 50 CFR part 602), which provided an official definition of overfishing an d required each FMP to includ e measurable definitions of overfishing for each managed species, and the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-297; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ), which was passed and integrated into the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996 (M SFCMA, Public Law 94-265, as amended through October 11, 1996; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). This later act required FMCs and the Secretary of Commerce to identify and describe Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species specified under each respective FMP. The Caribbean Fishery Management Council (C FMC) is responsible for implementing the MSFCMA through FMPs in the Caribbean region . EFH is designated under four FMPs in the Caribbean region\u2014spiny lobster, queen conc h, reef fish, and coral. The commercially important fish species of the Caribbean region are listed in Appendix F, Table F.3-3. NMFS is currently finalizing and updated set of EF H designations develope d by the CFMC for the region. The updated designations will likely encompass all waters from mean high water to the out boundary of the U.S. Exclusive Econom ic Zone (EEZ; see Fi gure 3.1-1), and all substrates from mean high water to 100 fat homs depth (CFMC, 2004). EFH designations for each region are available on-line 10. It is important to identify habitat areas essential to 10 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/habit atprotection/efh/fish_manage_c.htm Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-34 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region each life stage of a federally managed species to ensure sustainable fisheries and the ability of managed species to contribute to a health y ecosystem. EFH in the Caribbean region includes benthic substrates (e.g., mud, sand, shell, rock, and associated biological communities), coral habitats, subtidal vegetation, and adjacent intertidal vegetation (wetlands and mangroves). 3.3.5. Socioeconomic Environment 3.3.5.1. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment The socioeconomic impact area of the Ca ribbean region comprises Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. John, St. Thomas, and St. Croix. Although there are some municipios (the equivalent of a county in Puerto Rico) and some subdistricts within the U.S. Virgin Islands that do not fall directly on the coastline, all areas are included in th e following analysis because of their economic and social interconnectivity and the small geographic distance between them. The current coastal population of the Caribbean region is 3,917,222 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a), which is calculate d by combining population statistics for the region's four islands. Appendix F, Table F.3-12 lists these islands and their populations. Puerto Rico makes up more than 97 percent of the region's population, while the U.S. Virgin Island s make up a little less than 3 percent. See Appendix F, Figure F.3-12 for the coastal population distribution of the Caribbean region (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). Socioeconomic patterns vary across the is lands substantially, from low-density, undeveloped rural areas to high-density, highly developed urban centers. Appendix F, Table F.3-13 lists the most densely populated municipios in Puerto Rico. In 2000, the region had a total civilian labor force of 1,202,796 individuals, with an average unemployment rate of 18.7 percent, compared with the national average of 5.8 percent. Income levels ra nk well below the national average of both per capita and median household incomes at $13,031 and $23,797, respectively. (The national average per capita and median household incomes are $21,587 and $41,994, respectively.) The levels of in come vary throughout the region. For example, Puerto Rico, the poorest island in the region, has a per capita income of $8,185, while the St. John, the wealthiest island in the region, has a per capita income of $18,012 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). 3.3.5.2. Economic Status Three primary sectors make up the fo undation of the Caribbean region's economic system: tourism, manufacturing and commodity exporting, and petroleum refining. An associated fourth sector provides services to the former three in a variety of capacities includ ing government, sale s, communications, and infrastructure. More than 2 million tourists visit the region every year, ex pending over $2.0 billion (Commonwealth of Puerto Ri co, 2001; USVI BER, 2001). In Puerto Rico, tourism is estimated to be responsible for more than 6.5 percent of the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-35 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region gross domestic product (GDP) and over 40 percent of the GDP for the U.S. Virgin Islands (WTTC, 2001a, b). Manufacturing surpassed the traditional agricultural-based economy of the region in the past two decades. This is primarily the result of large amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI) coming from the United States. Tax incentives and subsidies established by the U.S. government in the 1950s promoted the development of the region through the establishment of a capital base. The majority of these goods are then exporte d to the United States or to Europe, Mexico, and South America. The commodities that are produced and then traded on the international market are pharmaceuticals, electronics, apparel, food products, canned tuna, rum, beve rage concentrates, medical equipment, watches, and alumina. There is a large potential for both onshore and offshore oil development within the Caribbean region. Petroleum refining is a large activity for the region; one of the world's largest petroleum refineries is located on St. Croix, making it a large importer of crude oil and exporter of refined petroleum. 3.3.5.3. Vessel Transportation and Ports The islands of the Caribbean region are located along two very important shipping routes. Puerto Rico is on the Mona Passag e, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are on the Anegada Passage. Both these passages are key shipping lanes for the Panama Canal. In 1999, there were 30,637 vessel trips measured along waterways associated with major ports of this region (USACE , 1999a). Appendix F, Table F.3-14, lists the major ports of the Caribbean region. The ports at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands are some of the best natural deepwater port s in the Caribbean region. In addition, the major ports of the U.S. Virgin Islands are significant debarkation points for the tourist industry. In 2000, almost 2 million cruise ship passengers visited Virgin Island ports (USVI BER, 2001). In 1999, the Caribbean region received or shipped from its ports close to 75 thousand short tons of foreign and domestic cargo: domestic shipping and receiving accounted for 21,232 and 8,409 thousand short tons, respectively, while foreign shipping and receiving accounted for 2,066 and 40,011 thousand short tons, respectively. In addition, there were 2,698 thousand shor t tons of intrastate wate rborne commerce (USACE, 1999a). The shipment of crude oil significantl y contributes to vessel traffic in the Caribbean region. Extensive refinery operations and easy port access have made this region a large importer of crude oil and one of the largest exporters of refined petroleum. An oil refinery in St Croix, US Virgin Islands is among the largest in the Western Hemisphere. In March 2002, the U.S. Virgin Islands was the largest single regional exporter to the United States (EIA, 2002a). The Caribbean region is becoming the largest single-source region for refined petroleum imported into the United States. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-36 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region 3.3.5.4. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries The commercial fishing sector of the Caribbean region is generally small scale and poorly organized, employing lower levels of technology than other regions. Nevertheless, it produced revenues in excess of $8 million in 2001 (NMFS, 2001). Appendix F, Table F.3-15 lists th e top commercial landings for the Caribbean region. A variety of species are caught in Caribbean fisheries. Recreational Fisheries A 2001 survey showed that mari ne recreational fishing in Puerto Rico has 220,000 anglers, who took 1.4 million trip s and caught about 2.2 million fish (NMFS, 2001). According to a 1992 report 10,800 residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands were involved in boat-based recre ational fishing, involving expenditures of $5.9 million and an estimated annual catch of 54,339 lb; the most frequently harvested species were snappers (Jenni ngs, 1992). Additional data collection by NMFS recently was attempted for U.S. Virgin Islands but was suspended because of logistical problems associated with the survey. 3.3.5.5. Subsistence Information on subsistence use of fish an d shellfish in the Caribbean is limited. While some residents may supplement their diets with these resources, subsistence is not known to be a prominent activity in this area, as compared to Alaska, where Native communities may suff er substantial economic and cultural losses due to contamination of subsis tence seafood during an oil spill. 3.3.5.6. Archaeological/Historic Resources The Caribbean region is part of a larg e volcanic island complex that occurs between the junctions of the American and Caribbean plates. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were formed during the complex sequence of geologic events that took place during the formation of the Caribbean plate and the separation of North and Sout h Americas (Scatena, 1989). The region was occupied by a variety of different cultures migrating from North and South America between 7,900 and 500 years ago. These were the Mesoindian, Saladoid, and Ostinoid cultures. Evidence of these former cultures has been found at Salt Bay, Krum Bay, and Angostora along the southwestern and northern coasts of Puerto Rico; Isla de Vieques; and the Virgin Islands National Park on St. Thomas and St. John. However, since the ma jority of these cult ures were coastal dwellers, it is believed that, because of sea-level fluctuations, many archeological artifacts are buried underwater in near-coastal areas (NPS, 2001). The majority of the existing archeologica l sites within the Caribbean region is from the era of European settlemen t from 1500 onward. These consist of shipwrecks, forts, tools, and settlements from the Spanish, Dutch, and French. In particular, the Sp anish built a fort in 1508 near the current city of San Juan, and the old city wall still exists. In 1650, the French attempted to colonize St. Croix, US Virgin Islands and the Danish West Indies Company colonized the Virgin Islands, the remains of which can be seen at Christensted National Historic Site and the Virgin Islands National Park. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-37 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region Because of the surrounding nature of its coral reefs and its location near the Mona Passage, the Caribbean region has a large number of nearshore, submerged shipwrecks. It is estimated that there are more than 200 known wrecks within the Puerto Rico area, with many others hidden underneath coral and sand formations (Mir, 1983). 3.3.5.7. Recreation and Tourism The Caribbean region is a major recreational area of the United States, particularly in connection to coastal and marine activities. Both domestic and foreign tourists come to enjoy the coastal beaches, unique forests, and tropical waters of both the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Publicly owned and administered areas such as the Virgin Islands National Park and Buck Island, which offers an underwater snorkeling trail, are good examples of what the region has to of fer. The reliability of the temperature (77\u00b0 to 85\u00b0F), because of the consistency of the trade winds and its latitudinal location, adds to the lure of the region. All beaches in the Caribbean region are ope n to the public. Recreational activities include sightseeing, camping, hiking, beach combing, picnicking, boating, swimming, sunbathing, scuba diving, snorkeling, and sport fishing. Recreational boating \u2014cruise lines, private charters, and privately owned sail- and speedboats \u2014 is one of the more popular activities. Th e Caribbean region derives a substantial portion of its income from recreation- and tourism-related activities. More than 2 million tourists visit the region every year. 3.3.5.8. Public Safety and Worker Health Oil spill response is one of the U.S. Co ast Guard's (USCG's) many missions. In responding to oil spills, the USCG is aware of public safety and the effects that alternative response technologies \u2014chemical dispersion and in situ burning \u2014 could have on human health. Under the guidelines established by the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), steps have been taken to protect both the public and oil spill responders. Whether compensated workers or volunteers, responders are required to be certified under either the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emerge ncy Response Standard or USEPA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard. These standards ensure that responders unde rstand the hazards of oil spill response and how to protect themselves. To assist in public safety, the USCG has the maritime safety authority to establish a safety zone around oil spill cleanup operations. This zone is established to safeguard the public and responders from the hazards associated with cleanup. In addition, USCG standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to protect responders, as well as the public, from the hazards associated with chemical dispersion and in situ burning. These procedures are outlined in SOPs in each Area Contingency Plan's (ACP's) Site Safety Plan. In addition, training exercises such as PREP (Preparedness for Response Exercise Pr ogram) and SONS (Spill of National Significance) train USCG response personnel to avoid safety hazards. Dispersants are a liquid chemical used to disperse oil spills from the ocean surface (see Section 2.2.2). During an oil spill, di spersant application can be from either an aerial or a shipboard platform. In both cases response personnel have the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-38 2009 3.3. Affected Environment: Caribbean Region potential to be accidentally exposed to the dispersant, and in extreme cases exposure to the public could occur. The two types of dispersants with use allowed in the United States have OSHA-establish ed, permissible exposure limits of 50 ppm on skin. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for these dispersants makes clear the human health concerns from excess exposure. In situ burning of an oil spill entails setting contained or boomed oil on fire (see Section 2.2.3). This action has been acknowledged as having potential human health and safety effects. Besides the physical hazards to responders, there is the potential for inhalation of airborne burn products. In situ burning emits a plume of black smoke laden with particulates (PM10, soot), the main public health concern. Response personnel working close to the burn may be exposed to levels of gases and particulates that would require them to use personal protective equipment. Occupational standards such as OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) are applicable . For the general public, NOAA (2000a) reported that particulate concentrations in a smoke plume remain the only agent of concern past 1 or 2 mi downwind , with the gases created in a burn dissipating to levels close to background. Public exposure to smoke particulate from the burn is not expected to occu r unless the smoke plume travels down to ground level. Since the general public may include sensitive individuals, such as the very young and very old, pregnant women, and people with pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, this population's tolerance to particulates may be significantly lower than that of the resp onders. There is little data concerning the effect on humans of particulates from the in situ burning of oil. Based on chemical analysis of soot particulates and their physical behavior, the hazard is expected to be similar to that of better-known particulates emissions that are now regulated by the NAAQS. In 1997, the Special Monitoring of Applied Response Technologies (SMART) protocol 11 was created, in pa rt, to address the particulates concerns and to better aid the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) in making decisions related to initiating, continuing, or terminating in situ burning. 11 http://response.restoration.noaa. gov/oilaids/SMART/SMART.html Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-39 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region 3.4. G ULF OF MEXICO REGION 3.4.1. Physical Environment For the purpose of this Programmatic Envir onmental Impact Statement (PEIS), the Gulf of Mexico region will specifically cover the waters that lie south and west of the continental United States; east and north of Mexico, and northwest of Cuba. Five states \u2014 the west coast of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas \u2014border the Gulf of Mexico and are considered in this PEIS (Figure 3.1-1). Extensive marine waters entering through the Yucatan Channel of Mexico and exiting through the Florida Straits influence this body of water. In addition, fresh water from over two-thirds of the United States, one-half of Mexico, and part of the Guatemalan riverine system of Central America drains into the Gulf (Birkett and Rapport, 1999). A prominent physical feature of the Gulf of Mexico is the Loop Current, which is a swift, narrow current that enters the Gulf of Mexico through the Yucatan Channel, turns clockwise, and exits through the Florida Straits to become the Florida Current and eventually the Gulf Stream. Appendix F, Figure F.4-1, sh ows the major currents of the Gulf of Mexico region. Water current velocities associated with the Loop Current can have surface speeds of 2 to 3 kt or more. As the Loop Current extends into the Gulf and widens, surface velocities range between 1.5 to 2.9 kt (Coa ts, 1992; Nowlin and McLellan, 1967). Circular eddies of water break off from the Loop Current and transport water across the Gulf to the west. These eddies can create short-term, high-velocity currents at the surface as they pass by. The Loop Current also can expand and contra ct at different times of the year. At one extreme, it has an almost direct path to th e Florida Current, causing the shear in the flow to set up a quasi-permanent, clockwise recirculation known as the Cuban Vortex. This feature may initiate Loop Current expansion. At the other extreme, the Loop Current intrudes into the Gulf of Mexico, forming an intense clockwise flow as far north as 29.1\u00b0N (latitude) and occasionally reaching as far north as the Mississippi River delta and the Florida continental shelf (NRC, 1990a). Surface salinities in the Gulf of Mexico vary seasonally. During months of low freshwater input, surface salinities near the coastline range between 29 and 32 parts per thousand (ppt) (MMS, 1997). High-volume freshwater inpu ts during the spring and summer months result in strong horizontal sa linity gradients with salinities less than 20 ppt on the inner shelf. The waters in the open Gulf are char acterized by salinities between 36 and 36.5 ppt (MMS, 1997). Surface water temperatures also vary seasonally. During January, surface temperatures range from 57\u00b0 to 75\u00b0F. During July, sea surface temperatures range from 82\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F (Cochrane and Kelly, 1986; Wallace, 1980). 3.4.1.1. Water Quality Coastal In 1998, the U.S. Environmental Prot ection Agency (USEPA, 1998a) compiled an assessment of the Gulf of Mexico region water quality within estuaries and coastal waters in its 305(b) report. About 78 percent of the region's estuaries Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-40 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region were surveyed, and 65 percent of those had good water qualit y. The remainder was considered \"impaired\" because of nutrient enrichment, influx of pathogens, increase in oil and grease concentrations, alteration of habitat, salinity, chloride intrusion, siltation, and organic enrichment. Primary activities that have contribute d, or continue to contribute, to the degradation of coastal water quality \u2014often known as the dead zone within the Gulf of Mexico \u2014include those associated with the petrochemical industry, hazardous and oil-field waste, disposal sites, agricultural and livestock farming, power plants, pulp and paper mill plants, fish processing, commercial and recreational fisheries, municipal wastewater treatment, and maritime shipping. Other activities include land modification s for flood control, river development, harbors, docks, navigation channels, and pipelines. The concentration of petrochemical industries along the Gulf coast is the largest in the United States and includes extensive oil and gas development operations both on- and offshore, tanker and barge transport of both imported and domestic petroleum, and petrochemical refini ng and manufacturing operations (MMS, 2001a). Marine The four most predominant factors that affect marine water quality within the Gulf of Mexico region are coastal runoff, oil production, marine transportation, and natural oil seepage. The magnitude of these factors is directly related to the configuration of the basin, which contro ls the oceanic waters that enter and leave the Gulf, and to the runoff from land, which controls the quantity of freshwater input into the Gulf. For exampl e, there is a higher concentration of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) nearshore, while large amounts of petroleum-related VOCs have been detected in offshore areas (Kennicutt and Gallaway, 1985). In nearshore areas, point and non-point so urce pollution enters the Gulf via river inputs. The Mississippi River is the largest contributor in that it drains approximately 41 percent of the entire continental United States. A major consequence from this input is nutrient overenrichment, which creates hypoxic (oxygen-depleted) waters. This hypoxic condition has been identified in shallow depths of 13 -16 ft nearshore to as far as 8.7 mi offshore (Rabalais et al., 1999). Offshore, thousands of oil-producing platforms operate within the Gulf of Mexico region. These platforms discharge produced water \u2014that is, the water brought up along with petroleum and oil reserves during exploitation. This produced water is known to contain benz ene, arsenic, lead, naphthalene, zinc, and toluene. More than 100,000 vessels cart millions of tons of cargo across the Gulf of Mexico each year; of these about 45 percent are petroleum and oil related. Spills and dumping via discharged bilge water and lack of segregated ballast tanks during transit are among the chief causes of both marine and coastal debris. Along with on- and offshore platforms, marine transporters located in this region are responsible for 21 percent of all oil spills reported in the United States. In 1999 alone, there were 1,756 re ported spills within the Gulf of Mexico region (USCG, 2000a). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-41 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region The large oil and petroleum resource base of this region also alters water quality via naturally occurring oil seepages. Though insignificant compared with larger manmade oil spills, these small quantities are responsible for some biota kill and can pose an environmental threat to coastal and marine resources. 3.4.1.2. Meteorology and Air Quality Climate The Gulf of Mexico region is influenced by a maritime subtropical climate controlled mainly by the clockwise wind circulation around a semipermanent area of high pressure known as the Bermuda High, which alternates between the Azores and Bermuda. This circulati on around the western edge of the high- pressure system, aided by the trade winds, results in the predominance of moist, southeasterly winds throughout this region. During the winter months, a persistent high-pressure system over North America results in rare periods of relatively dry, polar continental air over the Gulf. Humidity, cloudiness, visibility, precipitation, and air temperat ures over the waters of the Gulf are typical of a maritime climate and show little diurnal or seasonal variation. Winds speeds average 6.5 kt from the south-southeast but are more variable near coastal regions because of the effect of a land-sea breeze circulation system. Tropical storms also affect this area, as hurricanes are expected to influence the area at least once every 2 years (MMS, 2001a). Air Quality Air quality of coastal counties 12 is measured against National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), resulting from the Clean Air Act and its 1977 amendments (40 CFR 50.12), or it is measured against more restrictive adopted state standards. These standards are designed to protect human health. The USEPA requires states to report ambi ent air quality levels for six major pollutants: particulate matter (10 micron s or larger [PM10]), sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone. NAAQS have been adopted by each of the Gulf of Mexico region's states except Florida, which amended these standards to make sulfur dioxide emission levels more restrictive than the federal standard. Appendix F, Table F.1-1 summarizes federal ambient air standards in detail. All coastal counties of the Gulf of Me xico region are considered to be in compliance with the NAAQS attainment levels for PM10, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. However, the USEPA identified fifteen counties that are not in complianc e for ozone, the primary constituent of smog (USEPA, 2000a). 12 The Office of Ocean Resources, Cons ervation and Assessment (ORCA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce classifies counties as coastal \"because they meet one of the following criteria: (1) at least 15 percent of their total land area is located with in the nation's coastal watershe ds (as defined by ORCA's Coastal Assessment Framework [ http://spo.nos.noaa.gov/projects/caf/caf.html ], or (2) the county accounts for at least 15 percent of the land area of a coastal cataloging unit (a U.S. Geological Survey-defined drainage basin)\" (http://spo.nos.noaa.gov/projec ts/population/population.html). The U.S. Bureau of the Census also uses ORCA's coastal counties list. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-42 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region 3.4.2. Biological Environment13 3.4.2.1. Marine Mammals There are a variety of marine mammals \u2014twenty-eight cetaceans (whales and dolphins), one pinniped (sea lion), and two sirenians (manatees)\u2014 known to inhabit the Gulf of Mexico region. The common bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ), the most numerous cetacean in the Gulf, is found in all water depths of the Gulf. In deep waters, the pantropical spotted dolphin ( Stenella attenuata ) is the whales ( Kogia breviceps and simus ) are the most common large whales (MMS, 2000a). At least three additional species \u2014 long-finned pilot Delphinus capensis )\u2014have been recorded close enough to the boundaries of this region that they may eventually be found in this area (MMS , 2000b). Appendix F, Table F.4-1 lists twenty-three recognized nonendangere d marine mammals in this region. 3.4.2.2. Marine and Coastal Birds The offshore waters, coastal beaches, an d contiguous wetlands of the Gulf of Mexico region provide habitats for migrant and resident marine and coastal birds. More than 230 species of marine and coastal birds have been identified as part- or full-time residents of this region, with the majority being nearly year-round residents (USGS, 1998a). Many species are strongly pelagic and, therefore, rarely seen from shore. The remaining species are found within coastal and inshore habitats. In the winter, populations of s horebirds are augmented by large numbers of wintering marine, freshwater, or terrestrial birds from more northern ecosystems. Recent surveys indicate that the coastal areas of Louisiana and Texas are among the most important in terms of colony sites and total population numbers of nesting marine and coastal birds (MMS, 2000b). The presence of three Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) sites, one Ramsar site, and forty-three National Wildlife Refuges in the Gulf of Mexico region indicates that large numbers of shorebirds (WHSRN sites) and wetland birds (Ramsar site) concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. The WHSRN maintains a network of monitoring sites comprising critical habitat for shorebird species. These sites are categorized as hemispheric, with an annual count of 500,000 shorebirds or 30 percent of a species flyway population ; international, wi th an annual count of 100,000 shorebirds or 10 percent of a species flyway population; and regional, with an annual count of 20,000 shorebirds or 5 pe rcent of a species flyway population. The three WHSRN sites in the Gulf of Mexico region are international sites (WHSRN, 2004). The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands designates Ramsar sites as wetlands of international importance. These wetlands are selected based on criteria such as supporting 20,000 or more waterbirds and regularly supporting 1 percent of the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of waterbird (Wetlands Internat ional, 2004). The National Wildlife Refuge sites are established under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 13 Only nonendangered species will be included in Section 3.4.2, Biological Environment. Threat ened, endangered, and candidate species will be discussed separately in Se ction 3.4.3, Threatened, Endangered, and Candidate Species. For this reason, sea turt les will only be discussed in Section 3.4.3, as they are a thre atened/endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-43 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region 1997 with the aim of protecting wildlife and preserving biological diversity (USFWS, 2004). For the purpose of this PEIS, marine and coastal birds are categorized into five major groups, as detailed in Appendix F, Table F.4-2: seabirds, shorebirds, wading and marsh and raptors. 3.4.2.3. Plankton and Fish Plankton Plankton are organisms that float at or near the surface of marine waters and are unable to swim against tides, winds, or currents. Plankton species, which represent nearly all major aquatic phyla, can be roughly classified as phytoplankton (microscopic plant life), zooplankton (microscopic animals), and ichthyoplankton (fish eggs and larvae). Phytoplankton are microscopic floating algae, which form the base of the food web. They are responsible for approximat ely one-half of global photosynthesis and play a vital role in stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide. These plants can only survive in the shallower, sunlit wate rs of open-ocean and estuarine areas. High production rates are commonly observed at intermediate salinities in the Mississippi discharge plume (Lohrenz et al., 1990). Common types of phytoplankton occurring in the Gulf of Mexico region include diatoms, protococ caceans, euglenids, either part (meroplankton) or all (holoplankton) of their life cycle as plankton. Their temporal and spatial distributions depend on a number of factors including currents, water temperature, and phytoplankton abundance (Loeb et al ., 1983). The zooplankton community of the Gulf of Mexico regi on includes Rotaria eggs, nauplii of Moira, and Chryodorus. Zooplankton levels drop be cause of direct mortality, avoidance behavior, and vertical migration when hypoxic conditions occur near the Mississippi discharge plume (MMS, 2001a). Most fishes inhabiting the Gulf of Mexico, whether benthic or pelagic, have pelagic larval stages (ichthyoplankton). It has been estimated that there are 200 families with more than 1,700 species wh ose early life stages may occur in the Gulf. In addition to the resident fauna, many eggs, larvae, and juveniles may be advected into the Gulf from the Cari bbean Sea via the Loop Current (MMS, 2000b). In a study of the Loop Current front, 237 taxa representing 100 families of ichthyoplankton were identified. Some of the most abunda nt families in the Gulf are Myctophidae, Gonostomatid ae, and Bergmacerotidae (MMS, 2000b). Fish The Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Manageme nt Council (Append ix F) manages the commercial fisheries in the region. During 2000, total fish landings for commercial fisheries in the Gulf total ed 814,086 metric tons (NMFS, 2004). In the Gulf, the bulk of the commercial fish ing landings are from epipelagic fish, which occupy the upper 656 ft of the water column. These include FRPs for Oil 3-44 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region (Thunnus thynnus ). Some the commercially important fish and lobster species are found in the coral reefs and seagrass beds. These species F, Table F.4-3, lists the commercially important fish species of the Gulf of Mexico region. Because of their location in coastal waters , the fish of hard-bottom habitats have been exploited vigorously and some species, such as the red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus ), have seen serious population declines. The Gulf coast has approximately 9,000 mi of shellfish grow ing waters, of which about 42 percent is approved for harvesting. Between 1990 and 1995, the total acreage of approved shellfish-growing waters decreased by 574,000 acres because of habitat degradation and overexploitation (USEPA, 1999). 3.4.2.4. Intertidal Habitats Beaches and Coastal Barrier Islands The Gulf of Mexico region has 14,304 mi of shoreline (Good et al., 1998), with coastal barrier islands and beache s found at various locations. The coast from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle and southeast Florida is part of a complex integrated system of beaches, dunes, marshes, bays, tidal flats, and inlets forming part of the extensive barr ier island system in the United States. These barrier islands and beaches are constantly migrating, eroding, and building in response to natural processes and human activities. By separating coastal waters from the open ocean, thes e islands contribute to the amount of available estuarine habitat and protect coastal wetlands. Of all the coastal areas in this region, Louisiana's barrier islands are eroding the most quickly \u2014in some places up to 100 ft of barrier island shoreline is disappearing every year (MMS, 2000b). Along most of the Gulf, the beaches are composed of sand and other unconsolidated coarse sediments. Coastal beaches are important not only for their ecological habitats (such as for endangered sea turtle nesting) but also for their economic integrity in terms of tourism and recreation. States bordering the Gulf of Mexico have the highest average erosion rates (about 3 ft/yr) in the nation (Heinz Cente r, 2000). Louisiana has the most rapidly retreating beaches on the continent, with the Louisiana shoreline retreating annually at an average rate of 13.8 ft/yr (MMS, 2000b). The hi ghest reported rates of Louisiana's coastal retreat occurred along the coastal plain of the Mississippi River. Estuaries, Wetlands, and Mangroves Estuaries are important habitats for both resident and transitory species, providing spawning or nursery habitat and foraging areas for numerous species, including invertebrates, fishes, reptile s, birds, and mammals. High organic productivity, high detritus production, and extensive nutrient recycling characterize estuaries. Some examples of the largest estuaries in the Gulf of Mexico region are Tampa Bay, Florida; Mobile Bay, Alabama; and Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi Bay, Texas. These estuaries are impacted by anthropogenic activities from nutrient en richment to habitat modification, plus channelization. Many different habitat types are found in and around estuaries, including shallow marine waters, freshwat er and salt marshes, sandy beaches, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-45 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region mud and sand flats, rocky shores, river de ltas, mangrove forests, tidal pools, seagrass beds, and wooded swamps. Appe ndix F, Figure F.4-2 shows estuary locations in the Gulf of Mexico region. Wetland habitats are associated with estu arine areas. These habitats may occupy only narrow bands along the shore, or they may cover larger expanses at the mouths of bays, rivers, or coastal stre ams. They support a large number and wide diversity of environm entally and economically important invertebrates, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The extensive coastal wetlands that lie along the Gulf make up approximately half of the total U.S. wetland area (NOAA, 1991). The entire Gulf of Mexico region contains approximately 17,900 mi 2 of wetlands, with Louisiana having the greatest area of coastal wetlands with 5,037 mi 2 (Good et al., 1998). However, over the past several decades, this region has lost close to 50 percent of wetland nursery areas as the result of channelization, river control, subsidence of wetlands, urbanization, and poor water-management practi ces (Good et al., 1998). In tropical latitudes, mangroves domina te most wetlands. In this region, they primarily grow along the Gulf coast of southwest Florida. Estimated total area of mangrove forests in Florida ranges from 430,000 to 650,000 acres (Handley, 1995). The three most impo rtant species of mangrove s in this area are red mangrove ( Rhizophora mangle ), protect habitats and nurseries for fish, crustaceans, and shellfish; provide food for marine species; and provide shoreline protection from wind, waves, and floods. Mangrove s are sensitive to cold temperatures and can take 5 to 10 years to reestablish their presence following a freeze. In addition to freezing, several human activities \u2014ditching or impounding for mosquito control, reduci ng freshwater input, and clearing and filling\u2014 lead to the degradation of mangrove quantity and quality. 3.4.2.5. Subtidal Habitats Submerged Grass Beds The subtidal (benthic) areas of the Gulf of Mexico region consist of either soft or rocky substrates. These areas support a variety of marine life and habitats, including seagrass beds and coral reefs. Seagrass ecosystems are widely recognized as some of the most productive benthic habitats in the Gulf coast's estuarine and nearshore waters. Seagrass meadows provide food for wintering waterfowl plus important spawning and foraging habitats for several species of commercially important finfish and shellfish. The physi cal structure provided by seagrasses affords juveniles refuge from predation and allows for attachment of epiphytes and benthic organisms. Seagrass communities also support several threatened and endangered species, including sea turtles and manatees. Appendix F, Figure F.4-3 provides the locations of submerged gras s beds in the Gulf of Mexico region. Although often considered continuous ar ound the entire periphery of the Gulf, seagrasses exist only in isolated patche s and narrow bands from Mobile Bay, Alabama, west to Aransas Bay, Texas. They are, however, more extensively developed from Mobile Bay to Florida Bay (see Appendix F, Figure F.4-3). There are an estimated 7.4 million acres of seagrasses in the Gulf of Mexico region. Approximately 98.5 percent of the seagrass beds in this region are located in the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-46 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region eastern Gulf off the coast of Florida (M MS, 1996a). The coastal waters of Alabama and Mississippi contain approximately 74 ,000 acres of seagrass growing along the inner edges of the barrier islands of th e Mississippi Sound and along prominent bays. To the west, Texas nearshore waters contain 37,000 acres of seagrass beds (MMS, 2000b). Five species of seagrass commonly are found in the Gulf of Mexico region: Changes in seagrass distribution can reflect the health of a water body, and losses of seagrasses may signal water-quality problems in coastal waters. Losses of seagrasses in the northern Gu lf of Mexico region over the last five decades have been extensive \u2014from 20 to 100 percent for most estuaries \u2014with only a few areas experiencing increases in seagrasses. Primary factors believed responsible for theses losses include hurricanes, dredging, dredged material disposal, trawling, water-quality degradation, flood protection levees, saltwater intrusion that moved beds closer inland, and infrequent fres hwater diversions from the Mississippi River into coastal areas during flood stages (Handley, 1995). Coral Reefs Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive communities on earth. They buffer adjacent shorelines from wave action, thus protecting coastal environments and reducing erosion. Reefs also provide economic benefits in terms of pharmaceutical research, commercial and recreational fisheries, and cost reduction through the mitigation of property damage. For example, approximately 50 percent of all federally managed fisheries depend on coral reefs and related habitats for a part of their life cycle (CoRIS, 2002). U.S. coral reefs cover about 6,500 mi 2: more than 90 percent is located in the western Pacific; the remainder is loc ated off Florida and Texas, and in the Caribbean Sea. Throughout the Gulf's ne arshore, continental slope, and canyon areas, coral exists in both reef communities and solitary stands. See Appendix F, Figure F.4-4, for the coral reef areas in the Gulf of Mexico region. About 100 mi northwest of Tampa Bay, Florida, and en compassing 379,392 acres, the Florida Middle Grounds \u2014the best-known and most important area on the west coast of Florida in terms of coral communities \u2014consists of two types of large reef structures: mountain-like pinnacles and flatto p plateaus. The tops of the structures are in 70 to 90 ft of water, and the st ructures slope down to depths of 120 to 130 ft. They are covered with dense algae, large sponges, sea whips, and several stony coral species including fire coral ( Millipora sp.), ten-ray Montastrea cavernosa) (Sakas, 2002). The East and West Flower Garden Banks are two of the most prominent topographic features in the central Gulf. These coral banks rise from surrounding water depths of greater than 328 ft to a dept h of 66 ft at the crest. Their crests consist of carbonate rock formed by reef-building corals, coralline algae, and other lime-secreting creatu res. The dominant community on the banks is composed primarily of hermatypic corals ( Dendrophylliidae ) consisting of approximately twenty species (MMS, 1999a, b). Additionally, more than 80 species of algae, approximately 250 spec ies of macroinvertebrates, and more than 120 species of fish are associate d with these features (MMS, 2001a). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-47 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region Coral reefs also exist in areas surroundi ng the Dry Tortugas, an island group about 73 mi west of Key West, Florida. These coral beds form an elliptical- shaped structure dominated by staghorn coral ( Acropora spp.). Coral reefs are vulnerable to environmental changes, including the impacts of human activities. Environmental influences, such as temperature changes, sea-level fluctuations, and storm events, can negatively impact reefs via coral bleaching, lack of sunlight, and ph ysical damage. Vessel groundings and anchorings, dredging, destructive fishing practices, overfishing, pollution from poor land use, chemical loading, marine debris, and invasive alien species each contributes to the loss of coral reefs. 3.4.2.6. Areas of Special Concern Executive Order 13158 (\"Marine Protecte d Areas\") defines marine protected areas as \"any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cu ltural resources therein\" (65 FR 34909) . There are many different types of marine protected areas within and bordering U.S. waters; some examples include National Marine Sanctuaries, National Seashores, National Parks, National Monuments, National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, and many others (NOAA, 2002a). They have different shapes, sizes, and mana gement characteristics and have been established for different purposes. The Gulf of Mexico region has two National Marine Sanctuaries, seven National Park units, thirty-eight National Wildlife Refuges, three National Estuarine Research Reserves, and seven National Estuary Programs located in coastal or near-coastal areas. For more details regarding history, purpose, and specific site locations pertaining to this region, see Appendix F, Tables F.4-4 through F.4-6 and Figures F.4-5 through F.4-7. 3.4.3. Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS ) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have classified six threatened, fift een endangered, and eleven candidate species within the Gulf of Mexico region. These consist of eight marine mammals, seven marine and coastal birds, thirteen fish species, and four sea turtles. Six cetaceans and two sirenians are endangered and reside in or migrate through the Gulf of Mexico region. Appendix F, Table F.4-7, lis ts the threatened, enda ngered or candidate marine mammals of the Gulf of Mexico Region. Although whale sightings are less f r e q u e n t i n t h i s r e g i o n t h a n i n t h e m o r e open areas of the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, whales are known to breed in more protected tropical waters. As such, the relatively closed off environment of the Gulf, in conj unction with its warmer water temperatures, has the potential to lure these species. Seven species of threatened and endangered ma rine and coastal birds reside in selected habitats provided by the Gulf of Mexico region. Appendix F, Table F.4-8, lists threatened, endangered or candidate marine and coastal bi rds of the Gulf of Mexico. In the winter, populations of shorebirds are augmented by large numbers of wintering individuals from Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-48 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region northern ecosystems. Other species reside only temporarily along their route to South America. This region's well-developed mangrove, estuary, wetland, and coastal beach habitats provide the necessary biological divers ity for a variety of endangered bird species. National Wildlife Refuges and National Park units across the region also provide sanctuaries. Variable ecological factors, including salinit y, primary productivity, and bottom type, differ widely across this region and between inshore and offshore waters. Therefore, the threatened and candidate fish depend on various environments and are not randomly distributed (e.g., coastal pelagic and reef fish). Appendix F, Table F.4-9, lists threatened, endangered or candidate fish of the Gulf of Mexico region. As such, many threatened and endangered fish species require habitats th at provide specific elements. When these environments are altered, usually by human activity, more sensitive fish species can experience rapid population decline. In an effort to protect these critical habitats, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established the Florida Keys and the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuaries. Four species of threatened or endangered sea turtles reside in the Gulf of Mexico region. Appendix F, Table F.4-10, lists threatened, en dangered, or candidate sea turtles of the Gulf of Mexico region. Sea turtles nest along the entire northern Gulf coast and parts of southwest coast of Florida. Adult turtles are apparently less abundant in the deeper waters of the Gulf than they are in waters less than 27 to 50 ft in depth (NRC, 1990b). Because of such factors as water depth, bo ttom sediments, and pr ey availability, the relative abundance of sea turtles increases dramatically east of Mobile Bay (MMS, 2000b). 3.4.4. Essential Fish Habitat The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (FCMA) established eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) charged with developing Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) to achieve optimum fishery yields within their respective regions. In subsequent years, additional legislation was formulated to increase the effectiveness of this act. Two examples are the NMFS \"602 Guidelines\" (\"Guidelines for the Preparation of Fishery Management Plans under the FCMA,\" 50 CFR part 602), which provided an official definition of overfishing an d required each FMP to includ e measurable definitions of overfishing for each managed species, and the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-297; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ), which was passed and integrated into the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996 (M SFCMA, Public Law 94-265, as amended through October 11, 1996; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). This later act required FMCs and the Secretary of Commerce to identify and describe Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species specified under each respective FMP. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (GMFMC) is responsible for implementing the MSFCMA through FMPs in the Gulf of Mexico region. EFH is designated under seven FMPs in the Gulf of Mexico region\u2014red drum, reef fish, coastal migratory pelagics, shrimp, stone crab, sp iny lobster, and coral. The commercially important fish species of the Gulf of Mexico region are listed in Appendix F, Table F.4-3. NMFS is currently finalizing an updated set of EFH designations developed by the GMFMC for this region. The updated desi gnations will likely encompass all waters extending from the U.S.-Mexico border to the boundary between the areas covered by the GMFMC and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) from estuarine waters out to depths of 100 fathoms (GMFMC, 2004). EFH designations for Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-49 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region each region are available on-line14. It is important to identify habitat areas essential to each life stage of a federally manage d species to ensure sustainabl e fisheries and the ability of managed species to contribute to a healthy ecosystem. 3.4.5. Socioeconomic Environment 3.4.5.1. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment This socioeconomic impact area, based on NOAA's definition of coastal counties, comprises 143 coastal counties (k nown as parishes in Louisiana) in the five states listed in Section 3.4.1. The coastal counties/parishes in the socioeconomic impact area extend from Monroe County, Florida, to Cameron County, Texas. The coastal population of the Gulf of Mexico region is 18,002,958 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a), which is calculated by combining population statistics for the region's 143 coastal counties/parishes, as identified by NOAA (includes three counties in Georgia). Appendix F, Table F.4-11 lists these coastal counties and their populations. The Gulf of Mexico region's coastal population makes up 6.4 percent of the total U.S. population, of which the majority is located in Florida and Texas (NOAA, 2002b; U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). Appendix F, Figure F.4-8, shows the coastal population distribution of the Gulf of Mexico region. The Gulf of Mexico region varies substantially in socioeconomic patterns ranging from low-density, undeveloped rural areas to high-density, highly developed urban centers. The range vari es from 414 people in Kenedy County, Texas, to 3,400,578 people in Harris, Texas. Appendix F, Table F.4-12 lists the most densely populated coastal counties/parishes of this region. In 2000, the coastal counties/parishes wi thin this region had a total civilian labor force of 8,130,780, with an average unemployment rate of 6.39 percent, compared with the national average of 5.8 percent. Income levels rank lower than the national average of both per capita and median household incomes at $16, 276 and $32,573, respectively. (The n ational average per capita and median household incomes are $21,587 and $41,994, respectively.) For example, Starr County, Texas, the poorest county in the region, has a per capita income of $7,069, while Collier County, Florida, the wealthiest county in the region, has a per capita income of $31,195 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). 3.4.5.2. Economic Status Three primary sectors make up the foundation of the Gulf of Mexico's economic system: tourism, oil and gas exploration and production, and the seafood industry. An associated fourth sector provides services to the former three in a variety of capacities includ ing government, sale s, communications, and infrastructure. A wide array of natural resources within this region attracts tourists year-round. In 2000, the combined revenue for coastal tourism for the five states of the Gulf of Mexico region exceeded $41 billion. These activities consist of 14 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/habit atprotection/efh/fish_manage_c.htm Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-50 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region recreational boating (including marinas), beach visits, ecotourism, scuba diving, commercial cruises, amusement park s, and historical sites (ACC, 1998). This region has one of the highest concentrations of oil and gas activities in the world, the majority of which is located along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas. It is estimated that nearly 25 percent of U.S. crude oil production was produced in this area in 2001, and production is estimated to increase by 5 percent or more in coming years (EIA, 2002b, c) . Supporting sectors such as gas processing plants, navigation channels, oil refineries, pipelines and pipeline falls, pipe coating and storage yards, platform fabrication yards, separation facilities, service bases, terminals, and other related industries contribute substantially to the onshore economy. Commercial fishing activities of the region bring in more than 25 percent of the total U.S. seafood catch. The shrimp catch alone is worth more than $500 million per year with crab, oysters, finf ish, lobsters, menhaden, and snappers bringing in another estimated $300 m illion (NMFS, 2004). Similar to the oil industry, this industry has an extensive onshore service sector, including warehousing and transportation companies, canneries and packaging plants, sales and marketing firms, marine maintenance and support operations, and many other associated service industries. 3.4.5.3. Vessel Transportation and Ports An extensive domestic and international shipping pattern exists via the marine waters of the Florida Straits, Yucatan Channel, and Bay of Campeche. In addition to this pattern, there also is a substa ntial amount of domestic waterborne commerce along the Gulf coast that does not always use open Gulf waters. Vessels engaged in this activity generally use the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, which follows the coastline inshore and through bays and estuaries, and, in some cases, may move offshore. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway reaches from Fort Myers, Florida, to Brownsville, Texas. The ports of New Orleans, Louisiana, and Houston, Texas, are two of the largest ports serving the United States. In 1999, there were mo re than 750,000 vessel trips meas ured along waterways associated with major ports throughout the regi on (USACE, 1999b). Appendix F, Table F.4-13 lists the major ports of the Gulf of Mexico region. In 1999, the Gulf of Mexico region received or shipped from its ports more than 1.1 billion short tons of foreign an d domestic cargo: domestic shipping and receiving accounted for 189,430 and 244,724 thousand short tons, respectively, while foreign shipping and recei ving accounted for 192,498 and 413,013 thousand short tons, respectively. In addition, there were 109,251 thousand short tons of intrastate w aterborne commerce (USACE, 1999b). The tankering of crude oil is the most significant contribution to vessel traffic in the Gulf of Mexico region. Extensive refinery capacity, easy port access, and a well-developed onshore transportation syst em contributed to the development of the Gulf coast as an important center for both imported and domestic oil and associated refinery operations. The region receives about 65 percent of all crude oil imported into this countr y. In 2000, approximately 1. 3 billion bbl of crude oil were imported, the majority of which was received from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (EIA, 2001a). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-51 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region Of the oil imported into the region, approximately 70 percent enters through the Yucatan Channel, and approximately 12 percent enters through the Florida Straits. Because of the Loop Current, tanker movement is preferentially routed through the Yucatan Channel. Tanker captai ns use the circulation patterns in the Florida Straits to aid in returning to their ports of origin (MMS, 1996b). 3.4.5.4. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are very important to the economics of the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico leads all other U.S. regions in fishery production. During 2000, fisher ies in this region produced more than 1.79 billion lb, valued at $996 billion, an d provided nearly 40 percent of all commercial fish landings in the co ntinental United States (NMFS, 2004). Appendix F, Table F.4-14 lists the top co mmercial landings for the Gulf of Mexico region. A variety of species are caught and la nded in Gulf of Mexico commercial fisheries, including at least ninety-seven species from thirty-three families, of which the most important species groups are oceanic pelagic fishes, reef fishes, coastal pelagic species, and estuarine-de pendent species. The primary estuarine- dependent species targeted are menhaden, penaeid shrimp (brown, white, and pink), and blue crab (MMS, 2001a). Recreational Fisheries A major recreational activity in the Gulf of Mexico region is offshore and coastal fishing. It is estimated that more than 40 percent of the nation's marine recreational fishing occurs in the Gulf, wi th the highest number of anglers fishing in Florida and Texas (USEPA, 1999). According to a 2001 NMFS Marine Recreational Fishery Statistical Survey, ov er 3 million marine recreational fishing participants took 22.8 million fishing trips and caught appr oximately 163 million fish excluding Texas (NMFS, 2002). Fo r this region in 2001, the economic expenditures due to this fishery were approximately $8 billion (ASA, 2002)15. 3.4.5.5. Subsistence Information on subsistence use of fish and shellfish in the North Texas Shelf is limited. While some residents may supplement their diets with these resources, subsistence is not known to be a prominent activity in this area, as compared to Alaska, where Native communities may su ffer substantial economic and cultural losses due to contamination of subsistence seafood during an oil spill. 3.4.5.6. Archaeological/Historic Resources At the end of the last Ice Age more than 12,000 years ago, the continental shelves in the Gulf of Mexico region were exposed because great amounts of water were frozen into glaciers. The ocean continental shelf of this region was subaerially exposed and habitable by terrestrial flora and fauna, including prehistoric man, who is known to have been in the region since about 12,000 years B.P. (Before Present) (MMS, 2000b). At that time, the sea level would have 15 This includes the total dollar amount fr om both coasts in Florida. Recreational fi shing information for Texas is unavailable and therefore is not included here. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-52 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region been approximately 148 ft below presen t sea level (MMS, 2000b). Therefore, the continental shelf shoreward of the 148-ft bathymetric contour would have potential for prehistoric sites dating subsequent to 12,000 B.P. Geographic features that have a high pr obability for associated prehistoric sites in the northwestern and north central Gulf of Mexico region (from Texas to Alabama) include barrier islands and ba ck barrier embayments, river channels and associated floodplains and terraces, and salt dome features. Recent investigations in northwestern Florida ar ound Apalachee Bay area resulted in the discovery of more than 30 archaeological sites. Most of the sites are located between 3 and 9 nm offshore within state waters (MMS, 2000b). Most historic archaeological resources in the Gulf of Mexico region are shipwrecks. A literature search for re ported ship losses and known shipwrecks was conducted as part of the archaeological resources baseline study for the northern Gulf (MMS, 2000b). This study indicated that less than 2 percent of pre-twentieth century ships reported lost in the Gulf and less than 10 percent of all ships reported lost between 1500 and 1945 have k nown locations (110 out of 1,589). Considering the problems with inac curate wreck reporting, drift, and breakup of wrecks, and ships that have been lost but never reported, it becomes apparent that very little is known about the locations of historic shipwrecks in this region. An updated investigation of the initia l Coastal Environments, Inc. study identified more than 4,000 potential shipwreck locations in the Gulf, nearly 1,500 of which occur on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) (MMS, 2000b). The study also investigated the relationship between factors such as ocean currents, storm tracks, natural navigational hazards, economic history of port development and usage, and distribution of shipwreck patterns. The results of these analyses indicate that many shipwrecks on the OCS occur in clustered patterns related mainly to navigation hazards and port entrances. As a result of this study, a high probability zone for the occurrence of shipwrecks was refined. High concentrations of shipwrecks occur off Florida's west coast from Pensacola and the Apalachicola-C ape San Bias areas (MMS, 2000b). 3.4.5.7. Recreation and Tourism The Gulf of Mexico region is one of the major recreational regions of the United States, particularly in connection with marine fishing and beach-related activities. Tourists from domestic and foreign locations come to the coastal beaches, barrier islands, estuarine bays and sounds, river deltas, and tidal marshes. Publicly owned and administered areas (such as national seashores, parks, beaches, and wildlife lands), as well as designated preservation areas (such as historic and natural sites, landmarks, wilderness areas, wildlife sanctuaries, and scenic rivers), attract residents and visitors throughout the year. Commercial and private recreational fa cilities and establishments, such as resorts, marinas, amusement parks, an d ornamental gardens, also serve as primary areas of interest. The region's coastal shorefront has many public and private recreation areas. Most of the outdoor recreation activities are associated with accessible beach areas. There are more than 400 public access points to beac hes and bays along Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-53 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region the coast of Texas (TGLO, 2000). Florida has identified 41 percent, more than 300 mi, of sandy shoreline that is accessible to the public (Florida Department of Community Affairs, 2000). These beaches are a major inducement for coastal tourism, as well as a primary resource for resident recreational activity. These physical attributes make tourism a prominent industry in the Gulf of Mexico region. Coastal tourist expenditur es amounted to more than $41 billion and created more than 640,000 jobs in 1996 (ACC, 1998). Coastal resources (especially beaches), marine and sport fishery resources, and developed coastal tourism infrastructure contribute significantly to Gulf state tourism attractions. Tourism is the leading industry in the s tate of Florida; in Texas, tourism is second only to the oil and chemical industry. Ecotourism and gambling are the fastest growing components of this tourism sector. 3.4.5.8. Public Safety and Worker Health Oil spill response is one of the U.S. Co ast Guard's (USCG's) many missions. In responding to oil spills, the USCG is aw are of public safety and the effects that alternative response technologies \u2014chemical dispersion and in situ burning \u2014could have on human health. Under the guidelines established by the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), steps have been taken to protect both the public and oil spill responders. Whether compensated workers or volunteers, responders ar e required to be certified under either the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSH A's) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standa rd or USEPA's Hazardou s Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standa rd. These standards en sure that responders understand the hazards of oil spill respon se and how to protect themselves. To assist in public safety, the USCG has the maritime safety authority to establish a safety zone around oil spill cleanup ope rations. This zone is established to safeguard the public and responders from the hazards associated with cleanup. In addition, USCG standard operating proc edures (SOPs) are used to protect responders, as well as the public, from the hazards associated with chemical dispersion and in situ burning. These procedures are outlined in SOPs in each Area Contingency Plan's (ACP's) Site Safety Plan . In addition, training exercises such as PREP (Preparedness for Response Exercise Progra m) and SONS (Spill of National Significance) train USCG response personnel to avoid safety hazards. Dispersants are a liquid chemical used to disperse oil spills from the ocean surface (see Section 2.2.2). During an oil spill, di spersant application can be from either an aerial or a shipboard platform. In both cases response personnel have the potential to be accidentally exposed to the dispersant, and in extreme cases exposure to the public could occur. The two types of dispersants with use allowed in the United States have OSHA-establish ed, permissible exposure limits of 50 ppm on skin. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for these dispersants makes clear the human health concerns from excess exposure. In situ burning of an oil spill entails setting contained or boomed oil on fire (see Section 2.2.3). This action has been acknowledged has having potential human health and safety effects. Besides the physical hazards to responders, there is the potential for inhalation of airborne burn products. In situ burning emits a plume of black smoke laden with particulates (PM10, soot), the main public health concern. Response personnel working close to the burn may be exposed to Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-54 2009 3.4. Affected Environment: Gulf of Mexico Region levels of gases and particulates that would require them to use personal protective equipment. Occupational standards such as OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) are applicable . For the general public, NOAA (2000a) reported that particulate concentrations in a smoke plume remain the only agent of concern past 1 or 2 mi downwind, with the gases created in a burn dissipating to levels close to background. Public exposure to smoke particulate from the burn is not expected to occu r unless the smoke plume travels down to ground level. Since the general public may include sensitive individuals, such as the very young and very old, pregnant women, and people with pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, this population's tolerance to particulates may be significantly lower than that of the resp onders. There is little data concerning the effect on humans of particulates from the in situ burning of oil. Based on chemical analysis of soot particulates and their physical behavior, the hazard is expected to be similar to that of better-known particulates emissions that are now regulated by the NAAQS. In 1997, the Special Monitoring of Applied Response Technologies (SMART) protocol 16 was created, in part, to address the particulates concerns and to better aid the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) in making decisions related to initiating, continuing, or terminating in situ burning. 16 http://response.restoration.no aa.gov/oilaids/SMART/SMART.html Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-55 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region 3.5. P ACIFIC REGION 3.5.1. Physical Environment For the purpose of this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS), the Pacific region specifically constitutes the coas tal area in which the states of California, Oregon, and Washington border the Pacific Oc ean. Appendix F, Figure F.5-1, shows the major currents of the Pacific region. The California Current, low in temperature and salinity flowing southward from the northern latitudes down the Washington-Oregon border to southern California, dominates these 2,134 mi of coastal waters (A ppendix F, Figure F.5-1). The current is strongest at the surface and is approximately 1,000 km wide with a typical velocity of 0.2 kt (NOAA, 2003b). A secondary and seasona l coastal current is the Davidson Current, which flows northward averaging 2 kts along the Pacific region from Point Conception, California, to Washington duri ng the fall and winter season (Barth, 2002). The Southern California Eddy, offshore from Point Conception, forms off the California Current, and is stronger in the summer and autumn and weaker during winter and spring. The physical oceanographic conditions along the Washington, Oregon, and northern California coast are primarily influenced by the California Current and the input of fresh water from precipitation and river runoff. The Columbia River provides a major source of freshwater to Washington and Oregon coastal waters. Off the coast of central California, the influx of fresh water is from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers through the mouth of San Francisco Bay. Analysis of surface waters in the California Current shows the seasonal variation of temperature and salinity from 55\u00b0 to 68\u00b0F and 32 to 34 parts per thousand (ppt) (County of Santa Barbara, 2002). 3.5.1.1. Water Quality Coastal The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA, 1998a) compiled assessments of the Pacific region water quality within estuaries and coastal waters in its 305(b) report. The quality of the estuarine and coastal waters varied from a high of 93 percent of the surveyed estuaries partially supporting aquatic life to a low of 60 percent supporting life. The coastal waters surrounding areas of low population, industry, and residential development \u2014such as northern California , portions of Oregon, and the northwest coast of Washington \u2014are essentially unpolluted. Few roads, steep rocky cliffs, and restricted access by private owners and Native American tribes make accessibility difficult, contributing to the lack of shoreline development. However, along much of the California coast and developed areas of Oregon and Washington, water is degraded from shipping activities, logging activities, pulp mill wastes, domestic and industrial di scharges, and agricultural runoff. These anthropogenic sources impact the co astal waters at various levels. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-56 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region Marine Marine water quality in the Pacific region is generally good to excellent (MMS, 1996b). The dilution effect of the Colu mbia River plume ex tends offshore of northern California during the summer and as far north as the Strait of Juan de Fuca during the winter. The plume's effect on various water quality parameters is exemplified by studies that have tracked its salinity, alkalinity, productivity, turbidity, and radioactivity far into the sea (MMS, 1996b). The effect of discharge from the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the water masses along the coast of Washington and Oregon is believed to be minimal because of the relatively high salinity caused by tidal mixing in the Strait and the poleward transport of water along the coast of Vancouver Island away from the Washington and Oregon coasts. Approximately 75 percent of the to tal discharge of rivers into the ocean from Washington and Oregon comes from the Columbia River (MMS, 1996b). Natural petroleum seepage contributes significant amounts of hydrocarbons, which may have a profound effect on microbial populations, productivity, and metabolic activities of sediments (MMS, 2001b). Most known seepage occurs off the California coast. The four main seepage zones on the mainland shelf are at Point Conception, at Coal Oil Point and Santa Barbara-Rincon in Santa Barbara Channel, and in Santa Monica Bay, whic h are all in California (MMS, 2001b). Oil and gas production facilities have been installed in the southern waters of the Pacific region. It has been estimated that each offshore platform discharges hundreds of thousands of gallons of produced water every day (MMS, 2001b). Produced water is water that is brought up along with oil and gas; it contains various toxic pollutants including benzene, arsenic, lead, naphthalene, zinc, toluene, and varying amounts of radioactive pollutants. The Pacific region covers a very broad area with several major ports located throughout its coastal area. Maritime vessels transport millions of tons of cargo each year. This vessel traffic in this region is responsible for a large portion of all oil spills reported in the United Stat es: during 2000, there were 623 oil spills into the Pacific region, spilling a to tal volume of 36,301 gal (USCG, 2000a). 3.5.1.2. Meteorology and Air Quality Climate The climate in the Pacific region is affect ed by the cold-water California Current and two pressure systems: the North Pa cific High and the Aleutian Low. The North Pacific High air mass in combination with the California Current moderates the Pacific region's coastal weather, resulting in relatively cool summers and warm mild winters. The Aleutian Low dominates the winter weather along the Washington and Oregon coasts. Winter winds are generally from the west and southwest. During the summer months, the Aleutian Low contracts northward and is replaced by the expanding North Pacific High from the south. Wind directions are primarily northwesterly except in Southern California where the winds are more westerly with average wind speeds from about 8 to 16 kt (MMS, 1996b). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-57 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region Air Quality Air quality of coastal counties17 is measured against National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), resulting from the Clean Air Act and its 1977 amendments (40 CFR 50.12), or it is measured against more restrictive adopted state standards. These standards are designed to protect human health. The USEPA requires states to report ambient air quality leve ls for six major pollutants: particulate matter (10 microns or larger [PM10]), su lfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone. NAAQS have been adopted by each of the Pacific region's states except California, which amended these standards to make them more restrictive than the federal standards. Appendix F, Table F.1-1 summarizes federal ambient air standards in detail. All coastal counties of the Pacific region are considered to be in compliance with the NAAQS attainment levels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. However, there were several counties that were not in compliance for the remaining three pollutants: seventeen counties were not in compliance for ozone, three counties were not in compliance for carbon monoxide, and nine counties were not in compliance for particulat e matter (PM10) (USEPA, 2000a). 3.5.2. Biological Environment 18 3.5.2.1. Marine Mammal The marine and coastal waters of the Pacific region support a large and diverse population of marine mammals that are highly migratory, moving seasonally between northern feeding-breeding grounds and southern wintering grounds. There are a variety of marine mammals \u2014sixteen cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), six pinnipeds (seals and sea lions), and one fissiped (sea otter) \u2014 known within this region, at least a portion of the year. The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis ) is the most numerous cetacean and is found in both coastal and offshore waters of the Pacific re gion (NMFS, 1999). The eastern Pacific Harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina richardsi ) is the most numerous pinniped and is found in coastal waters usually near an inlet, bay, or harbor. Appendix F, Table F.5-1 lists fourteen recognized nonendangered marine mammals of this region. 3.5.2.2. Marine and Coastal Birds The offshore waters, coastal beaches, bays, and contiguous wetlands of the Pacific region are populated by a large va riety of both resident and migratory species of marine and coastal birds. More than 2 million marine birds of twenty- nine species nest along the California, Oregon, and Washington coasts (Carter et al., 1995). Including breedi ng species, migrants, overwintering birds, and rare vagrants more than eighty species of marine birds have been found in Pacific 17 The Office of Ocean Resources, Conservation and Assessment (ORCA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce classifies counties as coastal \"because they meet one of the following criteria: (1) at least 15 percent of their total land area is located within the nation's coastal watersheds (as defi ned by ORCA's Coastal Assessment Framework [ http://spo.nos.noaa.gov/projects/caf/caf.html ], or (2) the county accounts for at least 15 percent of the land area of a coastal cataloging unit (a U.S. Geological Survey-defined drainage basin)\" (http://spo.nos.noaa.gov/projec ts/population/population.html). The U.S. Bureau of the Census also uses ORCA's coastal counties list. 18 Only nonendangered species will be included in Section 3.5.2, Biological Environment. Threatened, endangered, and candidate species will be discussed separately in Section 3.5. 3, Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species. For this reason, sea turtles will only be discussed in Sect ion 3.5.3, as they are a threatened/end angered species in the Pacific region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-58 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region coast nearshore and pelagic waters (USG S, 1998a). The shorebirds that frequent the coast and shorelines of the region are highly migratory and move seasonally between Alaska's breeding and feeding grounds to the south for overwintering grounds. The presence of five Western Hemi sphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) sites, two Ramsar sites, and thirty-one National Wildlife Refuges in the Pacific region indicates that large numbers of shorebirds (WHSRN sites) and wetland birds (Ramsar site) concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. The WHSRN main tains a network of monitoring sites comprising critical habitat for shorebird species. These sites are categorized as hemispheric, with an annual count of 500,000 shorebirds or 30 percent of a species flyway population; internationa l, with an annual count of 100,000 shorebirds or 10 percent of a species fl yway population; and regional, with an annual count of 20,000 shorebirds or 5 percent of a species flyway population. The five WHSRN sites in the Pacific region include two hemispheric, one international, and two regional sites (W HSRN, 2004). The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands designates Ramsar sites as wetlands of international importance. These wetlands are selected based on criteria such as supporting 20,000 or more waterbirds and regularly supporting 1 percen t of the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of waterbird (Wetlands International, 2004). The National Wildlife Refuge sites are established under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 with the aim of protecting wildlife and preserving biological di versity (USFWS, 2004). For the purpose of this PEIS, marine and coastal birds are categorized into five major groups, as detailed in Appendix F, Table F.5-2: seabirds, shorebirds, wading and marsh and raptors. 3.5.2.3. Plankton and Fish Plankton Plankton are organisms that float at or near the surface of marine waters and are unable to swim against tides, winds, or currents. Plankton species, which represent nearly all major aquatic phyla, can be roughly classified as phytoplankton (microscopic plant life), zooplankton (microscopic animals), and ichthyoplankton (fish eggs and larvae). Variability in the California Current influences distribution and abundance of plankton. In particular, periodic disruptions of the California Current, often associated with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation events, can affe ct available nutrients an d zooplankton. Upwelling caused by southward-blowing winds and earth rotation allows colder, nutrient-rich layers of the bottom to rise to the surface, thus causing periods of increased phytoplankton, and, in turn, zooplankton abundance all along the coast during June and July (County of Santa Barbara, 2002). Phytoplankton are microscopic floating algae which form the base of the food web. They are responsible for approximat ely one-half of global photosynthesis and play a vital role in stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide. These plants can only survive in the shallower, sunlit wa ters of the open-ocean and estuarine areas. The distribution of phytoplankton communities in the Pacific region appears to be influenced by local oceanographic conditions with the diatom Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-59 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region abundances being associated with coas tal upwelling. Phytoplankton in this region primarily consist of dinoflage llates and diatoms, which include either part (meroplankton) or all (holoplankton) of their life cycle as plankton. Unlike the phytoplankton, which are limited to the upper levels of ocea n surface zooplankton growth occurs at all depths. Their temporal and spatial distributions depend on a number of factors including currents, water temperature, and phytoplankton abundance (Loeb et al., 1983). Like phytoplankton the distributi on of zooplankton is extremely patchy. Zooplankton are a critical link in the tr ansfer of energy from primary producers (phytoplankton) to apex predators, so any process influencing the abundance and distribution of zooplankton can ultimately have an impact on fisheries. Major zooplankton groups off the coastal areas of the Pacific region include copepods, euphausiids, chaetognaths, mollusks , thaliaceans, present year-round within the region; however, the annual distribution and abundance of their eggs and larvae may be highly variable depending on the season and location (Smith et al., 1981). In a 1996 study by the California Cooperative Oceania Fisherie s Investigation (CalCOFI Atlas No. 33, Moser, 1996) of early stages of fishes of the California Current, more than 500 species of fish larvae and eggs were identified. Off the coast of California, the larval fish assemblage is dominated by Northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax ); to the north off of Washington and Oregon the coastal zone is dominated by a diverse assemblage of Sebates species, cottids, hexagrammids, and various pleuronectid and paralichthyid species (Doyle et al., 1993). Fish The Pacific Fishery Management Council manages a diversity of fish species (see Section 3.5.4). Many of the managed species are targeted for commercial fishing including Pacific Whiting The Pacific region has 455 mi 2 of shellfish growing waters, 30 percent of which are approved for harvesting. In 2000, fish landings in the region's w aters totaled over 467,000 metric tons (NMFS, 2003a). Some fish within the region can generally be classified as anadromous (Oncorhynchus spp.). Anadromous fish stocks have declined primarily due to loss of freshwater and estuarine habitats; there has also been increased mortality associated with dam construction and operations, water diversion, and sportfishing acti vities (MMS, 2001a). Appendix F, Table F.5-3 lists the commercially important fish species of the Pacific region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-60 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region 3.5.2.4. Intertidal Habitats Beaches and Rocky Shores The Pacific region has 7,863 mi of shor eline (Good et al., 1998). The region's coastal beaches are important for their ecological and economic integrity in terms of tourism and recreation. Two of the most prominent beach types found in the region are rocky shores and sandy beaches, the latter of which are the most common in the region. Rocky shore habitats are more abundant from central California to southern Oregon, and along the Channel Islands offshore of southern California. Fo r over 305 mi of California coastlines from central California and further south, beaches exhibit the classic beach structure: they are backed either by dunes or cliffs, followed to seaward by the berm, beach flat, trough, and bar (Oakden, 1996). For the s tate of California, th e average rate of coastal erosion is 0.5 to 1 ft/yr (S urfrider Foundation, 2001). The primary reasons for coastal beach degradation and depletion are all human related. The construction of sea walls, roads, beach property, and marinas all play a role, as do the effects from El Ni\u00f1o. Estuaries and Wetlands Estuaries are important habitats for both resident and transitory species. They provide spawning or nursery habitats and foraging area for numerous species, including invertebrates, fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. High organic productivity, high detritus production, and extensive nutrient recycling characterize estuaries. Some of the important estuaries in the Pacific region include Puget Sound and Willapa Bay, Washington, and San Francisco Bay and Santa Maria River mouth, California. Along the coasts of Washington and Oregon, estuaries are typically larger than those found further south. Many different habitat types are found in and ar ound estuaries, including shallow marine waters, freshwater and salt marshes, sand y beaches, mud and sand flats, rocky shores, river deltas, tidal pools, and seagrass and kelp beds. Appendix F, Figure F.5-2 shows estuary locations in the Pacifi c region. A large percentage of bays and estuaries have been altered by anthropogenic activities, such as population growth, pathogen contamination, sedimentation, and pollution runoff. Wetland habitats are associated with estu arine areas. These habitats may occupy only narrow bands along the shore, or they may cover larger expanses at the mouths of bays, rivers, or coastal stre ams. Wetland habitats occurring in the Pacific region include salt marshes, eelgr ass beds, freshwater and brackish water marshes, and mud flats. San Francisco Bay contains more than half of all w e t l a n d s i n t h i s r e g i o n , e v e n t h o u g h i t i s e s t i m a t e d t o h a v e l o s t a l m o s t 9 5 percent of its wetlands since the time of its settlement by humans (Nichols, 2002). All totaled, the Pacific region has 3,005 mi 2 of wetlands with a 46 percent wetland loss (Good et al., 1998). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-61 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region 3.5.2.5. Subtidal Habitats Submerged Grass Beds The subtidal (benthic) areas of the Pacifi c region consist of either soft or rocky substrates. These areas support a variety of marine life and habitats, including seagrass beds and kelp fore sts. Seagrass ecosystems ar e widely recognized as some of the most productive benthic habitats in the Pacific coast's estuarine and nearshore waters. Seagrass beds are critical nursery areas for many recreational and commercial fishery species. Seagrass meadows provide food for wintering waterfowl plus important spawning and foraging habitats for several coastal bird species. The physical struct ure provided by seagrasses affords juveniles refuge from predation and allows for attachment of epiphytes and benthic organisms. Seagrass communities also suppor t several endangered and threatened marine species. Appendix F, Figure F.5-3 provides the locations of submerged grass beds in the Pacific region. Seagrass communities in the Pacific region occur mainly in low-energy subtidal and intertidal habitats along the coast and comprise three species of surfgrass (Phyllospadix torreyi, P. scouleri, and P. serrulatus ) and of eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. japonica ) (Yozzo et al., 2001). Increasing human use of coastal areas has resulted in the loss of seagrass beds because of construction, recreation, harbor and channel maintenance, and water pollution. Kelp Forests Kelp is large brown algae ( Phaeophyta ) that attach to rocky substrates and grow to the surface in shallow nearshore waters with depths ranging from about 7 to 98 ft. Kelp forests are composed of large brown algae with an underlayer of various red and brown algae. They are anchored to the rocky sea floor by strong holdfasts and grow upwards. The upper portion of these plants floats on the sea surface and forms dense canopies. Kelp forests are one of the most productive communities in the sea. Kelp beds provide vertical water-column habitats for many species of invertebrates, fish, birds, marine mammals, and other plants. These beds are found in the photic zone and are sensitive to water temperatu re changes, nutrient availability, and wave energy. Since kelp forests are va riable and dependent on environmental and anthropogenic factors, ke lp is found in other habitats such as drift kelp (detached kelp floating far out to sea) and beach wrack (detached kelp deposited on the beach). Kelp beds are dynamic systems that may change in size and species composition over time spans of weeks to years. These fluctuations are a normal part of these ecosystems and are caused by a variety of natural causes, such as warm water periods, sea urchin populations, low nutrient periods, and storms (Santa Monica BayKeeper, 2003). The Pacific region is home to two types of giant kelp ( Macrocystis integrifolia and Nereocystis luetkeana ). Giant kelp dominates areas of relatively low water motion in years with relatively calm sea conditions. It is present from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico, often forming canopies on rocky substrata at 20- to 39-ft depths (V an Wagenen, 2001). Bull kelp is more Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-62 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region tolerant of high water motion and dominates more exposed areas (NOAA, 2000b). Both are the dominant canopy-forming kelps in this region. In California, mixed canopies of giant kelp and bull kelp run from Sandhill Bluff to Port San Luis, with giant kelp found o ffshore and bull kelp found inshore (Van Wagenen, 2001). 3.5.2.6. Areas of Special Concern Executive Order 13158 (\"Marine Protecte d Areas\") defines marine protected areas as \"any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cu ltural resources th erein\" (65 FR 34909). There are many different types of marine protected areas within and bordering U.S. waters; some examples include National Marine Sanctuaries, National Seashores, National Parks, National Monuments, National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, and many others (NOAA, 2002a). They have different shapes, sizes, and mana gement characteristics and have been established for different purposes. The Pacific region has five National Marine Sanctuaries, five National Park units, twenty-eight National Wildlife Refuges, four National Estuarine Research Reserves, and six National Estuary Programs located in coastal or near-coastal areas. For more details regarding history, purpose, and specific site locations pertaining to this region, see Appendix F, Tables F.5-4 through F.5-6 and Figures F.5-4 through F.5-6. 3.5.3. Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) classify seventeen threatened, thirteen endangered, and two candidate species within the Pacific region. These consist of nine marine mammals, eleven marine and coastal birds, eight fish, and four sea turtles. Six endangered cetaceans, two threatened pinnipeds, and one threatened fissiped reside in or migrate through this region. Appendix F, Table F.5-7, lists threatened, endangered, or candidate marine mammals of the Pacific region. Although whales were once hunted to near extinction in the Pacific, their numbers have steadily increased over the past few years. Whale sightings in the marine waters of the Pacific are becoming more frequent and should continue to incr ease in the future. Eleven species of threatened and endangered marine and coastal birds reside in selected habitats provided by the Pacific region. Appendix F, Table F.5-8, lists threatened, endangered, or candidate marine and coastal birds in the Pacific region. In the winter, the populations of the shorebirds are augmented by large numbers of wintering individuals from the northern ecosystems. Migratory species reside only temporarily along their route to wintering nesting areas. The Pacific region' s well-developed bay, estuary, wetland, and coastal beach habitats provide the necessary biological diversity for a variety of bird species. National Wildlife Refuges and National Park units across the region provide sanctuary to a variety of endangered migratory and indigenous bird species. Five species of anadromous (Oncorhynchus) Pacific salmon and steelhead trout spawn in and migrate through rivers and streams in this region. Salmonids (including Chinook salmon Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-63 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region [Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ]) on the U.S. West Coast have ex perienced dramatic declines during the past several decades as a result of huma n-induced and natural factors. Threats from water diversion and agricultural and development activities have affected stream habitats. In addition, commercial fishing on unlisted healthier stocks has caused adverse impacts to weaker stocks of salmon, and illegal high-seas driftnet fishing in past years also may have been partially responsible for population de clines (USCG, 2002). Recreational fishing throughout the salmon range also affects these populations. Nehlsen et al. (1991) identified 214 declining West Coast stocks (California, Oreg on coast, Columbia Basin, Washington coast/Puget Sound) of anadromous Pacific sa lmon and steelhead trout. The stocks noted were those headed toward extinction (high and moderate risk), as well as those of special concern because of habitat loss and disturbance (e.g., population growth, lumber operations, agricultural activities, an d hydropower development). The white abalone ( Haliotis sorenseni ) located off the California coast is the only shellfish (mollusk) currently listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA, Public Law 93-205, 16. U.S.C. 1531 et seq., as amended) while the black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii ) in the same location was designated a candidate species in June 1999. Appendix F, Table F.5-9 lists the eight threate ned, endangered, and/or candidate species supported in the Pacific region. Sea turtles nest on beaches in the tropics and subtropics throughout the Pacific region; they have also been sighted in the eastern No rth Pacific Ocean as far north as the Gulf of Alaska (NOAA, 1993). Appendix F, Table F.5- 10, lists the threatened, endangered, or candidate sea turtles of the Pacific region. The Pacific region hosts four species of sea turtles, two of which are listed as both threatened and endangered. ) sea turtles are most commonly reported off the West Coast. Factors such as water depth, bottom sediments, and prey availability account for sea turtle distribution in nearshore habitats. 3.5.4. Essential Fish Habitat The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (FCMA) established eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs), charged with developing Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) to achieve optimum fishery yields within their respective regions. In subsequent years, additional legislation was formulated to increase the effectiveness of this act. Two examples are the NMFS \"602 Guidelines\" (\"Guidelines for the Preparation of Fishery Management Plans under the FCMA,\" 50 CFR part 602), which provided an official definition of overfishing an d required each FMP to includ e measurable definitions of overfishing for each managed species, and the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-297; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ), which was passed and integrated into the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996 (M SFCMA, Public Law 94-265, as amended through October 11, 1996; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). This later act required FMCs and the Secretary of Commerce to identify and describe Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species specified under each respective FMP. The Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for implementing the MSFCMA through FMPs in the Pacific region. EFH is designated unde r four FMPs in the Pacific region\u2014groundfish, salmon, highly migratory species, and coas tal pelagic species. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-64 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region The commercially important fish species of this region are listed in Appe ndix F, Table F.5-3. NMFS is currently updating EFH designations for this region. EFH designations for each region are available on-line19. It is important to identify habitat areas essential to each life stage of a federally managed species to ensu re sustainable fisherie s and the ability of managed species to contribute to a healthy ecosystem. 3.5.5. Socioeconomic Environment 3.5.5.1. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment This socioeconomic impact area, based on NOAA's definition of coastal counties, comprises 60 coastal counties located in three states listed in Section 3.5.1. The coastal counties in the so cioeconomic impact area extend from Whatcom County, Washington, south to San Diego County, California. The coastal population of the Pacific re gion is 36,055,298 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a), which is calculated by combining pop ulation statistics fo r the region's 60 coastal counties, as identified by NOAA. Appendix F, Table F.5-11 lists these coastal counties and their populations. The Pacific region's coastal population makes up 12.8 percent of the total U.S. population, of which the majority is located in California (NOAA, 2002b; U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). Appendix F, Figure F.5-7, shows the coastal population distribution of the Pacific region. The Pacific region varies in socioeconomi c patterns ranging from low-density, undeveloped rural areas to high-density, highly developed urban centers. The range is from 3,824 people in Wahkia kum County, Washington, to 9,519,338 people in Los Angeles County, Californi a. Appendix F, Table F.5-12 lists the most densely populated coastal counties of the Pacific region. In 2000, the coastal counties within this region had a to tal civilian labor force of 17,333,433, with an average unemployment rate of 6.4 percen t, compared with the national average of 5.8 percent. Income levels rank higher than the national average of both per capita and median household incomes at $21,991 and $44,116, respectively. (The national average per ca pita and median household incomes are $21,587 and $42,834, respectiv ely.) The levels of income vary throughout the region. For example, De l Norte County, California, the poorest county in the region, has a per capita income of $14,573, while Marin County, California, the wealthiest county in the region, has a per capita income of $44,962 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000a). 3.5.5.2. Economic Status Four primary sectors make up the foundation of the Pacific's economic system: natural resources, tourism, petroleum, and international commerce. An associated fifth sector provides services to the former four in a variety of capacities including government, sales, communications, and infrastructure. The coastal areas of northern California, Oregon, and Washington historically have had a resource-oriented economy dependent on agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Although there has been a shift in recent years to diversify that 19 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/habit atprotection/efh/fish_manage_c.htm Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-65 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region economic base to include manufacturing, food processing, smelting, forestry, and commercial fishing are still the pr imary economic sectors within the northern Pacific region. Tourism is a critical segment of the coastal economy, and public recreation facilities, such as national parks an d museums, can be found all along the coastline. Although in 1996 the combin ed revenue for coastal tourism across the three states exceeded $41 billion (ACC, 1998), the tendency of these industries to be cyclical over time and highly seasonal in nature can pose a problem. For example, employment levels drop during the rainy season when tourism drops significantly. The southern portion of the Pacific region has a large amount of oil and gas activity. Proved reserves of oil and gas off California are es timated to be 3,627 million bbl and 2,681 billion ft 2, respectively, as of December 31, 2001 (EIA, 2002d). In 1992, the offshore oil and ga s industry employed approximately 25,600 people and contributed an esti mated $850 million to the California economy (California Resources Agency, 1997). The Pacific region's proximity to the Pacific Rim countries and Mexico provides major access to world markets. As su ch, international trade represents a significant economic input in the region. In 2000, California businesses exported $130 billion in products (Ca lifornia Technology, Trade and Commerce Agency, 2001), leading the nation in expor ts and expecting to grow in the future. In addition, the state of Washington ranked fourth in total value of exports among the fifty states in 1999 (Lin and Schmidt, 2000). There is evidence suggesting that more than 40 percent of all Washington exports are moved by water and that almost one out of every four jobs is related to the export industry (Dinsmore, 1997). 3.5.5.3. Vessel Transportation and Ports An extensive domestic and international shipping pattern exists within the coastal states of the Pacific region and between various ports in Asia, Mexico, Canada, and South America. There are seventeen major ports in the region, with over 500,000 voyages reported every year (USACE, 1999c). Appendix F, Table F.5-13, lists the major ports of the Pacific region. The combined Port of Seattle- Tacoma, Washington, is the eleventh larg est port in the world, and the Port of Los Angeles, California, is the tenth busiest, bringing in annually over $80 billion dollars worth of goods (USA CE, 1999c). Major commodities are automobiles, petroleum products, grain, and a variety of miscellaneous containerized items. In 2002, an estimated 275,740 bbl (approximately 8 percent) of the crude oil entering the Un ited States came through ports in the Pacific region (EIA, 2003). In 1999, the Pacific region received or shipped from its ports more than 318 thousand short tons of foreign and domestic cargo: domestic shipping and receiving accounted for 20,928 and 69,047 thousand short tons, respectively, while foreign shipping and receiving accounted for 86,247 and 107,891 thousand short tons, respectively. In addition, th ere were 34,588 thousand short tons of intrastate waterborne commerce (USACE, 1999c). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs Oil 3-66 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region 3.5.5.4. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries With the recent decline in revenues from the coastal timber industry, the importance of commercial fi shing and ancillary activities to the local economies of the Pacific region has increased substantially. Fisheries are located throughout the coast, with important catches consisting of sardines, squid, anchovies, salmon, albacore, tuna, sablefish, Pacific whiting, rockfishes, Pacific cod and halibut, rex and petrale sole, crabs, oysters, scallops, clams, and kelp seaweed. During 2000, fisheries off the Pacific coast produced nearly 640 million lb, valued at $217 million (NMFS, 2003b), which provided nearly 13 percent of all commercial fish landings in the continental United States. Appendix F, Table F.5-14, lists the top commercial landings for the Pacific region. Recreational Fisheries Recreational fishing is an important activity throughout the Pacific region. Many tourists are attracted to the region for oceanic salmon fishing and numerous other species. There are six different kinds of sportfishing in the region: shore, pier, commercial passenger vessel (party boat), skiff, diving, and clamming. Based on a 2001 NMFS Marine Recreation al Fishery Statistical Survey, 2.5 million marine recreational fishing partic ipants took 9.6 million trips and caught a total of 35 million fish (NMFS, 2002). Sixty-five percent of the trips were made in California, 23 percent in Washington and 12 percent in Oregon (NMFS, 2002 ). In 2001, the economic expenditures in this region due to this fishery were approximately $2.5 billion (ASA, 2002). 3.5.5.5. Subsistence In the Pacific region, Native American subsistence gathering, although not previously well documented, may involve several thousand individuals and can account for a major portion of the total subsistence for some Native American families (MMS, 2001b). Subsistence gathering along the Oregon and Washington coasts involves both foodstuff and traditional medicines, such as herbs and teas. The taking of salmon and shellfish make up the largest portion of the subsistence economy in the area. Shellfish have recently replaced salmon as the leading subsistence crop for Native American tribes in the state of Washington. The annual subsistence and commercial harvest for the region is approximately 757,000 lb of clams, 2.8 milli on lb of oysters, 4 million lb of crab, and 500,000 lb of shrimp (MMS, 2001b). The Makah, a Washington State Native American tribe, also harvested marine mammals such as the gray whale. Historic ally, the types of re sources taken have been very extensive and have included salmon, skate, mussels, cod, sculpins, porpoise, seal, halibut, deer, elk, duck, geese, herring, puffins, crabs, cormorants, roots, berries, and eels . Currently, the types of resources taken are far fewer than was common in historic times; however, subsistence gathering is an extremely important part of life for the contemporary Native American tribes in Oregon and Washington. Ocean resources are also used in an extensive barter system, exchanging salmon and other ocean resources for inland resources (such as deer and elk). The resources also are sold for cash as a means of supplementing their income (MMS, 2001b). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-67 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region In California, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other agencies have primarily documented gathering for subsistence and ceremonial purposes. The distribution of the subsistence and hunting activities in California varies. In northern California, activities tend to be very similar to those in Oregon and Washington, while in southern California, the intertidal zone is the object of intensive food-gathering activities by members of various ethnic groups. The traditional subsistence gathering of Native Americans in southern California has been reduced in recent years because of a decrease in the supply of traditional plant and animal foods (MMS, 2001b). 3.5.5.6. Archaeological/Historic Resources The Minerals Management Service (MMS, 1996b) conducted two archaeological baseline studies that cover the entire coas tal Pacific region: the California, Oregon, and Washington Archaeological Resource Study that ran from Morro Bay, California, north to the Canadian border , and the Archaeological Resource Study that ran from Morro Bay to the Mexican border. This report revealed that the onshore coastal areas of the Pacific re gion contain numerous prehistoric and historic archaeological sites. Many of these sites are the cultural remains of early coastal Native American populations. The baseline study for northern California, Oregon, and Washington compiled info rmation on 2,762 known prehistoric archaeological sites within a narrow stri p of land along the coast. The baseline study for southern California documented 1,681 known prehistoric archaeological sites along the coastal area south of Morro Bay to the Mexican border. These prehistoric archaeological si tes represent only the sites that have been recorded to date; it is likely that there are thou sands of additional undocumented sites. Although no submerged prehistoric archae ological sites have been recorded offshore of northern California, Oreg on, or Washington, there have been numerous finds of ground-tone artifacts of fshore of southern California. Most of the artifacts are indicative of the Millin g Stone Cultural Horizon (MMS, 1996b). Onshore historic sites are numerous and are listed in such inventories as the National Register of Historic Places and the State Register of Historic Places. Offshore historic sites (submerged reso urces) can include several categories of resources, such as sunken ships and ai rcraft. An MMS archaeological baseline study for northern California, Oregon, and Washington identified a total of 3,850 shipwrecks for the area from Mo rro Bay north to th e Canadian border (MMS, 1996b). The baseline study for sout hern California iden tified a total of 916 shipwrecks for the area from Morr o Bay south to the Mexican border (MMS, 1996b). These shipwrecks represent only those shipwrecks that have been documented through literature searches (MMS, 1996b). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-68 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region 3.5.5.7. Recreation and Tourism The Pacific region's coastline is extremely diverse and varies from rugged, wind\u00ad blown cliffs to flat, sandy be aches backed by wide, meande ring river valleys to fully developed urban areas. Recreational activiti es along the coast include sightseeing, camping, clam digging, hiking, beachc ombing, picnicking, boating, swimming, wading, sunbathing, diving, surfing, and sportfishing. Sightseeing and beachcombing are enjoyed along the entire coast and are mainly dependent on the aesthetic aspect of the area. Each of these recreational activities depends on an accessible and unpolluted marine environment. Most of these activities occur at established shoreline parks, recreation sites, beaches, or publ ic access sites. The most intense use of available recreational resources generally is found near the major coastal population centers. The Am erican Coastal Coalition (ACC, 1998) reported that coastal tourist expenditures for th e Pacific region totaled $41,092,240 and supported 575,000 jobs. 3.5.5.8. Public Safety and Worker Health Oil spill response is one of the U.S. Co ast Guard's (USCG's) many missions. In responding to oil spills, the USCG is aware of public safety and the effects that alternative response technologies \u2014chemical dispersion and in situ burning \u2014 could have on human health. Under the guidelines established by the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), steps have been taken to protect both the public and oil spill responders. Whether compensated workers or volunteers, responders are required to be certified under either the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emerge ncy Response Standard or USEPA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard. These standards ensure that responders unde rstand the hazards of oil spill response and how to protect themselves. To assist in public safety, the USCG has the maritime safety authority to establish a safety zone around oil spill cleanup operations. This zone is established to safeguard the public and responders from the hazards associated with cleanup. In addition, USCG standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to protect responders, as well as the public, from the hazards associated with chemical dispersion and in situ burning. These procedures are outlined in SOPs in each Area Contingency Plan's (ACP's) Site Safety Plan. In addition, training exercises such as PREP (Preparedness for Response Exercise Pr ogram) and SONS (Spill of National Significance) train USCG response personnel to avoid safety hazards. Dispersants are a liquid chemical used to disperse oil spills from the ocean surface (see Section 2.2.2). During an oil spill, dispersant application can be from either an aerial or a shipboard platform. In both cases response personnel have the potential to be accidentally ex posed to the dispersa nt, and in extreme cases exposure to the public could occur. The two types of dispersants with use allowed in the United States have OS HA-established, permissible exposure limits of 50 ppm on skin. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for these dispersants makes clear the human health concerns from excess exposure. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-69 2009 3.5. Affected Environment: Pacific Region In situ burning of an oil spill entails setting contained or boomed oil on fire (see Section 2.2.3). This action has been acknowledged as having potential human health and safety effects. Besides the physical hazards to responders, there is the potential for inhalation of airborne burn products. In situ burning emits a plume of black smoke laden with particulates (PM10, soot), the main public health concern. Response personnel working close to the burn may be exposed to levels of gases and particulates that would require them to use personal protective equipment. Occupational standards such as OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) are applicable . For the general public, NOAA (2000a) reported that particulate concentrations in a smoke plume remain the only agent of concern past 1 or 2 mi downwind, with the gases created in a burn dissipating to levels close to background. Public exposure to smoke particulate from the burn is not expected to occu r unless the smoke plume travels down to ground level. Since the general public may include sensitive individuals, such as the very young and very old, pregnant women, and people with pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, this population's tolerance to particulates may be significantly lower than that of the resp onders. There is little data concerning the effect on humans of particulates from the in situ burning of oil. Based on chemical analysis of soot particulates and their physical behavior, the hazard is expected to be similar to that of better-known particulates emissions that are now regulated by the NAAQS. In 1997, the Special Monitoring of Applied Response Technologies (SMART) 20 protocol was created, in part, to address the particulates concerns and to better aid the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) in making decisions related to initiating, continuing, or terminating in situ burning. 20 http://response.restoration.noaa. gov/oilaids/SMART/SMART.html Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-70 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region 3.6. A LASKA REGION 3.6.1. Physical Environment The coastal shoreline of Alaska measures about one-third of the total shoreline of the United States and its possessions. Because of the Alaska region's immense size, a range of information primarily from the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Beaufort Sea will provide a discussion about this region for the purpose of this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). Beginning south of the state, the body of water bordering the state's southern coastline and Canada's west coast is the GOA. Traveling counterclockwise, these far-reaching waters adjoin the Bering and Chuk chi Seas; finally, the Be aufort Sea is located along the north coast of Alaska (Figure 3.1-1). Each of these marine environments differs through various surface currents and phy sical inputs from Alaskan rivers. Three surface currents affect the GOA: Alaska Current, Alaska Stream, and Alaska Coastal Current. Appendix F, Figure F.6-1, shows the major currents of the Alaska region. The eastward-flowing Alaska Current in the northern GOA flows into the southward- moving Alaska Stream. This stream then flows along the Alaskan Peninsula. Closer to shore flows the Alaska Coastal Current. All th ree currents characterize the circulation of the GOA. Speed and salinity vary betwee n each of these systems and depend on prevailing winds and seasonal fluctuations. Current speeds average 0.4 to 3.6 kt. Mean monthly sea-surface temperatures range from about 38\u00b0F in March to about 57\u00b0F in August. Surface salinities range from a maximum of approximately 31 parts per thousand (ppt) in late winter to a minimum of 25 ppt in August ( EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council, 2002). The surface circulation of the Beaufort Sea is dominated by a clockwise gyre in the Arctic basin. The prevailing current moves water and ice shoreward throughout most of the year, with velocities ranging from 2 to 4 in/s. For 9 months of the year (typically from November through July), marine waters are covered with ice. In late summer and fall, easterly and offshore winds produce surface currents countering the prev ailing Arctic gyre, which results in a variable period of relati vely ice-free waters (ADNR, 1999). Salinity and temperature in the Beaufort Sea also depend on the change of seasons. Seawater temperatures are cold throughout the year, ranging from 28\u00b0 to 30\u00b0F in winter under the ice, to just above freezing in the summer. The salinity in the Beaufort Sea varies both geographically and seasonally from 28 to 32 ppt (ADNR, 1999). 3.6.1.1. Water Quality Coastal Alaska is a remote, sparsely populated landmass with little or no industrial activity, which causes one to assume that the water quality should be near pristine. However, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, trace metals, and hydrocarbons are introduced into the marine environment through river runoff, glaciation, coastal erosion, natural oil seeps, atmospheric deposition, mining activities, oil and gas activities, and past oil spills. An thropogenic impacts from concentrated population areas include seafood processing, discharge, and municipal waste. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA, 1998a) compiled an assessment of 1 percent of Alaska's estu arine waters in its 305(b) report. Of these, most were classified as impaired for overall use. It should be noted that Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-71 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region this assessment reflects waters with known impairments. Efforts are underway to assess other waters across the state. Marine The general water quality of offshore mari ne waters is pristine. There is, however, some impact from major river inputs (sed iments) that flow beyond coastal waters and into offshore waters. Waste discharg e from petroleum-producing platforms, commercial fishing vessels, oil tankers, and cruise ships also contaminate marine waters. For example, it was estimated that during a typical 7-day cruise, 1,109,523 gal of graywater was discharged into Alaskan coastal waters from 3,000 passengers and crewmembers (AMSEC LLC, 2000). Accidental oil spills normally result from collisions and groundings of ve ssels. In 1999, there were 800 oil spills in and around the coast of Alaska (USCG, 2000a). 3.6.1.2. Meteorology and Air Quality Climate The climate of Alaska is varied because of the large differences in latitude and geography. Three semipermanent atmospheric pressure patterns largely affect the climate over Alaska: Siberian High, Aleutian Low, and East Pacific High (EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council, 2002). The Siberian High influences the continental, arctic, polar air mass and is generally characterized by average low annual temperatures and low precipitation. Maritime polar air masses are influenced by two pressure patterns \u2014Aleutian Low and East Pacific High. The Aleutian Low creates moderate temperatures and moderate moisture; this low-pressure system dominates control ov e r m u c h o f A l a s k a ' s w e a t h e r i n t h e winter. The second pressure pattern influe ncing polar air mass is the East Pacific High, which controls much of Al aska's weather in the summer. Arctic coastal wind speeds of 30 to 50 kt are common during winter months. The average wind speed is 10.6 kt at Barrow (ADNR, 1999). Winds along the coastal areas of the GOA are strongly influenced by local topography. They mostly blow parallel to nearby mountain ranges, with a prevalent wind direction from the east averaging betw een 12 and 18 kt (MMS, 2001a). Air Quality Air quality is measured against National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), resulting from the Clean Ai r Act and its 1977 am endments (40 CFR 50.12), or it is measured against more restrictive adopted state standards. These standards are designed to protect human health. The USEPA requires states to report ambient air quality levels for six major pollutants: particulate matter (10 microns or larger [PM10]), sulfur dio xide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone. NAAQS have been adopted by the state of Alaska. Appendix F, Table F.1-1 summarizes federal am bient air standards in detail. All coastal counties of the Alaska region are considered to be in compliance with the NAAQS attainment levels for sulf ur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone. There were only a few counties that were not in compliance with the remaining two pollutants: one county was not in compliance for carbon monoxide, and two counties were not in compliance for particulate matter (PM10) (USEPA, 2000a). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-72 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region Alaska has the lowest air emissions of all states in the nation because there are few industrial emission sources and, other than Anchorage or Fairbanks, no sizable population centers. Primary emissions are associated with oil and gas production, power generation, small refi neries, paper mills, and mining. During winter and spring, pollutants are transported across the Arctic Ocean from industrial Europe and Asia to ar ctic Alaska (Rahn, 1982), causing a phenomenon known as arctic haze. The haze has been thoroughly analyzed, and it consists of sulfate (up to 90 percent), soot, and sometimes dust (AMAP, 1997). Concentrations of this aerosol ha ze are similar to those over large portions of the continental United States. Despite this seasonal, long-distance transport of pollutants into the Arctic, regional air quality is still far better than specified by the NAAQS and by state standards (BLM, 1998). 3.6.2. Biological Environment 21 3.6.2.1. Marine Mammals The Alaska region is home to a diverse group of marine mammals living in both arctic and subarctic environments throughout the coastline. All coasts north of the Bering Strait are bordered by sea ice every winter, with pack ice often just offshore every summer; marine mammals that occur here are rare or nonexistent south of the Bering Sea (USCG, 2002). A variety of marine mammal species \u2014 sixteen cetaceans (whales and porpoises), eight pinnipeds (seals and walruses), and two fissipeds (sea otters) \u2014are known to inhabit Alaskan waters. Polar bear, seal and walrus also inhabit Alaska's waters fo r at least part of the year (USCG, 2002). Many of these species face unique pressure from human activities such as oil exploration, subsistence hunting, and intense seasonal fisheries and are, therefore, protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 as amended (Neff et al., 2001). Appendix F, Table F.6-1 lists fifteen recognized nonendangered marine mammals in this region. 3.6.2.2. Marine and Coastal Birds The Alaska region is an important breeding area for migratory waterfowl and shorebird species. About 100 million seabir ds reside in the marine waters of Alaska during some time of the year. Conceivably half of this population is composed of fifty species of nonbreeding residents, visitors, and breeding species that use marine habitats on ly seasonally (Hatch and Piatt, 1995). Another thirty species include 40 to 60 million birds that breed in Alaska and spend most of their lives in U.S. te rritorial waters (Hatch and Piatt, 1995). Alaskan populations account for more than 95 percent of the breeding seabirds in the continental United States; eigh t species nest nowhere else in North America (Hatch and Piatt, 1995). These bi rds populate the offshore waters, coastal shores, and wetlands of the Alaska Region. Many species are strongly pelagic and are, therefore, rarely seen from shore. The remaining species are found within coastal and inshore habitats. The presence of five Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) sites, one Ramsar site, and eight National Wildlife Refuges in the 21 Only nonendangered species will be included in Section 3.6.2, Biological Environment. Threatened, endangered, and candidate species will be discussed separately in Secti on 3.6.3, Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-73 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region Alaska region indicates that large numbers of shorebirds (WHSRN sites) and wetland birds (Ramsar site) concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. The WHSRN maintains a network of monitoring sites comprising critical habitat for shorebird species. These sites are categorized as hemispheric, with an annual count of 500,000 shorebirds or 30 percent of a species flyway population ; international, wi th an annual count of 100,000 shorebirds or 10 percent of a species flyway population; and regional, with an annual count of 20,000 shorebirds or 5 pe rcent of a species flyway population. The five WHSRN sites along the Alaska coastline consist of one hemispheric, one international, and three regional sites (WHSRN, 2004). The Ramsar Convention designates Ramsar sites as wetlands of international importance. These wetlands are selected based on crit eria such as supporting 20,000 or more waterbirds and regularly supporting 1 percent of the individuals in a population of one species or subspeci es of waterbird (Wetland s International, 2004). The National Wildlife Refuge sites are established under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 with the aim of protecting wildlife and preserving biological diversity (USFWS, 2004). For the purpose of this PEIS, marine and coastal birds are categorized into five major groups, as detailed in Appendix F, Table F.6-2: seabirds, shorebirds, wading and marsh and raptors. 3.6.2.3. Plankton and Fish Plankton Plankton are organisms that float at or ne ar the surface of marine waters and are unable to swim against tides, winds, or currents. Plankton species, which represent nearly all major aquatic phyla, can be roughly classified as phytoplankton (microscopic plant life), zooplankton (microscopic animals), and ichthyoplankton (fish eggs and larvae). In the GOA, dramatic differences are observed between pelagic communities in the deep ocean and those communities in shelf, coastal, and inside waters (sounds, fjords, and estuaries). Specifically, the euphotic zone seaward of th e shelf edge is dominated year-round by very small phytoplankters, which are tiny diatoms. In contrast, shelf, coastal, and inside waters host a more traditional plankton community, in which large and small diatoms and dinoflagellate s support a copepod-domina ted grazing assemblage (EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council, 2002; Sheppard, 2000). Phytoplankton are microscopic floating algae, which form the base of the food web. They are responsible for approximat ely one-half of global photosynthesis and play a vital role in stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide. These plants can only survive in the shallower, sunlit wate rs of open-ocean and estuarine areas. Off the Alaskan coast, phytoplankton blooms occur over areas of upwelling; these areas are widespread, particularly at the edges of the various water domains on the shelf and shelf break (e.g., heads of submarine canyons, edges of gullies on the continental shelf, within passages between the Aleutian Islands, around submerged seamounts) (USGS, 1998a). In the Beaufort Sea, plankton numbers are very low, and phytoplankton bloom less frequently than in southern waters (ADNR, 1999). Quantities do increase a modest amount during and after ice breakup and are most abundant in late July and early August, when Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-74 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region sunlight is strongest. Phytoplankton species include diatoms, dinoflagellates, and flagellates. 1999). Zooplankton, which consume phytoplankton, spend either part (meroplankton) or all (holoplankton) of their life cycles as plankton. Their temporal and spatial distributions depend on a number of factors including currents, water temperature, and phytoplankton ab undance (Loeb et al., 1983). The zooplankton community on the GOA shel f is dominated by a combination of oceanic and neritic herbivorous and omnivorous copepod stocks. The of micro-nektonic species contribute substantially to the ov erall density of fora ge for fish on the GOA shelf. The euphausiid species primarily spinifera zooplankton either continuously or until they become mature fishes. The Alaskan Fisher ies Science Center has identified 291 of 636 (45.8 percent) of larvae species in regional waters. The major families identified are Scorpaenidae, Cottidae, He mitripteridae, Liparidae, Stichaeidae, and Pleuronectidae (Busby et al., 2000). Fish The Alaska region contains some of the mo st productive waters on earth. Almost all commercially important fish species are found here, including King salmon The major commercial fisheries species in western GOA are King crab ( ( In 2000, commercial fisheries in Alaska grossed a total of 2,025,758 metric tons of fish landings (NMFS, 2003a). The North Pacific Fishery Management Council manages the Alaska Fisheries (see Section 3.6.4). Appendix F, Ta ble F.6-3 lists the most commercially important fish species of the Alaska region. Because of problems associated with excess exploitation, many fish species are heavily managed by both state and federal agencies. In particular, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) regulates salmon stocks through a strict permitting and quo ta system. Through these an d similar efforts, fish stocks in the Alaska region are slowly increasing to more sustainable levels. 3.6.2.4. Intertidal Habitats Beaches and Coastal Barrier Islands Alaska has the longest shoreline in the United States \u201433,904 mi, including the Aleutian Islands (Good et al., 1998). Locate d in the Beaufort Se a area are barrier islands, which are so numerous that they nearly equal the amount of barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico region. These barrier islands are constantly migrating, eroding, and building in response to natural processes such as severe Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-75 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region storms. Marine mammals and migratory seabirds use these islands as important haul-out and nesting habitats. Along the GOA shoreline, the dominant habitats in the Alaska region are sheltered and exposed rocky shores, wa ve-cut platforms, and beaches with varying mixtures of sand, gravel, cobble, and boulders (EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council, 2002). Fine- and coar se-grained sand be aches represent a small portion of the GOA shoreline. Gravel and sand beaches dominate the coast on the Beaufort Sea. Strong storm waves and ice action cause the erosion rate in the Beaufort Sea to reach 9.8 ft/yr in some locations (USACE, 1998). Estuaries and Wetlands Estuaries are important habitats for both resident and transitory species, providing spawning or nursery habitats and foraging areas for numerous species, including invertebrates, fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. High organic productivity, high detritus production, and extensive nutrient recycling characterize estuaries. In the Alaska region, there are numerous and extensive estuaries along the coast from the Cook Inlet-Shelikof Strait on the south- central coast to the Colville River delta in the Beaufort Sea. Many different habitat types are found in and around estuaries, including shallow marine waters, freshwater and salt marshes, mud flats, rocky shores, river deltas, tidal pools, and seagrass and kelp beds. Wetland habitats are associated with estu arine areas. These habitats may occupy only narrow bands along the shore, or they may cover larger expanses at the mouths of bays, rivers, or coastal streams. Wetland habitats are important habitats for marine mammals, salmon species, and other anadromous fish populations. The Alaska region has approximately 26,230 mi 2 of wetlands comprising 43 percent of the surface area of the state; as a comparison, the remainder of the United States contains 42,713 mi2 of wetlands (ADEC, 2002; Good et al., 1998). Over the last 50 years, it has been estimated that Alaska lost less than 1 percent of its wetlands from human activities and natural erosion (Good et al., 1998). Well-developed salt marsh communities are unusual along Alaska's arctic coast, and those that exist tend to be only a few meters in extent because of low tidal range and sea-ice action along the generally unstable and erosion-prone shoreline (Macdonald, 1977; Viereck et al., 1992). The most extensive salt marsh habitats occur in the deltas of major rivers and a few protected bays. For example, the Copper River delta covers approximately 70,750 acres along the south-central coast of Alaska, just ea st of Prince William Sound; the delta contains the largest contiguous area of coastal wetland on the Pacific coast of North America (MMS, 2001a). Mud flats ar e predominantly found in southern Alaska, in particular near Kachemak Bay. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-76 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region 3.6.2.5. Subtidal Habitats Submerged Grass Beds The subtidal (benthic) areas of the Alaska region consist of either soft or rocky substrates. These areas support a variety of marine life and habitats, including seagrass beds and kelp forests. Seag rass beds provide food for wintering waterfowl and provide important spawning and foraging habitats for several species of commercially important finfish and shellfish. The physical structure provided by seagrasses affords juveniles refuge from predation and allows for attachment of epiphytes and benthic organisms. Appendix F, Figure F.6-2 provides the locations of submerged grass beds in the Alaska region. Two species of seagrass thrive in the Alaskan is distributed in the northern Pacific Ocean and is the only seagrass north of the Arctic Circle. Unlike kelp, eelgrass is a flowering, marine vascular plant found in intertidal and subtidal zones in extensive meadows. Surfgrass is also located in the northern Pacific Ocean; however, the GOA is its most northern habitat. Surfgrass occurs on rocky, surf-beaten coasts (NOAA, 2001). The Beaufort Sea coastline is subject to severe erosion and experiences tides of small fluctuation. Subsequently, coasta l salt marshes are smaller and less common than on the southern coast (Vie reck et al., 1992). These salt marshes are characterized by dense growth of salt-tolerant sedges (primarily Carex ramenkii and C. subpathacea ). Kelp Forests Kelp forests perform important ecological functions, namely as nurseries and feeding grounds for juveniles of several marine species. Kelp provides food materials and protection from predators. The GOA supports three genera of kelp\u2014Agarum , Laminaria , and Nereocystis \u2014that form dense beds along a large portion of the coast. The largest kelp community in the Alaska region occurs in Stefansson Sound and is appropriately entitled the boulder patch, an area of cobbles and boulders with attached kelp and invertebrate organisms located between barrier islands and the Sagavanirktok Delta along the coast of the Beaufort Sea (Dunton, 1984; Dunton and Schonberg, 1981; Dunton et al., 1982). The boulder patch only occurs in this area of Alaska and has been found nowhere else in the Beaufort Sea or in the Arctic. It contains unique communities of macrophytic algae (large seaweeds or kelp), benthic microalgae, bacteria, and diverse benthic invertebrates, including soft coral, sea anemones, hydroids, jellyfish, and many other organisms. In general, macrophytes are most likely to oc cur in areas not subjected to ice gouging or landfast ice and where hard substrates occur. The locations of other kelp beds in the eastern Beaufort Sea are portrayed near Stockton Island, Flaxman Island, and Demarcation Bay (Dunton et al., 1982). 3.6.2.6. Areas of Special Concern Executive Order 13158 (\"Marine Protecte d Areas\") defines marine protected areas as \"any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-77 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region for part or all of the natural and cu ltural resources th erein\" (65 FR 34909). There are many different types of marine protected areas within and bordering U.S. waters; some examples include National Marine Sanctuaries, National Seashores, National Parks, National Monuments, National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, and many others (NOAA, 2002a). They have different shapes, sizes, and mana gement characteristics and have been established for different purposes. Two-thirds of the entire National Park system (nearly 55 million acres) lie in Alaska (NPCA, 2002). The Alaska region has ten National Park units, ten National Wildlife Refuges, and one National Estuarine Research Reserve (Kachemak Bay, the largest reserve in the federal system [NOAA, 2003c]) located in coastal or near-coastal areas. In addition, Alaska is the only region in this PEIS with designated National Forests (two) in coastal or near-coastal areas. For more details regarding history, purpose, and specific site locations pertaining to this region, see Appendix F, Tables F.6-4 through F.6 7 and Figures F.6-3 through F.6-6. 3.6.3. Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS ) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have classified nine threatened, ten endangered, and three candidate species within the Alaska region. These consist of eleven marine mammals, six marine and coastal birds, and three fish species. Seven cetaceans are endangered and reside in and migrate through this region; in addition, there is one candidate cetacean (Table 3.6-2) . Appendix F, Table F.6- 8, lists threatened, endangered, or candidate marine mammals of the Alaska region. One pinniped and one fissiped are threatened, while the Northern sea otter ( Enhydra lutris kenyoni ) was designated a candidate species on November 9, 2000. The remainder of marine mammals, although not listed as endangered or thre atened, receives special protection under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 as amended. Although Alaskan waters are not as heavily used as coastal waters in the lower forty-eight states, many species face unique pressures from human activities such as oil exploration, subsistence hunting, an d intense seasonal fisheries. Four threatened, one endangered, and one candidate species of marine and coastal birds reside in selected habitats provided by the Alaska region. Appendix F, Table F.6-9, lists threatened, endangered, or ca ndidate marine and coastal birds of the Alaska region. The Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and GOA contain some of the most productive waters on earth (USCG, 2002). Three species of fish ar e listed as either enda ngered or threatened species, depending on the population's location. Appendix F, Table F.6-10, lists threatened, endangered, or candidate fish of the Alaska region. Salmonids (including Chinook salmon [ Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ]) on the U.S. West Coast have experienced dramatic declines during the past several decades as a result of human- induced and natural factors. Threats have resulted from water diversion and agricultural and development activities that affect stream habitats. In addition, commercial fishing on unlisted, healthier stocks has caused adverse impacts to weaker stocks of salmon, and illegal, high-seas driftnet fishing in past year s also may have been pa rtially responsible for Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-78 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region population declines (USC G, 2002). Recreational fishing throughout the salmon range also affects these populations. Sources of disturbance to the steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss ) along the coast include commercial, recreational, and tribal fishing of streams and oceans, plus ocean conditions. Sources of disturbance to the species inla nd include stream water diversions and obstructions, and land-use activities such as logging and road construction, urban development, agriculture, grazing, mining, and fishing (USCG, 2002). 3.6.4. Essential Fish Habitat The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (FCMA) established eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs), charged with developing Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) to achieve optimum fishery yields within their respective regions. In subsequent years, additional legislation was formulated to increase the effectiveness of this act. Two examples are the NMFS \"602 Guidelines\" (\"Guidelines for the Preparation of Fishery Management Plans under the FCMA,\" 50 CFR part 602), which provided an official definition of overfishing an d required each FMP to includ e measurable definitions of overfishing for each managed species, and the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-297; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ), which was passed and integrated into the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996 (M SFCMA, Public Law 94-265, as amended through October 11, 1996; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). This later act required FMCs and the Secretary of Commerce to identify and describe Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species specified under each respective FMP. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) is responsible for implementing the MSFCMA through FMPs in th e Alaska region. EFH is designated under five FMPs in the Alaska region\u2014 Bering Sea -Aleutian Islands groundfish, GOA groundfish, salmon, crab, and scallop. The commercially important fish species of this region are listed in Table F.6-3. NMFS is in the process of finalizing the EFH designations for this region through their EFH Environmental Impact Statement (NPFMC, 2005 ). EFH designations for each region are available on-line 22. 3.6.5. Socioeconomic Environment 3.6.5.1. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment This socioeconomic impact area comprises twenty-four coastal counties within the state of Alaska. The coastal counties extend from the North Slope Borough in the very north, down the coast (including the Aleutian Islands) to the Prince of Wales, outer Ketchikan Census Area in the southeastern corner of the state. The coastal population of the Alaska region is 529,474 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000b), which is calculated by combining population st atistics for the region's twenty-three coastal boroughs/census ar eas/municipalities, as by NOAA as coastal counties23. Appendix F, Table F.6-11 lists these coastal 22 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/habit atprotection/efh/fish_manage_c.htm 23 The Office of Ocean Resources, Cons ervation and Assessment (ORCA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce classifies counties as coastal \"because they meet one of the following criteria: (1) at least 15 percent of their total land area is located with in the nation's coastal watershe ds (as defined by ORCA's Coastal Assessment Framework [ http://spo.nos.noaa.gov/projects/caf/caf.html ], or (2) the county accounts for Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-79 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region counties and their populations. The Alaska region's coastal population makes up less than 1 percent of the total U.S. population, of which over 49 percent is located in the Anchorage Municipality (NOAA, 2002b; U.S. Census Bureau, 2000b). Appendix F, Figure F.6-7, shows th e coastal population distribution of the Alaska region. The Alaska region varies substantiall y in socioeconomic patterns. The vast majority of the coastline is made up of low-density, undeveloped rural areas. There are several developed areas along the southern coast, with Anchorage being the most highly populated and highly developed urban center. The range is from 808 people in Yakutat City and Borough to 260,283 people in Anchorage Municipality. Appendix F, Table F.6-12 lists the most densely populated coastal boroughs/census areas/municipalities of the Alaska region. In 2000, the coastal counties had a total civilian labor force of 262,330, with an average unemployment rate of 8.7 percent, compared with the national average of 5.8 percent. Income levels rank on par with the national average of per capita income and higher than the national average of median household income at $20,635 and $47,948, respectively. (The n ational averag e per capita and median household incomes are $21,587 and $41, 994, respectively.) Income levels fluctuate throughout the Alaska region. For example, Wade Hampton Census Area is the poorest with a per capita income of $8,717, wh ile Skagway-Hoonah- Angoon Census Area is the wealthiest with a per capita income of $27,769 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000c). 3.6.5.2. Economic Status Three primary sectors make up the found ation of the Alaska region's economic system: oil and gas, tourism, and commer cial fisheries. An associated fourth sector provides services to the former th ree in a variety of capacities including government, sales, communications, and infrastructure. The oil industry, which is the largest ec onomic sector in the state, provides approximately 85 percent of the state budget (Alaska Department of Community and Business De velopment, 2001). Alaska remains a leading U.S. supply source of crude oil, ranking seco nd in crude oil reserves and third in crude oil production worldwide. Per da y, 970,000 million bbl ar e produced, with proved reserves of 4.9 billion bbl, accoun ting for 23 percent of the U.S. total. There are 1,852 oil-producing wells and 8 operational rota ry rigs, located primarily on state lands in the North Sl ope. After the oil is produced, it is shipped to the port of Valdez via the Alyeska Pipeline (EIA, 2002e). Tourism is the second largest industry in Alaska, and it is responsible for employing one-eighth of the workforce, which is primarily driven by small businesses. In 1999, 1.4 million tourists visited, spending $1.36 billion (approximately $970 per visito r). Approximately 32 percen t of Alaska's visitors come by cruise ship and 53 percent by air (ATIA, 2002). at least 15 percent of the land area of a coastal cataloging unit (a U.S. Geological Survey-defined drainage basin)\" (http://spo.nos.noaa.gov/project s/population/population.html ).

Affected Environment: Alaska Region Commercial fishing activities in 2000 employed 65,710 individuals, or 25 percent of the Alaska region's civil labor force. The same year the commercial fisheries of the region caught $942 million worth of seafood products and generated $58,961,200 in tax revenues for the state. This region is the world's largest producer of wild salmon, in additi on to catching a variety of shellfish, groundfish, and herring (ADFG, 2002). 3.6.5.3. Vessel Transportation and Ports An extensive domestic and international shipping pattern exists in the marine waters of the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Domestic trade occurs between Alaska and western states, and internationally with Canada and countries in east and south Asia. Marine traffic in norther n areas is largely limited to a 60-day summer open-water season. Transport of marine freight to arctic communities/work camps is accomplished by lighters that ferry cargo directly from a freighter anchored offshore or by shallow-draft barges. The largest natural deepwater port is in the Ketchikan Gateway Borough, which is located near the southernmost point of this re gion. In 1999, 10,614 trips were recorded for vessels entering and departing these major Alaskan ports 24: Ketchikan, Juneau, Valdez, Bay (USACE, 1999c). Within this region, a large volume of both crude oil and petroleum products are transported between land-based terminal s and storage facilities at ports by tanker and barge. Large amounts of oil extracted in the North Slope Borough are shipped via the Alyeska Pipeline and then stored at the Alyeska Terminal in Valdez, at the head of Prince William Sound. From there, approximately 500 annual crude-carrier departures occur by tankers that vary in size from 250,000- to 2.6-million-bbl carriers. The oil expo rted from the port at Valdez accounts for approximately 17 percent of total U.S. domestic oil production (Alyeska Pipeline Company, 2003; EIA, 2001b; NRC, 1998). In 1999, the Alaska region received or shipped from its ports more than 71 thousand short tons of foreign and domestic cargo: domestic shipping and receiving accounted for 51,839 and 2,614 thousand short tons, respectively, while foreign shipping and receiving accounted for 11,174 and 1,375 thousand short tons, respectively. In addition, there were 4,167 thousand shor t tons of intrastate wate rborne commerce (USACE, 1999c). 3.6.5.4. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries The Alaskan commercial fishing sector is an important component of the Alaska region's economy. During 1999, fisheries in the Alaska region produced 5.6 billion lb, valued at $1.3 billion, which provided approximately 55 percent of all commercial fish landings in the continen tal United States (A DFG, 2000, 2001a). A variety of species are caught and landed in Alaska's commercial fisheries. They include scallops, cucumbers, urchins, geoducks, clams, shrimp, crabs rockfish, sablef ish, halibut, herrin g, salmon (seven 24 Arctic Alaska has no major ports; the most extensive marine facilities are the industrial docks associated with the Prudhoe Bay industrial complex.

Appendix F, Table F.6-13, lists the to p commercial landings for the Alaska region. Recreational Fishing One of the major recreational activities in the Alaska region is offshore marine recreational fishing. In 2001, more than 420,000 anglers fished off coastal waters (ASA, 2002). A large portion of the an glers are tourists, allured by a wide range of fishing expeditions throughout the state, varying from low to high adventure. Preferred target species are salmon, Pacific variety of shellfish. In 2001, the total catch for marine recreational fisheries was 3,078,100 fish, with an estimated $537 million spent by U.S. residents on fishing trips and equipment in Alaska (ADFG, 2001b, c). 3.6.5.5. Subsistence The term subsistence refers to the hunting, fishing, and gathering activities that constitute the traditional way of life fo r Alaska's native people. Subsistence continues to flourish in many areas of the Alaska region. Before the mid-eighteenth century arrival of the first nonnatives, subsistence was the only form of economic production by which the indigenous populations fed, clothed, and housed themselves. Conducted in seasonal cycles by small, seminomadic communities and kinship groups within recognized territories, indigenous people utilized traditional, small-scale technologies for hunting, harvesting, and preserving foods. These foods were then distributed through networks of communal sharing and bartering. Wide disparities existed among the subsistence practices of native societies depending on the different climatic and biological areas of Alaska \u2014 from the marine mammal cultures of the high Arctic, through the land mammal and fishing groups of the interior river systems, to the resource-abundant coastal communities of the southeastern rain forests (ADFG, 1999). Subsistence remains economically and culturally important for many Alaskan families and communities. The Alaska Subsistence Fisher ies 1999 annual report defines subsistence fishing as the taking of fish, shellfish, or other fisheries resources by Alaska residents for subsistence uses. Subsistence uses of wild resources are defined as \"noncommercial, customary, and traditional uses\" for a variety of purposes: direct personal or family consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation; making and selling handicraft articles out of nonedible by- products of fish and wildlife reso urces taken for personal or family consumption; and customary trade, barter, or sharing for personal or family consumption (ADFG, 1999). In 1985, comm ercial fisheries harvested about 908,500,000 lb of salmon, halibut, herring, and shellfish. (There was an additional commercial groundfish ha rvest of about 2.99 billion lb.) For comparison, according to statistics provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, subsistence harvesting composes only 4 percent (by weight) of all Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-82 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region fish and game harvested in the state, with sport uses and commercial uses comprising 1 percent and 95 percent, re spectively (Wolfe and Bosworth, 1990). 3.6.5.6. Archaeological/Historic Resources Archaeological and historic resources are the remains of the material culture of past generations. They are also basic to, and have implications for, the nonmaterial culture such as beliefs, knowledge, art, customs, property systems, and other social aspects of culture. Prehistoric and historic peoples occupied the northern and southern onshore and offshore coastal areas of most of the Alaska region. Some archaeological sites reveal prehistoric subsistence resources such as the remains of sea and land mammals, fishes, shells, sea urchins, and birds. These sites contain information on the wide variety of species used by ancient people. The Alaska region's archaeological resources date to about 6,000 -6,500 B.C. The surrounding continental shelf and ons hore area have been inhabited by prehistoric and historic people for thousands of years and contain valuable known and undiscovered arch aeological resources. Over 1,000 prehistoric sites have been documented throughout the GOA. Most of these sites lie next to the shore and consist of subsistence resource-gathering sites, and many of them are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The predominant types of prehistoric resources found on the shores are housepits containing household and subsistence artifacts (e.g., stone lamps, sinkers, arrowheads) of early people. Historic sites consist of early Russian houses, churches, roadway inns, fish and mining camps, downed World War II aircraft, and other World War II artifacts. The approximately 997 shipwr ecks that occurred offshor e in the Alaska region are archaeological resources that, if found, would add considerable information about marine culture (MMS, 1996b). 3.6.5.7. Recreation and Tourism Major recreational and tourist activities in clude fishing, boating , hunting, hiking, sightseeing, and camping. So me of these activities are water-oriented and often water-dependent. The wilderness qualit y and beautiful vistas on most of the coastline are attractive components for all these activities. Some of the highest quality tourist and recreational opportunities take place in the National Park units, National Wildlife Refuges, and Nationa l Forests along the Alaskan coast. Tour ships from the lower forty-eight s tates regularly traverse southeast Alaska, and many independent travelers use the Alas ka Maritime Highway (ferry) system to access the region. Helicopter and small ai rcraft sightseeing tours have developed locally, along with a generally robust tour ism sector that includes a fleet of small regional tour ships, river jet-boat tour s, and fishing char ters (MMS, 2001a). In northern Alaska, most nonresident recreational activity takes the form of tour groups, primarily visiting Barrow or Deadhorse. Hikers and river rafters also visit the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and other areas (MMS, 2001a). Because of the limited population and transportation infrastructure, and its remoteness, the number of residents and tourists who might enjoy these environs is few. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-83 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region The American Coastal Coalition (ACC , 1998) reported that coastal tourist expenditures for the Alaska region totaled $1.364 billion and supported approximately 26,000 jobs. 3.6.5.8. Public Safety and Worker Health Oil spill response is one of the U.S. Co ast Guard's (USCG's) many missions. In responding to oil spills, the USCG is aware of public safety and the effects that alternative response technologies \u2014chemical dispersion and in situ burning \u2014 could have on human health. Under the guidelines established by the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), steps have been taken to protect both the public and oil spill responders. Whether compensated workers or volunteers, responders are required to be certified under either the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emerge ncy Response Standard or USEPA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard. These standards ensure that responders unde rstand the hazards of oil spill response and how to protect themselves. To assist in public safety, the USCG has the maritime safety authority to establish a safety zone around oil spill cleanup operations. This zone is established to safeguard the public and responders from the hazards associated with cleanup. In addition, USCG standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to protect responders, as well as the public, from the hazards associated with chemical dispersion and in situ burning. These procedures are outlined in SOPs in each Area Contingency Plan's (ACP's) Site Safety Plan. In addition, training exercises such as PREP (Preparedness for Response Exercise Pr ogram) and SONS (Spill of National Significance) train USCG response personnel to avoid safety hazards. Dispersants are a liquid chemical used to disperse oil spills from the ocean surface (see Section 2.2.2). During an oil spill, dispersant application can be from either an aerial or a shipboard platform. In both cases response personnel have the potential to be accidentally ex posed to the dispersa nt, and in extreme cases exposure to the public could occur. The two types of dispersants with use allowed in the United States have OS HA-established, permissible exposure limits of 50 ppm on skin. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for these dispersants makes clear the human health concerns from excess exposure. In situ burning of an oil spill entails setting contained or boomed oil on fire (see Section 2.2.3). This action has been acknowledged as having potential human health and safety effects. Besides the physical hazards to responders, there is the potential for inhalation of airborne burn products. In situ burning emits a plume of black smoke laden with particulates (PM10, soot), the main public health concern. Response personnel working close to the burn may be exposed to levels of gases and particulates that would require them to use personal protective equipment. Occupational standards such as OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) are applicable . For the general public, NOAA (2000a) reported that particulate concentrations in a smoke plume remain the only agent of concern past 1 or 2 mi downwind, with the gases created in a burn dissipating to levels close to background. Public exposure to smoke particulate from the burn is not expected to occu r unless the smoke plume travels down to ground level. Since the general public may include sensitive individuals, such as the very young and very old, pregnant women, and people with pulmonary or Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-84 2009 3.6. Affected Environment: Alaska Region cardiovascular diseases, this population's tolerance to particulates may be significantly lower than that of the resp onders. There is little data concerning the effect on humans of particulates from the in situ burning of oil. Based on chemical analysis of soot particulates and their physical behavior, the hazard is expected to be similar to that of better-known particulates emissions that are now regulated by the NAAQS. In 1997, the Special Monitoring of Applied Response Technologies (SMART) protocol 25 was created, in part, to address the particulates concerns and to better aid the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) in making decisions related to initiating, continuing, or terminating in situ burning. 25 http://response.restoration.no aa.gov/oilaids/SMART/SMART.html Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-85 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region 3.7. O CEANIA REGION 3.7.1. Physical Environment Oceania is a collective name used for the islands scattered throughout most of the Pacific Ocean. In its broadest sense, the term embraces the entire insular region between Asia and the Americas. For the purpose of this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS), all references to the Oceani a region will specifically cover the tropical waters surrounding the islands of Hawaii, Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Samoa (Figure 3.1-1). Midway, Jarvis, and Wake Islands are also included in some of the analysis. The westward-flowing North Equatorial Current influences the waters surrounding Hawaii and all U.S.-affiliated islands of the Oc eania region except American Samoa, which is south of the equator and is affected by the broad, western-flowing South Equatorial Current. Appendix F, Figure F.7-1, shows the major currents of the Oceania region. Both currents flow at a rate between 1 and 2 kt (Sheppard, 2000). Hawaii, Guam, and CNMI are in warm, temperate , subtropical and tropical waters north of the equator. American Samoa is solely in warm, southern, tropical waters. Both types vary in surface seawater temperatures of 41 \u00b0 to 95\u00b0F with surface salinity averaging between 28 and 37 parts per thousand (ppt) (NOAA, 1994). Thes e areas are generally affected by a diurnal tide cycle, which encompasses one low and one high tide per tidal period. 3.7.1.1. Water Quality Coastal Quality of coastal water in the Oceania region is not widely known because of the lack of comprehensive coastal monitoring. Though data are limited, the 305(b) reports of the U.S. Environmen tal Protection Agency (USEPA, 1998a) show that coastal waters are impacted by anthropogenic sources, such as sedimentation from shore development, stormwater and agricultural runoff, nutrients, industrial effluent, and sewage outfalls. Data from the 305(b) reports also suggest that 10 percent of Hawaii's coastal shoreline area is impaired by some form of pollution or habitat degradation, and, of the 14 mi assessed (of 117 mi of shoreline) in Guam, all 14 mi were identified as impaired for swimming. CNMI's most recent USEPA 305(b) report on w ater quality stated that the 52 mi of coastal water surroundi ng Saipan is rated poor for swimming. Marine The 305(b) reports (USEPA, 1998a) for Guam, CNMI, and American Samoa lacked significant amounts of marine water-quality information. Complicating matters further is the nature of the locati on of the region. Because of the Pacific Ocean's large, deep expanses, plus the distance between each location, it is difficult to obtain aggregate numbers without speculative estimation. However, marine monitoring programs are expe cted to increase in the future. Domestic sources of pollution are most likely the largest contributor to marine pollutant loads. Contaminants of con cern associated with domestic sources include nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, solids, and microbial pollution. Agricultural activities that contribute po llutants to marine and coastal waters are Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-86 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region the application of agricultural chemicals, erosion of exposed soils with naturally occurring nutrients, and runoff cont aining concentrated animal wastes. The vast majority of exports and imports in the Oceania region are via waterborne shipping. For instance, the state of Hawaii imports about 80 percent of what it consumes; approximately 97 percent of that enters the state through the commercial harbor syst em (State of Hawaii, 2001) . This large dependency on maritime traffic increases the potent ial for environmenta l impacts in the form of oil spills. In 1999, there were 229 oil spills totaling 5,582 gal in waters in and surrounding Hawaii (USCG, 2000a). 3.7.1.2. Meteorology and Air Quality Climate With the exception of American Samoa, which is in the southern hemisphere, the whole of the Oceania region lies in the northern Pacific Ocean above the equator. The North Pacific High pre ssure system and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ, an equatorial trough of low pressure) influence the climate of the northern part of the Oceania region. The shifting of the North Pacific High pressure system and ITCZ during the year is accompanied by seasonal changes in the direction and intensity of the winds. Northeast and southeast trade winds prevail in this area, with winter trade winds being weak and summer trade winds being persistent in the 15- to 20-kt range. American Samoa falls in a tropical marine climatic region that is affected by the South Pacific Convergence Zone, with relatively consistent southeasterly trade winds for 9 months out of the year and northwesterly trade winds for the remaining 3 months. Tropical storms such as typhoons are known to frequent the area (NOAA, 2003d). Air Quality Air quality of the islands in the Oceania region is measured against National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), resulting from the Clean Air Act and its 1977 amendments (40 CFR 50.12), or it is measured against more restrictive adopted state standards. These standards are designed to protect human health. The USEPA requires states to report ambient air quality levels for six major pollutants: particulate matter (10 micron s or larger [PM10]), sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, le ad, and ozone. Appendix F, Table F.1-1 summarizes federal ambient air standards in detail. Hawaii and all U.S-affiliated islands wi thin the region are considered in compliance with NAAQS attainment le vels (USEPA, 2000a). Compliance is mainly due to the region's geographical location in the Pacific Ocean: constantly blowing westerly winds, coastal location of large cities, and a limited amount of heavy industry. For example, Hawaii has been rated as having the best air quality in the nation and is not impacted by pollution from neighboring states (USEPA, 2000a). The localized air pollution that can occur is primarily due to concentrated urban centers by way of auto emissions and small industry. In addition, there are also some natural pollutants from active volcanoes and geothermal energy production in the form of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids and glass fragments. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-87 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region 3.7.2. Biological Environment26 3.7.2.1. Marine Mammals A variety of marine mammals \u2014twenty-two cetaceans (whales and dolphins), one sirenian (dugong), and one pinniped (seal) \u2014are known to occur in the Oceania region. Humpback whales ( Megaptera novaeangliae) are one of the most abundant marine mammals in the region, and the Hawaiian Islands are an important breeding ground for the spec ies (USCG, 2002). In both coastal and offshore environments, several different species of whales can be found in the region. At least four species of )\u2014are known to occur in all water depths throughout the region (USGS, 1998d). Appendix F, Table F. 7-1 lists the sixteen recognized nonendangered marine mammals in this region. 26 Only nonendangered species will be included in Section 3.7.2, Biological Environment. Threatened, endangered, and candidate species will be discussed separately in Section 3.7. 3, Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species. For this reason, sea turtles will only be discussed in Sect ion 3.7.3, as they are a threatened/end angered species in the Oceania region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-88 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region 3.7.2.2. Marine and Coastal Birds The Oceania region provides habitats for both migrant and resident marine and coastal birds; however, migration is rare in the area. Over 100 species of marine and coastal birds have been identified as part- or full-time residents of this region (USGS, 1998d). Of these, the majority are nearly year-round residents. Many species are endemic to specific island locations within the region. The offshore waters, coastal beaches, tropical forests, and existing wetlands are populated by both resident and migratory species of marine and coastal birds. Many species are strongly endemic, and, th erefore, only seen on specific islands. The remaining species are found within coastal and offshore habitats. Despite having the world's highest proportion of ende mic species per unit of land area or number of human inhabitants, the biological diversity of the Pacific islands is among the most critically threatened in the world (USGS, 1998d). The presence of ten National Wildlife Re fuges in the Oceania region indicates that large numbers of waterbirds conc entrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. The National Wildlife Refuge sites are established under the National Wildlife Refuge Sy stem Improvement Act of 1997 with the aim of protecting wildlife and preserving biological diversity (USFWS, 2004). For the purpose of this PEIS, marine and coastal birds are categorized into five major groups, as detailed in Appendix F, Table F.7-2: seabirds, shorebirds, wading and waterfowl. 3.7.2.3. Plankton and Fish Plankton Plankton are organisms that float at or ne ar the surface of marine waters and are unable to swim against tides, winds, or currents. Plankton species, which represent nearly all major aquatic phyla, can be roughly classified as phytoplankton (microscopic plant life), zooplankton (microscopic animals), and ichthyoplankton (fish eggs and larvae). Distinct populations of planktonic and micronektonic marine organism s appear to be maintained around islands. These include populations of mesopelagic fishes, larval fishes, and zooplankton. The tropical Pacific Ocean, like other tropic al ocean regions, contains warm, clear water. The water is clear because of the near absence of plankton and suspended particles, with the excepti on of highly productive coastal and reef areas. Because there is little plankton in the tropics, tropical ocean water is nearly sterile in comparison with the fertile wate rs of temperate oceans. This contrasts the popular misconception that tropical ocean regions are very high in biological productivity. The reason for these low levels of biological productivity is due to the relatively oligotrophic, or nutrient-poor, marine waters of the Oceania region. As such, the majority of plankton found in the Oceania region are located near reef structures or in areas where ground water runoff and surface water run-off from the islands that are rich in nutrients can elevate nearshore primary production (plankton) (Sheppard, 2000). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-89 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region Phytoplankton are microscopic floating algae, which form the base of the food web. They are responsible for approxim ately one-half of global photosynthesis and play a vital role in stabilizing atmo spheric carbon dioxid e. These plants can only survive in the shallower, sunlit waters of open-ocean and estuarine areas. There are over ninety species of diatoms and forty species of dinoflagellates in the Oceania region. Commonly identified phytoplankton, spend either part (meroplankton) or all (holoplankton) of their life cycle as plankton. Their temporal and spatial distributions depend on a number of factors including currents, water temperature, and phytoplankton abundance (County of Santa Barbara, 2002). Detailed vertical distribution data for zooplankton around the islands of the Oceania region are lacking, so that the degree to which vertical distribution can affect the ability of zooplankton to be re tained around islands cannot be assessed. Coastal species, which have been identified around Hawaii, include the coastal calanoid Undinula vulgaris around the islands of the Oceania region are typically a combination of open-ocean and shorefish species. Few surveys have examined the distribution of ichthyoplankton near oceanic islands. A 1996 report on ichthyoplankton off the coast of Oahu, Hawaii, identified a total of 155,390 fish larvae in 375 taxa; and Fish The Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (WPFMC) (see Section 3.7.4) manages fisheries in the Oceania region, which includes Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and CMNI. In 2000, fi shing landings for this region were over 2.9 million pounds (NMFS, 2001b). Some of the im portant fish are snappers, tuna, and dolphinfish. Appendix F, Table F.7-3 lists the most commercially important fish species of the Oceania region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-90 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region Because of the generally oligotrophic tropical waters of the Oceania region, the majority of fish species are found near reef structures, sea mounts, or estuarine areas, or in relatively nearshore areas. Reef fish are found in and around coral and rock reefs and can range from shallo w tidal pools to areas over 200 ft in depth. In offshore areas, there are some commercially feasible deepwater dwelling species such as tuna and sharks. The majority of the fish stocks located in this region have a wide distributi on; however, as is the case for many Hawaiian fish species, some are only found near their particular habitats and conduct little migrati on (NMFS, 2001b). Fish stocks have been declining signific antly for the last 20 years. Recent shifts from traditional, small-scale fishing pr actices to more intensive commercial fishing have had a large impact on local fi sh stocks. Further, destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting and chlorine application destroy breeding habitats and reduce reproductive rates. Human population pressure has also taken a toll: nursery areas are destroyed during road construction and coastal building projects; coral is smothered and blocked from sunlight by the sediment from harbor dredging and faulty land management. The destruction of estuarine, wetland, and mangrove areas also negati vely impacts fish st ock. Finally, coral blocks are either taken as souvenirs or used as building materials (NMFS, 2001b). 3.7.2.4. Intertidal Habitats Beaches The Oceania region has 1,494 mi of shore line (Good et al., 1998). Coastal beaches are important not only for the ecological sy stems of the islands, but also for their economic integrity in terms of tourism and recreation. Hawaii's beaches consist of either white or black (volcanic) sand. Approximately one-third of Guam's 36 mi of shoreline consists of coastal beache s, and CNMI's island of Saipan has widespread sandy beaches on its western side for recreation (USEPA, 1998a). There are few beaches on the American Sa moa's main island of Tutuila because the majority of its coastline is made up of rocky cliffs. Beach erosion is a serious problem in Hawaii, with a typical erosion rate ranging from 0.5 to 1 ft/yr (Surfrider Foundati on, 2002). Nearly one-qua rter of the area of the Hawaiian Islands has been signif icantly degraded over the last 50 years, and all shorelines have been affected to some extent. In Oahu, Hawaii's most populated island, over 24 percent (17 mi) of coastal beaches has been lost or significantly narrowed over the last ce ntury (Surfrider Foundation, 2002). The primary reasons for coastal beach degradation and depletion are all human related: construction of sea walls, roads, beach property, and marinas, as well as the destruction of natural barriers such as coral reefs. Estuaries, Wetlands, and Mangroves Estuaries are important habitat for both resident and transitory species, providing spawning or nursery habitat and foraging area for numerous species, including invertebrates, fishes, reptile s, birds, and mammals. High organic productivity, high detritus production, and extensive nutrient recycling characterize estuaries. Examples of estuaries in the region are Kane'ohe Bay, Hawaii, and Leone Bay, American Samoa. Some estuaries have been affected by Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-91 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region anthropogenic activities such as population growth, pathogen contamination, sedimentation, and pollution runoff. Many different habitat types are found in and around estuaries, including shallow marine waters, freshwater and salt marshes, sandy beaches, mud and sand flats, rocky shores, mangrove forests, tidal pools, and seagrass beds. Wetland habitats are associated with estu arine areas. These habitats may occupy only narrow bands along the shore, or they may cover larger expanses at the mouths of bays, rivers, or coastal streams. Some 180 mi2 of wetlands in the Oceania region consist of coastal freshwater, saltwater, and brackish water marshes, and reed swamps (Good et al ., 1998). These wetlands provide habitats that sustain commercial fisheries and many endangered species. Guam has considerably more wetlands and a wider variety of types than any of the other islands in the Mariana chain (Wiles an d Ritter, 1993). Cumulative wetland loss over the last few decades has been substantial in some areas, such as CNMI with a 64 percent loss, while Hawaii has lost only 12 percent and Guam, 23 percent (Good et al., 1998). This loss is mostly due to agriculture, urban expansion, and aquaculture. Past expansion of the U.S. military port facility in Apra Harbor, Guam, has also caused extensive loss to wetland habitats. All islands in the Oceania region have mangroves, with the boundary for naturally occurring mangroves being American Samoa; mangroves are not found naturally much to its east. Mang roves were introduced on the Hawaiian Islands of Oahu and Molokai in the ea rly 1900s. The most common species of mangroves in the region include red ( Rhizophora mangle ), ball ( Xylocarpus moluccensis). The largest mangrove section in the region is at Pa la Lagoon (Nu'uuli Pala) (148.6 acres) on Tutuila, American Samoa (Volk, 2001). Mangrove ecosystems are a useful buffer between the land and the sea. Their primary function is to provide a \"sink\" for sediments, nutrients, and other contaminants to maintain coastal water quality, thus promoting coral and seagrass growth offshore. Further, they protect the land from marine inundation during storms and from rising sea levels, and protect habitats and nurseries for fishes, crustaceans, and shellfish. However, through human activities such as clearing and filling, most mangrove forests have been reduced in size over the past century. 3.7.2.5. Subtidal Habitats Insular Shelves The subtidal (benthic) areas of the Oceani c region consist of either soft or hard- bottom substrates. These areas support a variety of marine life and habitats, including insular shelves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and seamounts. One of the main characteristics of the Oceania regi on's coastal environment is the general absence of the broad, shallow shelves that are found in most U.S. coastal regions. Comparatively narrow coral shelves sitting on steep island slopes characterize these coasts. It is common to find depths of over 9,000 ft within 1.2 mi of shore. These deeper-water ha bitats have unique biota. The steep shelves provide a habitat for coastal species whose range extends into deeper waters, and provide shelter to permanent biological communities such as the Pen Shell Beds. Further, humpback whales ( Megaptera novaeangliae) use island slopes during critical moments in their life cycles. With the exception of Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-92 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region fisherman who exploit some of the larger species of these areas, the biological resources of insular shelves are most likely not under threat from habitat damage or ecological degradation (USGS, 1998d). Submerged Grass Beds Seagrass beds are less widespread in the Oceania region than in other regions. Unlike temperate seagrasses, most tropical species are small with rapid growth rates. They are usually found in less then 33 ft of water, but in some circumstances can exist in depths of up to 164 ft ( USGS, 1998d). Much of the seagrass growth in the western Pacific O cean is made possible by the sheltering effect of barrier reefs. The algae associated with seagrasses contribute to the productivity. There are two known seagrass specie s in Hawaii, both a are most diverse in the western Oceania region, with seven species in Guam and three species in CNMI. In Guam, seagrass ( Halodule uninervis ) stands cover about 9 percent of the fringing and barrier reefs. In CNMI, seagrasses are found primarily on the leeward side of Saipan within an extensive lagoon acoroides, Halodule uninervis, and virtually no seagrasses. Seagrass ecosystems are vital for fish and invertebrates (including shellfish), mammals, sea turtles, and waterfowl. However, currently they are declining in most U.S. coastal regions \u2014destroyed by dredging, propeller scouring, and disease; poisoned by pesticides and herbicide runoff; and denied sunlight by increased turbidity of water. The turbidity of water, because of blooms of microalgae, is often compounded by in creased loads of suspended materials such as sand, silt, and clay from activi ties like boating or coastal construction. Further, runoff from fertilizer and sewage can stimulate large algal formations that have the potential to stunt seagrass growth through competition for nutrients and sunlight. Coral Reefs Coral reefs are one of the most import ant and extensive ecosystems in the Oceania region. About 94 percent of the coral reefs under U.S. jurisdiction are located within the region and cover a 9,272 mi 2 area (NOAA, 2002c). Coral reefs are very diverse ecosystems that provide many benefits to humankind. They build atolls, protect isla nd shores from coastal erosion and wave damage, support fisheries of cultural and economic value, and provide a natural medicine cabinet for traditional healing and biomedical research (WPRFMC, 2001). The National Oceanic Data Center (NODC) 27 has identified sixty-five different reefs within the Oceania region, of which over half are within the Hawaiian Island chain. The majority of these sixty-five reefs are located near the coastlines of their respective islands, bu t there are five outlying banks paralleling Guam and CNMI to the west, as well as two banks located a few miles 27 http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/col/projects/coral/Coralhome.html Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-93 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region northwest of Saipan, CNMI. Several forms of coral reef development can be found in the Oceania region: barrier reefs around Guam and Saipan, CNMI; fringing reefs around Hawaii and American Samoa; and patch and submerged reefs, banks, and shoals throughout the region, particularly abundant in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the CNMI (WPRFMC, 2001). The Hawaii Island reefs are not noted for high levels of coral, fish, or other reef species. However, their fauna consists of endemic species, a manifestation of near-continuous geographic isolation over a long time period (Bryant et al., 1998). By virtue of its isolated position in the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii has relatively few species of coral (about fifty species in seventeen genera) and, more importantly, lacks most of the branching or tabletop Acropora species, which form the majority of reefs elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Appendix F, Figures F.7-2 and F.7-3, shows the coral reefs in the Hawaiian Islands located in the Oceania region. Guam has fringing reef flats, submerged formations, a barrier reef, and offshore banks (Birkeland et al., 2000; Gulko et al., 2000) (Figure 3.7-4). Appendix F, Figure F.7-4, shows the coral reefs in the Oceania region of the fringing reef flats vary from 33 ft wide on the windward si de to well over 328 ft. This reef system contains approximat ely 270 species of hard cora l and 220 species of benthic marine algae (Birkeland et al., 2000; Gulk o et al., 2000). In the southern (Rota, Aguijan, Tinian, Saipan, and Farallon de Medi nilla) have well- developed coral reefs on the western coasts with about 253 species (56 genera) of reef-building (hermatypic) coral. The northern islands (nine islands from Anatahan to Farallon de Pajaros) have less developed coral reefs but still have approximately 159 species (56 genera) of coral (Grigg and Birkeland, 1997). Although they are not cataloged to the same extent as coral reefs in Hawaii, Guam, and CNMI, most of American Sa moa's coral beds consist of narrow fringing reefs (85 percent) growing up against the steep slopes of the main islands, a few offshore banks (12 percent), and two atolls (3 percent) (NOAA, 2002c). These coral reefs are currently re covering from a series of natural disturbances over the past two decades. Appendix F, Figure F.7-5, shows the locations of coral reefs in the Oceania region of American Samoa. A healthy, functioning coral reef is a neces sary habitat requirement for reef fishes. Habitat destruction through dredging, blasting, and chlorine fishing can destroy these important sanctuaries and may elim inate important fish species from these areas. Tourism and increased temperatures significantly impact the coral reefs of the Oceania region. Increased social an d economic demands place new levels of stress on Pacific corals; for example, wi th low-impact tourism, tourists crowd coastal coral reefs to view the tropical arra y of fish species that exist within the region. The World Bank (2 000, p. 8) observed that: Coastal areas in the Pacific are increasi ngly threatened. Overfishing, pollution, mining, and poor coastal planning are leading to the depletion of fisheries and to coastal degradation, undermining livelihood of coastal communities. The decline of mangroves and coral reefs is increasing the islands' exposure to cyclones and storm surges. The degradation of coastal areas is imposing significant economic and social costs, leaving coastal communit ies in need of urgent assistance. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-94 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region Seamounts Seamounts are undersea peaks in the ocean floor; they are widely scattered throughout the Pacific Ocean. Within th e Oceania region, they are concentrated near the Hawaiian Islands and CNMI. The seamounts appear to support a high diversity of life both on their surfac es and in surrounding waters. Although these seamounts and their inhabitants are located in very deep and remote waters, they have been threatened by overfishing. 3.7.2.6. Areas of Special Concern Executive Order 13158 (\"Marine Protecte d Areas\") defines marine protected areas as \"any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cu ltural resources th erein\" (65 FR 34909). There are many different types of marine protected areas within and bordering U.S. waters; some examples include National Marine Sanctuaries, National Seashores, National Parks, National Monuments, National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, and many others (NOAA, 2002a). They have different shapes, sizes, and mana gement characteristics and have been established for different purposes. There are two National Marine Sanctuarie s, ten National Park units, eighteen National Wildlife Refuges, one Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, and three Special Management Areas located in coastal or near-coastal areas. For more details regarding history, purpose, and specific site locations pertaining to this region, see Appendix F, Tables F.7-4 through F. 7-6 and Figures F.7-6 through F.7-11. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-95 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region 3.7.3. Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS ) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have classified five threatened an d thirty-four endangered species within the Oceania region. These consist of eight marine mammals, twenty-six marine and coastal birds, and five sea turtles. Six cetaceans, one sirenian, and one pinniped are endangered and reside in or migrate through the Oceania region. Appendix F, Table F.7-7, lists the threatened, endangered, or candidate marine mammals of the Oceania region. The waters off the coast of the Hawaiian Islands constitutes one of the world's most important North Pacific humpback whale ( Megaptera novaeanglia ) habitats, and the only place in U.S. coastal waters where humpbacks reproduce. Pacific whales been sighted in waters surrounding Hawaiian Islands, Guam, CNMI, and American Samoa. The endangered Hawaiian monk seal ( Monachus schauinslandi ) inhabits the main seven- island chain of Hawaii. Current estimates indica te that this population is declining. These seals breed primarily at Laysan Island, Lisianski Island, and Pearl and Hermes Reefs (USCG, 2002). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-96 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region The Oceania region provides habitat for twen ty-six threatened or en dangered marine and coastal birds. Appendix F, Table F.7-8, lists threatened, endangered, or candidate marine and coastal birds of the Oceania region. Because of their location in the Pacific, there are few migratory species (except interisland), with only two species coming from Alaska and northern Canada each year. The majority of the wildlife sanctuaries in the region \u2014Laysan, Howland, Baker, and Jarvis Islands, and Midway Atoll \u2014provide habitats for the endangered birds of the region, as well as for local state and territorial conservation programs. In spite of this isolation, the bird population of the Oceania region is one of the most diverse in the world. It has been estimated that, with the exception of protected areas, diversity dropped dramatically in the last 100 years because of exotic species and human settlement in nesting areas. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-97 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region Five species of sea turtles have been observed in the Oceania region, and all are classified as threatened or endangered. Appendix F, Table F.7-9, lists threatened, endangered, or candidate sea turtles of the Oceania region. Sea turtles have been known to nest in larger numbers in CNMI and American Samoa but also nest throughout the region. The green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) is considered the most abundant in Hawaiian waters. Hawksbills ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) are considered uncommon, and a small number nest on the islands of Hawaii and Molokai each year. Adult leatherbacks ( Dermochelys coriacea schlegelii ) are commonly sighted near Most records of olive ridleys ( Lepidochelys olivacea ) are from entanglements an d strandings (USCG, 2002). 3.7.4. Essential Fish Habitat The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (FCMA) established eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs), charged with developing Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) to achieve optimum fishery yields within their respective regions. In subsequent years, additional legislation was formulated to increase the effectiveness of this act. Two examples are the NMFS \"602 Guidelines\" (\"Guidelines for the Preparation of Fishery Management Plans under the FCMA,\" 50 CFR part 602), which provided an official definition of overfishing an d required each FMP to includ e measurable definitions of overfishing for each managed species, under the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-297; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ), which was passed and integrated into the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996 (M SFCMA, Public Law 94-265, as amended through October 11, 1996; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). This later act required FMCs and the Secretary of Commerce to identify and describe Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species specified under each respective FMP. The Western Pacific Regional Fishery Manage ment Council (WPRFMC) is responsible for implementing the MSFCMA through FMPs in the Oceania region. EFH is designated under five FMPs for this region\u2014pelagics, bottomfish, coral reef ecosystems, precious corals, and crustaceans (shellfish). The commerc ially important fish species of the Oceania region are listed in Appendix F, Table F.7- 3. NMFS is currently reviewing the EFH designations for this region to determine if changes are necessary. Those habitats currently designated as EFH in the Oceania region are listed in Appendix F, Table F.7-10. EFH designations for each region are available on-line 28. 28 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/h abitatprotection/efh/fish_manage_c.htm Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-98 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region 3.7.5. Socioeconomic Environment 3.7.5.1. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment The socioeconomic impact area of the Oceania region comprises thirty-seven coastal districts and twenty coastal counties over the twenty-six islands consisting of Hawaii, Guam, CNMI, and American Sa moa. The socioeconomic impact area extends from the island of Kauai, Hawa ii, to the western Pacific at Farallon de Pajaros Island, CNMI, and southeast to Tutuila Island, America Samoa. The population of the Oceania region is 1,492,854 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000), which is calculated by combining popul ation statistics for the region's fifty- seven counties/districts. Appendix F, Table F.7-11 lists these counties/districts and their populations. The Hawaiian Islands are the most populated in the region, making up 81 percent of the total population. Appendix F, Figure F.7\u00ad12, shows the population distribution of the Oceania region. The Oceania region varies substantially in socioeconomic patterns ranging from low-density, undeveloped rural areas to high-density, highly developed urban centers. The range is from 6 people in the Northern Islands1 Municipality District, CNMI, to 876,156 people in Honolulu County, Hawaii. Appendix F, Table F.7-12,, lists the most densely populated counties/districts of the Oceania region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-99 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region In 2000, the region had a total civilian labor force of 700,339, with an average unemployment rate of 6.6 percent, comp ared with the national average of 5.8 percent. In addition, 1.29 percent (or 8,463) of those employed were engaged in some kind of subsistence activity. Income levels rank well below the national average of both per capita and median household incomes at $11,939 and $32,564, respectively. (The national average per capita and median household incomes are $21,587 and $41,994, respecti vely.) The levels of income vary throughout the region. For example, American Samoa, the poorest island group, has a per capita income of $4,357, while Hawaii, the wealthiest island group, has a per capita income $21,525 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). 3.7.5.2. Economic Status Five primary sectors make up the foundation of the Oceania region's economic system: tourism, U.S. government and te rritorial expenditure, U.S. military, agriculture, and manufacturing. In addition, there is a small commercial seafood sector as well as associated service sectors \u2014sales, communications, transportation, warehousing, and infrastructure \u2014supporting the five primary sectors. On average over 6 million tourists visi t the Oceania region every year (Bank of Hawaii, 1997, 1999, 2003a, b); however, touris m is still very small in American Samoa because of its limited land area to support a critical mass of tourist infrastructure. Tourism accounts for 50 percent of the workforce in CNMI, and over $10 billion in visitor expenditur es for Hawaii (Bank of Hawaii, 1999, 2003a). From 1985 to 1997, tourism expe nditures multiplied throughout the region's economy and resulted in a large construction boom in which hotels and other tourist-related structures were in high demand. In the past 3 years, however, the tourism industry has declin ed, due to the economic fallout from the September 11, 2001 event and the SARS (severe ac ute respiratory syndrome) epidemic. It is also highly dependent on the well-being of Asian economies. In particular, the uncertain state of the Japanese economy has had a particular impact in that it is estimated that over 90 percent of all tourism revenues comes from Japanese visitors (Bank of Hawaii, 1997, 1999, 2003a, b). The Oceania region depends highly on in direct and direct U.S. funding. Total grants, wage payments, and procuremen ts to Guam in 1998 from the United States amounted to over $1 billion, and it was responsible for the well-being and employment of approximately 22 percent of the total Oceania population via welfare and direct project assistance (Bank of Hawaii, 1997, 1999, 2003a, b). The special relationships between the United States and Guam, CNMI, and American Samoa make the United States responsible for a certain amount of annual financial assistance. In the past 10 years, these revenues have started to decline as local tax revenues have increased. The U.S. military is actively involved in Hawaii, Guam, and CNMI. Hawaii is the headquarters for the U.S. Navy, Pacific Fleet, and is home to a variety of Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Marine bases. Guam also has a variety of air, naval, and army bases along with supporting infrastructure. A large portion of Tinian, CNMI, is leased to the U.S. Department of Defe nse. Industry and serv ices associated with the military are an integral part of the livelihood of many Oceania residents as these sectors earn billions of outside dollars every year. The large role of the U.S. military in the regional economy was he avily noticed duri ng the military Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-100 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region downsizing of the 1990s that created larg e fiscal deficits and high unemployment rates during the transition. Unless ther e becomes an increased need for military deployments in the region in the near fu ture, Hawaii, Guam, and CNMI will need to look for alternate sources of revenue. The agricultural and food products of the Oceania region consist of coconuts, breadfruit, sugarcane, pineapples, tomatoes, melons, tuna, and a variety of smaller fish. In Hawaii, pineapples and sugarcane remain the largest commercial crops. In Guam and CNMI, subsistence and commer cial fishing are the largest food production sectors. There are two tuna canning factories on American Samoa that account for 33 percent of employed labor force and provide 25 percent of all canned tuna consumed in the United States (Craig et al., 1993). Manufacturing began increasing in the past 15 years primarily through tariff-free trade zones established with the United States. Hawaii has a small manufacturing sector and relies more on the associated transportation and warehousing services because of its advantageous location to, and political inclusion with, the United States. Manufacturing has increased in Guam, as the local government began to encourage alternatives to tourism and the U.S. military. There are now thirty-one garment producing factories in the CNMI employing over 12,000 employees and producing goods worth over $1 billion (CIA, 2001). With the exception of two tuna plants, there is no substantial manufacturing in American Samoa. 3.7.5.3. Vessel Transportation and Ports Because of their location in the Pacific O cean, the islands of the Oceania region are highly dependent on ships for the import and export of goods. The majority of the food consumed in the region is imported (98 percent of all freight arrives by ship), and almost all bulk export commodities are shipped by sea. Since the region is spread out across the Paci fic Ocean, the islands serve as a transshipment point to a variety of locati ons including the United States, Samoa, eastern and southern Asia, Japan, Sout h America, and smaller islands of the South Pacific. There is also a large amount of U.S. naval traffic in the region. In 1999, over 15,000 vessel trips measured along the waterway s were associated with major ports throughout the region (USACE, 1999c). Honolulu Harbor is the largest in the region and contains large-scale facilities for the on- and offloading of containers and support operations. In 1998, 2,752 vessels called on Guam's port in Apra. Appendix F, Table F.7-13, lists the major ports of the Oceania region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-101 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region In 1999, the Hawaiian Islands received or shipped from thei r ports more than 21 thousand short tons of foreign and domestic cargo: domestic shipping and receiving accounted for 1,164 and 5,136 th ousand short tons, respectively, while foreign shipping and receiving acco unted for 609 and 6,548 thousand short tons, respectively. In addition, there were 7,852 thousand short tons of intrastate waterborne co mmerce (USACE, 1999c). Ther e is a lack of detailed waterborne commerce data for Guam, CNMI, and American Samoa. Aggregate shipping and receiving, without knowing if the totals are domestic or foreign, for these islands are as follows: Guam , 31,000 and 250,000 1999c); CNMI, 205,851 and 851,794 revenue tons (Commonwealth Development Authority, 2000) 29; and American Samoa, 182,720 and 614,017 tons (American Samoa Department of Treasury, 2002)30. 3.7.5.4. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries The Oceania region serves as an important transshipment center for commercial fisheries based in both domestic and international waters. The majority of commercial catch is undertaken by international tuna fleets, which lease fishing rights within certain areas of the region's EEZ. During 1999, fisheries produced more than 28 million lb (valued at greater than $200 million (NMFS, 2001b). In particular, tuna species are highly abundant in the tuna fisheries located in the EEZ of Hawaii, Guam, CNMI, and American Samoa. Pago Pago, American Samoa, received 208,300 tons of tuna worth $200 milli on, making it the leading U.S. port in terms of dollar value and fish landings (NMFS, 2001b). A variety of species is caught and landed in the region's commercial ). Of these, tuna is the most important to the region economically. Appendix F, Table F.7-14, lists the top commercial la ndings for the Oceania region. 29 These numbers are for 1998 in revenue tons from the Co mmonwealth Development Authority. Short ton information was not available. 30 The numbers for American Samoa are estimates based off tot al inbound and outbound cargo (in tons) as denoted by the American Samoa Department of Treasury, Customs and Excise Tax Division. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-102 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region Recreational Fisheries Recreational fishing occurs throughout the region but is predominant in Hawaii and Guam. Small-scale fishing operations in CNMI and American Samoa are primarily for subsistence and direct consumption purposes defined largely by tradition and culture. According to the MSFCMA, fish caught but not sold are classified as \"recreational.\" The WPRFMC estimated recreational participant numbers for bottomfish (2,550), pelagic (64,722) 31, and coral reef (8,050) fisheries32. Although charter vessels occur in large numbers throughout the region (particularly in Hawaii and Guam), the fishing statistics \u2014total catch of 2,265,217 lbs valued at $5,292,579 \u2014associated with this sector are not considered specifically recreational since the majority of the total catch may be sold commercially29. Blue constitute the majority of the recreational catch in the region. 3.7.5.5. Subsistence The Oceania region has depended on coastal marine food sources for thousands of years as an important source of protein and nourishment because of limited space for agriculture and a general lack of land mammals. Yet, even though the population's survival is no longer depe ndent on these resources, subsistence fishing continues to have important traditional and cultural impacts. Over time, local communities developed a close, emotional, as well as utilitarian, association with the marine environment, which ha s had a large impact on their social organization. Communal disbursement of the catch is still a common practice throughout the Oceania region and its diverse people, as well as the traditional format in which it is conducted. Subsistence fishing is even now conducted in some rural areas of Niihau, Hawaii; CNMI; and American Samoa; combined, the subsistence fisheries production for these three areas is 889 tons, with a nominal value of about $3.5 million (UNEP, 2000). (A survey indicated that at least 40 percent of American Samoa's households exploit the nearshore fisheries for part of their food [OTA, 1987].) The catch consists of shellfish, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other small pelagic fish species. 3.7.5.6. Archaeological/Historic Resources Many locations on the Oceania region's is lands are identified as culturally or archaeologically sensitive areas and include burial sites, historic properties, and shrines. However, most of the islands have yet to complete thorough archeological surveys, and those completed tend to occur only prior to development. For example, it is estimated that only 10 percent of Hawaii and 8 percent of American Samoa are adeq uately surveyed (USCG, 1999b, 2000b). Traditional cultural places are only just beginning to be identified. Further, the number of identified areas is substantial \u2014Hawaii alone has 20,000 to 30,000 31 This number does not include the number of recreational participants in pelagic fisheries in Hawaii. At the time of this PEIS, this information was unavailable. 32 Personal communication from Marcia Hamilton, Western Pacifi c Regional Fishery Management Council, Honolulu, HI, 2002. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-103 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region known sites \u2014and it will take immense resources to compile a list of sites and locations (USCG, 1999b). Hawaii contains a wide variety of historic properties that well reflect the diverse character of its population. A large number of sites remain that relate to the approximately 1,700-year occupation of th e islands by native Hawaiians (SHPD, 2001), prior to European contact in 1778 A.D. (USCG, 1999b, 2000b). Sites range from residential landscapes to temporary habitations and agricultural fields, such as the extensive wetland ag ricultural fields or the sacred summit region of Mauna Kea. Many of these historic sites are still used today and remain culturally significant (SHPD, 2001). Numerous significant historic sites are also found along Hawaii's entire coastline. The reason for this coastal patterning is that these areas are where the bulk of the prehistoric population lived. Though more rare, some sites extend below the high-water line, such as fishponds, petroglyphs (rock art) cut into reef rock, circular holes for grinding bait (b ait cups), and anchor holes. Shipwrecks (the USS ARIZONA ) and trains (e.g., in Ewa on Oahu) are also more rare among the modern Hawaiian sites and relatively few significant sites are known in open, offshore waters. Guam is a mix of Chamorro, Micrones ian, American, and Asian cultures. Noteworthy examples of historic sites are petroglyphs (cave paintings) and latte stones (pillars that supported ancient stru ctures and houses). Sites such as these provide insight into the lives of Chamorro people in their earliest times. Below the marine waters of Guam are five shipwrecked galleons. The ancient Chamorros, the earliest known inhabitants of CNMI, were of Mayo-Polynesian descent originating fr om Southeast Asia as early as 2,000 B.C. (Government of Guam, 2002). Examples of the Spanish period (1668-1899) are present in two shipwrecks, CONCEPCION and SANTA MARGARITA Both wrec ked off Saipan and Rota, respectively, in the early part of the seventeenth century. There is evidence to suggest that additional Spanish-period shipwrecks may be present within CNMI waters. There are remnants of World War II in this region today; offshore in shallow coastal waters are the remains of combat aircraft, patrol boats, and merchant ships (CMNI, 1999). There are 401 recorded historic archaeolog ical and cultural sites for the major islands of American Samoa. Nine major categories of sites have been identified: star mounds, quarries, U.S. military sites, prehistoric forts, legendary sites, villages, petroglyphs, National Register si tes, and terraces. Only 8 percent of the 401 American Samoa sites are being surveyed. The likelihood that archaeological sites are present in areas that would be used during a response to an oil spill is high (USCG, 2000b). 3.7.5.7. Recreation and Tourism With its unique location in the tropical Pacific, its proximity to Asia, and its relatively constant and enjoyable climate, the Oceania region receives millions of tourists every year. In 2000, nearly 7 million tourists visited the state of Hawaii Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-104 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region alone, with expenditures of $10.9 million. The American Coastal Coalition (ACC, 1998) reported that coastal touris m supported 172 thousand jobs. Tourists come for a variety of recreational activities including scuba diving, sportfishing, surfing, sailing, using the beach, snorkeling, hiking, camping, and observing natural phenomena. Publicly owned and administered areas (national seashores, parks, beaches, wildlife lands) as well as designated preservation areas (historic and natural sites, landmarks, wilderness areas, and wildlife sanctuaries) attract residents and visitors throughout the year. Commercial and private recreational facilities and establishments , such as resorts, marinas, gambling casinos (CNMI), shopping centers, and ornamental gardens, also serve as primary areas of interest. The region's coastal shorefront has many public and private recreation areas, as well as a variety of govern ment-sponsored mountain na ture reserves. There are miles of ocean shoreline within the region that are composed of sandy beaches, rocky outcroppings, and cliffs. Mountain na ture reserves usually consist of valley waterfalls, tropical rain forests, and natural phenomena like volcanoes. These areas are a major inducement for coastal tourism, as well as being a primary resource for resident recreational activity. In addition, cruise ships constitute an important part of the tourism industry, particularly in Hawaii, but they also account for large numbers of tourists in Guam and CNMI. With the exception of American Samoa, the economy of the Oceania region is highly dependent on tourism revenues, wh ich account directly or indirectly for over 30 percent of the employment oppo rtunities within the region (Bank of Hawaii, 1997). It is the number one industry in terms of revenue earnings for Guam and CNMI, yet the state of Hawaii is the highest earner in tourism revenue at over $13 billion (ACC, 1998). The region's heavy reliance on tourism expenditures, the bulk from Asia, has caused economic difficulty in the last few years as the financial situation of Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia has declined. Ecotourism is growing rapidly throughout the region, particularly in American Samoa where a new effort is being undertaken by the government to encourage the tourism industry. It is widely accepted as an environmentally sustainable activity and is especially appealing due to its similarities with the region's traditional ideals of environmental stewardship. Ecoparks (both private and public) are beginning to appear throughout the region and are expected to become very popular in the next decade. 3.7.5.8. Public Safety and Worker Health Oil spill response is one of the U.S. Co ast Guard's (USCG's) many missions. In responding to oil spills, the USCG is aware of public safety and the effects that alternative response technologies \u2014chemical dispersion and in situ burning \u2014 could have on human health. Under the guidelines established by the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), steps have been taken to protect both the public and oil spill responders. Whether compensated workers or volunteers, responders are required to be certified under either the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emerge ncy Response Standard or USEPA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard. These Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-105 2009 3.7. Affected Environment: Oceania Region standards ensure that responders unde rstand the hazards of oil spill response and how to protect themselves. To assist in public safety, the USCG has the maritime safety authority to establish a safety zone around oil spill cleanup operations. This zone is established to safeguard the public and responders from the hazards associated with cleanup. In addition, USCG standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to protect responders, as well as the public, from the hazards associated with chemical dispersion and in situ burning. These procedures are outlined in SOPs in each Area Contingency Plan's (ACP's) Site Safety Plan. In addition, training exercises such as PREP (Preparedness for Response Exercise Pr ogram) and SONS (Spill of National Significance) train USCG response personnel to avoid safety hazards. Dispersants are a liquid chemical used to disperse oil spills from the ocean surface (see Section 2.2.2). During an oil spill, di spersant application can be from either an aerial or a shipboard platform. In both cases response personnel have the potential to be accidentally exposed to the dispersant, and in extreme cases exposure to the public could occur. The two types of dispersants with use allowed in the United States have OSHA-establish ed, permissible exposure limits of 50 ppm on skin. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for these dispersants makes clear the human health concerns from excess exposure. In situ burning of an oil spill entails setting contained or boomed oil on fire (see Section 2.2.3). This action has been acknowledged as having potential human health and safety effects. Besides the physical hazards to responders, there is the potential for inhalation of airborne burn products. In situ burning emits a plume of black smoke laden with particulates (PM10, soot), the main public health concern. Response personnel working close to the burn may be exposed to levels of gases and particulates that would require them to use personal protective equipment. Occupational standards such as OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) are applicable . For the general public, NOAA (2000a) reported that particulate concentrations in a smoke plume remain the only agent of concern past 1 or 2 mi downwind, with the gases created in a burn dissipating to levels close to background. Public exposure to smoke particulate from the burn is not expected to occu r unless the smoke plume travels down to ground level. Since the general public may include sensitive individuals, such as the very young and very old, pregnant women, and people with pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, this population's tolerance to particulates may be significantly lower than that of the resp onders. There is little data concerning the effect on humans of particulates from the in situ burning of oil. Based on chemical analysis of soot particulates and their physical behavior, the hazard is expected to be similar to that of better-known particulates emissions that are now regulated by the NAAQS. In 1997, the Special Monitoring of Applied Response Technologies (SMART) protocol 33 was created, in part, to address the particulates concerns and to better aid the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) in making decisions related to initiating, continuing, or terminating in situ burning. 33 http://response.restoration.no aa.gov/oilaids/SMART/SMART.html Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3-106 2009 4. Environmental Consequences CHAPTER 4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES 4.1. I NTRODUCTION This section presents the potential direct, indir ect, and cumulative environmental impacts of the alternatives. The significance of these potential impacts is discussed, as well as possible options to mitigate or reduce any possible adverse impacts. The alternatives included in the evaluation are based on the proposed regulations that could, potentially, affect the nature and effectiveness of marine oil spill response. As discussed in Chapter 2, the proposed regulations (or any alternative other than Alternative 1) would establish a requirement for the regulated community (tank vessels and MTR facilities planholders) to have certain o il spill response capabilities available to them, but would not mandate the actual use of any particular response option 1. The impacts of the alternatives are caused by the oil spill response options in the alternatives, in relation to the baseline of the no action alternative (Alternative 1), which is the current response requirement. While a direct assessment of the environmental impacts of the response options\u2014 on-water mechanical recovery, on-water in situ burning, and on-water chemical dispersion\u2014is discussed in Section 4.2.1, these response opti ons will not be utilized under normal circumstances for their intended purposes unless there is an oil spill. Therefore, the assessment of the response options also incorporates the impact of an oil spill under the influence of different response alternatives, and oil spills are the focus of the fate and effects mode l that was used for the analysis. The impacts of the oil spill response options are presented in Sections 4.3 and 4.5 - 4.10, while the impacts of the oil spills per se are discussed in Appendix J. The first step in the evaluation of the alternatives wa s to refine the scope of the analysis to identify the issues to be analyzed and discussed (Section 4.2). When that was completed, an analytical strategy was selected to evaluate the potential consequences associated with these issues. The approach was to first summarize the available research and field observations concerning oil spills (Section 4.3) and then to place these effects into a regional context for each of the alternatives (Sections 4.5 through 4.10), based on an evaluation of the anticipated effects at selected locations. 1 The response options analyzed and disc ussed in this PEIS\u2014mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion\u2014 are for on-water recovery. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-1 2009 4. Environmental Consequences The analytical approach, explaine d in Appendix I, includes a stat e-of-the-art oil spill fate and effects model, used to predict oil fate and effects at five representative locations around the country based on the response op tions in the alternatives. Th e ecological results from the modeling scenarios were analyzed using a risk assessment methodology that emphasizes the relative environmental costs and benefits of the various response options under each of the alternatives, as described in Section 4.4.1. and Ap pendix I The results of th is risk assessment were used to refine and to document the anticipated impacts in each geographic region from Chapter 3, under each alternative. The results are in Appendix I. A risk assessment approach, described in detail in Appendix I was selected to analyze ecological effects. Risk assessment offers the best method to compare the relative consequences of each of the response options under the various alternatives within and between regions. Once oil has been spilled on the water, the potential for relative risk reduction thro ugh the use of various response options becomes much more significant than absolu te effects. This is true because some adverse consequences are inevitable and the only appropriate goal is to minimize the potential risks and consequences. Socioeconomic effects, on the other hand, could not be defined using the same risk scales used for ecological effects, and instead the assessment examined the relative change between response options, as described in Section 4.4.1.2 and Appendix I. The modeling results for the five representative locations of the six geographic regions in this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) are described in Appendix J and summarized in the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). All th is material is based on the modeling effort, the detailed result s of which appear in a six-part technical report prepared in support of this project (French McCay et al., 2004). The potential impacts of the various alternatives in terms of oil spills are compared in Appendix J. In Sections 4.11 through 4.15 the subject matter discussed includes unavoidable advers e impacts of the proposed action; irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources; relationship between the short-term use of the human environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; and cumulative impacts; respectively. The context of this PEIS is response to spills in dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas, generally 3 or more nm from shore with the exception of several areas with dispersant pre-authorization agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef <20 ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements 2. The underlying rationale for the establishment of dispersant pre-authorization agreements closer than 3 nm from shor e is the ability of the environment in these locations to provide reasonab le dilution over a shorter distance due to depth and hydrodynamic conditions. On this basis, the average modeling results and general conclusions presented in this chapter for an oil spill release based on the 3 nm limit would be applicable to these areas as well. A state -of-the-art oil spill fate and effects mo del was used to predict the impact of oil spills on the selected physical environment resources. The area that was modeled had boundaries of 3 and 12 miles from shore, with statut e miles instead of nautic al miles due to default options in the computer-modeling program. These oil spills, especially larger ones, are rare events. Response modes are mechanical recovery, dispersants, and in situ burning, and the option(s) selected depend on the timing and the location and conditions at the time of the spill, as well as 2 http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-2 2009 4. Environmental Consequences the type of oil, the time it has been on the water, and the ecological resources of concern. Frequently, the \"no action\" response option will be used when spills are this far from shore. Of the possible options, mechanical recovery is the most often considered, but its effectiveness begins to decline as wave heights grow beyond approximately 3 ft. In situ burning was tested during the EXXON VALDEZ spill response, but has never been used for an actual spill response in the United States. These issues were analyzed in detail in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999) and in Chap ter 2 of this PEIS. 4.2. R EFINEMENT OF SCOPE The intent of the proposed action (as described in Chapter 1) is to improve domestic marine oil spill response capability. All of th e response technologies addressed by the alternatives are already in use in the United States, and as a consequence the relative availability of response equipment may change in some locations, but no new technol ogies will be implemented. This section briefly describes the response technolog ies under consideration and the potential environmental effects associated with them, to explain what issues w ill be analyzed in detail and which ones will be omitted from further consideration, and why. It is a matter of public policy that spilled oil requires a response, and that the Coast Guard should examine all reasonable and potential response options to reduce the potential for environmental effects. There are five major opt ions for response (Section 2.2): On-water mechanical recovery On-water chemical dispersion On-water in situ burning Shoreline cleanup and other countermeasures Natural removal (no cleanup action) In all cases involving active oil spill response, the go al is to mitigate or to minimize the potential for environmental damage, based on what would occur if no cleanup action were undertaken. Because this assessment relates to alternatives affecting on-water response options, shoreline cleanup is not considered. Natural removal is part of the recovery process addressed in the risk evaluation, but it is not included here as a response option. It is assumed that mechanical recovery and in situ burn capabilities are currently available in all six geographic regions. However, in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, dispersant capabilities are assumed to be available and their use for response operations feasible (USCG, 1999). Dispersant capability will only be discussed for these two regions because appropriate response times cannot currently be met in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania regions. The proposed alternatives have the potential to in fluence the availability of equipment related to three response options: mechanical recovery, chemical dispersion, and in situ burning. The capability to use all three response options currently exists throughout the United States, but only mechanical recovery can be used without geographic restrictions. Dispersant pre-authorized agreement areas exist in all six geographi c regions (Figure 2.2-1). Dispersant and in situ burn use is Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-3 2009 4. Environmental Consequences restricted by decisions made at the Regional Response Team (RRT) level (see Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, respectively), and their use is essentiall y restricted to areas 3 or more nm from shore3. As defined in Chapter 2, dispersant capability is available only in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, while the other options are available nationwide. 4.2.1. Response Operations A detailed description of the response options is in Section 2.2. The following sections review the environmental issues associated with each of the response options. The effectiveness of each of the options is influenced by environmental conditions. Mechanical recovery and in situ burning achieve efficiencies generally considered to be less than 15 percent (NRC, 2005; OTA, 1990). On ly chemical dispersion offers the opportunity to treat 4 large volumes of oil (see Section 2.3). 4.2.1.1. On-Water Mechanical Recovery Mechanical recovery is the only response option that removes oil from the marine environment and places it back under containment. While the subsequent disposal of recovered oil may have environmental consequences, these are subject to a controlled decision process and are not addressed in the assessment of the alternatives. Other potential adverse consequences include hydrocarbon emissions from operating equipment, physical damage to the habitat or organisms as a direct result of removal activities, and noise effects on species sensitive to such disturbances. Relative to the hydrocarbon emissions from spilled oil, operation of recovery eq uipment is a minimal concern. Physical damage can be an issue when recovery equipment is operated in shallow water, but is not a significant concern in the offshore scenarios considered here. Finally, noise effects from response operations are a concern around sensitive organisms, particularly marine mammals, coastal and marine birds, and sea turtles. Nesting areas, rookeries, and haulout areas are of particular concern and must be considered during response operations. The level of concern is not expected to change significantly under any of the alternatives. Under Area Contingency Plans, guidance on minimizing noise effects on sensitive organisms should be included. Consequently, the potential adverse impacts of mechanical recovery are minimal or can be controlled, and both the modeling and discussion of the relevant alternatives are focused on the direct effects of removing the spilled oil, thereby modi fying its fate and effects in the environment. 3 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004). 4 The terms \"removal\" and \"treatment\" are used interchangeabl y throughout this PEIS. The term \"remove\" or \"removal\" is used throughout the PEIS as it is defined by section 311(a)(8) of the Clean Water Act, and refers to containment and removal of oil from the water and shorelines or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary to mi nimize or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare of the United States (including, bu t not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, public and private property, and shorelines and beaches) or to the environment. Wh ile the use of dispersants, whic h break an oil slick into small droplets that then disperse into the water column, renders furt her manual removal attempts infeasible, the use of dispersants increases the opportunity for the oil to undergo natural bioremediation. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-4 2009 4. Environmental Consequences 4.2.1.2. On-Water Chemical Dispersion Dispersant application involves the storage, handling, and delivery of commercial dispersants by either aircraft or vessels. The benefit is that oil is treated on the water surface by breaking it into small droplets that mix into the water column, rapidly dilute, and then un dergo biological degradation. The potential adverse effects include hydrocarbon emissions from operating equipment, noise impacts on species sensitive to such disturbances , and potential biological impacts from exposure to dispersants alone or in combination with oil. As with mechanical recovery, the potential hydrocarbon emis sions from equipment and the potential noise impacts are minor and not considered further. The potential environmental impacts of exposure to dispersants alone are much less significant than those from exposure to dispersed oil, but are often a concern and need to be addressed becaus e of concerns regarding overspraying or spraying beyond the area of floating oil. Since these do not vary between regions, they are discussed independently in Appendix G. The summary conclusions of the evaluation are that , while dispersants can cause adverse environmental impacts, these impacts are limited in extent, very short term, and minimal in comparison to th e potential effects of the dispersed oil. The primary reasons for this conclusion are that the amount of dispersant used is relatively small (for planning purposes 5 gal or less per acre based on a ratio of 1 part dispersant to 20 parts crude oil at an average thickness of 0.1 mm), and it is not intentionally sprayed away from the oil; therefore, the risk of exposure to dispersant alone is low. Wh ile dispersants do show a low level of toxicity in the laboratory, any dispersant that is accidentally sprayed on the water away from the oil is rapidly diluted to levels that are below the levels necessary to cause toxicity. Accidental spraying of marine mammals and birds is a concern because of the possibility of affecting their ther moregulatory capability, but there are spill response protocols in place to avoid areas where such an imals concentrate. Consequently, both the modeling and discussion of alternatives focus on the beneficial and adverse impact s related to dispersed oil. 4.2.1.3. On-Water In Situ Burning This response option involves the use of booms to contain and concentrate oil, and a means to ignite the oil. Burning is sustained as long as the oil thickness is sufficient. Boom used in this option is similar to that used for mechanical recovery operations, except that it is fire resistant. The same vessels and ancillary equipment are also used. As a consequence, unless oil is actually burned, the impacts of routine operations are equivalent to those of mechanical recovery. Burning oil causes air quality concerns and may result in residue that can sink. These impacts were modeled an d are discussed for the alternatives under consideration. 4.2.2. Storage and Maintenance of, and Training with, Response Equipment Oil spill response equipment must be unifor mly available, and there are stockpiles throughout the United States. These repositories are mostly located at or near high- volume ports and high-traffic areas. Curre nt stockpiles include mechanical recovery equipment, a wide range of booms (both for on-water recovery and shoreline protection), Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-5 2009 4. Environmental Consequences in situ burn booms, dispersant application equipment, trucks and vehicles, miscellaneous ancillary equipment, and stockpiles of dispersant. These repositories are located in industrial ar eas in various ports or, in the case of some dispersant stockpiles, at or near airports. They generally include warehouses of various sizes to store equipment that must be in a protected environment, as well as equipment yards for the storage of larger items and vehicles that can be kept outside. In addition, in areas where aerial dispersant capabilities are presently in place, aircraft and associated application equipment are maintained on standby status at airports. Various response organizations or cooperatives and their subcontractors are responsible for these repositories and also provide the manpower to respond to oil spills. Full-time staff may be supplemented at th e time of a spill, dependin g on circumstances. These organizations also conduct periodic training exercises for all their response capabilities. These exercises can involve the deployment and operation of equipment. The current levels of procurement, storage, maintenance, and use of mechanical recovery, in situ burn, and dispersant equipment for facilit ies and vessels would not need to be changed as a result of the proposed action, exce pt local repositioning of dispersant aircraft and associated resources might occur. Any re positioning would utilize existing facilities and equipment. The overall number and detail of spill response exercises is expected to remain consistent with the current levels. Based on these conclusions, potential additional impacts related to the storage and maintenance of response equipment and its use in training exercises are not expected to occur and are therefore not analyzed in this PEIS. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-6 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills & Response Options 4.3. A NTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF OIL SPILLS AND ON-WATER RESPONSE OPTIONS The impacts to each resource in this section are first described in terms of the likely consequences of oil spills without any response operations, to establish the context for the oil spill response options that make up the alternatives. This is followed by the impacts of the response options themselves (mechanical recovery, dispersants, and in situ burning.), for each of the resource categories. The impacts of marine oil spills have been the subject of intense study for decades. Four major reviews have been prepared by the National Academy of Sciences (NRC, 1975, 1985, 2003, 2005) and hundreds of scientific studies have been prepared. A recent study (NRC, 2005) finds that sufficient information exists to support open-water dispersant use, which this rulemaking would help support. It also recognizes the viability and importance of the regional-local ecological risk assessment processes that are used to compare the various tradeoffs associated with mechanical recovery and dispersant use, both in nearshore and offshore environments. In addition to impacts, each section al so addresses two additional issues: What are the general thresholds that determine the consequences for the resource? What is the recovery window for this re source, given the exposures anticipated? 4.3.1. Consequences to the Physical Environment 4.3.1.1. Water Quality Impacts of Oil Spills Oil spills are not considered to cause long-term degradation to water quality in the water column of marine and open coastal environments. Based on events at actual spills, measurable levels of concern usually occur only near the surface (down to perhaps 20 to 30 ft), even under the worst case weather conditions (Coelho et al., 1995; French McCay, 2002, 2003; Kingston, 1999; NRC, 1989). Historically, most oil spills have affected water quality only for short periods (days to weeks) after the release has stopped. Typically, mo re than 95 percent of the hydrocarbon components of oil are insoluble in water, limiting the effects of oil on water quality. Even large spills may not signif icantly affect water quality in marine waters. For example, concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska following the EXXON VALDEZ spill in 1989 were reported to be less than the state of Alaska standards for aromatic hydrocarbons in marine waters and concen trations shown to be toxic or causing sub-lethal effects in marine animals (N eff and Stubblefield, 1995). The ultimate fate of the oil hydrocarbons in the water is to evaporate, degrade, or be taken up by organisms and sediments, not to rema in in the water (see Part A of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). Thus, water-quality impacts are short in duration unless there is a cont inuous source of contamination to the water. Greater effects on water quality may occur if a medium or large spill occurs in or migrates to enclosed embayments, estu aries, or wetlands. This can be either directly from the slick or from subsequent leaching from oiled shorelines. In such confined or low-energy water bodies, the spilled oil is likely to be more concentrated because of the decrea sed mixing and dilution. The 1969 barge FLORIDA spill of West Falmouth, Massachus etts, is an example where spilled oil entered an area of shallow protected waters and severely affected the water quality and benthos for months to year s after the spill (Teal and Howarth, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-7 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills & Response Options 1984). Physical dispersion of oil droplets during storms may significantly affect the magnitude of the im pacts. During the 1996 NORTH CAPE oil spill, which occurred on the south coast of Rhode Island during a severe winter storm, most of the No. 2 fuel oil was mixed into the water column by the heavy surf, resulting in high concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the shallow water for we eks after the spill (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]; French McCay, 2003). The severity of water-quality impacts resulting from crude oil spills depends, in part, on the chemical composition of the oil. While the chemical composition of crude oil varies, al l crude oils contain a combination of hydrocarbon and non- hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbon components typically compose the bulk of the oil, with some crude oils having more than 95 percent hydrocarbons (NRC, 1985). The principal types of hydroc arbons found in crude oil are alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromati c hydrocarbons. Among these groups, the molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons (i.e ., 1-to 4-ring aromatics) are the most soluble, and specifically the 2- to 4-ring PAHs are considered to cause the most toxic effects on marine life via the wate r pathway because they are semisoluble, evaporate relative ly slowly, and so are more persistent than the soluble and highly volatile 1-ring aromatics (see Part A, Section A.2 of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). Higher molecular weight, less soluble PAHs (greater than 4\u00ad ring) are also toxic to marine organism s; however, exposure to these insoluble components is primarily via direct contact with oil or oiled sediments. Non- hydrocarbon components of crude oil in clude sulfur, nitrog en, oxygen, and a variety of trace metals. While all these components might be of concern to water quality, the components of most concer n are the PAHs because they have the greatest potential to affect marine orga nisms and contaminate their tissues, which may be consumed by othe r organisms and humans. The chemical and physical pr operties of spilled oil chan ge with time as the oil \"weathers\" or ages (see Appendix B). Generally, the longer spilled oil is weathered, the fewer ecologically damaging constituents it will contain (because the constituents of most concern evaporate). However, a small percentage (typically 1 to 5 percent) of the spilled o il can dissolve into the water column as part of the weathering process. This dissolution represents the most significant impairment to water quality associated with oil spills, but it is generally much less significant than evaporation, which acts to limit water-quality concerns. The importance of dispersion is increased when chemical dispersants are used, as discussed in subsequent sections. Sedimentation, which removes oil from the water column, is important in nearshore areas where the concentration of suspended particulate material is high. In this process, oil is adsorbed onto the particles and carried to the bottom as the particles settle. Interactions between oil and particulate matter can play a major role in the disposition of petroleum (Payne et al., 1987). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-8 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills & Response Options In addition to evaporation, dissolutio n, and sedimentation, photo-oxidation and the activity of naturally occurring micr obes will degrade some of the oil. Photo\u00ad oxidation produces highly soluble end prod ucts that are found in the water column below the slick, although at very low c oncentrations. This process and wave action are the major processes that promote disso lution of the soluble hydrocarbons into the water column. Subsequent microbial br eakdown occurs in the water column, in the sediments, and on the shorelines where oil is stranded. A detailed discussion of oil fate and water column to xicity issues may be found in Part A, Section A.2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery No additional adverse impacts on wate r quality are expected to occur from additional mechanical recovery components. Water-quality impacts will be reduced by the additional amount of oil recovered. Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion The proposed regulations apply only to w aters where pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are generally demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore5. Since dispersants will not be applied outside pre- authorization areas, dispersants will not be applied in shallow coastal waters and such actions are not analyzed as part of the proposed action. Coastal water quality will likely benefit from chemic al dispersion in pre-author ization agreement areas, as the volume of floating oil that subsequent ly migrates to the nearshore areas will be reduced by the amount disp ersed in marine waters. When effective, chemical dispersion in pre-authorization agreement areas will promote a temporary increase in the initial amounts of hydrocarbons that are dispersed and dissolved into the water column. This w ill to some extent delay the water column's return to background hydrocarbon concentration levels. However, the dilution volume in offshore waters is very large, quickly mitigating this effect. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning Open-ocean in situ burning of spilled oil will create burn residue materials and leave a percentage of the oil spill unburn ed. Water column quality impacts from unburned oil will be the same as discussed above, but will be reduced by the amount of oil that is burned, as some of the burned oil would have entered the water column either as oil droplets or as dissolved components if the burning did not occur. 5 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-9 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills & Response Options Physical properties of burn residues depend on burn efficiency and oil type. Efficient burns of heavy crude oils generate brittle, solid residues (like peanut brittle). Residues from efficient burns of other crude oils are described as semisolid (like cold roofing tar). Inef ficient burns generate mixtures of unburned oil, burned residues, and soot th at are sticky, taffy-like, or semiliquid. Depending on water density, initial density of the spilled oil, oil slick thickness, and efficiency of the in situ burning, burn residues may either sink or float. For example, 300 gal of stiff, taffy-like burn residue that could be picked up easily remained floating after a controlled test burn of between 15,000 to 30,000 gal of Prudhoe Bay crude oil during the EXXON VALDEZ spill (Allen, 1990), while Iranian heavy crude burn residues sa nk (which makes them difficult or impossible to recover) during the 1991 HAVEN explosion and burning off Genoa, Italy (NOAA, 2000a). Burn residues may also stay afloat while warm but sink as they cool off, as shown by Bu ist (1995) in a series of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, test burns. Generally, burn residues have less volat ile hydrocarbons with low boiling points, are denser and more viscous than unburned oil, and show relative enrichment in metals and the higher molecular weight PAHs. Environment Canada coordinated a series of studies to determine if in situ burning caused water column toxicity beyond that attributable to allowing the slick to remain on the surface of the water. While these studies centered on the Newfoundland in situ burn field trials conducted in August 1993, they also included laboratory tests to investigate potential effects in a more controlled environment (Daykin et al., 1994). Results from the laboratory and fi eld studies indicated that, although toxicity to test organisms was higher in water samples collected beneath oil burning on water than for control samp les, this increase was generally no greater than that caused by the presen ce of an unburned oil slick on water. Chemical analyses performed along with the biological tests reflected low hydrocarbon levels in the water samples. If burn re sidue is not collected, it could gradually leach hydrocarbons into the water. However, laboratory tests on burn residue from the Newfoundland in situ burn field trials indicated that toxic compounds were not leaching from the residue and the limited amount of burn residue produced would not be sufficient to noticeably affect water quality (Blenkinsopp et al., 1997). Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Water-quality standards criteria exist for a number of constituents known to be present in spilled oil and dispersants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA, 1999) maintains a list of National Recommended Water Quality Criteria for priority toxic pollutants and non-priority pollutants. Depending on the pollutant, numerical criteria may exist for the Criterion Maximum Concentration (CMC) and Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC) in fresh water, the CMC and CCC in salt water, and/or the concentrations for which the post-consumption carcinogenic risk to humans is greater than the human health threshold criterion of 10 -6. The CMC is an estimate of the high est concentration in surface water to which an aquatic community can be exposed briefly without resulting in an unacceptable effect. The CMC is developed based on acute toxicity bioassays and endpoints, such as LC50 (lethal concentrat ion to 50 percent of exposed organisms) and EC50 (effects concentration causing a 50 percent reduction in a measured function such as growth rate). The CCC is an estimate of the highest concentration Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-10 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills & Response Options in surface water to which an aquatic community can be exposed indefinitely without resulting in an unacceptable effect. Thus, the CCC applies to situations of chronic exposure. States also maintain water-quality criteria for pollutant constituents in their waters. In some cases, state criteria may be more stringent than federal criteria. States may also have site-, water body-, or designated use-specific criteria for certain pollutants that vary from site to si te within the state. Finally, some states may have numerical criteria for groups of pollutants rather than for individual pollutants. For pollutant constituents in water subsequent to an oil spill, the thresholds of concern are essentially the water-quality standards for those pollutants. Since the CMC criteria are based on short-term exposure, they are the most relevant to oil spill impacts. Table 4.3-1 lists the USEPA saltwater and human health risk water-quality criteria that are available for pollutant constituents in oil and dispersants. The saltwater-quality standards from some coastal states for the same constituents can be more stringent, as Table 4.3-2 shows. While metals are present in oil, their concentrations in the source oil are generally low. Given the insolubility of oil and the rapid dilution that occurs in the water column, the metal concentrations in the receiving water re sulting from an oil spill would not exceed water-quality standards. Thus, metals are not considered further.

The constituents of conc ern where there are water-quality standards are the monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs, such as benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene). These compounds rapidly evaporate from oil spills. While water- quality criteria do not yet exist for PAHs, they are more significant for interpreting impacts. The a pproach used by Di Toro et al. (2000), which is being used by the USEPA to develop water-qua lity criteria for PAHs, as well as the thresholds that result, are equivalent to the development of water column thresholds of concern described in Part A of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and summarized below. The PAH threshold is 6 \u00b5g/L (ppb [parts per billion]) averaged over at le ast 4 days. For brief exposures, analogous to the CMC, the PAH threshold is 100 \u00b5g/L (Part A, Table A.3-5 of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). In evaluating potential impacts of MAHs to water quality, the lowest water standards were used to establish a threshold of concern to be conservative. Thus, the threshold of concern is 1 mg/L (ppm [parts per million]). The modeling of water column toxicity thresholds (described below and in Part A, Section A.3.4 of the technical report [Frenc h McCay et al., 2004]) indicates the threshold for the most sensitive species, given 4 days or more of exposure, is 0.4 mg/L. Water column recovery time is directly related to spill size. Modeling of potential contact areas and contaminant residence times for spills greater than 1 bbl was performed for marine water and marsh water environments (MMS, 1995). Spills were classified into Size 1 (8,000 m 2), Size 2 (80,000 m2), and Size 3 (1,000,000 m2) categories, depending on the area of either surface water or marsh that was affected. Deterioration of open-water quality is expected only during the time that the oil slicks remain on the surface of the water. It is expected that most slicks will dissipate within 10 days and that all oil sheen will be gone within 6 weeks. In a previous assessment of the potential duration of water-quality impacts after an oil spill, water column concentrations in open coastal waters were expected to reach background levels within 6 months to 2 years (MMS, 1995). However, marine water column contamination lasting this long has never been documented in any spill, even for the worst case U.S. sp ill documented to date for water column Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-12 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills & Response Options contamination\u2014the NORTH CAPE spill off Rhode Island in 1996. The modeling results described in Parts A through F of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) also indicate that these estimates are conservatively long. Water column concentrations in open coastal waters (i.e., not inclusive of shallow subtidal areas) would be expected to re ach background levels within days to weeks, even after large spills. Concentration impacts on coastal marsh waters are expected to result in disturbances significant enough to de grade water quality in localized areas adjacent to the oiled marsh for up to 10 years for Size 3 spills, up to 5 years for Size 2 spills, and up to 6 months for Si ze 1 spills. The areal extent of this contamination will decrease significantl y over these time periods and depends on proximity to oiled vegetation and sediments that were assumed to gradually release oil to the adjacent water column (MMS, 1995). 4.3.1.2. Air Quality Impacts of Oil Spills The effects of an oil spill on air quality may involve all volatile components of the oil. The MAHs, PAHs, and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) could evaporate into the air. Many of these compounds have the potential to affect human health and wildlife via air exposure. Criteria have been established to determine what concentrations of these chemicals in the air are harmful to human health. Table 4.3-3 lists regulatory thresholds for various chemicals and compounds. Oil spills are not a major source of air po llutants relative to other hydrocarbon sources (NRC, 2003). Except for the very la rgest spills, the presence of volatile compounds is localized and of short duration. Most evaporation occurs within the first 24 hours after a spill (see Appe ndix B) and mixing in the air rapidly reduces concentrations with distance from the slick (Scholz et al., 1999). Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Mechanical recovery removes oil from the water surface. As a result of the decreased amount of oil on the surfa ce, less oil will vol atize, causing lower concentrations of MAHs, PAHs, and VOCs in the air. Air quality impacts will be reduced by the amount of oil recovered. Relative to the evaporation from the oil slick, emissions from response vessels are a minor concern. Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion Dispersant application treats oil on the water surface by enhancing the formation of small droplets. As a result, volatilization could be reduced or slowed, depending on how long after the spill dispersant is applied. If dispersant application occurred very early in the sp ill, more volatile compounds would be present in the dispersed droplets. These volatiles would also eventually enter the atmosphere but would be dispersed over a wider area. This would result in lower concentrations of MAHs, PAHs, and VOCs in the air. Thus, air quality impacts will be reduced if oil is disperse d. Relative to the evaporation from the oil slick, emissions from vessels or aircraft that are applying dispersant are a minor concern. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-13 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills & Response Options Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning In situ burning of oil spills as a response option has been proposed and debated for more than 30 years but has achieved only limited acceptance in the oil spill response community. The prim ary obstacle to incorporating it as a cleanup option is the concern over atmospheric emissions, in particular combustion by-products. Analysis of emissions is difficult and only studied by a few investigators, but more than a decade of intensive laboratory testing in addition to improved technology has yielded an inventory of the key compounds produced during oil burning (Fingas et al., 2001; Thornborough, 1997). The following is a summary of Fingas et al. (2001), which includes extensive sampling data from over forty-five experimental burns in outdoor test tanks with various crude oils and diesel fuel. The experimental oil burns and emission measurement tests began in Mobile, Alab ama, in 1991, with several controlled burns designed to measure a series of physical parameters as well as emissions. Further tests were conducted in 1992, 1993, 1997, and 1998. The emphasis on sampling was at typical receptor heights for humans, usually 1 m. Sampling locations were typically placed at downwind stations, at upwind stations, and in the smoke plume. A full analysis of emissions from an oil burn entails measuring a number of components, in cluding the smoke plume, particulate matter precipitating from the smoke plume, combustion gases, unburned hydrocarbons, organic compounds produ ced during the burning process, and residue left at the burning pool site. Soot particles also have a variety of chemicals absorbed and adsorbed (Fingas et al., 2001). Fingas et al. (2001) identi fied ten substances of possible concern to human and environmental health: particulates, PA Hs, VOCs, dioxins and dibenzofurans, carbonyls, carbon dioxide, carbon mo noxide, sulphur dioxide, other gases (oxides of nitrogen), and \"hidden\" compounds. They summarized the measured concentration data from the mesoscale test burns for 150 specific compounds and also calculated safe distances from the burn site for these compounds for various burn sizes.

(2001) also draws on the results of the Newf oundland Offshore Burn Experiment (NOBE), conducted 42 km east of St. John's, Newfoundland (Fingas et al., 1995a, b), and the U.K. in situ burn trials conducted 40 km offshore Lowesoft (Thornborough, 1997). The NOBE project was, by far, the most extensive in situ burn field study ever conducted and examined two controlled spills of approximately 50 m3 of crude oil. Numerous vessels and aircraft were stationed throughout the 34-km2 area with equipment to sample the fire and smoke plume (Fingas et al., 1995 a, b). The U.K. burn experiment also studied two controlled spills in a 25-mi2 area, but the emphasis was on determining the operational practicalities of in situ burning as a cleanup option, with only peripheral emph asis on emission sampli ng (Thornborough, 1997). A summary of the emissions data from these studies is in Part A, Section A.5 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). All burns, particularly those of diesel fuel, produce a substantial amount of particulate matter. The PM-10 smoke particulate (less than 10 microns in diameter) is the combustion product most likely to be a health concern. Small particle sizes are less likely to settle out of a plume and may be carried much further from the burn site than larger particles. Analysis of smoke plumes shows that these small particles with diameters less than 10 m constitute 70 to 90 percent of all particulate matter created by in situ burning. In the analysis of the data from the Mobile, Alabama, tank experiments, Fingas et al. (2001) concluded that co ncentrations of particulates from diesel were four times that for similar-sized crude oil bu rns. Fingas et al. (1998) showed that concentrations at 1-m height resulting from diesel burns of a small burn area (~5 m 2) were above normal occupational health limits between 30 and 50 m downwind from the burn site. A typical contained fire would have an exceedence area 10 to 100 times this size. In analyzing the results of the NOBE project, which only involved crude oils, Fingas et al. (1995a, b) found that the pa rticulate levels were only a matter of concern very close to the fire and un der the plume. Fingas et al. (2001) determined that the concentration of particulates and other components of the smoke plume may not be a concern past 1,000 m downwind from the burn site for typical crude oil burns. They concluded that safe distances are at least 1 km for crude oil burns and much farther for diesel. Overall, more PAHs, which are produced by combustion, are destroyed by fires than are created by them. Burning crude oil yields particulates contaminated by PAHs downwind of the fire, but the conc entration on the particulate matter is often significantly (at least a factor of ten) smaller than the concentration in the initial oil. Based on the NOBE project, Fi ngas et al. (1995a, b) concluded that in situ crude oil fires do not produce significant amounts of PAHs. The PAHs in crude oils are largely destroyed in comb ustion (Fingas et al., 1995a, b). Burning diesel results in more pyrogenic PAHs of larger molecular sizes, which are created by the fire (Fingas et al., 2001). Ho wever, the net production of PAHs from burning would be less than those produced by evaporation. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-17 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options VOCs in emissions are in similar concentrations for crude and diesel burns. While not a primary concern, their concentrations can rise close to concern levels very near a fire. VOC concentrations are three times higher when the oil is just evaporating and not burning than when it is burning (Fingas et al., 2001). The NOBE study concluded that no exotic or highly toxic compounds are generated as a result of the combustion process, but that VOC concentrations are well above concern levels within 150 m of the fire (Fingas et al., 1995a, b). Measurement of dioxins and dibenzofurans indicated that they were not being produced by crude or diesel fires (Fingas et al., 2001). The NOBE study indicated that the concentrations were at background levels (Fingas et al., 1995a, b). Carbonyls from diesel fuel fi res are slightly higher than those produced from crude oil burns, but the low levels detected would not be a health concern (F ingas et al., 2001). Carbon dioxide is the end result of combustion. Levels near a burn can be 500 to 800 ppm, which are higher than norm al atmospheric levels of 300 ppm, but do not present a hazard to human health. Near a burn, carbon dioxide levels are highest at 1-m height and fall to backgr ound levels at 4 m (Fingas et al., 2001). During a burn, carbon monoxide levels are usually at or below the lowest detection level of the instruments and do not pose any hazard to humans. Carbon monoxide has only been detected du ring an inefficient burn (Fingas et al., 2001). Sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, its pr oduct formed by reaction with water, were not detected at significant levels (Fingas et al., 2001). In the NOBE study, emitted sulphur dioxide was found in an acid aerosol form (Fingas et al., 1995a, b). Attempts to measure oxides of nitrogen that might be the result of combustion were unsuccessful (Fingas et al., 1995a, b, 2001). A major concern regarding oil burning is the production of any \"hidden\" compounds that may not be typically expe cted but could still be hazardous. A \"total\" analysis of soot and residue samples identified several hundred compounds, but none were found to be of any environmental concern (Fingas et al., 2001). Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Thresholds of concern (Table 4.3-3) were compiled from several sources: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Heal th (NIOSH), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and USEPA. The NIOS H thresholds values are: immediate danger to life and health (IDLH) and the recommended exposure limit-time weighted average (REL-TWA). The IDLH values represent a level at which the concentration of the chemical is high enough to immediately cause danger to human health if exposed for 30 minutes. The REL-TWA is the recommended exposure limit for a time-weighted average of 10 hours. PEL-TWA is the permissible exposure limit-time weighted average for air contamination for 8 hours according to OSHA. TLV-TWA is the thres hold limit value-time weighted average for 8 hours according to the ACGIH. The ACGIH TLV-TWA is usually more restrictive than the OSHA PEL or NIOSH REL. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-18 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options The USEPA values are National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). NAAQS values are provided by the USEPA for several time periods, from 1-hr averages to annual means and as both primary and secondary standards. Primary standards set limits to protect public heal th, including the health of \"sensitive\" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards set limits to protect public welfare, including protection against decreased visibility, damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. The recovery time for air quality is very short, on the order of hours to a few days. Volatile chemicals are released as oil weathers for at most a few days, with most release occurring in the first 24 hours. The air quality would be affected over the period of time that volatization is occurring, plus the time necessary to dilute any concentrations of concern. For in situ burning of oil, air quality would be affected over the durati on of the burn. According to Fingas et al. (2001), the duration of the burn would be on the order of 1 to 2 hours. Thus, recovery time is on the order of hours to days. 4.3.2. Consequences to the Biological Environment 4.3.2.1. Marine Mammals Impacts of Oil Spills There are two major pathways of oil ex posure for marine ma mmals: (1) physical oiling of fur, skin, or mucous membranes; and (2) ingestion. Marine mammals such as seals, manatees, whales, and dolp hins are vulnerable to oil on the water surface since they spend considerable ti me at the surface swimming, breathing, feeding, and resting. This enhances the po ssibility of contact with a surface slick or water-in-oil emulsion. Certain species such as seals and sea otters are often found nearshore, which can increase their exposure. In species such as fur seals and sea otters, contact may lead to fouling of pelage (fur). This fouling of fur interferes with the animal's thermoregu lation and buoyancy. Oil has less of a tendency to adhere to the surface of smooth-skinned marine mammals with relatively little or no pelage, such as whales, dolphins, manatees, and some seals (Geraci and St. Aubin, 1990). Pinnipeds (true seals, sea lions, and fur seal s, and walruses) are very vulnerable to floating oil because they spend considerable time at the surface. Additionally, these animals are at risk when hauling out onto shorelines (Dyrynda and Symberlist, 1998). Marine mammals with fur thermoregu late by trapping air in the deeper layers of pelage. If the fur is fouled with spilled oil, the fur will allow the critical air and fur layer to collapse and it will no l onger perform its proper function. Fouled animals then run the risk of either hy po- or hyperthermia depending on their environment. Sea otters must maintain a layer of warm, dry air in their dense underfur to insulate against the cold; they are the marine mammals most sensitive to the effects of oil contamination. Even pa rtial fouling of 30 percent of an otter's body surface could result in death (Pierson, 2000a). Some marine mammals such as walruses, ha rbor seals, and sea lions rely on blubber to stay warm. Newborn pups are not yet pr otected by a layer of blubber and do not enter the water until a few days after birth. There is a concern that when a seal pup's protective fur coat becomes oiled there will be increased likelihood of death from hypothermia (USEPA, 2000). The air trapped in deeper layers of fur also aids in Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-19 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options natural buoyancy. Fouled animals will lose this buoyancy and could drown (Geraci and St. Aubin, 1990; Pierson, 2000a; USEPA, 2000). Risks for pinnipeds and other marine mammal s are not limited to the effect of oil on fur. The most sensitive tissues exposed to the environment are mucous membranes that surround the eyes and line the oral cavity, respiratory surfaces, and anal and urogenital orifices. Petrol eum hydrocarbons, particularly volatile aromatics and short-chain fractions, are irritating to these delicate tissues (Geraci and St. Aubin, 1990). The tissues around the eyes are especially susceptible to oil fouling. Experiments have shown that marine mammals can develop severe conjunctivitis within 24 hours of exposu re. They have been found to return to normal after being returned to clean water. However, continued exposure would most likely cause permanent damage. Pinnipeds, with their large protruding eyes, are especially vulnerable (Dyrynda USEPA, 2000). Risks to marine mammals also exist when they ingest oiled food. Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons has been implicated in the deaths of a number of stranded gray and harbor seals in the United States and abroad. Sea otters, which groom themselves regularly as a means of maintaining their insulating properties, may also ingest oil. Ingested hydrocarbons can irritate or destroy epithelial cells that line the stomach an d intestine, thereby affecting digestion and absorption of nutrients, and may also facilitate the direct movement of hydrocarbons to the bloodstream. Chronic ingestion of subtoxic quantities of petroleum may have subtle effects that would only become apparent through long-term monitoring. All pinnipeds examined to date have the enzyme systems necessary to convert absorbed hydrocarbons into polar metabolites that can be excreted in urine. However, some port ion of the nonpolar fractions will be deposited in the lipid-rich tissues, partic ularly blubber (Geraci and St. Aubin, 1990). Therefore, in addition to direct ingestion, marine mammals may be at risk when they feed on animals that have bioaccumulated hydrocarbons elsewhere (Dyrynda and Symberlist, 1998). Breathing high concentrations of hydrocarbon vapors can be toxic to all marine mammals. The vapors penetrate the epithelium of the respiratory tract and enter the bloodstream. Depending on the vapor concentrations present and the animal's immediate response to stress, exposures to these vapors may be fatal. A panic reaction may cause the animal to breathe rapidly, increasing the amount of vapors inhaled. Depending on the health of the animal, a sudden release of adrenaline may cause death (G eraci and St. Aubin, 1990). This risk is low except in very large spills, because evaporation is high only in the 12 to 24 hours immediately following the spill and the fumes are rapidly diluted. As discussed below, this risk is often difficult to separate from other routes of exposure. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-20 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options In 1989, during the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill in Alaska, many sea otters were exposed to oiled waters and were fouled. More than 1,000 dead sea otters were recovered, and anot her 350 oiled otters were rescued and taken to treatment centers for rehabilitation. Four critical factors were identified in the sea otter mortality during the spill in Al aska: (1) pulmonary emphysema, caused by the inhalation of toxic fumes, occurred primarily during the first 2 weeks of the spill; (2) low body temperature, or hy pothermia, was a direct result of oil contamination of the fur, which decrea sed insulation; (3) low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, was probably caused by poor gastrointestinal function because of ingestion of oil; and (4) lesions in other organs, including the liver, heart, spleen, kidney, and brain, were also probably caused by ingestion of oil and by stress. Oil spills can also affect sea otters, as well as other species, indirectly by reducing available food resources, eith er by killing prey organisms or making them unpalatable. Sea otter habitat can also be lost temporarily if kelp forest communities become contam inated (Pierson, 2000a). In pinnipeds, oiling can also occur when the animals are out of the water. If oil is stranded on beaches, it will adhere to sand particles and will grind into the fur and skin of these animals as they travel over the fouled surfaces. Where young are concerned, actions by the parent to clean the pups may affect survival more than the fouling alone. Additionally, if very young animals become oiled, the mother may not recognize the scent of its young and abandon it, leaving it little to no chance of survival (Gerac i and St. Aubin, 1990). Some of the risks discussed above for pi nnipeds also threaten cetaceans (whales and dolphins). Recent studies on the possible effects of oil on cetaceans have focused on the animals' ability to detect and avoid oil, behavioral effects, and physiological effects because of contact, inhalation, and ingestion of oil (Pierson, 2000b). Experiments have shown that dolphins can detect and will avoid a surface layer of oil. Baleen whales also appear to be capable of detecting oil. A field study (Pierson, 2000b) of the reactions of migrating gray whales to naturally occurring oil slicks from seep s in the Santa Barbara Channel recorded mainly subtle and short-term responses including changes in direction to avoid surface oil. During the oil spill in the Santa Barbara Channel (which began in January 1969), gray whales were beginnin g to arrive in the channel on their northward migration. By April, as much as 70,000 bbl of oil had been released, and as much as 800 mi 2 of water surface may have been contaminated, although the concentrations were highly variable and there were many areas of sheen and marine water where the animals could surface. Gray whales were observed moving northward through the area of the slick during this period. Although six dead gray whales were recovered from the area during the 2 months following the spill, no link was established betwee n oil contamination and mortality, and no effects on the gray whale population or migration were observed (Pierson, 2000b). Studies have shown that cetacean skin is nearly impenetrable to even the highly volatile constituents of oil. This indicates that contact with oil probably would be less harmful to cetaceans than prev iously believed. However, the toxic, volatile fractions in fresh crude oils could irritate and damage cetacean soft tissues, such as the mucous membranes of the eyes and airways. The effects could lead to death in extreme cases. A cetacean unable to leave the area during Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-21 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options the first few hours after a spill, when vapor concentrations are still high, would inhale vapors and might be harmed. The extent of injury would depend on the health of the animal and its response to stress (Geraci and St. Aubin, 1990; Pierson, 2000a). The preferred habitat of a species will influence the probability that it will encounter oil. The frequency of exposure is higher in species that frequent restricted areas such as bays and estuaries, where surface oil may be concentrated, and in developed areas, where spills may be more frequent. Examples are breeding and feeding humpback, gray, right, bowhead, and beluga whales; por poises; and river dolphins. Cetaceans that range widely may contact some oil as they move quickly through a fouled area but are unlikely to be exposed for any extended period. After a spill, oil is distributed primarily at the surface. Consequently, cetaceans that feed in these areas are more likely to contact oil than those that feed in the water column. These include skim-fee ding right and bowhead whales and surface-lunging rorquals. Dolphins that habitually force schools of prey to the surface may also be at risk (Geraci and St. Aubin, 1990). Oil could also adhere to the fringed baleen plates that baleen whales use to filter their food, blocking the flow of water and interfering with feeding. A study of the fouling effects of oil on samples of the baleen plates from several species, including bowhead and gray whales, concluded that a spill of heavy oil or residual patches of weathered oil could foul the plates enough to interfere with feeding efficiency of surface skimming species for several days, and that such effects could be cumulative in heavily fouled areas like the center of a spill or in a contaminated bay (Pierson, 2000b). There was no evidence that the damage would be permanent. Gray whales, which are mainly bottom feeders unlike most baleen whales, could ingest oil-contaminated bo ttom sediments. However, mo st of this risk would occur on the species' feeding grounds and is unlikely to be important because of the low probability of encountering areas of high contamination. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Operation of mechanical recovery equipment and vessels is not expected to result in increased risk since unoiled ma rine mammals would have no difficulty avoiding slow moving response vessels or towed boom. In addition, ACPs address ways to minimize impacts, and concentrations of marine mammals are avoided unless they are already at significant risk from the oil. Overall, mechanical recovery effo rts will reduce the risk posed to marine mammals because oil is removed from the water. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-22 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion Furred marine mammals rely on their dense fur layers for thermoregulation. A critical component of this fur layer is the animal's own oil which is excreted through the skin and worked into the fur to create a strong and virtually water\u00ad tight barrier between the outer fur layers and the inner thermoregulating layer. If these animals encounter dispersants, th e dispersants can work into the fur of the animals and remove its natural oils. As was the case for floating oil, thermoregulation then b ecomes a serious issue. Marine mammals may be affected by dispersants and disperse d oil in different ways. Baleen whales run the greatest risk of ingesting dispersants or dispersed oil. While there has been no experimentation on the effects of dispersed oils and dispersants on baleen plates, it is possib le that either might reduce their overall efficiency, although the effect should be less than with untreated oil. Moderate toxic effects might be experienced, but it is unlikely that expo sures would be high enough to exceed critical thresholds except possibly for very large spills (Dyrynda USEPA, 2000). The primary benefit for marine mammals of dispersing oil is that it lessens the risk of contact with floating or stranded oil in areas where they may feed or congregate, whether on land or in water. There is some concern about the potential for furred marine mammals contacting dispersed oil droplets if they were to dive through a plume of dispersed oil. However, the window of exposure for this would be of very limited duration, given rapid dilution within the water column. In comparison, floating oil may be present for weeks, stranded oil for years, and dispersed oil for hours, so the risk from the dispersed oil plume is very low, even if encountered by an animal not already exposed to floating oil. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning Since an in situ burn would not be initiated with the presence of marine mammals within the burn perimeter, and mammals will avoid areas where burning is already in progress, the risk to marine mammals during in situ burning would be very limited. Burn residues, whether submerged or on the surface, might be ingested by feeding marine mammals, but given the small volume and the fact that as much residue as possible is recovered, this risk is very low. Based on the chemical and physical properties of the residue, burn residues should be less toxic to marine mammals than untreated oil. The other consideration for in situ burning is the smoke component of the burn. However, since the smoke from the burn will tend to rise into the atmosphere and occurs for only a limited time, it should not pose a risk to these animals. Because in situ burning is unlikely to remove more than a fraction of the floating oil, the overall risks are very similar to those for floating oil. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns The threshold of concern depends on the type of mammal under consideration. Whales and dolphins are at very low risk because they tend to avoid oil and are not sensitive to low levels of dermal contamination. Furred marine mammals are very sensitive to contact with even lim ited amounts of oil; their contact with even thin slicks (0.25 to 1 \u00b5m) could represent a risk. Shoreline oiling also poses Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-23 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options a significant route of exposure; oiling of even a small portion of the body can have severe impacts. Recovery times for marine mammal populations vary from several years to potentially ten or more, depending on the species. The concern is greatest with animals that mature slowly and have a low reproductive potential. Cetaceans in general mature slowly and only reproduce every few years. A primary example of such an animal would be the humpback wh ale, which reaches sexual maturity at 6 to 8 years of age. Females typically only bear a calf every 2 to 3 years. There are also certain pinnipeds, such as the Califo rnia sea lion, that do not reach sexual maturity until 4 or 5 years of age an d only bear a sing le pup each year. 4.3.2.2. Marine and Coastal Birds Impacts of Oil Spills Marine and coastal birds are highly susceptible to the acutely toxic effects of exposure to floating oil. Large losses of birds have been documented following oil spills worldwide (Burger, 1993; Day et al., 1995; Kajigaya and Oka, 1999; Oka et al., 1999). Following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill, substantial numbers of dead oiled birds, particularly alcids (e.g., murres) and sea ducks, were recovered onshore Piatt and Lensink, 1989; Piatt et al., 1990); and significant declines for some marine birds were documented in oiled versus unoiled areas within the first year after the spill (Day et al., 1995, 1997a, b; Irons et al., 2000; Klosiewski and Laing, 1994). The two major pathways of oil exposure fo r birds are ingestion and oiling of the feathers (NRC, 1989). Birds may ingest oil directly from the water, through consumption of oiled prey, or from preenin g the feathers. Effects of oil ingestion may include Heinz-body hemolytic an emia; impaired osmoregulation; decreased growth; decrease d production and viability of eggs; and abnormal conditions in the lungs, adrenals , liver, nasal salt gland, and fat and muscle tissues (Fry and Addiego, 1987; NRC, 1985; RPI International, 1988). All these complex biological reactions to oil ingestion result in three categories of toxic effects: (1) reduction in reproduction, (2) destruction of red blood cells and varying degrees of anemia, and (3) increased stress that leads to an increased susceptibility to disease. All these categories affect th e health and survival of exposed birds. Certain marine-associated raptors are at ri sk of oil ingestion via oiled prey; bald eagles will scavenge oiled dead animals, and peregrine falcons will prey on oiled and debilitated birds (Bowman et al., 1995). When birds become oiled by contact with fl oating slicks, their feathers lose their water-repellent characteristics, which may cause the birds to lose their buoyancy and/or become hypothermic because of the reduced insulation provided by their plumage (Fry and Lowenstine, 1985; Wien s, 1995). These losses may impair the ability of oiled birds to dive and fly, making feeding difficult, and increasing energetic demands on the stressed birds often leads to death (Wiens, 1995). Death by hypothermia, drowning, and starvation are all potential impacts of direct oiling (RPI International, 1988). Nesting birds may transfer oil from their feathers directly to their eggs during incubation, potentially affecting embryo development and reducing overall reproductive success (Wiens, 1995). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-24 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Behavior, ecology, and life history may af fect the likelihood that birds will be exposed to oil, and to what extent th e population will be affected by a spill. Birds that raft and feed on the water surface or feed by diving (e.g., pelicans, cormorants, terns, auks, penguins, seabirds, sea ducks, loons, diving ducks) may be at the greatest risk of exposure, because they spend all or most of their time on the water, or potentially passing thro ugh the oil-water interface (Hunt, 1987). Also, large aggregations of birds may feed in confined areas due to proximity to nesting habitats or a preferred food supply, therefore putting them at risk if those areas become oiled (Wiens, 1995). Some species, such as seabirds and loons, tend to be long lived and exhibit delayed maturation and/or breeding, low rates of reproduction, high chick mortality, and natural episodic reproductive failures (Wie ns, 1995). These types of species may be at greater risk of population- or community-level impacts compared with other species, such as gulls and dabbling ducks, which are shorter lived with higher reproduction rates (RPI International, 1988). In addition to acute impacts often experien ced during direct contact with floating oil, marine and coastal birds may also exhibit sublethal and/or chronic (long\u00ad term) effects of exposure to oil stranded on the shoreline, or in sheltered habitats, via direct contact with oil residues and ingestion of oil during feeding. Numerous studies were conducted rega rding indirect, chronic, or delayed impacts on marine and coastal birds following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (summarized in Peterson, 2001). Black oy stercatchers, harlequin ducks, and Barrow's goldeneyes, all of which feed on benthic invertebrates, were documented as having declined signific antly in oiled areas and did not show signs of recovery for several years (D ay et al., 1995, 1997a; Esler et al., 2000; Holland-Bartels 1994; Rosenberg, 1999; Rosenberg and Petrul a, 1998). The sea ducks also showed evidence of an enzyme that is used for metabolizing petroleum hydrocarbons (Trust et al., 2000). Multiyear declines in several other marine and coastal species, including cormorants, black-legg ed kittiwake, murres, pigeon guillemot, mergansers, and loons, may be due to the indirect effects of oil exposure to important species of forage fish that may have declined following the spill, indicating that food chain impacts are also likely, even well after the initial floating oil slicks are no longer presen t (Day et al., 1995, 1997a; Irons et al., 2000; Klosiewski and Laing, 1994; Murphy et al., 1997). Also, some of the impacts associated with oil ingestion mentioned above, such as Heinz-body hemolytic anemia, may persist long after birds appear to have \"recovered\" from the initial exposure to o il (Fry and Addiego, 1987). Birds that survive initial oil exposure or that avoid initial exposure, but continue to feed and/or nest in oiled areas, often experience reduced reproductive success. Following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill, several studies documented that black oystercatchers that ate and fed their young oiled mussels, and/or nested on oiled shorelines, had lower numbers of breeding pairs, produced smaller and fewer eggs, and experienced decreased chick growth and higher chick mortality than oystercatchers that fed and nested in unoiled areas (Andres, 1996, 1997; Sharp et al., 1996). Harlequin ducks did not appear to breed successfully in oiled areas either, although this may be due more to human disturbance during cleanup than to physiological or habitat impacts Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-25 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options (Patten, 1993; Wiens, 1995). Brown pelicans that were oiled and rehabilitated following two Southern California Bight spills experienced lower survival than control pelicans and showed no signs of breeding, in contrast to actively breeding control pelicans (Anderson et al., 1996). Eppley and Rubega (1990) reported \"complete reproductive failure\" in a population of South Polar skuas following the BAHIA PARAISO spill, and suggested that the exposure of nesting adults to oil resulted in changes in their parental behavior, including the neglect of chicks that were ultimately killed by neighboring adults. In another study, nest abandonment by oiled birds was documented for Cassin's auklets and we dge-tailed shearwaters, as well as delayed and lowered egg production, low hatching success, and complete reproductive failure in some cases (Fry, 1987). Yet, despite all of the data supporting the premise that the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill caused acute and chronic impacts on bi rds, conflicting data exist, and several authors concluded that population- an d community-level impacts were not apparent following the spill, that many populations affected early on appeared to have recovered within a relatively short period of time, and that impacts were inconsistent among species in the same guild (a group of species with similar feeding patterns) (Boersma et al., 1995; Day et al., 1995; Erikson, Wiens, 1995; Wiens et al., 1996). It is clearly documented, however, that ma rine and coastal birds are very susceptible to both acute and chronic exposures to oil, and the risk is greatest where large numbers of birds concentrate for breeding, migration, or overwintering. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Impacts on birds associated with the mechanical recovery of oil are most likely limited to disturbance of feeding, rafting, or breeding behaviors. Some species of birds are very sensitive to even minor human disturbances (e.g., bald eagles and harlequin ducks). If these sensitiv e species also have high nesting and/or feeding site fidelity because of limited nesting habitats or prey abundance, or if large aggregations of breed ing birds occur in the spill area, impacts are possible from the operation of recovery e quipment (Kuletz, 1993; Wiens, 1995). Mechanical recovery will no t significantly reduce the potential impacts on birds because it has limited efficiency (10 to 15 percent removal of total oil volume; 75 to 90 percent recovery within the boom). Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion If used in pre-authorization agreement areas, dispersant application would reduce surface oil and reduce shoreline o iling, thereby reducing exposure. The guidance in ACPs for dispersant applicati on during spills usually specifies that areas with large numbers of birds be avoided because of the concern that the dispersants could be toxic to birds, an d to avoid possible noise impacts and to help minimize the possibility of bird strikes. It is possible for marine birds to be exposed to dispersed oil via direct spra ying of the dispersant onto the birds during application to the oil slick, fouling of the feathers with dispersed oil droplets, and ingestion of dispersed oil. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-26 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Chemical dispersants may affect the wate r-repellency and insulating capacity of feathers, as well as the structural integrity of external membranes and surfaces; therefore, the direct spraying of rafting (large groups resting on the surface) birds should be avoided during applic ation (NRC, 1989). Peakall et al. (1987) reviewed the available literature and found little difference between the toxicity of oil alone and the toxicity of dispersant s or dispersed oil. Lambert et al. (1982) did not find significant differences in the metabolic rates of mallards that were exposed to dispersants versus control mallards (external dosing), although both oil and the oil-dispersant mixture did produce significant metabolic changes, with the mixture producing greater changes. Crude oil, dispersant alone, and oil- dispersant mixtures all reduced hatc hing success when mallard eggs were externally exposed to the different tre atments (Albers, 1979; Albers and Gay, 1982). Weight gain in mallards and herring gulls exposed to crude oil and oil- dispersant mixtures through their diets or applied externally has also been studied, and no differences were found (E astin and Rattner, 1982; Peakall et al., 1982). Butler et al. (1982) found that Leac h's storm-petrels were more likely to abandon their nests, and their young were more likely to have lower survival and decreased weight gain, when adults were applied externally with high doses of a crude oil-dispersant mixture than when adults were exposed to external oiling alone. Decreases in hatchability between the two treatments (applied both internally and externally) were the same. Another factor of concern regarding dispersants and seabirds is that the area of the slick on the water surface tends to increa se temporarily following dispersant use prior to the slick's breaking up (Lichtenth aler and Daling, 1985). Therefore, rafting birds in the area may briefly be more at risk following dispersant application, although the amount of oil exposure per in dividual will be smaller (Peakall et al., 1987). Diving birds, such as pelicans, co rmorants, terns, auks , penguins, seabirds, and sea ducks, may also be at an increase d, but brief, exposur e risk if they are feeding in the area while the oil is dispersing into the water column and is still present as large slicks on the surface that they may pass through (Peakall et al., 1987). There appears to be a negligible ri sk of birds becoming oiled by dispersed droplets under the water while diving because of the decrease in \"stickiness\" of the oil once it has been dispersed (Peakall et al., 1987). Aside from the above-cited studies, ther e is little evidence of birds being more heavily affected by dispersants or oil-dispersant mixtures than by oil alone (Peakall et al., 1987); therefore, exposure to the floating oil on the surface seems to be of greater risk to birds than exposure to chemically dispersed oil. Dispersant use shortens the amount of time that floating oil is on the water surface and lessens the possibility that it will reach the shoreline, where severe impacts on birds that utilize shoreline habitats are likely to occur, and may continue to occur if shoreline oiling becomes a chronic source of exposure. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-27 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning The main concerns associated with in situ burning of floating oil and birds are that species of concern will be consumed by flames or exposed to the smoke, and that birds will be exposed to toxic burn residues. Because the oil is contained within a boom prior to ignition, as long as birds are at a reasonably safe distance from oil, flames, and smoke, there is little concern that they would be directly affected by open-water in situ burning (Allen and Ferek, 1993). No studies have been done on bird expo sure to smoke and fumes, so detailed information on possible impacts is not available. If smoke and fumes do reach birds on the shoreline or in the water, th ey may choose to leave the area; then it is possible that important breeding or feeding behaviors may be disrupted, resulting in indirect impacts. Since the burning would be a short-term activity, these impacts should be temporary. Exposure to toxic residues on the water surface, especially the taffy-like floating residue that remains following the burn , may be a concern to birds as well (Allen and Ferek, 1993). In situ burning of contained oil is highly efficient and the percent removal of collected oil has been documented to range from 75 to 99 percent; therefore, only a relatively small amount of taffy-like floating residue will likely remain (Allen and Ferek, 1993; Campbell et al., 1994). These residues are typically collected and removed during manual cleanup following the burn (Allen and Ferek, 1993). Therefore, even if some risk would be associated with birds coming in contact with post-burn residues, the amount of oil residue that remains following the burn may be low enough to sufficiently decrease the likelihood of exposure. There does not ap pear to be any evidence that burn residues are more toxic to wildlife or aquatic resources than floating oil (Daykin et al., 1994). Yet because the total efficiency of in situ burning is limited to the amount of oil that can be contained in booms prior to ignition (~10 to 15 percent of total oil volume), many of the concerns associated with birds that contact floating oil would still be relevant. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Information on thresholds of oiling th at would cause impacts on birds is limited. Varoujean et al. (1 983) considered a 0.1-g/m 2 (0.25-m) oil slick to be too thin to cause acute mortality to birds resting on or swimming through it, while they considered a 1-g/m2 (0.8-m) slick to be 100 percent lethal. This is in contrast to other authors who did not consider slicks less than 1 m to be harmful to seabirds (NRC, 1985; Peakall et al., 1985). Doses ranging from 20 to 70 ml of crude oil have been found to have metabolic effects on ducks, while doses of 200 to 500 ml have been obse rved to cause sign ificant and lethal effects in ducks (French et al., 1996; Jenssen and Ekker, 1991). Recovery time periods for birds followin g an oil spill undoubtedly vary because of oiling conditions, time of year, abundance of birds, and several other factors. In general, based on multiple surveys, most populations, including murres that suffered high initial casualties and marb led murrelets, were considered to be \"recovered\" between and 1.5 and 2.5 years following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Boersma et al., 1995; Erikson, 1995; Kuletz, 1993; Wiens, 1995). for Oil 4-28 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options horned and red-necked grebe, mew gulls, and loons were much longer, and perhaps ranged from 3 to 9 years (Esler et al., 2000; Holland-Bartels et 1998; Sharp et al., 1996; Trust et al., 2000). Pelicans that were oiled and reha bilitated did not appear to recover enough to regain normal breeding capaci ty even after 3 years (Anderson et al., 1996). Recovery time for some species following spills may be irrelevant, as significant impacts may not have occurred at the population level (Day et al., 1995; Wiens, 1995). 4.3.2.3. Plankton and Fish Impacts of Oil Spills The toxic effects of oil spills on pl ankton and fish result from acute exposures\u2014during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floating oil or oil on the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapidly disperse to background levels, which usually are below thresholds of concern. Water column organisms near the water surface and floating oil are most vulnerable to oil exposure, particularly those in the surface nephloid layer (the microlayer at the water surface). A number of planktonic organisms and early life stages of other organisms concentr ate in the surface nephloid layer. In addition, organisms in shallow subtidal areas and the intertidal zone may be exposed to hydrocarbons dissolved or resuspended from stranded oil or oil contaminated sediments. As dilution in these areas is much slower than for deeper waters, concentrations remain higher for longer periods of time, exposing plankton, fish, and benthic organisms to potentially toxic levels. Greater effects may occur if the spill occu rs in or migrates to nearshore areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands. In such confined or low- energy water bodies, the spilled oil is lik ely to be less dispersed and be more concentrated because of the decreased water depth. As discussed above, the 1996 NORTH CAPE oil spill resulted in high concentrations of the toxic components (PAHs) remaining for weeks after the spill, which caused a large impact to water column and benthic communities (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]; French McCay, 2003). There are three potential pathways of exposure for water column organisms to oil hydrocarbons: (1) dissolve d hydrocarbons, (2) particulate oil (entrained oil droplets from either natural or chemical di spersion), and (3) via the food web. Of these, exposure to dissolved components is the most significant (French et al., 1996; French McCay, 2002), as dissolved hy drocarbons may be taken up directly through the surface (or skin), through the gills, and via the gut (by water intake). Fine particulate oil may be ingested by filter feeders, of which there are many examples among plankton (e.g., copepods, amphipods, ciliates) and fish (e.g., herrings). Contaminated organisms may, in turn, be ingested by larger plankton and fish, resulting in effects on these organi sms. In addition, prey affected directly by a spill may become unavailable to the food web, affecting their predators (French and French, 1989; French et al., 1996; NRC, 1985, 2003). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-29 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options The most toxic components of oil to water column and benthic organisms are lower molecular-weight compounds, whic h are both volatile and soluble in water, especially the aromatic compounds, the MAHs and the PAHs (Anderson et al., 1987; French et al., 1996; French McCay, 2002). Descriptions of typical MAHs and PAHs, their toxicity, and conc entrations in the crude oils modeled as part of this study are in the Sections A-2.1, B-I.3, C-I.3, D-I.3, E-I.3, and F-I.3 of the technical report (French Mc Cay et al., 2004). A brief summary of their fates and effects on plankton and fish is presented here. It is important to note that the effects of MAHs and PAHs on plankton and fish are additive (DiToro French et al., 1996; French McCay, 2002; Swartz et al., 1995). Because exposure to these compounds in water can occur for periods of a few days to weeks, the LC50 is the appropriate toxicity parameter for evaluation of effects. French McCay (2002) provides LC50s for the mixture of MAHs and PAHs originating from spilled oil. The BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) of the MAHs are very soluble in water, so ex posure concentrations in water can be high. However, BTEX are relatively low in toxicity (compared with other soluble compounds in oil) and evaporate quickly. Thus, the BTEX rapidly volatilize, reducing exposure concentrations and the time of exposure to toxic levels. For these reasons, the impact of BTEX after a spill is typically low and of very short duration (French McCay, 2002). PAHs and many of the larger MAHs are less soluble than BTEX, but do dissolve in significant quantities into the water, thus becoming bioavailable. Because they are much more toxic than BTEX, PAHs and larger MAHs can have significant impacts on aquatic organisms (French McCay, 2002). In a typical crude or fuel oil spill (the only types considered suitable for dispersant use), the PAHs cause most of the toxicity to water column comm unities. The LC50 for a mixture of oil PAHs is about 50 parts per billion (ppb) for the average species. For sensitive species (2.5th percentile of a Gaussian-shaped distribution with the mean at 50 ppb), LC50 for total PAHs is about 5 ppb. For insensitive species (97.5th percentile), LC50 for total PAHs is about 400 ppb (French McCay, 2002). Toxicity increases with duration of ex posure; LC50 values decrease as exposure time increases (Anderson et al., 1987; French, 1991; French and French, 1989; et al., 198 9, 1992; Sprague, 1969). This is due to the accumulation of toxicant over time up to a critical tissue concentration that causes significant effects or mortality. Since after an oil spill concentrations decrease rapidly on a scale of hours to days, duration of exposure needs to be considered in evaluating toxicity, part icularly for the PAHs , which accumulate more slowly in tissues (French McCay, 2002). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-30 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options The LC50s listed above are for long exposure durations of at least 4 days or a week. If exposure is shorter, as is typical in most oil spills, the LC50s are much higher and toxicity much lower, by an order of magnitude or more for a few hours of exposure (100 ppb for 6 hours of exposure to PAHs; see Part A, Table A.3-5 of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). As an index of this effect of exposure duration, an exposure dose may be calculated by considering both concentration and exposure durati on (i.e., ppb-hours). For PAHs from crude and fuel oils, the LC50s for sensitive, average, and insensitive species at 96 hours or more may be translated to equiva lent exposure dose by multiplying by a factor of 100: 500 ppb-hours for sensit ive species, 5,000 ppb-hours for average species, and 40,000 ppb-hours for insensitive species. There is also a potential for naturally or ch emically dispersed oil droplets (particulate oil) to adversely impact filter-feeding or ganisms in the water column, either by mechanical interference or via dissolution of hydrocarbons from ingested droplets (NRC, 1985). However, existing studies examining this potential have not documented adverse effects from (naturall y or chemically) dispersed oil, and no quantitative data are available to estimate th e magnitude of this impact. As the larger oil droplets would resurface rapidly, while the smaller droplets (less than 70 microns in diameter) would remain dispersed (Delvigne and Sweeney, 1988), the small particles are those of most concern for filter-feeders. Once weathered, the toxicity of the particulates related to the soluble compounds would be lower, and, if exposure is relatively short (hours to days) via external surfaces or the gut of the organisms such that higher molecular weig ht PAHs would not be assimilated into the organism's tissues, the effects would be more mechanical than toxic . Bioaccumulation of oil hydrocarbons is primarily via direct uptake from the water, either directly or through the gills. Hydrocarbons may also accumulate from contaminated food and particulate matter that have been ingested. Predators can consume hydrocarbons accumulated in tiss ues of organisms. However, plankton and fish have mechanisms to eliminat e MAHs and PAHs from their bodies; therefore, these compounds do not biomagnify up the food web (Call et al., 1985; Giesy Graney, 1989; Gobas, 1989; McCarty, Mackay, 1993). The most important exposure ro ute to and effects on water column communities are via direct exposure to dissolved, and possibly particulate, oil. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery No additional adverse impacts on wate r column communities are expected to occur from mechanical recovery because most organisms can easily avoid the equipment and near surface plankton in the vicinity have already been affected by the oil. Water column impacts will be reduced by the additional amount of oil recovered. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-31 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion In the open ocean or areas where there is sufficient tidal flow, dispersant application would treat surface oil and pr event shoreline oiling, thereby reducing exposure. The proposed regulations apply only to waters where pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are generall y demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore6. Dispersant application is not likely in coastal waters given the extremely low application rates and rapid dilution; therefore, no impacts on coastal water column commun ities related to dispersant use are expected in those areas (see Appendix G). Coastal water column communities will most likely benefit from disp ersant use in pre-authorization agreement areas, as the volume of oil that subseque ntly migrates to the nearshor e areas will be reduced by the amount dispersed in marine waters. In the offshore areas where dispersants are used, water column concentrations of dissolved hydrocarbons and particulate oil would increase. However, most of the soluble components will evaporate fr om surface-floating oil during the hours prior to the application of dispersant, and dissolution of these components from dispersed oil that has already weathered is likely to be very limited (French McCay and Payne, 2001). Modern dispersants are much less toxic than the oils they disperse. Since the toxicities are additive and dispersed oil droplets are primarily oil, not dispersant, the increase in toxicity is negligible. Th is conclusion is supported by NRC (1989), which states, \"Laboratory bioassays at me asured concentrations show that the toxic effects per unit of dispersed oil are usually the same for chemically dispersed oil as those for physically dispersed oil\" (p. 255). This issue was also examined by NRC (2005), which states that \"there is no compelling evidence that the toxicity of chemically dispersed oil is enhanc ed over physically dispersed oil if comparisons are based on measured conc entrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in the water column\" (p. 229). The separate issue of dispersant toxicity alone has been well researched, and the results are presented in Appendix G. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning Open-ocean in situ burning of spilled oil will create relatively small amounts of burn residue and leave a percentage of the oil spill unburned. Even if the residue were to sink, which can occur, only larger fish would be capable of ingesting the residue. The amount produced would be very small and the risk minimal. The potential impacts from any remaining unburn ed oil will be the same as discussed above, but will be reduced by th e amount of oil that is burned. 6 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-32 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Physical properties and fates of burn re sidues were discussed in Water Quality section (Section 4.3.1.1). Environment Canada coordinated a series of studies to determine whether in situ burning caused water column toxicity beyond that attributable to allowing the slick to remain on the surface of the water. Results from laboratory and field studies indicated that, although toxicity increased in water samples collected beneath oil bu rning on water, this increase was generally no greater than that caused by the presence of an unburned oil slick on water. Bioassays with water from laboratory- and field-generated burn residues of Alberta Sweet Mix Blend show ed little or no acute toxicity to sand dollars (sperm cell fertilization, larvae, and cytogenetics), oyster larvae, and inland silversides (Daykin et al., 1994). Bi oassays using burn residues from the Newfoundland in situ burn field study showed no acute aquatic toxicity to fish (rainbow trout and three-spine stickl eback) and sea urchin fertilization (Blenkinsopp et al., 1997). Bioassays usin g laboratory-generated Bass Strait crude burn residue showed no acute toxicity to amphipods and very low sublethal toxicity (burying behavior) to marine snails (Gulec and Holdway, 1999). Chemical analyses performed along wi th the biological tests reflected low hydrocarbon levels in the water samples. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Thresholds of concern to plankton and fish would be those concentrations causing acute toxic effects on the most sensitive species in the water column community. For crude and medium-to-heav y fuel oils (including No. 2 fuel), exposure to dissolved PAHs would cause th e most effects. Based on the toxicity data, a reasonable threshold for effects on sensitive species would be 5 ppb for at least 4 days of exposure, or 100 ppb for sh ort-term (6-hr) expo sures. Expressed as an exposure dose, this threshold would be 500 ppb-hours (Part A, Section A.3.4 of the technical report [French McCay et al, 2004]; French McCay, 2002). Thresholds of concern for particulate oil are not available. However, bioassays with filter-feeding organisms exposed to whole oil indicate that 1 mg/L (ppm) or higher is needed for an observab le effect (NRC, 1985) . Thus, 1 ppm is assumed as a threshold of concern. As described for water qua lity, nearshore water contamination is expected during the time that the oil slicks remain on the surface of the water. It is expected that most slicks will dissipate wi thin 10 days and that all oil sheen will be gone within 6 weeks. Concentration impacts on coastal marsh waters are expected to result in disturbances sign ificant enough to degrade water column quality in localized areas of the contacted marsh for up to 10 years, depending on the degree of contamination (MMS, 1995). This could pose a localized risk to plankton and fish. Affected water column communities will recover at time scales related to their life spans. Even in spills where water column impacts are large (e.g., NORTH CAPE oil spill as discussed in the technica l report [French Mc Cay et al., 2004] and French McCay, 2003), impact s would not normal ly be large enou gh to affect future reproduction and recruitment for the populations as a whole. The numbers of marine organisms affected would usually be relatively small portions of the total populations, and it is reasonable to assume that those populations would produce more than sufficient eggs to replace the population in the next Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-33 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options generation. Thus, it is assumed that density-dependent compensation for lost reproduction would occur naturally. Given the evolutionary strategy of the fish and invertebrate species involved, this is considered a reasonable assumption, as was made by government trustees in developing the restoration plan for the NORTH CAPE spill (NOAA et al., 1999). Impact would be limited to the normal life span of the affected (killed) individuals. For phytoplankton and zooplankton, the time scale would be days to months. For most small forage fish and invertebrates, the time scale for recovery would be about 1 year. For longer-lived fish and invertebrates, the recovery period would be on the order of about 5 years. Geographically restricted or rare species, if affected, might take longer to recover; however, the general trends among organism groups would still hold such that longer-lived species would take longer to recover. Many commercially valuable species are fished very efficiently once the individu al matures and before age 5 or so, such that the population is highly skewed to smaller younger age classes. This artificially shortens the reproductive life span. All of these estimates of recovery time are based on the assumption that the impact to the water column is significant. If the impact were very small, the changes in the populations would not be measurable or significant within natural variability by location and over time. 4.3.2.4. Intertidal Habitats Impacts of Oil Spills The sensitivity of intertidal (coastal) habitats to spilled oil and the processes affecting oil fate and behavior on shorelines have been embodied in the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) (Hayes et al., 1980). The ESI is a ranking scheme, on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) that incorporates the relative exposure to wave and tidal energy, shoreline slope, substrate type, and biological productivity and sensitivity (Halls et al., 1997). The ESI has been the cornerstone of oil spill planning and respons e; therefore, it will be used as the basis for discussing the general impacts of oil on intertidal habitats. Shoreline habitats will be grouped into the fo llowing three categories: (1) exposed habitats, (2) sedimentary beaches, and (3) sheltered habitats. For all intertidal habitats, the primary pathway of exposure is the physical stranding and adherence of a floating oil slick on the intertidal zone. The stranded oil becomes a source of dissolved hydrocarbons that can contaminate nearshore water (see Section 4.3.1.l). Within a shoreline type , impacts are generally proportional to the amount of oil stranded. Impacts are also greater where the oil penetrates permeable substrates and persists in sheltered habitats. Exposed shoreline habitats include expos ed rocky shores, wave-cut platforms, erosional cliffs in clay, and exposed seawalls, and they are ranked as 1 -2 on the ESI scale. In such exposed areas, oil is generally held offshore by wave reflection, and any oil that is deposited is rapidly removed by wave action. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-34 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Sedimentary beaches range in grain size from sand to gravel, and they are ranked 3 (for sand) to 6 (for gravel) on the ESI scale. The grain size controls several important factors co ntrolling oil behavior on be aches, such as the degree of penetration into the sediments, the potential for burial by clean sediment, and the rate of natural sediment reworking. On sand beaches, oil penetration is limited to between 5 and 25 cm, and the risk of rapid burial increases with grain size. However, these beaches are the easiest to clean, and cleanup can be very effective. Sand beaches are important feeding habitats for shorebirds and nearshore fish, and declines in infauna (organisms that live in the sediments) can affect those species that prey on them. Gravel beaches (ESI 6) vary widely in their grain size and degree of exposure to wave energy. Stranded oil will penetrate d eeply into gravel beaches, up to 1 m, depending on the grain size and sorting (amount of finer-grained gravel and sand in between the larger gravel). The depth of routine sediment disturbance by waves will control the long-term persis tence; in semisheltered locations such as Puget Sound and Prince William Sound, oil can persist for more than 10 years (Hayes and Michel, 1999). Buried oil in gravel beaches also weathers more slowly (Michel and Hayes, 1999), thus posing continued risks of uptake by intertidal organisms and continued exposure to animals that feed on them such as oystercatchers (Andre s, 1997). Cleanup options ar e less effective than on sand beaches, and there can be significant additional impacts on intertidal communities resulting from cleanup efforts (Driskell et al., 1996). Sheltered habitats include tidal flats (ESI 7), sheltered rocky shores (ESI 8), and wetlands (marshes and mangroves, ESI 10). Oil impacts on these habitats can be significant, especially when heavily o iled. This is because the natural removal rates are low, the sediments are generally fine-grained where oil degradation can be slow, and the intertidal communities are rich and highly sensitive to oil. With low natural removal rates, these shoreline types are often areas where there is significant pressure to actively remove the oil, which ca n be highly intrusive, and unless it is done with a great deal of care, often is not beneficial in terms of recovery. Oil does not generally adhere to the water-saturated surface of tidal flats, but can still affect epifauna (organisms livin g on the surface) and infauna, thereby reducing food sources for birds and ot her predators (NOAA, 2000a). Sheltered muddy habitats are particularly sensitive because any stranded oil can persist and weather very slowly. Cleanup is very difficult, and there are few methods that will not result in significant damage (NOAA, 2000a). Sheltered rocky shores often contain rich intertidal communities that provide vital ecosystem functions in the form of prey resources for many animals, as well as commercial and subsistence harvest, and aesthetic, cultural, and recreational opportunities. Natural removal rates can be very slow. Intertidal animals and plants are often killed or remo ved during cleanup, and the intertidal communities can go through cycles of succession before recovery is considered complete (Kimura and Stei nbeck, 1999). Sell et al. (1995) analyzed twelve oil spills where sheltered to moderately exposed rocky shores were heavily oiled, finding that treated sites recovered more slowly (2 -10 years) than those sites Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-35 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options that were not treated (1 -6 years). They also reported that lightly to moderately oiled sites recovered faster. Marshes and mangroves are ranked as 10, highest on the ESI scale, because they have the potential for the greatest impact s from spilled oil, particularly when heavily oiled. Oil adheres readily to the vegetation, and it can penetrate the muddy sediments via root ca vities and burrows (NOAA, 2000a). Oil spills are known to cause severe and long-term damage to mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems (e.g., Burns et al., 1993; Corredor et al., 1990; Duke et al., 1997; Mendelssohn et al., 1993). The vegetation and st ructure that salt marshes and mangroves provide may be affected, sediments may be contamin ated, and ecosystem functions may be impaired with regard to utilization by organisms, including important fisheries species, processing of nutr ients and chemicals, and stab ilization of sediments. The rate of degradation of the oil in the sediments is influenced by the sediment type, oxygen content and bacterial component of the sediment; availability and level of nutrients in the sediments and at the oil/sediment interface; and the depth to which the oil has penetrated. Oil penetrat ed into marsh sediment can be highly persistent, up to 30 years at the FLORIDA spill site in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts (Reddy et al., 2001). Oiling effects may be limited or negligible and be short term when the oil exposure is minimal, the vegetative structure is not affected (either by the oiling or various cleanup procedures), and residual oil levels are minimal or rapidly weathered. Oil impacts on mangroves are a function of the oil type, spill volume, duration of re-oiling, extent of oil coverage on expose d roots, and degree of substrate oiling. Light refined products can be acutely toxic (Ballou and Lewis, 1989). Heavier types of oil can lead to eventual death by smothering. Oiling of mangroves following spills can lead to the death of those plants and ultimately unstable habitats and sediment eros ion (Duke et al., 1997; Garrity et al., 1994). For example, during the Bahia Las Minas spill in Panama, about 82 km of shoreline were heavily oiled, including more than 1,000 ha of mangrove forests, intertidal reef flats, and subtidal flats. Large expanses of mangrove forest were inaccessible, and no oil removal was conducted. Approximately 69 ha of mangrove forest (dominated by red mangrove [ Rhizophora mangle ]) were killed and sublethal impacts affected approximately 30 8 ha (Duke et al., 1997). Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery No additional adverse impacts on shorelin e habitats are expected to occur from mechanical recovery. Shoreline impacts will be reduced by the amount of oil recovered. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-36 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion As stated previously, the proposed re gulations apply only to waters where pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are generally demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore7. Dispersant application in areas greater than 3 nm from shore makes it unlikely that dispersants will be directly applied to oil stranded onshore. In the open ocean or areas where there is sufficient tidal flow, dispersant application would treat surface oil and prevent shoreline oiling, thereby reducing exposure. Intertidal habitats will be exposed to dispersed oil that is carried close to shor e by currents after offshore application. In all cases, impacts on in tertidal habitats will be si gnificantly reduced compared with floating oil slicks. Three field studies were conducted in the 1980s to compare the impacts of controlled releases of oil and dispersed oil on intertidal and nearshore habitats: the Searsport, Main e study in a temperate setting (Gilfillan et al., 1983; 1985); the Tropical Oil Pollution Investigations in Coastal Systems (TROPICS) study of tropical ecosystems in Panama (Dodge et al., 1995; Getter and Ballou, 1985); and the Baffin Island Oil Study (BIOS) in the Canadian Arctic (Boehm et al., 1985). In each of these studies, dispersed oil concentrations along the shoreline were much higher than what is likely to occur during actual spills. Impacts on shoreline habitats exposed to dispersed oil were much reduced, compared with the oil treatments. For example, at the TROPICS study, half of the mangrove trees at the oil-only site were dead by year 2. In contrast, there was no explicit mortality of trees at the chemically dispersed oil site over the entire 10 years of monitoring. At the Searsport, Maine, site, the oil-only site showed clear evidence of oil incorporation into sediments and impacts on benthic fauna, whereas there was no evidence of impacts on fauna at sites exposed to dispersed oil. In the Canadian Arctic at the BIOS sites, large amounts of untreated oil washed up on the beach and became a source of remobilized oil that persisted for at least 9 years, whereas dispersed oil caused a significant, but short-lived, increase in hydrocarbon compounds in the water column, a significant initial bioaccumulation of oil, and little sediment impact. Because dispersants will not always be 100 percent effective, there will likely be some shoreline oiling, particularly for larg e spills and applications close to shore. If effective, however, impacts on shorel ine habitats can be greatly reduced in terms of the extent of shoreline affected and oil loading. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning Impacts on shoreline habitats from open-water in situ burning will result primarily from two types of exposure: (1) untreated oil that strands onshore, and (2) burn residues that are transported into the intertidal zone and strand onshore. Impacts from untreated oil will be the same as discussed above. The only difference will be a reduction in the amount of oil that might strand. Burn residues are semisolid and tar-like. Studies have predicted that about half of 7 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-37 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options international crude oils would tend to produce a residue that would sink in seawater, but only after cooling (Buist and Trudel, 1995). Sinking residues would be less likely to strand than those that float. Response plans for in situ burning call for the collection of as much residue as possible. Chemical analyses of burn residues show relative enrichment in metals and the higher molecular weight PAHs, which have high chronic toxicity but are thought to have low bioavailability in th e residue matrix. Bioassays with water from laboratory- and field-generated burn residues have been conducted on a variety of organisms but not on intertidal species (see Section 4.3.2.3). In general, such residues show little or no toxicity; therefore, impacts on shoreline habitats from stranding of burn residues will be primarily a result of physical coating and smothering of intertidal organisms. The extent of impact is likely to be small because only a small amount of residue will form. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Thresholds of concern for the amount of oil stranded onshore vary by habitat type and both ecological and recreational use. Even small amounts of oil on a high-use amenity beach duri ng peak holiday periods will trigger the need for cleanup, whereas natural recovery will be considered on remote beaches during periods of low biological use. A suggested threshold of concern for all sedimentary beaches is an oil thickness of 0.1 mm. At this thickness, assuming that the oil penetrated or mixed to a depth of 10 cm, the sediment would contain 300 ppm oil, which would visibly stain sand, triggeri ng the need for cleanup in most areas. This same thre shold would apply to all rocky shores based on the potential impa cts on intertidal communities (French et al., 1996). On wetlands, there have been studies on the oil loading needed to kill the vegetation. For exam ple, Alexander and Webb ( 1985) (Bowyer et al., 1994) reported that 0.35 gal/ft 2 had a detrimental effect on Texas salt marsh plants; Baker (1971) reported that 0.5 mm of fr esh Kuwait crude sp read over a salt marsh was not enough to kill most plant species and plants recovered the next growing season. However, even oil loading levels that do not kill plants would be of concern to animals that use these habitats. The CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) Type A model (French et al., 1996) assumes that a thickn ess of oil greater than 14 mm is lethal to wetland macrophytes. However, considering sublethal endpoints, a threshold of concern would be on the order of 0.1 mm. Recovery time periods vary considerably from habitat to habitat, primarily in response to the ambient energy level provided by winds and waves. The higher the energy is, the more rapid the recovery is. Exposed rocky shorelines are expected to recover within 1 to 3 years, and often within a few months, regardless of response strategy (Sell et al., 1995). Sheltered rocky shores, on the other hand, may retain pockets of oil for longer periods, depending on the degree of exposure. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-38 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Sedimentary beaches will have variable re covery periods, with gravel beaches the longest under heavy oiling and semish eltered conditions (greater than 8 years, based on studies of the EXXON VALDEZ spill site [Michel and Hayes, 1999]). Sand beach recovery rates are variable, depending on conditions and initial disturbance. Keller and Jacks on (1991) summarized recovery of sand beaches in Panama following oiling as being complete by 1 year, except for certain species. Bodin (1988) observed recovery within 5 years for three sand beaches in Brittany, France, over the years 1978 to 1984 after the AMOCO CADIZ oil spill. Baker et al. (1990) cite evidence from the Baltic Sea after a 1970 spill of medium and heavy fuel oil wi th mechanical cleanup. Recovery was estimated at 4 years. Judd et al. (1991) obse rved that Texas dune vegetation took 2 to 3 years to recover from removal experiments. Documented recovery times for oiled marshes range from a few weeks to decades (summarized in Hoff, 1995). Long est recovery periods are for several well-studied marsh sites where recovery times ranged from 5 years to over 20 years, including two sites in Bu zzards Bay, Massachusetts; the MIGUASHA spill in Quebec, Canada; the METULA spill in Chile; and the AMOCO CADIZ in France. These spills share the following characteristics: temperate to cold environments; sheltered location; heavy o iling; and spills of fuel oils (bunker C or No. 2 fuel). Recovery time periods for mangroves depend on the initial and residual oil loading as well damages result ing from cleanup efforts. Lightly oiled mangroves are likely to recover within 1 year, particularly if there is little or no substrate oiling. In contrast, recovery of heavily oiled mangroves will be delayed until the oil toxicity drops below threshold levels, the si te is stabilized in terms of its structure (e.g., the dead trees are eroded or removed so they no longer move around the intertidal zone because of wave and tidal action and prevent recolonization by seedlings), and the hydrology is reestablished so that recruits survive and grow. At 5 to 6 years post -spill, vegetation gaps remained in sheltered locations at the Pa nama site (Duke et al., 1997). Once recovery begins, then the recovery curve is relatively predictable, depending on the age of the oiled forest (up to 25 to 50 years). Based on field dispersant trials, marshes and mangroves exposed to dispersed oil ar e expected to recover within 1 year. 4.3.2.5. Subtidal Habitats Impacts of Oil Spills The subtidal (benthic) habitat consists of the bottom substrate below the low tide level, as well as the species that live in, on, and near the substrate. This benthic community includes areas of hard substrate inhabited by dense growth of sessile algae, corals, and sponges (often referred to as live bottoms and reefs); sandy and muddy bottoms; low-relief live bottoms; subsurface canyons; and pinnacles. Organisms living this area include corals, plants and seagrasses, benthic invertebrates (such as crabs, shrimp, snails, bivalve mollusks, and marine worms), and bottom-dwelling fish. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-39 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Subtidal benthic communitie s are rarely at risk from floating oil because, by definition, this environment is always below the surface. There are two rare exceptions to this: (1) extremely high energy environments caused by high sea state that could physically disperse the floa ting oil and force oil particles down to the benthos, and (2) extremely shallow subtidal environments (nonintertidal). In extremely high-energy environments, wave action can force whole oil droplets down into the benthic habitat. In this case, the oil particles could adhere to bottom substrate, plants, and animals. This could result in both physical coating of plant leaf or animal gill surfaces, as occurred in the 1993 BRAER spill in the Shetland Islands, and toxic effects from exposure to the chemical constituents. However, a sea state of this magnitude would exclude the implementation of any of the three altern atives and, therefore, does not warrant further discussion here. This type of spill is rare, and only one of a handful where extreme weather, sea co nditions, and a spill of an easily dispersible oil leads to direct impacts on the subtidal environment. Water accommodated fraction (WAF) refers to that portion of a test oil that will enter the water and remain when the water and oil are mixed together gently. It represents, as closely as possible, the components that enter the water column under a floating oil slick. Its composit ion can vary considerably depending on how it is prepared, so results must be evaluated carefully. WAF toxicity testing on the early life stages of Pacific oysters has resulted in LC50 levels near 2 ppm (Clark et al., 2001) and studies with the eastern oyster embry onic/larval stages resulted in sublethal effects near 6 ppm in 24-hr exposures (Fucik, 1994). Studies on epifauna and infauna (e.g., polychaetes, bivalves and other mollusks, and decapod crustaceans) re sulted in mortality at concentrations near 20 ppm (Knap et al., 1985). In the TROPICS study, Baca and Getter (1984) showed that turtle grass exposed to untreated Prudho e Bay oil resulted in 96-hr LC50 levels of 4 ppm. Sustained hydrocarbon concentrations within the benthic habitat at levels cited in these experiments are unre alistic beneath an untreated oil slick, even at extremely shallow depths. Thus, the risk to fauna and flora of the subtidal benthic habitat is minimal. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Mechanical recovery is a risk to benthic environments when the water depth is shallow enough that recovery equipment might come in contact with subsurface life such as coral reefs, oyster beds, seagrass beds, and other benthic habitats. Vessels must also avoid anchoring in sensitive habitats. A well-planned mechanical recovery operation would identify and avoid shallow depths to ensure that equipment such as boats and skimmers would not come in contact with benthic habitats. However, when operations disturb the natural environment of the benthos, devastating results can occur. Areas that have experienced significant disturbance from mechanical recovery can take considerable time to recover (C ubit and Connor, 1993; NOAA, FRPs for Oil 4-40 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion As stated previously, the proposed re gulations apply only to waters where pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are generally demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore8. Dispersant application under these conditions limits the risk to the benthic environment. A number of field studies have been conducted over the past two decades to study the fate and transport of chemically dispersed crude oil. McAuliffe et al. (1980; 1981) performed field trials in wh ich they dispersed a Prudhoe Bay crude oil slick at sea. Within 30 minutes, 40 pe rcent of the oil was dispersed in the top 2 m, and within an hour approximately 85 percent of the slick had dispersed into the top 7 m. Depending on the sea state, dispersed oil droplets are normally vertically distributed down to 10 m in the water column (NRC, 1989). From 1994 through 1996, three different projec ts were conducted that involved toxicity testing of water beneath untreate d and dispersed oil slicks during field trials in the North Sea. In each of the st udies, toxicity effects were negligible at depths greater than 1 m beneath the dispersed oil slick (Coelho and Aurand, 1996; Coelho et al., 1995; Wright et al., 1994). These studies clearly indicate that subtidal benthic habitats located below 10-m depth will not be affected from dispersant operations or resulting dispersed oil. Three field studies were conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s that addressed the ecological effects of oil versus chemic ally dispersed oil in nearshore, shallow subtidal areas: the Searsport, Maine, study in a small bay (Gilfillan et al., 1983, 1985), the TROPICS study in a tropical em bayment in Panama (Ballou et al., 1989; Dodge et al., 1995), and the BIOS in the Canadian Arctic (Sergy, 1985). In all three studies, chemically disperse d oil mixed into the water column and affected the benthos. It was concluded that, although the ecological effects from the dispersed oil were more severe initially, long-term recovery of the ecosystem was improved in the areas that were treated with dispersant. Studies on corals have found that over the long term, corals such as Diploria stringosa appear relatively tolerant to brief ex posures by chemically dispersed oil in the water column (Dodge et al., 1995; Knap et al., 1985). Laboratory studies on corals are backed by field studies such as the TROPICS study where chemically dispersed oil had relatively minor effects on corals and associated organisms (Ballou and Lewis, 1989). In corals, exposu re to 20 ppm of chemically dispersed oil for 24 hours induced various behavioral re actions, including tentacle retraction, tissue contraction, and mesenterial filame nt extrusion. However, effects were typically sublethal, and recovery was evident within 4 days. These symptoms were not significant in long-term transplants (Knap et al., 1985). Dispersant use may be highly appropriate near su bmerged coral reefs (i.e., where water depth increases quickly and subsurface currents are likely to carry dispersed oil away from the reef). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 2001a) has 8 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-41 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options modeled such situations for potential spills, focusing on when dispersants were considered as a response tool near a coral reef. Experimentation and observation of dispersant applications have not shown specific toxic effects on marine plants an d seagrasses. Chemica lly dispersed oils are less sticky than undispersed oil and tend not to adhere to marine plants (Lewis and Aurand, 1997). In the TROP ICS study, Baca and Getter (1984) determined a 96-hr LC50 value for turtle grass exposed to chemically dispersed Prudhoe Bay oil of 202 ppm. These concen trations are much higher than those that would be expected in seagrass beds , unless dispersants were used directly over the bed in very shallow water, so direct toxicity is unlikely. The primary concern for seagrass meadows is not necessarily the grass itself, but the fauna, since seagrass beds host nume rous different species. Mortality of seagrass epifauna and infauna from disp ersed oil was observed in the TROPICS study, but the recovery rate for the habitat was fairly rapid (i.e., within 1 year) (Ballou et al., 1989). Early life stages of epifauna and infauna are more vulnerable to dispersed oil than adults of the same species. Acute toxicity studies of polychaetes resulted in LC50s (24-hr ex posures) of 220 ppm for oil-dispersant mixtures (NRC, 1989). Butler al. (1982) found amphipod ( Gammarus oceanicus) 36-hr LC50 levels to be between 10 to 100 ppm with supporting testing conducted by Gulec and Holdway (1997). These concentrations are much higher than those typically observed in a subtidal benthic habitat, so it is unlikely that these invertebrates would be a ffected by dispersed oil. Laboratory toxicity tests utilizing dispersed Mayan crude oil on adult blue crabs resulted in LC50 values of 43 ppm in a static environment and greater than 150 ppm in a flow-through environmen t. Adult brown shrimp LC50s were 36 ppm in flow-through testing, and adult white shrimp LC50s were 44 ppm in flow-through testing and 1989; Wells et al., Wilson, 1977). CR OSERF (Chemical Response to Oil Spills: Ecological Effects Forum) labo ratory experiments utilizing spiked (declining concentration) exposures of larval and juvenile crustaceans to chemically dispersed oil resulted in similar LC50 values ranging from 1 to 60 ppm dispersed oil (Clark et al., 2001; Fuller and Bonner, 2001; Singer et al., 2001; Wetzel and Van Vleet, 2001). These re sults indicate that , in an extremely shallow benthic subtidal community, some juvenile crustacean mortality might occur from dispersed oil. Mollusks have been found to survive in highly oiled sediments. Their resistance to the effects of hydrocarbons has been seen in both experimental studies as well as in actual spill site observations. Multiple studies have noted a lack of significant mortality associated with hydrocarbon concentrations in excess of 1,000 ppm (Anderson et al., 1987; Rosiejadi et al ., 1978; Wells and Sprague, 1976). This resistance may be attributed to the fact that the very toxic components of oil rarely persist in highly oiled sediments in the field, and because of the highly variable feeding mechanisms found in moll usks, not all of whic h are conducive to uptake from the sediments. Even though adults tend to be resistant to relatively high concentrations, exposures in shallow areas have been high enough at some spills to result in mortality or narcosis to adults. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-42 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options In benthic fish (much like pelagic fish), the early life stages are generally more sensitive. The later life stages of benthic fish are more resistant to the toxic effects of dispersed oil and disper sants (Shuba and Heikamp, 1989). The concern for benthic fish involves interaction with dispersed oil and oil-sediment particles that have mixed to the bottom of the water column. Benthic fish will experience the toxic effects longer than those in the water column if the sediments become contaminated. However, dispersed oil is less adhesive than untreated oil to sediment particles and is more likely to be carried away by currents than settle to the bottom and pose a serious risk (Boyd et al., 2001; Shuba and Heikamp, 1989). Additionally, biodegradation of chemically dispersed oil will reduce the risk pres ented to the benthic fish. The toxic concentrations cited in Section 4.3.2.3 for fish are much higher than those typically observed in a subtidal benthic habitat, so it is unlikely that adult or juvenile benthic fish would be affected by dispersed oil. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning As stated in previous sections, most burns result in a taffy-like, buoyant layer of residue that can generally be recovered ma nually for disposal (Allen and Ferek, 1993). In some cases, residues may sink, which usually happens when the oil picks up sediments suspended in the water or when a highly efficient burn leaves only the heaviest part of the oil (ADEC, 1995). Residues that do sink are likely to settle to benthic environments and may interact with bottom-dwelling plants and animals (Shigenaka and Barnea, 1993). Ho wever, the amount of residue to be expected from an actual event is minima l, and would result in small patches of residue spread throughout the area of the burn. Several laboratory and field studies of burn residues on aquatic or ganisms have shown little or no acute toxicity to sand dollars, oysters, inland silversides, rainbow trout, three-spine sticklebacks, sea urchins, an et al., 1994; Gulec and Holdway, 1999), and very lo w sublethal toxicity to marine snails (Gulec and Holdway, 1999). One exception to this was noted when in situ burning was utilized on the HONAM JADE spill that occurred off the coast of South Korea in 1993. Reportedly burn residues from heavy Arabian crude oil sank and adversely affected crabs being reared in nearby submerged pens. However, specific impacts were not identified in detail in any available publications. This burn was conducted on a spill that was nearly 3 km in diameter. Most in situ burns are conducted on spill sections of much smaller volume. Burn residue contamination is likely to be local in scale when it occurs (Shigenaka and Barnea, 1993). Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Thresholds for subtidal contamination vary significantly depending on the hydrocarbon compound under consid eration. There are sediment quality guidelines, which were developed for the National Status and Trends Program, available for many of the PAHs of the most concern, as well as for total PAHs (NOAA, 2000b). These can be used as thre sholds in areas with soft sediments. The effects range-low (ERL) value, which represents a conservative criterion based on its definition as a level wh ere toxicity effects may begin to be observed, is approximately 4,000 ppb for total PAH. The effects range-median (ERM), which represents the 50th percentile, is approximately 45,000 ppb. The Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-43 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options PAHs of concern represent only a small fraction of crude oil, so these values must be multiplied at least tenfold to represent total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs). On this basis, TPH values woul d need to be in the range of 40 to 100 ppm to represent a concern. Threshol ds for invertebrate s and fish can be based on the information provided in Sect ion 4.3.2.3, since the sensitivities are similar for benthic and water column species. Recovery of contaminated sediments can be very slow, since the chemicals of concern (usually PAHs) may be bioavaila ble for years or decades. However, the results of a single, or even several, oil spills rarely leads to levels of concern because the limited amount of oil that reaches the bottom is not concentrated enough to exceed the thresholds. Spills in extreme weather conditions rarely will lead to localized areas of potentially si gnificant contaminatio n. Most concerns for benthic habitats involve areas of continuous hydrocarbon contamination from sources such as urban runoff or industrial pollution (such as polluted harbors), where long-term consequences have been observed. Once the source of the hydrocarbons is removed, sedimentary processes and biodegradation will gradually reduce the availability of th e compounds. In complex subtidal communities, such as seagrass beds or co ral reefs, recovery from single spill events is generally related to the growth rate and reproductive capacity of the key species and can take from 1 to several years. 4.3.2.6. Areas of Special Concern Habitat areas of special concern are those areas of particular importance that may require additional protection from o il spills. These areas are defined on the basis of their ecological importance, sensitivity, exposure, and rarity of the habitat. These areas are usually protected by the federal government and may exist as marine protected areas or reserves (such as Marine Sanctuaries and Estuary Research Reserves), National Park units, National Wildlife Refuges, or National Forests. Areas of special concern are identified in the corresponding section (Section 3.X.2.6) for each of the six geographic regions. As stated previously, the proposed regulations apply only to waters where pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are generally demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore 9. Only those areas that include intertidal or subtidal habitat are considered in this analysis . The risks to such areas have been described for the various resource or habitat types, but the potential levels of concern increase for areas with a high bi ological or socioeconomic value. These areas are most at risk from floating oil and benefit from any actions that reduce the potential for oiling. The levels of concern are highly site specific. 9 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-44 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options 4.3.3. Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species Whenever an oil spill occurs, the risk to protec ted species is always a critical concern. If the spill occurs in an area where such speci es are present, the ACP always includes provision for special efforts to minimize the risk to such species. The threatened, endangered, or candidate species that are us ually of concern during oil spills include a variety of bird species, all marine mammals, and sea turtles. Some species of fish, notably anadromous species such as salmon, may also be protected. Terrestrial species that are sometimes found near the coast may also be of concern, but are less likely to be affected than are marine or coastal species. The risks to birds, marine mammals, and sea turtles are greatest from floating oil and from oil that strands on the shoreline. Any response that reduces these conditions will benefit birds or marine mammals. Fish could be at risk from those sources, as well as from oil dispersed or dissolved in the water column. Whether fish would benefit from reduction in floating or stranded oil is more species dependent. The biological risks for three of these key groups, marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, and plankton and fish have been described in Sections 4.3.2.1, 4.3.2.2, and 4.3.2.3, respectively. The risks to sea turtles are presented below. Since protected species tend to be geographically restricted or very rare, it is difficult to assess the specific risk except on a site-by-site basis. If affected, populations of protected species ware more likely to be at risk than populations of more abundant, sim ilar species because of their limited numbers and the potential effects on reproducing adults. As required under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), the USCG contacted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in letters dated April 18, 2002, to determine that the promulgation of the proposed regulations wo uld not affect listed species or designated critical habitat. The letters refer to the 2001 Inter-Agency Memorandum of Agreement Regarding Oil Spill Planning and Re sponse Activities under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act's National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan and the Endangered Species Act (MOA) , which was signed by the USCG, USFWS, U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), NOAA (National Marine Fisheries Service and National Ocean Service), and USEPA, and determines how the agencies intend to work together to fulfill their obligations under the ESA and the NCP. The MOA is intended to be used at the Area Committee level primarily to identify and incorporate plans and procedures to protect listed species and designated critical habitat during spill planning and response activi ties. The MOA identifies the roles and responsibilities of each agency during pr e-spill planning, spill response, and post-spill response. The potent ial effects of oil spill response opti ons on listed species and critical habitat will be identified and response plans and countermeasures (response strategies) to minimize or avoid adverse effects will be jo intly developed. In the event that oil spill response actions result in effects on listed species or critical habitat, the MOA provides guidance on how to conduct emergency consul tation under the ESA. In addition, the MOA encourages the planning committees to pursue informal consultation whenever possible during the planning and response stages. In a letter dated August 12, 2002, the USF WS concurred that promulgation of the proposed regulations would not affect listed species or designated critical habitat and that any effects to listed species would be eval uated as outlined in the implementing procedures incorporat ed in the MOA. Likewise, in a letter dated May 22, 2002, NOAA Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-45 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options agreed that the regulations, as proposed, wo uld not affect listed species or designated critical habitat. 4.3.3.1. Sea Turtles Impacts of Oil Spills All sea turtle species and their life stages are vulnerable to the harmful effects of oil though direct contact or by fouling of their body, habitats, and food sources (MMS, 2001). Eggs, hatchlings, and small juve niles are particularly vulnerable to oil contact. Laboratory experiments show that crude oil has detrimental effects on sea turtle eggs, hatchlings, and juven iles. In general, sea turtle nests are located above the high tide level and usually are only susceptible to being coated with oil at very high tide s. When nests do become o iled (by oil seeping down to the buried eggs) the unhatched sea turtle eggs are at increased risk. The number of unhatched eggs in a nest is much higher when fresh crude oil is on the surface of the sand during the last half or quarter of incubation. This effect is associated with crude oil aromatics entering the nest's atmosphere and results in a reduction of available oxygen during a critical developmental phase in which the embryo's oxygen consumption is reaching its peak. When oiled nests do produce viable young, the hatchling weight is generally lower and the animal size is smaller. This also applies when the eggs are exposed to a light dosage of oil mixed in the sand (Research Planni ng, Inc., 1991). Weathe red oil, which is the most likely condition for oil that would contaminate nests, is less toxic to turtle eggs than fresh crude oil. When a new nesting season occurred after a year of weathering, there would be little residu al risk (Research Planning, Inc., 1991). Hatched turtle young that are exposed to oil respond by increasing their dive time and by diving deeper. With all sea turtles, regardless of age, oil exposure increases respiratory rate and decreases blood glucose level. Crude oil exposure causes reddening and sloughing off of the skin of juveniles, which can reduce the viability of the individual and increase the chance of infection (Research Planning, Inc., 1991). The oil also causes an immune system response, which is indicated by an increase in the white blood cells. The oil also interferes with the functioning of the salt gland, thereby upsetting the water balance and internal ion regulation (Research Planning, In c., 1991). In the natu ral environment, disease and predators may kill already weak ened animals exposed to oil, while in lab experiments test animals usually rehabilitate well from oil exposure (Research Planning, Inc., 1991). Tissues around the eyes and other mucous membranes would presumably be most sensitive to contact with hydrocarbons. A break in the skin barrier could act as a portal of entry for pathogenic organisms, leading to infection, ne oplastic conditions, and debilitation. Experiments on the effects of hydrocarbons have shown that sea turtles are adversely affected by short exposure to weathered oil. Sea turtles accidentally exposed to oil or tar balls may suffer breathing disturbances, red blood cell disturbances, and digestive disorders or blockages. Although disturbances may be temporary, long-term effects remain unknown, and chronically ingested oil may accumulate in organs. Hatchling and small juvenile turtles are particularly vulnerable to contacting or ingesting oil because floating oil often concentrates in the debris mats where these young animals are sometimes found (MMS, 1996). Exposure to hydrocarbons may be fatal, particularly to juvenile and hatchling sea turtles (MMS, 2001). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-46 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Turtles feed on objects floating at the water surface. This makes them susceptible to floating or partially submerged tar balls. The oil that is ingested by the turtles does not pass rapidly through the digestive tract but is instead retained for several days. During this ti me toxic components of the oil can be passed on to other organs or tissues (M MS, 1996, 2001; Research Planning, Inc., 1991). Many detrital and filter feeder s that turtles feed on concentrate pollutants. Some species of sea turtles eat pelagic jellyfish, which concentrate contaminants (because of their place in the food web). Because these turtles specialize in this one prey item, they could ingest high levels of chemicals (Research Planning, Inc., 1991). Adult sea turtles do not appe ar to detect and avoid oi l spills. Oil can adhere to the body surface of marine turtles. Oil ha s been observed to cling to the nares, eyes, and upper esophagus and even seal the mouth. Marine turtles may become entrapped by tar and oil slicks an d rendered immobile (MMS, 1996, 2001). Turtles can potentially be exposed to the tar, which accumulates in the windrows of gulfweed ( Sargassum sp.). When their flippers become coated with the tar, they may try to clean their flippers, thereby contaminating their mouths. The tar may then impede feeding, which could lead to starvation (Research Planning, Inc., 1991). Some captive turtle s exposed to oil either reduced the amount of time spent at the surface, possibly avoiding the oil, or became agitated and had short submergence levels (MMS, 2001). Either behavior change could increase stress in the animals. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-47 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Mechanical recovery would benefit turtles by removing surface oil and minimizing shoreline impacts. The risks involved during mechanical recovery operations are virtually the same as those for floating oil. Encounters with boomed oil will result in oiling similar to encounters with an uncontained oil slick. Operation of mechanical recovery equipment and vessels is not expected to result in increased risk since sea tu rtles would have no difficulty avoiding slow-moving response vessels. In additi on, ACPs address ways to minimize impacts, and responders are trained to watch for and avoid sea turtles. Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion In the open ocean or areas where there is sufficient tidal flow, dispersant application would treat surface oil and pr event shoreline oiling, thereby reducing exposure. Dispersants would be present at such low concentrations that they would not pose a risk, and even if sprayed, sea turtles would be at minimal risk, in contrast to many marine mammals or birds, because they do not rely on body oils and fur or plumage to create insulating layers or waterproofing (see Appendix G). Chemically dispersed oil would dilute rapidl y enough to quickly reduce any risk to animals such as sea turtles. The shoreline risk from chemically dispersed oil, if it did contact a breeding beach, would be less than the ri sk from floating oil since dispersed oil is less likely to adhere to eggs or juveniles. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning In situ burning of floating oil poses a minimal risk to sea turtles. Since an in situ burn would not be initiated with the presence of sea turtles within the burn perimeter, and they will avoid areas where burning is already in progress, the risk to sea turtles during in situ burning would be very limited. Residues from in situ burns might appear as food items to sea turtles that could be ingested and cause internal harm to these animals, but given the small volume, and the fact that as much residue as possible is recove red, this risk is very low. Based on the chemical and physical properties of the residue, burn residues should have a similar or perhaps reduced toxicity in co mparison with naturally occurring tar balls, which turtles are known to ingest. The other consideration for in situ burning is the smoke component of the burn. Since the smoke from the burn tends to rise into the atmosphere and occurs for only a limited time, it should not pose a risk to these animals. Because in situ burning is unlikely to remove more than a fraction of the floating oil, the risks are very similar to those for floating oil, but somewhat reduced in proportion to the volume removed (Shigenaka and Barnea, 1993). Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Sea turtles are less sensitive to floating oil than are marine mammals with fur or birds, but contact with oil slicks can put them at risk to at least temporary physiological damage. On oiled shorelines, adults coming ashore to breed would probably only be affected by relatively thick oiling, but juveniles and eggs could be affected by even thin layers of stranded oil. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-48 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Recovery times for populations of sea turtles would be on the order of years (for the loss of juveniles or eggs on a nesting beach) to decades for the loss of an adult. In an extreme situation, the oiling of a primary breeding area for one of the more threatened species could be extremely severe unless the young could be rescued. 4.3.4. Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) is those waters and substrates necessary to federally managed fish for spawning, breeding, fe eding, or growth to maturity (MSA, 16 U.S.C. 1802(10)). Because of the wide variation of habitat require ments for a multitude of species for each of their life-history stages, most estuarine and ma rine waters and substr ates from the shoreline to the seaward limit of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) have been designated as EFH. In addition, numerous rivers and stre ams have been designated as EFH because of utilization by federally managed diadromous species. Those waters specifically identifi ed as EFH can be found on-line 10 for each of the six geographic regions. For the purposes of this document, the threat to EFH can be best characterized by the risk to either fish or the benthic habitat. The results of the modeling for plankton and fish and for subtidal habitats are applicable to EFH. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled that is naturally dispersed into the water column and the potential for adverse effect on EFH. As the volume of dispersed oil increases, the potential risk of toxic hydrocarbon components being present in the water column also increases. Potential adverse effe cts increase as spill volume increase, with greatest concern for severe weather conditions and increased oil dispersion. In general, an EFH might be judged more susceptible to th e toxic effects of oil and dispersants than areas that are not categorized as \"essential habitat.\" ACPs review this issue when response options are evaluated, and such areas receiv e special consideration. Decisions concerning the best response strategy to protect such areas must be made on a case-by-case basis. 4.3.5. Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment This section addresses the potential effect s an oil spill may have on the socioeconomic environment. Although oil sp ills have the capability of producing a variety of economic and social impacts, these effects are generally not significant when measured at the regional or national levels. Instead, impacts are typically felt in co mmunities located near resources oiled by a spill. Si gnificant impacts are generally limited to those economic sectors and populations of the community that depend on natural resources affected by the spill, including commercial and recreational fishing operat ions, recreation and tourism industries, and subsistence and cultural resource users. 10 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/habit atprotection/efh/fish_manage_c.htm Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-49 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options 4.3.5.1. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Impacts of Oil Spills Oil spills can affect multiple aspects of a coastal community's economy, culture, and quality of life. The reliance of these communities on marine-related resources and industries (e.g., recreati on and tourism, commercial fishing, maritime commerce) can lead to disruptions in employment, business revenue, import and export of materials, and other economic factors. A broad range of coastal communities exist, from the millions of people and diverse industries of the Galveston Bay region of Texas, to the isolated community of Cordova, Alaska, where the majority of the 2,500-person population is employed in fishing-related industries or tourism. Coastal regions offer environmental amenities, recreational activities, and distinct job opportunities that many residents value highly. As a result, oil spills that negatively affect the environment will have correspond ing adverse effects on members of coastal communities. For exam ple, a spill that oils the shoreline, kills wildlife, and/or emits a petroleum odor can change the local resident's behavior and reduce their quality of life. Cleanup of the co ntaminated coastal area may require trucks, boats, and incr eased human presence, thus reducing the social welfare of the coastal community by disrupting the daily lives of its inhabitants (e.g., increased traffic, noise pollution, aesthetic disamenities). Even after cleanup is completed, a coastal area may be perceived as tainted; members of the coastal community may believe that the ecosystem is no longer pristine, diminishing the amenities provided by and value of the resource. This perception of taint can reduce the desirability of living in the region by decreasing demand for housing, reducing property values, and negatively affecting the property owners in the coastal community. The possible effects of an oil spill on a coastal community include, but are not limited to, the following: Risks to fisheries industries includin g fish and shellfish harvesting and processing Disruption of maritime commerce Decline in revenue for local businesses engaged in or supporting marine- based economic sectors Losses incurred by subsistence and artisinal fishermen (the latter being fishermen whose practice is rooted in cultural tradition and whose products may not enter formal markets) Risks to tribal, Native, and/or other ethnically defined communities Real and perceived risk to human health Reduction in quality of life of resident s of and visitors to the spill area Financial obligations borne by local governments associated with spill response and cleanup activities Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-50 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options For the most part, the effects suffered by coastal communities as a result of an oil spill will persist only in the short to medium term. However, in the unlikely event that a spill forces the permanent clos ure of a fishery, for example, a spill may yield longer-term impacts. As such extreme events are rare, discussion of socioeconomic impacts in this sectio n and the following sections focuses predominantly on short- to medium-ter m effects. The expected influence of various response options on socioeconomic factors within coastal communities is similar across other categories of po tential impact (e.g., commercial fishing). Therefore, benefits and limitations of the various response options are discussed generically below, and only additional, category-specific information is included in subsequent sections, as needed. Small to medium oil spills generall y have minimal impacts on either demography or employment since the impacts of these events generally last only days or weeks. This is especially true in more populated areas where the employment base is likely to be diverse and less reliant on marine resources. Very large spills may have a temporar y effect on both demography and employment, especially in remote or sparsely populated areas. For example, the workforce involved in the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill cleanup added a significant seasonal population to the local communities in Alaska for 3 years. Ultimately, however, even the effects of large spills on demography and employment are temporary and are expected to be local in nature. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Mechanical recovery is likely to mitiga te the effects of spilled oil on coastal communities, demography, and employment and therefore is expected to provide socioeconomic benefits to coasta l communities. Mechanical recovery of oil may reduce the amount of shoreline oiled or the area of surface water oiled, thus lessening the impacts on marine resource users (e.g., less surface water oiled may reduce the potential for fishery closures and eliminate the risk of job losses). In the case of major oil spill even ts, the recovery effort, in addition to the spill itself, may be large enough to significantly affect social and economic aspects of communities in the spill area. Cl eanup of any beaches, piers, marinas, and other coastal resources will be notice able to local residents and potentially disruptive to social and economic activities. Coastal communities also may serve as staging locations for offshore activities, with significant numbers of workers passing through. This effect can be both negative (in the form of disruption) and positive (in the form of enhanced revenue for local businesses). Large-scale oil spill cleanup operations can require a significant number of workers over an extended period of time. In some cases, response managers may hire local workers displaced by the spill, such as lo cal commercial fishermen, to assist in the cleanup. Nonlocal workers and managers also require lodging and food, which can offset the losses hotels and restaurants, might otherwise suffer from a reduced number of tourists. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-51 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion Dispersants are a countermeasure used to reduce the surface oil and its impact on the environment. The proposed regulations apply only to waters where pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are generally demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore 11. Therefore, it is unlikely that dispersants will affect coastal areas direct ly (NOAA, 2002a). To the extent that coastal areas do experience effects of dispersa nts, they are likely to be positive in that dispersants reduce the quantity of surface oil from a spill, potentially reducing the quantity of oil that washes ashore or affects natural resources. This may subsequently reduce the negative percep tions residents and visitors may have regarding spill areas adjacent to coasta l communities and may correspondingly reduce the risk to resource-dependent job markets. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning NOAA (2002b) has stated that in situ burning can reduce sheen and surface oil quicker than mechanical recovery or natural processes. NOAA (2002c) has further stated that a properly planned in situ burn can mitigate the impact on coastal areas and recreational activities. If the burn occurs close to shore, the visible smoke plume can be an aesthetic and health concern, albeit a short-lived one. In addition, studies have concluded that in situ burning does not pose a significant threat to human health, especi ally at distances over 500 m, and so burns used to address offshore spills are not likely to affect the health of coastal communities direct ly (Fingas et al., 2001; Westph al et al., 1994). As such, the application of in situ burning would be expected to reduce the total socioeconomic impact of most spills on coastal communitie s, demography, and employment. However, although NOAA burning procedures require conditions that imply that any smoke will travel away from populated areas, the actual or potential presence of this smoke in or within view of a coastal community might affect recreation, tourism, and/or the overall quality of life of residents of that coastal community (NOAA, 2002d). Although most burn residue will be mechanically removed or will sink, the residue could potentially wash ashore, creating an environmental disamenity. Any expected negative impacts of in situ burning on demography and employment would be expected to be short-term and localized in nature, such as job disruptions in the tourism sector. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns There is no specific threshold or quantifiable relationship between the amount of oil spilled and the expected magnitud e and duration of impact on a coastal community, its demographics, or its empl oyment. Factors such as location of the spill, weather conditions at the time of the spill, season of the spill, and effectiveness of cleanup will all act to determine the scope and duration of the impact. It is expected, however, that such impacts will be linea rly related to the proportion of physical resources at risk in a given spill area above generalized exposure thresholds (e.g., just visible shee n). That is, spills that result in greater oiling of shoreline or a larger area of su rface water swept by oil will, on average, 11 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-52 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options result in greater socioeconomic effect s. Results based on specific monetary measures of damage, if they could be developed, would not be expected to differ significantly from the risk metrics presented in this analysis (Transportation Resear ch Board, 2001). Limiting the exposure of shorelines to spilled oil and minimizing the extent of surface water oiling will act to reduce th e magnitude and duration of effects of spills on coastal communities. As such, response actions that minimize the physical impacts of spills will be exp ected to reduce the total expected socioeconomic impacts on affected co astal communities, demography, and employment. 4.3.5.2. Economic Status Impacts of Oil Spills Coastal communities can suffer directly an d indirectly from an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease revenue, eliminate jobs, and adversely affect subsistence users of the resources. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisheries, both by the anglers themselves and by related industries as catch opportunitie s decrease or are eliminated entirely. Tourism and associated businesses will su ffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal areas decline and purchases of area goods (e.g., fish in restaurants) decrease because of perception of resource taint. Coastal regions offer environmental amenities, recreational activities, and distinct job opportunities that many residents value hi ghly. As discussed in the previous section, oil spills that negatively affect the environment will have a corresponding adverse effect on member s of coastal communities. For example, a spill that oils the shoreline, kills wild life, and/or emits a petroleum odor can change the behavior and reduce the quality of life of a community's residents. Cleanup of the contaminated coastal area may require trucks, boats, and increased human presence, thus reducing the social welfare of the coastal community by disrupting the daily lives of its inhabitants with increased traffic, noise pollution, and the aesthetics of natural resources. Even after cleanup is completed, a coastal area may be perceived as tainted; members of the coastal community and visitors to the region may believe that the ecosystem is no longer pristine, diminishing the amenities provided by and value of the resource. This perception of taint can reduce the desirability of living in the region, decrease demand for housing, reduce prope rty values, and negatively affect the property owners in the coastal community. As an integral part of coastal communities, commercial fishing and related industries like fish and shellfish proce ssing rely on natural resources that are susceptible to injury from oil spills. Any major reduction in the volume of fish harvest because of an oil spill, such as oiled fish or fishery closures, can adversely affect onshore processing facilities and cause a corresponding reduction in employment and revenue. For example, after the EXXON VALDEZ spill, hundreds of fishermen were at least temporarily unable to harvest, and three local fish processing plants in Cordova, Alaska, were shut down for most of the season. Plant workforces were reduced from approximately 225 employees to less th an 100, and some processors were Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-53 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options forced to import fish to supplement th eir raw materials, thereby suffering lower profit margins (Piper, 1993). An oil spill that initially decreases revenue for tourism, maritime commerce, and commercial fishing industries will have a subsequent detrimental effect on other sectors of the local economy. Industri es within any geographic area are interdependent in the sense that they purc hase output from various industries and sectors, while also supplying inputs to ot her businesses. Thus, the contribution of a particular industry or activity to the re gional economy is greater than its individual output. A lobsterman may sell his catch to a local processor or distributor and at the same time locally purchase equipment an d supplies (traps and bait). As a result, the effects of an oil spill on a lobster fish ery may be significantl y greater than just those borne by local lobstermen, potenti ally affecting regional revenues and employment across multiple industries. Oil spills will generally not result in sign ificant changes in economic status at either the regional or national levels. These effects, if significant, will be felt at the local level within populations and economic sectors that depend on the marine environment. In most cases, the effects of even large spills on the economic status of a community will be short term , on the order of weeks or months. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Mechanical recovery is likely to mitiga te the effects of spilled oil on overall economic status in a manner that parallels the impact of this response action on coastal communities. First, mechanical recovery is expected to reduce the amount of resources oiled, causing a subsequent reduction in the adverse effects experienced by resource users. Second, in the case of major oil spill events, the recovery effort itself may be large enough to temporarily have a significant economic effect on the local community , perhaps increasing employment opportunities and income levels. Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion Chemical dispersion is likely to mitigate the effects of spilled oil the economic status of affected communities in a manner that parallels the impact of this response action on coastal communities. That is, to the extent that coastal areas experience effects of dispersants, they are likely to be positive in that dispersants reduce the quantity of surface oil from a spill, potentially reducing the quantity of oil that washes ashore or affects natural resources. This will allow for lessened impacts on the general economies of coastal communities and the specific industries related to marine resources (e.g., commercial fishing and recreation, and tourism). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-54 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning In situ burn techniques are also likely to miti gate the effects of spilled oil on an affected community's economic status in a manner that parallels the impact of this response action on coastal communities. That is, to the extent that coastal areas experience effects of in situ burning, they are likely to be positive in that in situ burn application is expected to reduce the quantity of surface oil from a spill and to potentially reduce the quantity of oil that washes ashore or affects natural resources. This will allow for lessened impacts on communities and industries that rely on marine resources for success. Any expected negative impacts of in situ burning on a community are expected to be short term and localized in nature. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns There is no specific thres hold or quantifiable relationship between the amount of oil spilled and the impact on a community 's economic status (s ee discussion in Section 4.3.5.1). However, limiting the expo sure of shorelines to spilled oil and minimizing the extent of surface water oiling will act to reduce the scope and duration of such impacts. As such, res ponse actions that minimize the physical impacts of spills will be expected to redu ce the total expected impact of an oil spill on a community's economic status. It is expected, however, that such impacts will, on average, be linear ly related to both the area of surface water and the length of shoreline used for marine activities that are swept by oil. Results based on specific monetary measures of damage , if they could be developed, would not be expected to differ significantly from the risk metrics presented in this analysis (Transportation Research Board, 2001). 4.3.5.3. Vessel Transportation and Ports Impacts of Oil Spills An oil spill can disrupt maritime commerc e if it results in the presence of significant quantities of oil in a shipping channel or at a port, or if it results in a moratorium on watercraft usage. Any interruption of marine commerce can affect a coastal community. For example, in 1990 the SHINOUSSA collided with two tank barges, releasing approximately 17,000 bbl of oil into Galveston Bay, Texas. The USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) closed the Houston Ship Channel to all traffic, forcing boat traffic to use longer alternate routes or wait for passage for 3 days before limited use was permitted; the channel was not reopened for all traffic until 10 days later (NOAA-HMRAD, 1992). Similarly, barges incurred increased travel time and transportation costs \u2014additional payroll costs, fuel expense, and port fees \u2014when the BAYWAY released oil into the Arthur Kill, New Jersey, in 1990, forcing barges to travel around St aten Island, New York, to reach their desired ports (Meade and Unsworth, 1990 ). While these spills occurred in nearshore waters, the impact of closures because of the presence of oil from an offshore spill, while rare, could be similar. The consequences of disruptions on maritime commerce are not limited to longer tour times and increa sed costs for the co mpanies involved in this activity. Businesses depending on prompt delivery of inputs and raw materials for production will be negatively affected by delays. Further, firms that provide maritime services and/or supplies will suff er from any sort of stoppage. Intra- and international trade are important to local, state, and national economies. For Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-55 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options example, Maryland exported $5 billion worth of goods to foreign markets in 2000, with more than half of this volume originating from the port of Baltimore (USDOC-ITA, 2001). Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Mechanical recovery is lik ely to mitigate the effects of spilled oil on vessel transportation and ports by reducing the duration of any slowdown in operations, rerouting, or port closure. The ultimate cost of a spill to businesses that rely on marine transportation w ill rise with increased duration or geographic extent of closures. Thus, to the extent that mechanical recovery reduces the duration or extent of mari ne transportation impacts, it will help minimize the economic costs of oil spills. Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion As discussed above, dispersants are a coun termeasure used to reduce surface oil. To the extent that dispersants can reduce the quantity of surface oil from a spill, their use would be expected to reduce the frequency, duration, and geographic scope of marine transportation impacts. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning To the extent that in situ burning may reduce the extent and severity of surface water oiling, it would be expected to reduce the frequency, duration, and geographic scope of marine transportation impacts by reducing the geographic or temporal scope of shipping channel closures, and other marine transportation impacts. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns There is no specific threshold or quantifiable relationship between the amount of oil spilled and the impact on marine transportation. For example, a waterway might be closed following a spill event to allow for effective spill response, even in the absence of local surface oiling. Alternatively, a waterway might remain open despite the presence of an oil sheen if it is deemed that there is little risk associated with continuance of marine ac tivities. It is expected, however, that such impacts will, on average, be linearl y related to the area of surface water used for marine transportation that is swept by oil. Results based on specific monetary measures of damage, if they could be developed, would not be expected to differ significantly from the risk metrics presented in this analysis (Transportation Resear ch Board, 2001). Limiting the extent of surface oiling will act to reduce the scope and duration of any expected impacts on marine transportation. As such, response actions that minimize the physical impacts of spills will be expected to reduce the total expected impact of an oil spill on marine transportation. In any case, the duration of closures and other impacts on marine transportation are expected to be short lived. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-56 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options 4.3.5.4. Fisheries Impacts of Oil Spills Commercial Fisheries Oil spills can have a wide range of impacts on commercial fishing operations that include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: Closure of the fishery, or loss of access to the fishery because of port or transportation-corridor closures (such effects are generally temporary in nature) Perception of taint in fish from the spill area, which reduces the value of the product in the market Closure of the fishery to allow for recovery of affected stocks Reduced harvests due to reduced stocks Change in fishing practices leading to increased costs or diminished revenue, such as the need to access more distant fishing areas outside of the spill area Marine fisheries are located in areas as diverse as the inlets of Prince William Sound and the waters off the Texas Gulf coast. The severity of oil spill effects on a region's commercial fisheries will be influenced by the location of the spill, target species, and type of equipment used in each fishery. In addition, location, spill size, oil type, and timing \u2014especially weather conditions at the time of the spill\u2014can alter the impacts of an oil spill on commercial fishing. For example, the time of year that an oil spill occu rs plays a crucial role in determining whether a fishery will be affected for sp ecies that have distinct harvest seasons, and weather will determine if the oil remain s on the surface or is dispersed into the water column. Large oil spills can force a complete closure of a fishery because of increased morbidity/mortality in fish stocks, concern over possible adverse human health effects from consumption of contaminated fish, and/or the existence of an oily taste or odor in fish exposed to the oil (or the perception that fish from an area might have these characteristics). In all three cases, the fishery may remain closed not only until cleanup is complete d, but until oil is eliminated from the system, stocks are recovered, or market confidence is returned. Regardless of the reason for the closure, inability to fish could lead to significant losses in revenue for the local commercial fishing industry. Three examples of the impact of fishery closures include the NORTH CAPE , GLACIER BAY, and AMOCO CADIZ oil spills. The 1996 grounding of the NORTH CAPE off the coast of South Kingstown, Rhode Island, resulted in an oil spill of approximately 20 ,000 bbl that severely af fected commercial lobster harvesting. As a result of the spill, coastal ponds and state and federal offshore water fisheries were temporarily closed for fish and shellfish. Although some of these fisheries reopened after only 3 week s, the more heavily affected areas remained closed to lobstering for 5 mont hs. The spill resulted in an estimated direct kill of over 9 million lobster and increased morbidity for other members of the population. The cost to restore the lobster fishery is estimated to be almost $10 million (NOAA et al., 1999). The 1987 GLACIER BAY oil spill released Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-57 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options over 380,000 bbl of crude oil into Cook Inlet, Alaska, and resulted in the closure of the majority of the area's salmon fisher ies. In addition, fish were contaminated by oiled gear during harvesting. As a re sult, drift gillnet fishermen and set net fisherman reported a total loss of $53.6 million (MMS, 1990). The 1978 AMOCO CADIZ oil spill discharged 1.6 million bbl of oil off the coast of Brittany, France. The spill had an enormous effect on benthic species, resulting in the loss of that year's oyster stocks, a delay in the prep aration of oyster culture for next season and diminished oyster harvests for the next few years, resulting in a loss of over $22 million (NOAA, 1983). Even if the oil spill does not affect a fishery directly (e.g., by killing fish), fishing may still be prohibited because of spill loc ation, potential disruption of cleanup operations, or preservation of public perception regarding the health of the fishery. For example, the spill could occur in a location such that the boats are unable to reach the fishing grounds, or, if the oil spill occurs near a harbor or within traffic lanes, federal agencies may require docking of all boats to prevent disruption of cleanup operations. In addition, fisheries may be closed to pr eserve the public's perception that fish sold on the market are of the highest quality and are not tainted by oil. For example, in 1989 the EXXON VALDEZ struck Bligh Reef, releasing 11 million gal of crude oil into Prince Will iam Sound. Although some species of fish and shellfish, as well as some area stocks, were not directly in contact with the oil, concern that the fish would become tainted during extraction, transportation, or processing caused NOAA and the state of Alaska to close the herring, shrimp, crab, and salmon fisheries and hatcheries (Piper, 1993). The goal of the closures was to preserve the pu blic's confidence in the safety of fish on the market. Fear of taint can lead to a reduction in the demand for fish, from both consumers and processors, causing economic losses to the commercial fishing industry. A study by Mendelssohn et al. (1993) found that Alaskan salmon and herring prices decreased be low expected levels from 1989 to 1991 because of the EXXON VALDEZ spill. The study attributes this change in price to a decrease in demand because of consumer perception that the fishery had been tainted. Oil spills can also force local fisherman to incur higher costs and/or diminished revenue. After a spill, fishermen may either travel farther than usual to reach an uncontaminated fishery, or they may be forced to use a lower quality fishery with lower catch rates, smaller fish, or specie s with lower market values. For example, the GLACIER BAY spill caused a closure of most of the salmon fisheries in Cook Inlet during the height of the salmon season. This forced many fishing vessels to travel longer distances to other fisheries, where, because of overcrowding of fishing vessels, catc h sizes were reduced (Piper, 1993). The GLACIER BAY spill also resulted in another cost for the commercial fishing industry: the replacement of fishing gear ruined by the oil (MMS, 1990). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-58 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options In some cases, even large oil spills ca n cause significant environmental damage with minimal impact on comm ercial fisheries. In 1988 the NESTUCCA was punctured by its tugboat, causing the release of 5,500 bbl of oil into Puget Sound. The spill resulted in the collection of over 10,300 oiled birds, with many more believed to have been oiled but not collected; however, commercial fishery losses were small, with only precautionary temporary closures of some crab and mollusk beds (NOAA-HMRAD, 1992). Finally, in the event of a very large spill, there may be long-term damage to fish habitats and stocks. Long-term damage would imply that the effects on the commercial fishing industry mentioned above would extend farther into the future and force fishermen and the industries that support them to make permanent changes in their business st rategies and employment choices. Recreational Fisheries While impacts on fisheries from oil sp ills generally center on the loss of commercial opportunities, recreational fisheries may suffer from similar impacts. Fishery closures, fish consumption advisories, moratoria on boating activities, and perception of taint can reduce recreational fishing activity levels and therefore the economic value of such activities to participants. In some coastal areas, recreational fishing is an important economic resource, and closures or the perception of a diminished resource can lead to significant local economic impacts, such as reduced touris m. Recreational fishing, however, is a seasonal activity; as such, the extent of an oil spill's impact on this activity will depend on the timing of the spill. For example, the NORTH CAPE oil spill occurred at the begi nning of the winter cod se ason. Between January 1996 and June 1996, the spill caused a temporary moratorium on fishing, as well as perception of taint among anglers, result ing in a loss of over 3,300 party/charter angler trips for winter cod (NOAA et al., 1999). However, the GLACIER BAY oil spill in Cook Inlet, Alaska, a popular fishing destination, occurred at the early part of the season and had no adverse impact on recreational salmon and halibut fishing (MMS, 1990). Although the relative size of the recreational fishing industry may be smaller than commercial fishing operations in an oil spill location, the impact of various response actions on recreational fisheries, as well as the impact thresholds and recovery patterns following a spill, pa rallel those described for commercial fisheries. Therefore, the discussions in the Commercial Fishing Section on the effects of mechanical recovery, chemical dispersion, and in situ burning, as well as information on thresholds and recovery, apply to recreational fishing as well. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery No adverse impacts on commercial and recreational fisheries are expected to occur from mechanical recovery. Rather, mechanical recovery is expected to reduce the amount of oil in the environment, thereby reducing exposure of biota to oil and/or impacts on transportation routes and reducing adverse effects on fisheries and associated industries. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-59 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion Chemical dispersion is a countermeasure used to reduce the impact of oil on surface and near-surface organisms. This remedial measure has the potential to reduce the levels of oil in the water as well as the area affected, leading to a corresponding reduction in the risk of adverse socioeconomic effects on fisheries and related industries. Disper sants reduce both sheen and oil in the upper 2 m of the water column more quickly than mechanical recovery or natural processes, and thus would be exp ected to allow for the rapid removal of oil and a faster resumption of offshore commercial fishing activities. Current restrictions make it unlikely for dispersants to be applied near any coastal fisheries or shallow water or intertidal harvested mollusk and shellfish beds, eliminating any direct effect of dispersant use on nearshore commercial and recreational fisheries. Offshore fisheries could be at risk from application of dispersants, but field trials of disp ersants have demonstrated that after application, dispersed oil is rarely detect able more than a few meters, usually less than 5 or 10, below the surface (NRC, 1989). Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning In situ burning will act to reduce the sheen and surface oil more quickly than mechanical recovery or natural removal, allowing for a more rapid resumption of commercial and recreational fishing and a reduction in the risk of adverse socioeconomic effects to fisheries and related indust ries. Although in situ burning can have some ecological impacts such as a \"small adverse effect\" on the upper reaches of the water column, including fish eggs or larvae, and possibly on benthic resources because of sinking residue, these effects are expected to be very localized in nature, less severe than ex posure to the oil itself, and insignificant in terms of adverse impacts on the fishing industry (NOAA, 2002b, c). Thresholds and Recovery Patterns There is no specific threshold or quantifiable relationship between the amount of oil spilled and the impact on commercial and recreational fisheries in the spill area. For example, a fishery might be cl osed for an extended period of time following a spill event to protect the integr ity of the products from the spill area in the market. Similarly, a fishing fleet may be unable to access a fishery, given the need to close to allow for effectiv e spill response, even in the absence of local surface oiling. The severity and dur ation of damage to a fishery resulting from an oil spill will be influenced both by the amount of oil spilled and the retention time of the oil in that particular environment, among other factors. Estimating the impact of an oil spill on a fishery requires consideration of factors such as spill location, weather condit ions at the time of the spill, oil type, seasonality of the spill, cleanup effectiven ess, and fishery characteristics. Absent spill specific information, it is expected that such impacts will, on average, be linearly related to the area of surface water swept by oil that supports commercial and recreational fisheries. Results based on specific monetary measures of damage to specific fisherie s, if they could be developed, would not be expected to differ significantly from the risk metrics presented in this analysis (Transportation Resear ch Board, 2001). Irrespective of the conditions that occur at a particular spill site, any mech anism for reducing the quantity of oil Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-60 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options spilled and the amount of time that the oil remains in contact with the environment will mitigate the impact on commercial and recreational fisheries. 4.3.5.5. Subsistence Impacts of Oil Spills When an oil spill damages natu ral resources, it is likely to harm local subsistence users as well as commercial fishermen. In some coastal areas, portions of the population rely on regional fisheries and marine species for subsistence or as part of an artisanal economic system \u2014a system in which resources are harvested, sold, and consumed within the local community. Individuals in areas such as Prince William Sound, Alaska, rely on their own harvests from the ocean for a significant portion of their diets. These individuals may experience the effects of a spill more directly than the general population, which relies on a more widespread and commercially available selection of foods. Subsistence use of natural resources has value beyond that of a food source. Many communities associate their subsistence use with their ethnic and cultural identities, subscribing to a unique lifestyle built around environmental awareness and interaction with the same natural resources that are susceptible to injury from oil spills. Damage to these resources not only disrupts a major source of food for these communities, but it also can cause a loss of cultural identity. As a result, cash payments or replacement food supplies cannot compensate fully for losses caused by an oil spill, as subsistence use incorporates aspects of history, culture, social identity and family, and food supply. Species collected and consumed in subs istence communities include finfish, bivalves, crustaceans, octopus, squid, seals, walruses, whales, waterfowl, seaweed, and algae. The state of Alaska has a large population of Native people who rely on marine mammals, birds, fish, and shellfish for subsistence (Field et al., 1999). Harvesting marine fish, invertebrates, and alga e is also very important in the Native Hawaiian culture. Little research has been done on oil contamination of subsistence species other than fish and invertebrates; therefore, these groups will be th e primary focus of this review. In general, finfish seldom become tainted because they are able to avoid oiled areas and can rapidly metabolize oil (L aw and Hellou, 1999; Law et al., 1997; Moller et al., 1989), while sh ellfish are more likely to become contaminated because of their lack of mobility an d feeding strategies. The level and persistence of contamination in shellfish depends on the behavior of the oil, shoreline types, and cleanup technique s used. Typically, wind and currents transport floating oil on the water surface to the shoreline where it strands. Stranded oil can directly coat intertidal habitats, organisms, and fishing and cultivation equipment. If large volumes of oil penetrate permeable substrates, such as sand beaches, gravel beaches, and rocky rubble shores, there can be episodic releases of relatively fresh oil. If these areas are also sheltered from direct wave energy, the potential for long-term persistence of oil is greatly increased. Natural remova l processes usually include physical breakup and dispersal of persistent oil residues over a period of months to years, during which time it remains available to intertidal and shallow subtidal beds of mussels, oysters, and clam s (Hayes and Michel, 1999; Shigenaka and Barnea, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-61 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options 1997; Shigenaka and Henry, 1995). The longest fishery closure periods have been for bivalves in areas where sedime nts remained heavily contaminated for long periods of time (up to 19 months) following spills (Fall and Field, 1996). Tissue samples collected from harbor seals and sea lions following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill showed very low accumulations of PAHs in blubber even for highly exposed animals. These results indicate that marine mammals are able to metabolize oil and prevent accumulation even in blubber (Field et al., 1999). Regardless of the actual degree of taint or contamination of su bsistence resources, confidence in the safety of harvesting species that typically make up the majority of the diets of Native Alaskans was severely affected following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Field et al., 1999). De spite multiple reports based on extensive monitoring of subsistence seaf ood stating that finfish from all areas were safe to consume, but that intertidal shellfish from specific contaminated areas should not be consumed, post-spill harvests of marine species declined dramatically in Native villages (Fall, 1999; Fall an d Field, 1996). After the first post-spill year, the amount of resources harvested gradually increased but after 5 years still averaged less than the amount harvested prior to the spill (Fall, 1999). In addition to fears about consuming contaminated food items, Native villagers were very concerned about the future of the re source populations, considering the large number of dead and dying birds, marine mammals, and invertebrates they witnessed on their beaches, and they chos e to harvest less or not harvest certain species at all (Fall, 1999). Even assuming high consumption rates, the possibility of a subsistence seafood consumer being exposed to hydrocarbon levels high enough to cause an acutely toxic effect is unlikely. No adverse ef fects were observed in rats exposed to doses of 150 mg/kg/d of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) for 1 to 4 da ys (Danz et al., 1991; Nousianen et al., 1984). The highest concentrations of PA Hs reported for mussels collected from contam inated areas following the EXXON VALDEZ spill were 45.2 mg/kg (dry weight) in one study, and approximately 25 mg/kg (wet weight) in another (Bence and Burns, 1995; Short and Harris, 1996). A concentration of 34 mg/kg (wet weight) for PAHs was reported for a finfish collected following the NOWRUZ spill in the Gulf of Arabia (Fayad et al., 1996). Reported values for most finfish and shellfish samples collected from spills are much lower than these, and ev en these levels would appear to pose little acute toxicity risk to the general population. Certain population groups, such as pregnant women and children, may experience adverse effects at lower exposure levels than the general population, as was the case in studies on reproduction in mice exposed to high levels of BaP (Legraverend et al., 1984; Mackenzie and Angevine, 1981). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-62 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Open-ocean mechanical recovery will reduce the amount of oil that reaches important nearshore harvest areas, which would benefit subsistence resources. However, mechanical recovery operations, especially along the shoreline and in traditional harvest areas, may influence harvesting patterns. Following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill, Native communities were severely disrupted by the intrusiveness of the massive clea nup effort (Peacock and Field, 1999). Almost all villagers abandoned their normal ways of life to assist in oil recovery, to monitor the oil path while fisheries were closed, and to rescue and to collect dead and dying wildlife (Peacock and Fi eld, 1999). Intracommunity relationships were stressed, as Native Alaskans, particularly those who owned boats, were offered monetary compensation to assist in the cleanup effort, resulting in debates within the communities about the morality of aiding the polluter (Russell et al., 1996). Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion Dispersants are not likely to be directly applied to floating oil in nearshore areas where many subsistence harvest activities occur. Intertidal habitats could be exposed to dispersed oil that is carried cl ose to shore by currents after offshore application. Yet, overall impacts on intertidal habitats and to seals and sea lions when they are hauled out on the shoreline will be reduced compared with floating oil slicks. In the water column, chemical dispersion w ill increase the risk of oil exposure and potentially taint organisms in the upper layers of the water column compared with floating oil (NRC, 1989). Following the BRAER oil spill of 84,700 tonnes of light crude oil, hurricane-force winds caused the oil to naturally disperse into the water column, resulting in contaminated bottom sediments and tainted benthic organisms, including haddock, dab, lobsters , and scallops (Topping et al., 1997). The wild fishery was closed for 2 months, while the lobster fishery was closed for over 6 years (Kingston, 1999). Even in the absence of an actual health threat or closure, subsistence users can lose conf idence in the safety of seafood. Hearing that the oil is being dispersed into the wa ter column may increase their fear that seafood may not be safe to eat. Chemical dispersion can increase the risk of tainting filter-feeding bivalves because they can readily uptake dispersed oil. Ackman et al . (1991) found that scallops experimentally exposed to chemic ally dispersed oil in the water column had hydrocarbon levels several orders of magnitude higher than scallops exposed to crude oil alone. Sensory panelists were able to recognize taint in scallops that had been exposed to dispersed oil more easily than taint in scallops that were exposed to oil alone. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-63 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning Impacts on subsistence resources from open-ocean in situ burning could result from exposure to the untreated oil and semisolid, tar-like burn residues that float, strand onshore, or sink in harvest areas. Studies have shown that about half of internationally transported crude oils tested tend to sink in seawater after burning (Buist and Trudel, 1995). Impacts from untreated oil will be similar to those discussed above for oil, except that the reduction in the amount of stranded oil will result in lower numbers of potentially contaminated resources and fewer impacts on the subsistence community. Impacts on nearshore habitats and species from the sinking of burn residues will primarily be a result of physical coating of both animals and traps used to collect them. The extent of impact on subsistence users is likely to be small because only a small amount of residue will form. It is unlikely that water column organisms will be affected at the burn site because toxic volatile and soluble fraction s of oil are typically consumed in the fire (Campbell et al., 1994). Burning will ac tually reduce the risk of dissolution of these more bioavailable compounds. Overall, in situ burning should reduce the risk of impacts on subsiste nce resources and their users. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Recovery time \u2014return to background PAH levels or the absence of taint \u2014for subsistence resources varies greatly by species, duration of exposure, degree of contamination, metabolic capability, an d other factors. Case studies from several spills show that wild finfish are ra rely tainted; the duration of taint from the BRAER spill, during which a large amount of a light crude oil was naturally dispersed under storm conditions, was less than 1 month (Whittle et al., 1997). The duration of taint for lobsters following the NORTH CAPE spill, during which a No. 2 fuel oil was naturally dispersed during storm conditions, was between 2.5 and 5 months (Mauseth et al., 1997). Bivalves, particularly filter feeders, are likely to show elevated levels of PAHs shortly after exposure, although elimination rates can be rapid (less than 1 month) (Meador et al., 1995). Heavily oiled sediments can be a so urce of chronic exposure, such as at the SEA EMPRESS spill where intertidal mussels remained contaminated in one heavily oiled bay for 19 months after the spill (Law et al., 1997). 4.3.5.6. Historic Resources Impacts of Oil Spills Potential damage to cultural resources both on the shoreline and under the water, including historical sites, needs to be addressed following an oil spill, as do the risks associated with various cleanup options (Bittner, 1996). Floating oil on the water surface is not typically c onsidered to be a threat to cultural resources, as long as the oil stays offshore and does not adhere to intertidal or shoreline areas (Mobley et al., 1990). Shoreline resources are at much greater risk than underwater resources, since oi l rarely contaminates sediments enough to affect such areas, and subtidal cleanup is very rarely an issue. Resources in very shallow water could be affected by shoreline cleanup and nearshore operation of equipment. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-64 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options In Alaska, the types of cultural resources potentially present in the intertidal zone include stone and wooden remains, petrog lyphs, shipwrecks, piers and pilings, bone, shell, metal, textiles , leather, midden deposits, and other items and features that were historically associated with domestic and commercial facilities, villages, and cultural practices (Mobley et al., 1990). In Hawaii, cultural resources located along the shoreline include subsurface deposits, stone and food remains, broken tools, charcoal and pollen (used for dating), and remnants of trails and agricultural fields (Cordy, 2001). These resources are historically associat ed with permanent and temporary habitations, burials, an d religious structures, and they may be present in a variety of habitats, including lo w and high dunes, sandy flats, beaches, floodplains, and alon g rocky and clay shorelines (C ordy, 2001). In Puerto Rico, sites such as Spanish coloni al forts, bridgeheads, walls , and remnants are present in nearshore areas; artifacts such as shells and pottery pieces are present in sand dunes (McKinley and Pantel, 1995). Potential impacts on cultural resources du ring an oil spill include direct contact with oil, which may physically or chemica lly alter the artifact or feature (Mobley et al., 1990). One problem associated with th e physical coating of artifacts by oil is that the oil may render them temporarily unidentifiable by archaeologists, although, in most cases, oil is quickly removed by wave action (Mobley et al., 1990). Results from several studies (Bi ttner, Dekin, 1993; Reger et 1995) indicated that direct oiling caused negligible impacts on cultural resources following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill. Also, for those artifacts that were oiled, it was possible to clean them with detergents and degreasers, which will not damage th e artifacts if app lied properly (Mobley et al., 1990). Yet, hist orical structures al ong the shoreline were re-oiled daily in San Juan, Puerto Rico, following the 1994 MORRIS J. BERMAN spill of No. 6 fuel oil. Little is known about the chemic al effects of oiling, although there is some concern about foreign hydrocarbons affecting the possibility of using radiocarbon dating techniques on artifact s following spills (Mifflin & Associates, 1991; Mobley et al., 1990). Yet, Reger et al. (1992) found that radiocarbon dating was still accurate at sites contaminated with oil during the EXXON VALDEZ spill. Cultural resources can also be affected by the disturbance or destruction of resources during shoreline cleanup, with indirect effects resulting from the presence of cleanup crews in the area. So me cleanup techniques are more likely to cause damage to cultural resources than others (Mobley et al., 1990). For spills that affect cultural resources, clea nup guidelines often require that an archaeologist be present during cleanup at the site to assure that the cultural resources are not damaged during cleanup ac tivities, as well as to assure that artifacts are not removed by workers. Manual removal of oil and oily debris by hand, rake, shovel, or sorbent use may ca use disturbance to the sediments and the artifacts associated with them. Other indirect impacts on cultural resources may include the creation of debris or the movement of sediments or artifacts that may compromise the integrity of the site or later be misinterpreted by archaeologists as historical features. Mechanic al removal of oil and oile d sediments, as well as washing, flooding, and vacuuming, involves using heavy equipment that may damage artifacts. High-pressure washing, burning of oiled surfaces, using abrasives, and altering or removing any sediment have the potential for negative impacts on cultural resources (McKinley and Pantel, 1995; Mobley et al., 1990). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-65 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Therefore, open-water respon se options, such as mechanical recovery, chemical dispersion, and in situ burning, may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, which will also reduce the amount of shoreline clean up and disturbance of sensitive cultural resources. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effect of Mechanical Recovery No additional adverse impacts on cultural resources are expected to occur from mechanical recovery. Impacts on shoreline resources will be reduced by the amount of oil recovered. Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion The only documented chemical dispersion in association with cultural resources along shoreline habitats was during an experimental treatment of EXXON VALDEZ oiled shorelines in 1989 (Mobley et al., 1990). In this case, a dispersant was applied directly to oiled substrates potentially containing historical sites. No adverse impacts on cultural resources were recorded following the treatment. Because the proposed regulations apply only to waters where pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are generally demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore 12, and dilution is so rapid, impacts on cultural resources related to the chemical properties of dispersants are very unlikely. Impacts on the s horeline and intertidal resources, including cultural sites, will most likely be reduced when dispersants are used, compared with floating oil slicks. There are limited da ta that identify long-term or chronic degradation to cultural resources due to chemical dispersion. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning Impacts on shoreline cultural resources from open-ocean in situ burning may include the stranding of untreated oil and burn residues onshore. Burn residues are semisolid and tar-like, an d would most likely cause less harm to artifacts with which they came in contact than would untreated oil because less residue is likely to adhere to the artifacts. In situ burning may also reduce the amount of untreated oil that comes ashore. The only documented negative effect of in situ burning on cultural resources is the direct burning of artifacts in the intertidal zone, such as wooden shipwrecks (Mobley et al., 1990). Open-ocean in situ burning would be far enough offshore not to affect intertidal areas directly. The small amount of residue from in situ burning of oil on water would pose a minimal risk to subtidal historic sites if the residues sink. 12 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-66 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Thresholds and Recovery Patterns Two issues will trigger thresholds of concern for cultural resources: (1) the amount of oil that may damage an artifact, and (2) the amount of oil that would require shoreline cleanup and place the artifact at risk of damage during cleanup activities. There is no information from which to estimate the amount of oil that might damage specific types of artifacts. For cleanup-related impacts, the threshold would be the same as discussed for shoreline habitats. Recovery usually occurs at the completion of the cleanup activity; otherwise, the artifact may be permanently damaged. 4.3.5.7. Recreation and Tourism Impacts of Oil Spills Recreation and tourism in coastal areas can consist of visiting developed and undeveloped landscapes and doing on-water activities, such as swimming and boating. Expenditures for recreation and tourism can be a significant component of the local econom y. For example, in 1998, beach recreation in the state of California generated $14 billio n in direct revenue and $73 billion through indirect and induced benefits (Kingston, 1999). Major recreational and tourist resources include coastal beaches, barrier islands, estuarine bays, sounds, river deltas, and tidal marshes. These resources can be publicly owned (national seashores, parks, beaches, wildlife areas, or preservations) or privately owned (resorts, marinas, or amusement parks). Oil spills that occur near coastal area s can have a significant impact on recreation and tourism. The extent of the impacts depends on the following: The season in which the oil spill occurs Whether the oil comes ashore Whether a perception of contamination exists Whether there is a closure of a recreational beach, fishing waters, and/or boating areas The time period needed for natural resources to recover (e.g., whales may not return to popular whale-watching areas for an extended period of time) One key determinant of an oil spill's impacts on recreation and tourism is the season in which the spill occurs. Oil sp ills that occur immediately prior to or during peak seasons will have a more significant impact on local economies than oil spills occurring during off-pe ak months. For example, approximately 60,000 tonnes of oil washed ashore from the AMOCO CADIZ oil spill on March 16, 1978. As a result, 245,000 fewe r people visited Brittany, France, a popular tourist destination during July and August, in that year (NOAA, 1983). In contrast, impacts of the 1996 NORTH CAP E oil spill occurred from January to April, when recreational beach usage in southern Rhode Island is minimal (NOAA et al., 1999). Other regions of th e United States do not have such a significant divide between peak and off-peak tourism and recreation seasons; Padre Island National Seashore in Texas receives a significant number of visitors year-round (NPS, 2001a). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-67 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Although offshore oil spills have little direct impact on recreation and tourism (since oil never reaches the shoreline), ne arshore oil spills can result in coastal oiling and have a significant effect on lo cal economies and social welfare. While the presence of oil offshore could affect offshore recreational activities such as deep sea diving and fishing, recreation alists will generally have substitute locations for such activities, and the number of individuals involved is small compared with onshore and nearshore activities. The most detrimental impact is usually a beach closure, reducing the number of visitors and harming the local economy. When the AMERICAN TRADER ruptured, spilling almost 9,500 bbl of oil into the Pacific Ocean in 1990, 14 mi of beaches, including Huntington Beach, California, were closed for 23 days (NOAA and Oregon State University, 1992). The lost recrea tion days were valued at $13.2 million (State of California, 2001), wi th regional economic effect s likely far greater (e.g., lost revenues to local businesses). Even in the absence of an oiled shoreline, offshore oil spills can adversely affect recreation and tourism in coastal areas because of a perception of taint or a shutdown by a regulatory agency. A decrease in beach visits might occur because of the presence of a petroleum odor or ne ws coverage of the oil spill incident. In all cases, visitors may change their behavior, such as canceling a trip to the coastal region or choosing to recreate at a diff erent beach or parkland. Substitution of a less desirable recreational location, as well as loss in revenue from the local coastal community, would cause a reduction in social welfare (changes in producer and consumer economic surpluses or the benefits derived by consumers and producers from the exchange of goods and services). Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery Regulatory agencies can enact beach closures and recreational fishing moratoriums, or restrict watercraft usage in anticipation of the use of mechanical recovery equipment. No additional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism are expected to occur from mechanical recovery. Rather, mechanical recovery is expected to reduce the amount of oil in the ecosystem, thereby decreasing the amount of oil washing up on shore and minimizing impacts on recreation and tourism (less oil may decrease the length of any beach and/or fishery closures). Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion Chemical dispersion is a countermeasure used to reduce surface oil and its impact on the environment. The proposed regulations apply only to waters where pre-authorization agreement areas exist, which are generally demarcated as waters in the United States greater than 3 nm from shore 13. Therefore, it is unlikely that dispersants will affect any coastal areas, th us eliminating any direct adverse effect on nearshore recreational areas. In addition, as dispersants reduce the quantity of surface oil from a spill, less oil is likely to wash ashore and affect beach usage or 13 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-68 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options recreational fishing and boating. Finally, a rapid reduction in surface oil will minimize any moratoriums on recreational watercraft usage. Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning NOAA (2002a) believes that in situ burning reduces sheen and surface oil quicker than mechanical recovery or natural processes, thereby decreasing the risk of beach closure and allowing for a more rapid resumption of recreational and tourism activities. NOAA (2002b) further states that a properly planned in situ burning can mitigate the impact on coastal area s and associated recreation. However, in situ burning will also produce la rge quantities of highly visible black smoke that is potentially harmful to humans (see S ection 4.3.5.8 and NOAA, 2002c for more details). Although NOAA burning procedur es require that the smoke travel away from populated areas, the actual or pot ential presence of this smoke in a recreational area could result in a re duction in beach usage (NOAA, 2002d). Finally, although most burn residue will be mechanically removed or will sink, the residue could potentially wash ashore an d disturb the aesthetics of natural resources, thus leading to a reduction in recreation and tourism. Thresholds and Recovery Patterns There is no specific threshold or quantif iable relationship between the amount of oil spilled and the impact on recreation an d tourism in the spill area. For example, a recreational beach may be closed for an ex tended period of time following a spill event to allow for cleanup activities. Es timating the impact of an oil spill on recreation and tourism requires considering factors such as location of the spill, weather conditions at the time of the spill, oil type, seasonality of the spill, effectiveness of cleanup, and specific recrea tional activities that occur in the spill area. Absent spill-specific information, it is expected that such impacts will, on average, be linearly related to the area of surface water swept by oil and shoreline oiled that supports recreational activities . Results based on specific monetary measures of damage to specific areas, if they could be deve loped, would not be expected to differ significantly from the risk metrics presente d in this analysis (Transportation Research Board, 2001). Irre spective of the conditions that occur at a particular spill site, any mechanism for re ducing the quantity of oil spilled and the amount of time that the oil remains in c ontact with the environment will mitigate the impact on recreation and tourism. 4.3.5.8. Public Safety and Worker Health Impacts of Oil Spills Offshore oil spills do not gene rally represent a risk to public safety since the event occurs at a distance from potential populati on concentrations. Oil stranded on the shoreline can represent a risk of air poll ution or present a physical hazard to the public if the public comes in contact with the oil, but these concerns are generally minimal. Restricting access easily contro ls these risks. Any response option that reduces shoreline oiling will reduce these concerns. Worker health and safety is always a con cern but is less so with proper training. First responders who arrive on-scene before volatile compounds have evaporated could suffer from exposure to hydrocarbon fumes. Similarly, the presence of oil on equipment and vessels can increase the risk of injury. Application of dispersants can expose work ers to low levels of dispersants if Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-69 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options improperly applied. Proper planning and the use of protective equipment can be minimized by all these concerns. In the event of an offshore oil spill, in dividuals living in coastal communities are unlikely to experience any of the acute he alth effects associated with exposure to oil. However, spills in Alaska, Wale s, and Scotland measured significant elevations in mental health symptoms in local populations that included anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress di sorder. Researchers associate these symptoms with both the oil spill itself an d indirect effects such as the stress of potential loss of jobs or subsisten ce resources (Palinkas et al., 1993). For example, oil spilled offshore can contaminate fish, she llfish, marine mammals, birds, and other sources of food. Concerns regarding such contamination were so significant following the EXXON VALDEZ spill that representatives of state and federal agencies, Native Alaskan organizations, and Exxon formed a task force that analyzed tissue samples from affected species for oil-related contaminants. Only a few samples coll ected from the most heavily oiled locations exhibited elevated levels of contaminants, and public health warnings consisted of advising people against consuming anything that smelled of oil. Similar measures were taken following the NEW CARISSA spill off the coast of Oregon in 1999. While an oil spill may contaminate fish, shellfish, and other marine and coastal species, local, state, and federal health officials generally identify and publicize associated risks to reduce the likelihood of consumption and corresponding harm to human health. Impacts of Oil Spill Response Options The impacts would be related to water quality and air quality, in sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.1.2. Effects of On-Water Mechanical Recovery No additional adverse impacts on wate r quality are expected to occur from additional mechanical recovery compon ents. Mechanical re covery will improve air quality at a spill as a result of less oil on the surface to volatize, causing lower concentrations of MAHs, PAHs, and VOCs in the air. Air emissions from response vessels will be minor relative to the evaporation from the oil spill. Air and water-quality impacts will be reduce d by the additional amount of oil recovered. Effects of On-Water Chemical Dispersion Chemical dispersion in pre-authorization agreement areas will promote a temporary increase in the initial amounts of hydrocarbons that are dispersed and dissolved into the water column, but the dilution volume in offshore waters is very large, quickly mitigating this e ffect. Air quality impacts will be reduced if oil is dispersed. Air emissions from resp onse vessels or aircraft will be minor relative to the evaporation from the oil spill. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-70 2009 4.3. Anticipated Consequences of Oil Spills and Response Options Effects of On-Water In Situ Burning Water column quality impacts from unburn ed oil will be reduced by the amount of oil that is burned. Some of the burned oil would have entered the water column either as oil droplets or as disso lved components if the burning did not occur. Laboratory tests on in situ burn residue indicate d that toxic compounds were not leaching from the residue and the limited amount of burn residue produced would not be sufficient to noticeably affect water quality (Blenkinsopp et al., 1997). Fingas et al. (2001) identi fied ten substances of possible concern to human and environmental health: particulates, PA Hs, VOCs, dioxins and dibenzofurans, carbonyls, carbon dioxide, carbon mo noxide, sulphur dioxide, other gases (oxides of nitrogen), and \"hidden\" compounds. The net production of PAHs from burning would be less than those produced by evaporation. No exotic or highly toxic compounds are generated as a result of the combustion process, but that VOC concentrations ar e well above concern levels within 150 m of the fire. Measurement of dioxins and dibenzofurans in tests indicated that they were not being produced by crude or diesel fires. Carbonyls from diesel fuel fires are slightly higher than those produced from crude oil burns, but the low levels detected would not be a health concern. During a burn, carbon monoxide levels are usually at or below the lowest detection level do not pose any hazard to humans. Carbon monoxide has only been detected during an inefficient burn. Sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, were no t detected at significant levels during tests. Regarding any \"hidden\" compound s, an analysis of soot and residue samples identified several hundred compounds, but none were found to be of any environmental concern. (Fingas et al., 2001). Thresholds and Recovery Patterns The information is the same as that in sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.1.2. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-71 2009 4.4. Analytical Approach 4.4. A NALYTICAL APPROACH USED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF RESPONSE OPERATIONS 4.4.1. A NALYTICAL METHODOLOGY The impacts of oil spills are difficult to predict and are highly site and event specific. Understanding the potential impacts of the alte rnatives within this context is even more difficult. There is a large body of knowledge abou t the effects of oil spills that can be used to understand the broad implications of spills in ge neral, but the analysis of the alternatives is easier to understand if there are specific, quantitative estimates of how the various alternatives could benefit the environment by ch anging oil spill response options, as well as what any associated risks might be. The best approach to obtaining such estimates is through simulation modeling of potential o il spill events. Since there are broad regional differences in the current response capabilities and environmental concerns, the USCG has chosen to address impacts for each of the six geographic regions presented in Chapter 3. Oil spills vary dramatically in size, which is a major factor in determining risk, so the model examines the probable effects of a small (200- bbl), medium (2,500-bbl), and large (40,000\u00ad bbl) oil spill, as defined in Appendix I. Using the modeling results to confirm (or modify) the expectations from the scientific literature review allows for a more rigorous analysis of the risks and benefits of the alternatives. The analysis of the alternatives presented in this PEIS is based on combining four elements. First, the generic information presen ted in Section 4.3 is used to establish broad expectations for the effects of oil spills in general; these ex pectations establish a range of probable impacts for oil spills in the vari ous geographic regions. Second, a model was selected that can be run in a probabilistic mo de to examine average and extreme events, thus allowing for the analysis of oil spill fates, as well as biological exposure and effects; five representative locations of the six geogra phic regions around the United States were selected as sites of a detailed modeling using the oil spill model (Section 4.4.2 an Appendix I). Third, the results of the modeling effort we re evaluated using a relative risk approach (Appendix I). Finally, all this information was integrated to evaluate the expected regional impacts, which were used to develop a nation al perspective on the risks and benefits of the various alternatives (Sections 4.5 through 4.10). 4.4.1.1. Ecological Risk Analysis Risk matrices have a long history as a way to evaluate the interrelationship of scaled variables. Paul (1998) discusses their use as a basic decision tool for risk analysis. They have been used to support ri sk decisions in a wide range of areas, including such diverse subjects as business planning, engineering decisions, sales and promotion strategies, foreign policy, and military strategies to name only a few. Norton (1991) was an early proponent of the use of a risk matrix using spatial scale, temporal scale, and reversibility to address relative ecological risk. In a review of analytical approaches available for eco logical risk assessment, Norton (1996) reviewed the risk square approach for both economic and ecological risk evaluation. He concluded that it could be a valuable tool for both. According to Harwell et al. (1994), this approach is c onsistent with the goals and objectives of the USEPA's Ecology and Welfare Subcom mittee of the USEPA Relative Risk Reduction Project. They found that the \"ecological risk square can be useful for analyzing decisions that have long-term, di fficult to reverse, an d spatially pervasive Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-72 2009 4.4. Analytical Approach impacts\" (Harwell et al., 1994, p. 2-23). Foran and Ferenc (1999) reviewed available ranking methods that involve the use of matrices comparing stressors and endpoints and found them to be a useful analytical tool. The National Academy of Sciences (NRC, 1992) used a risk square as a \"project assessment matrix\" to interrelate human and ecological value scales as a way to plan and to analyze potential restoration projects for aquatic ecosystems; the goal was to find projects that met both ecological and sociological valu e scales. Belluck et al (1993) reviewed the utility of generic risk assessments for ecological planning decisions and concluded that a descriptive evaluation, supported by qua litative data, provided an appropriate level of detail. 4.4.1.2. Socioeconomic Risk Analysis The modeling of social and economic ef fects of enhanced spill response is framed in terms of the degree of risk posed to economic and social factors. For example, the modeling considers the length of beach oiled as a result of a modeled spill above an assumed threshold of concern to indicate the risk of effect of that spill on recreational acti vities. By comparing the degree of risk posed with economic and social factors under various spill response scenarios, the modeling generates estimates of the degree of risk reduction achieved. This analysis of the modeling does not attempt to express damages in absolute, monetary terms. The steps followed in modeling the eco nomic and social effects of enhanced spill response include describing the econom ic resources at risk in each modeled location, determining the best physical metrics to act as an indicator of economic damages (e.g., shoreline length oiled, surface water area oiled), establishing oil coverage thresholds above which the effects on the chosen physical resources are likely to be significant, modeling the extent and magnitude of oil coverage for a range of hypothetical spills, establishing the absolute risk of effects under each scenar io, and determining the relative risk of economic and social effects under each of the enhanced cleanup scenarios versus the basic response scen ario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit). In some cases the degree of expected risk to economic and social factors can be modeled directly. For example, it is possible to model the risk of effects to recreational activities by considering th e expected extent of oiling of sandy beaches under a variety of scenarios. Oil spills may also impose impacts on coastal communities and populations that cannot be modeled directly. For example, an oil spill that initially de creases revenue for tourism may have subsequent detrimental effects on other sectors of the local economy. Similarly, a spill may result in a change in equi ty. That is, low-income communities may rely more heavily on coastal resources than other subsections of the coastal populations and therefore may face more severe consequences from contamination of those resources. There are limitations inherent in any attempt to model the effects felt by coastal communities as a result of oil spills. This analysis of the modeling applies an approach to oil spill consequence assessments, specifically the risk of socioeconomic effects, which are based on an approach developed by an expert committee established by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the environmental performance of double-hull tanker design Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-73 2009 4.4. Analytical Approach alternatives (Transport ation Research Board, 2001). This approach was developed explicitly to compare the expected performance of alternative tanker designs in avoiding the environmental and socioeconomic effects of oil spills, and thus can be applied to assess the re lative risk of socioeconomic effects given alternative response measures. 4.4.2. Modeling and Risk Analysis Results Detailed results for each of the five modeled geographic locations are presented in the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). The risk matrices list the resources of concern that are analyzed. Some categories are combined where there was no difference in risk, such as coastal and marine water quality, so they may not match exactly the categories presented in Chapter 3. Some categories, such as public safety, could not be ev aluated using the model since they are not directly related to the model outputs. The data in the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004 ) are used throughout the alternat ives discussions in Sections 4.5 through 4.10 to evaluate the potential levels of concern. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-74 2009 4.5.- 4.10 Alternatives Analysis 4.5. E NVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES : ALTERNATIVE 1\u2014N O ACTION , WHEREBY NO CHANGE IN RESPONSE PLAN REGULATIONS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED This section addresses the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 1 \u2014No Action for the resources described in Chapter 3. Current practices provide for certain response and cleanup capabilities. The impacts of alternative 1 are based on the residual oil that remains after current practices have been applied and that residual is wh at is referred to in the following discussions of oil spills. Under Alternative 1, the USCG would not implement any changes to existing oil spill response regulations; therefore, the availability of all response options would remain unchanged. Responders would continue to rely primarily on mechanical recovery equipment to remove as much oil as possible from the water surface. Oil that is not removed by this method would be removed through natural recovery or shoreline cleanup methods. Chemical dispersion and in situ burning would continue to be used infrequently in areas with pre-authorization agreements. Under this alternative it is assu med that mechanical recovery and in situ burn capabilities are currently available in all six regions desc ribed in this PEIS. Although dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in all s ix regions (Figure 2.2-1), appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical di spersion in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania regions. However, in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, dispersant capabilities ar e available and their use for response operations is feasible (USCG, 1999); thus, chemical dispersion will only be discu ssed for these two regions. Table 4.5-1 shows the options available under Alternative 1 \u2014No Action for each of the six regions in this PEIS. Table 4.5-1 Response Options for Each Region under Alternative 1 Region Mechanical Recovery Chemical Dispersion In Situ Burning Atlantic Yes No Yes Caribbean Yes No Yes Gulf of Mexico Yes Yes Yes Pacific Yes No Yes Alaska Yes Yes Yes Oceania Yes No Yes Source: Adapted from USCG, 2009. As explained in the description of the analytical approach in Section 4.4 and Appendix I, the modeling and risk assessment performed to determine the effe cts of Alternative 1 are based on the assumption that a spill has occurred (n o beneficial impacts are expected from an oil spill). (To interpret the risk scores listed in the tables in Appendix I, Figure I-8.2 is provided for reference.) Potential effects on all resources within each region are based on the analysis of three representative spill sizes \u2014small (200 bbl), medium (2,5 00 bbl), and large (40,000 bbl). Effects for the small spill are extrapolated from the modeling results for the medium and large spills. The determination of potential effects from oil spills under Alternative 1 was based on the use of a concentration threshold fo r adverse effects; the selected values were 10 g/m 2 for oiled shoreline and 0.01 g/m2 for oiled surface water (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). Final PEIS for Oil 4-75 2009 4.5.- 4.10 Alternatives Analysis Under Alternative 1, it is assumed that current response options for each region are available and utilized in response operations (f or detailed results of the modeling and risk assessment, see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). It is important to note that, in terms of the potential environmental consequences, the results of mechanical recovery and mechanical recovery combined with in situ burning are very similar, with air quality being the only resource showing a quantifiable difference between the two response options. This is because the physical limitations for skimming and collecting the oil floating on the water are essentially the same for the two response options. As discussed in Sect ion 4.2.1.3, oil removed by in situ burning is equivalent to mechanical recovery, so shoreline, water surface, and water column effects remain unchanged. There are much greater differences when chemical dispersion is available (see Section 4.7). 4.6. E NVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES : ALTERNATIVE 2-INCREASE ON-WATER MECHANICAL RECOVERY CAPABILITY AND ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AERIAL TRACKING CAPABILITY This section describes the potential adverse and beneficial environmental impacts associated with Alternative 2 for the resources described in Chapte r 3. Thus, the same resources addressed above in the Environmental Consequences of Alternative 1 section are also addressed here. Since Alternative 1 consists of current response and clea nup capabilities, the impacts of Alternative 2 are in consideration of the residual oil remaining after the current response and cleanup capabilities are applied. Under Alternative 2 the USCG would revise the current regulations to require a 25 percent increase in the amount of mechanical r ecovery equipment that ve ssel planholders would be required to have available to respond to an oil sp ill. Planholders would also be required to establish and maintain aerial tracking capabilities. There woul d be no other changes to the current regulations, so no dispersant application or in situ burn capabilities would be requir ed. In addition, this alternative only requires the availability of response capabilities but does not mandate the use of any particular response capability (see Section 2.6.2 for more details). Based on the requirements established by this alternative, the material presented in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), and the results of the regulatory analysis (USCG, 2009), any actual increase in mechanical response equipment would be minima l in many (if not most) regions since current equipment stockpiles are well in excess of the current requirements14. Further, the results of the regulatory analysis indicate that increasing the requirement by 25 percent would not result in increased efficiency (see Section 2.6.2 for additiona l explanation); no additional oil would be removed from the water in the event of a mechanical -only recovery. As s hown in Table 4.5-1, in situ burn capabilities would continue to be available in all six geographic regions considered in this PEIS, and dispersant capabilities would be available and th eir use for response operati ons feasible only as currently pre-authorized in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. Thus, potential adverse and beneficial impacts on the environment under Alte rnative 2 would be equivalent to those under Alternative 1, which will not be repeated here (see Section 4.5 for more details). 4.7. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES : ALTERNATIVE 3-INCREASE ON-WATER MECHANICAL RECOVERY CAPABILITY , ESTABLISH ON-WATER DISPERSANT APPLICATION 14 Personal communication [e-mail], from Robert Pond, U.S. Coas t Guard Headquarters, Washington, D.C., to Paul Valihura, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, U.S. Department of Transportation, Cambridge, Mass., concerning the current availability of mechanical recovery, in situ burn, and dispersant applicat ion equipment, January 15, 2003. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-76 2009 4.5.- 4.10 Alternatives Analysis CAPABILITY (OPTION A), ESTABLISH IN SITU BURN CREDIT , AND ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AERIAL TRACKING CAPABILITY This section addresses the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 3 for the resources describe d in Chapter 3. Thus, the same resources addressed above in the Environmental Consequences of Alternative 1 section are also addressed here. Since Alternative 1 consists of current response and cleanup capabilities, the impacts of Alternative 3 are in consideration of the residual oil remaining after the current response and cleanup capabilities are applied. Based on the analysis of this alternative presented in Section 2.8.3, there would be no effect on the opportunities for mechanical recovery or in situ burning; further, the effectiv eness of both response options would not change. The key change would be to en sure the uniform availability of dispersant capability in the four regions \u2014Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania \u2014where appropriate response times cannot currently be met. For Alternative 3, dispersant Option A (Table 2.6-1) requires sl ightly less delivery capacity under Tier 1 (0 -12 hours) than Option B under Alternatives 4 and 5. For the purpose of this analysis, the USCG estimated how much oil could be treated during re sponse operations based only on Option B (Appendix D). This was done to simplify the analysis and to ensu re that exposure to dispersants and dispersed oil in the water column was considered at the highest potential levels. This requirement would apply only to planholders of tank vessels operating 3 or more nm from shore 15 where chemical dispersion has been pr e-authorized in accordance with the National Contingency Plan. The oil spill response community would continue to rely primarily on mechanical recovery equipment to remove as much oil from surface water as possible, but would also have access to chem ical dispersion in the four geographic regions \u2014Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania \u2014where appropriate response times cannot currently be met under the Alternative 1. Chemical dispersion and in situ burning would be used infreque ntly in all regions. Under this alternative, it is assumed that all response options discu ssed under Alternative 1 are available, and dispersant capability is al so uniformly available in the four geographic regions where appropriate response times cannot currently be met. This section focuses on the incremental changes in the potential adverse environmental effects in these four regions with the addition of chemical dispersion. Ta ble 4.7-1 shows the res ponse options available under Alternative 3 for each geographic region analyzed in this PEIS. Table 4.7-1 Response Options for Each Region under Alternative 3 Region Mechanical Recovery Chemical Dispersion In Situ Burning Atlantic Yes Yes Yes Caribbean Yes Yes Yes Gulf of Mexico Yes Yes Yes Pacific Yes Yes Yes Alaska Yes Yes Yes 15 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-77 2009 4.5.- 4.10 Alternatives Analysis Oceania Yes Yes Yes Source: Adapted from USCG, 2009. As explained in Section 4.4, the modeling and risk assessment performed to determine the significance of potential adverse effects of Al ternative 3 are based on the assumption that a spill has occurred (no beneficial effects are expected from an oil spill). (To interpret the risk scores listed in the tables in Sections 4.5 and 4.7, Appendix I, Figure I-8.2 is provided for reference.) Potential effects on all resources within each geographic region are based on the analysis of three representative spill sizes \u2014small (200 bbl), medium (2,500 bbl), and large (40,000 bbl). Effects for the small spill are ex trapolated from the modeling results for the medium and large spills. The determination of potential adverse effects from oil spills under Alternative 3 was based on the use of a concentration threshold for adverse effects: 10 g/m 2 for oiled shoreline and 0.01 g/m2 for oiled surface water (techni cal report [French McCay et al., 2004]). It is important to note that, in terms of pot ential adverse environmental consequences, the results of mechanical-only recovery and mechanical plus in situ burn response are very similar, with air quality being the only resource showing a quantifiable difference between the two response options. This is because the physical limitations for skimming and collecting the oil floating on the water are essentially the same for the two response options. As discussed in Appendix I, oil collected by in situ burning represents an equivalent reduction in oil that is recovered, so shoreline, water surface, and water column effects remain unchanged. Under Alternative 3, it is assumed that the response options for each region are available and utilized in response operations (for de tailed results of th e modeling and risk assessment, see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). Because Alternative 3 does not affect existing response options in the Gulf of Mexico or Alaska regions, these two regions are not discussed here (see Appendix J). For the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania regions, the anal ysis focuses on the changes that occur to the Alternative 1 basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addi tion of chemical disp ersion. The results of the analysis in Appendix J are summarized for ea ch resource, followed by a discussion of the potential adverse environmental effects fr om the addition of chemical dispersion. 4.8. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES : ALTERNATIVE 4-INCREASE ON-WATER MECHANICAL RECOVERY CAPABILITY , ESTABLISH ON-WATER DISPERSANT APPLICATION CAPABILITY (OPTION B), ESTABLISH IN SITU BURN CREDIT , AND ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AERIAL TRACKING CAPABILITY This section describes the potential adverse and beneficial environmental impacts associated with Alternative 4 for the resources desc ribed in Chapter 3. Thus, the same resources addressed above in the Environmental Consequences of Alternative 1 section are also addressed here. Since Alternative 1 consists of current response and clea nup capabilities, the impacts of Alternative 4 are in consideration of the residual oil remaining after the current response and cleanup capabilities are applied. Under Alternative 4 the USCG would revise the current regulations to increase the amount of mechanical recovery eq uipment that vessel planholders woul d be required to have available to respond to an oil spill at the levels required unde r Alternatives 2 and 3. The dispersant credit in the current regulations would be eliminated, with the USCG amending the curren t regulations to require Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-78 2009 4.5.- Alternatives Analysis planholders to establish dispersant application capa bility equipment (Option B) to respond to an oil spill. (Option B requires more delivery capacity under Tier 1 [0 -12 hours] than Option A requires.) This requirement would apply only to planholders of tank vessels operating 3 or more nm from shore where chemical dispersion has been pre-authorized16 in accordance with the National Contingency Plan (NCP). Planholders would also have the opportunity to apply for an in situ burn credit to offset the requirements for mechanical recovery and woul d be required to establish and maintain aerial tracking capabilities. In addition, this alternative only requires th e availability of response capabilities but does not mandate the use of an y particular response capability (see Section 2.6.5 for more details). Based on the requirements established by this alternative, the material presented in the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), and the results of th e regulatory analysis (USCG, 2009), mechanical recovery and in situ burn equipment is already maintained in all six geographic regions considered in this PEIS (Table 4. 5-1). As explained under Alternative 1, any increase in mechanical response equipment would be minimal in many (if not most) regions and the new requirement would not result in increased efficiency or additional o il being removed from the water. Thus the impacts associated with increasing the level of mechanical recovery equipment would be equivalent to those under Alternative 3. For Alternative 4, dispersant Option B (Table 2.6-1) requires slightly more delivery capacity under Tier 1 (0 -12 hours) than dispersant Option A under Alternative 3. For the purpose of this analysis, however, the USCG estimate d the amount of oil that could be treated during response operations based only on Option B (Appendix B). This was done to simplify the analysis and to ensure that exposure to dispersa nts and dispersed oil in the water column was considered at the highest potential levels. Therefore, potential advers e and beneficial impacts on the environment under Alternative 4 would be equivalent to those under Al ternative 3, which will not be repeated here (see Section 4.7 for more details). 4.9.

The im pacts associated with maintaining the level of mechanical recovery equipmen t would be equivalent to those under Alternative 1 (and Alternative 3) since any increase in mechanical recovery equipment will not increase the amount of oil treated because adding more mechanical recovery equipment would not increase the number of opportunities to use that equipment. Under Alternative 5, dispersant Option B (Table 2.6-1) requires slightly more delivery capacity under Tier 1 (0-12 hours) than dispersant Option A under Alternative 3. For the purpose of this analysis, however, the USCG estimated the amount of oil that could be treated during response operations based only on Option B (Appendix B). This was done to simplify the analysis and to ensure that exposure to dispersa nts and dispersed oil in the water column was considered at the highest potential levels.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-81 2009 4.11.- 4.15 Alternatives Summary 4.11. C OMPARING THE ALTERNATIVES This section summarizes and compares the national -level conclusions regard ing the significance of potential adverse and beneficial impacts associated with the alternatives considered in this PEIS. As explained throughout Chapter 4, the analysis perf ormed to determine the significance of potential adverse and beneficial impacts of each alternative is based on the assumpti on that an oil spill has occurred. Thus, the impacts presented in Sections 4.5 through 4.10 and Appendix J represent the adverse and beneficial impacts of an oil spill with the alternatives on the regional-level. However, it is important to clarify that the each alternative results in the removal of different quantities of floating or stranded oil after an oil spill. The su mmary of impacts from the response options of the alternatives are presented in Section 4.11, which compares the national- level overall potential impacts on physical, biological, and socioec onomic resources under the six alternatives. As described in Chapter 2, the al ternatives relate to the availability of oil spill response options. The alternatives do not mandate the use of any particular oil spill resp onse option. Thus, the actual use of any particular response option remains at the discretion of the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC). The alternatives are not expected to change the actual use of mechanical recovery and in situ burning in any region or of chemical dispersion in the Gulf of Mexico or Alaska regions. In addition, the alternatives are not expected to affect oil spill response operations in areas closer to shore than those covered under existing pre-authorization agreements (Figures 2.2-1 and 2.2-2). Alternativ es 3, 4, 5, and 6 would ensure the uniform availability of dispersant ca pability in the four regions \u2014Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania \u2014where appropriate response times cannot cu rrently be met. The modeling developed in support of this PEIS is presented in detail in the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and is summarized in Appendix I. The modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and literature review (Section 4.3) show that, on the regional level, potential adverse impacts on physical, biological, and socioeconomic resource s are insignificant to minor for small (200-bbl) spills that occur 3 or more statute mi 19,20 offshore. The analysis also shows that, as expected, the level of potential adverse impacts increases with spill size . Potential adverse impacts from medium (2,500-bbl) and large (40,000-bbl) spills are highly related to the spill location, as potential adverse impacts on sensitive resources largely depend on the resources' presence and distribution. Thus, potential adverse impacts depend on the spill size and location re lative to sensitive or important resources. As discussed above, the actual use of mechanical recovery and in situ burning is not expected to change under the different alternatives. In general, it was estimated that these two oil spill response options would offer limited protection to physical, biological, and socioeconomic resources when compared with a hypothetical natural removal response option (no cleanup action). Because of the difficulties inherent in collecting oil at sea, these two response options frequently do not result in the recovery of large amounts of oil, and only a limited amount (generally considered to be less than 15 percent) of the oil is likely to be recovered on water using mechanical recovery or in situ burning, regardless of how much equipment is employed. 19 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, 2004). 20 Statute miles were used instead of nautical miles due to default options within the computer-modeling program. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-82 2009 4.11.- 4.15 Alternatives Summary While the analysis shows that mechanical recovery can provide some environmental benefits, there is still the potential for oil spills to cause moderate to si gnificant adverse impacts on the physical, biological and socioeconomic resources. As explained in Appendix I, in situ burning is not expected to change the amount of oil removed from the marine environment. This is because the physical limitations for skimming and collecting oil floating on the water are essentially the same for both mechanical recovery and in situ burning. Thus, the potential adverse and beneficial impacts on the physical, biological and socioeconomic resources would not change since it is assumed that in situ burning would simply replace me chanical recovery. Finally, as discussed in Sections 4.5 and 4.7, even though air quality impacts would be different under in situ burning, they would be loca lized and insignificant. The analysis considered two disp ersant efficiencies (45 and 80 pe rcent) and compared the results to a scenario with no dispersant application. As expected, based on scientific knowledge and experience, the modeling showed that chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent efficiency would be expected to significantly increase the amou nt of dispersed oil, removing correspondingly more oil from the water surface and thereby redu cing the length of shoreline oiled and surface water areas swept by floating oil above thresholds of concern. However, since the distribution of organisms in the marine environment is not random and varies seasonally, it is difficult to quantify the magnitude of potential benefits. Overall, the analysis shows that the uniform availab ility of dispersant capability has the potential to provide additional protection to certain biological and socioeconomic resources, including sensitive resources that recover relatively slowly such as intertidal habitats, sea turtles, and marine and coastal birds. Chemical dispersion capability, which is required under Alternatives 3, 4, 5, and 6, would be expected to reduce the level of potential adverse impacts proportional to the estimated reduction in shoreline length and surface water area oiled. However, chemical dispersion would not eliminate the potential adverse impacts posed by oil spills in the marine environment. Additionally, dispersed oil in the water column has the potential to adversely affect a different set of sensitive resources. As expected, the analysis shows that when chemical dispersion is used, there is a large increase in the volume of water contaminated above the assu med threshold of concer n. However, for both medium and large spills, the volumes estimated represent only a small fraction of the total dilution volume available. Given dispersant application offshore and in deep water, the results of the analysis presented in Sections 4.5 and 4.7 indicate that the potential adverse impacts on water quality and water column communities are not expected to be significant. The results of the analysis are consistent with the expected results described in Section 4.3 and Appendix J, based on a review of the scientific literature and observation s from actual spills. The results of the analysis are also consistent with the logic that suppo rts the establishment of the pre-authorization agreement areas \u2014chemical dispersion is acceptable when re asonable dilution can be anticipated. In addition, the FOSCs can, on the advice of their scientific support team, adjust the dispersant application to avoid sensitive resources (see Section 2.3). Finally, the results of the analysis show that the potential benefits associat ed with chemical dispersion are higher for medium oil spills than for large oil spills. Spill response already includes aircraft for tracking and vessels for response operations, so there is no anticipated change in emissions from these sources. Even so, relative to the evaporation from the oil slick, emissions from aircraft or vessels that are applying dispersants are a minor concern. Tables 4.11-1 through 4.11-1 su mmarize the impacts of the alternatives. The impacts are the effects from the application of th e oil spill response options, including the effects of the residual oil that results from the use of those response options. The impacts are both beneficial and adverse, and their intensity scale ranges from insignificant, to minor, to major, to significant.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2009 4-86 4.11.- 4.15 Alternatives Summary 4.11.1. Preferred Alternative Alternative 5 is the USCG preferred alternative. This alternative would produce the same increase in oil treated as Alternatives 3, 4, and 6 because it requires the same quantity of dispersant application equipment. The historical oil spill data in Section 2.8 indicates a considerable increase in the perc entage of oil spills th at could be responded to under Alternatives 3 - 6 when compared with that under Alternatives 1 and 2. In addition, as stated in Chapter 2, since the increase in mechanical recovery equipment (under Alternatives 2, 3, and 4) and the credit for in situ burn equipment (under Alternatives 3, 4, and 6) would not increa se the quantity of oil removed or treated, requiring those additional capabilities does not offset the costs incurred in establishing and maintaining them. Alternative 5 provides the largest potential net environmental benefit and meets the objectives of th e USCG to increase the response plan equipment capability requirements for tank vessels and MTR facilities, protect the marine environment, and promote maritime safety at reasonable cost and with substantial benefit. 4.12. U NAVOIDABLE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED ACTION The analysis of the alternatives, including Alternative 1, shows that no significant adverse environmental impacts are expect ed to occur. Minor to moderate adverse impacts could occur for some resources; however, these unavoidable im pacts are expected to be localized and short lived. The six alternatives would result in oil sp ill response storage and maintenance activities. However, the oil spill response community has resources available to satisfy the requirements of all alternatives 21. The negligible adverse impacts associated with the facilities used for storage and maintenance would be equivalent in significance to those associated with low-intensity industrial development. In the event of an oil spill, the alternatives would influence what response options are immediately available for consideration by the oil spill response co mmunity. Based on the analysis of the alternatives, it is expected that a ll available response options have the potential to reduce the unavoidable adverse impacts associated with an oil spill, relative to the natural recovery of the spill area. The final decision con cerning the use of the re sponse options is the FOSC's responsibility. The FOSC would select those response options that have the higher potential to minimize adverse environmental impacts. 4.13. I RREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES Based on the relatively infrequent occurrence of oil spills and the nature of the alternatives, implementing the alternatives would not result in a significant commitment of resources beyond those already in place, and in no case would the commitment amount to important irreversible or irretrievable losses. Currently, the oil spill response community ha s resources available to satisfy all alternatives22. However, implementing a response operation would require a commitment of 21 Personal communication [e-mail], from Robert Pond, U.S. Co ast Guard Headquarters, Washingt on, D.C., to Paul Valihura, John A.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-87 2009 4.11.- 4.15 Alternatives Summary these resources, as well as energy resources re quired for deployment. Any alternative, including Alternative 1, would require th e maintenance and uniform availability of a relatively limited supply of oil spill response equipment and associate d infrastructure. This would result in the utilization of nonrenewable re sources; however, the demand that this would place on environmental resources is expected to be mini mal when compared with national demand from all economic sectors. 4.14. R ELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SHORT -TERM USE OF MAN'S ENVIRONMENT AND THE MAINTENANCE AND ENHANCEMENT OF LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY The objective of the alternatives is to improve the nation's ability to resp ond to oil spills, thereby minimizing the extent of potential adverse enviro nmental impacts. The results of the analysis of the alternatives, including Alternative 1, show that no significant adverse short-term impacts are expected to occur beyond those adverse impacts that already occur during and after an oil spill. Alternatives 3 through 6 are the only alternatives that modify the current conditions. Before an oil spill occurs, the implicati ons of these alternatives are restricted to making response aircraft for dispersant application and respon se vessels for mechanical or in situ burn equipment uniformly available. When an oil spill o ccurs, the six alternatives have the potential, when used appropriately, to mitigate the potential long-term loss of productivity that might result from the adverse environmental impacts of the spilled oil. The results of the analysis for the alternatives indicate that there would be an environmental bene fit from any of the response options that are available. This potential environmental benefit would be more evident when chemical dispersion is used in the current pre-author ization agreement areas (Figure 2.2-1), thus potentially reducing the adverse impacts on the shoreline and on sensitive organisms that congregate on the water's surface. Both of these ha bitats are highly vulnerable to spille d oil and can lead to adverse impacts that can last, in some cases, for decades. Ultimately, however, even severe oil spills are recoverable events, and the actions available under any alternative have the potential to enhance the rate of recovery. 4.15. C UMULATIVE IMPACTS This section summarizes the cumulative impacts of the alternatives analyzed in this PEIS. Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations that implement the procedural provisions of NEPA define A cumulative impact is defined as \"the impact on the environment, which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions\" (40 CFR \u00a7 1508.7). Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time. Typically, a cumulative-impacts analysis predicts th e additive effects of existing similar activities that recur frequently in the affected area, a proposed action not yet implemented, and public and private plans that might occur in the future and affect resources. The focus of this PEIS is on th e analysis of the environmental consequences of oil spill response regulations for vessel response plans and marine transportation-related (MTR) facility response plans. As context for cumulative impacts, the foll owing is a discussion of historical background on oil spills and oil spill response. Petroleum input into North American waters comes from four main sources: (1) natural seeps, a natural phenome na that occurs when crude oil seeps from the geological strata beneath the seafloor to the overlying water column; (2) petroleum extraction activities, which can result in the release of crude oil and refined products as a result of human activities associated with efforts to expl ore for and produce petroleum; (3) petroleum transportation, which can result in oil spills associated with tanker a ccidents and operational Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4-88 2009 4.11.- 4.15 Alternatives Summary releases; and (4) petroleum consumption, (N RC, 2003). Petroleum consumption can include such elements as leakage and runoff. Large oil spills are rare events, are widely distributed in space and time, and represent a very small proportion of the total oil input into U.S. waters. Tank vessel spills represent approximately 2 percent of the petroleum input into North Americ an marine waters (NRC, 2003). While tending to be concentrated around shipping lanes and near por ts, oil spills are widely distributed in space and time and represent a very small proportion of th e total input. The remaining 98 percent of the petroleum input into North American waters is associated mostly with natural seeps and petroleum consumption activities, and to a lesser degree from petroleum extr action activities. Thus, on the national level, oil spills are not the driving factor in determining the potential impacts associated with hydrocarbon pollution in North American waters. In addition, hydrocarbon pollution impacts have been noted usually in areas beyond the scope of this PEIS, such as harbors or enclosed water bodies with multiple source s of hydrocarbons. Oil spill response capabilities at the national and lo cal level are expected to remain at the current level or increase, apart from the response alternatives evaluated in this PEIS. Regulatory entities, such as states, ports and municipalities may requi re their own response capabilities. Commercial firms may increase response capabilities on their own, regardless of requirements. Therefore, given current response capabilities and the possible in crease of response capabilities aside from these alternatives, the oil spill response alternatives would be expected to have an insignificant cumulative beneficial impact. The alternatives could more significantly reduce the potential adverse impacts of oil spills at a local leve l in U.S. waters, and the cumulative beneficial impact could be greater than for national leve l. Overall, the action alternatives for oil spill response in this PEIS would be expected to resu lt in insignificant cumulative beneficial impacts to the physical environment; biological resources; coastal, aquatic and marine resources; and socioeconomic resources in the United States.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 6-46 2009 CHAPTER 7 GLOSSARY 305(b) Report The National Water Quality Inventory, commonly referred to as the 305(b) report, is a biennial report to Congress and the public prepared under Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). It contains information from each state on the quality of the nation's rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, coastal waters, and ground water, along with information on public health and aquatic life concerns, and various programs implemented to restore and protect U.S. waters. Advection The movement of oil in the ocean due to the influence of overlying winds and underlying currents. Aerial tracking Following the movement of an oil spill in the ocean environment and collecting information on se veral important characteristics of the spill using trained oil spill monitoring personnel operating fixed-wing or rotary aircraft capable of sustained operations over water. This allows response managers to more effectively and efficiently deploy the appropriate response resources for removal. Alaska region One of six geographic regions with reasonably unique environmental conditions in which oil spill respon se operations could occur, this region includes the coast of Alaska. Anadromous Fish that hatch in fresh water, migrate to sea, spend most of their life in the ocean, and then return to freshwater natal streams to spawn and die. Anthropogenic Of, relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Apex predators Predators at the top of a local food web (the interconnected feeding relationships in an ecosystem). Typically, they suffer little predation from other carnivores, and they limit the population densities of their prey. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 7-1 2009 7.

API \u00b0 gravity is measured by a hydrometer instrument having a scale graduated in degrees API. The higher the API \u00b0 gravity, the lighter the oil. The entity appointed by the president consisting of members from qualified personnel of federal, state, and loca l agencies with responsibilities that include preparing an Area Contingency Plan (ACP) for an area designated by the president, as stated in the CWA sections 311(a)(18) and (j)(4). The Area Committee determines the pote ntial oil spill risks and devises strategies to mitigate oil spills in the most environmentally protective manner practicable, including adopting dispersant and in situ burn pre-authorization agreements in a given area. Prepared by an Area Committee that is developed to be implemented in conjunction with the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) and Regional Contingency Plan (RCP), in part to address removal of a worst case discharge (WCD) and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility operating in or near an area designated by the president, as provided by the CWA sections 311(a)(19) and (j)(4).

Glossary Bioassay A laboratory test or other assessm ent utilizing a living organism to determine the effect of a condition to which the organism is exposed. Such tests are performed under controlled environmental conditions and duration. The dosage of interest is typically the lethal concentration, known as LC50, that kills 50 percent of the population of organisms in a given period of time. Chronic bioassay tests indicate sublethal effects, such as changes in growth or reproduction of the organism over a longer period of time. Bioavailability The rate and extent to which a chemical is absorbed and is available for use by the body or the tendency of a contaminant such as oil to partition in a form conducive to uptake by organisms. Biodegradation The process by which naturally occurring bacteria and fungi consume hydrocarbons found in oil as a food source, and excrete carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Biota The flora and fauna of a region. Boom A temporary floating barrier used to contain and divert an oil spill. Booming The practice of containing and diverting oil within a temporary floating barrier. Bunker washings Discharges when bunker holding tank s or compartments are cleaned out with water.

Burn boom (burning boom) A floating barrier used to corral oil constructed of fireproof materials and designed to withstand prolonged periods of exposure to heat and flames during in situ burn operations. ( See also Fireproof boom and Fire-resistant boom.) Burn residue Unburned oil following an in situ burn event. The physical properties of burn residue depend on burn efficiency and oil type. Efficient burns of heavy crude oils generate brittle, solid residues (like peanut brittle); residues from efficient burns of other crude oils are described as semisolid (like cold roofing tar). Inefficient burns generate mixtures of unburned oil, burned residues, and soot that are sticky, ta ffy-like, or semiliquid. Depending on water density, initial density of the spilled oil, oil slick thickness, and efficiency of the in situ burning, burn residues may either sink or float. Burn residues have less volatile hydrocarbons with low boiling points, are denser and more viscous than unburned oil, and show relative enrichment in metals and the higher molecular weight polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). By-catch A species caught in a fishery intended to target another species, as well as reproductively immature juveniles of the target species. By-catch is a serious issue that can contribu te to species endangerment.

Crude oil A general term for unrefined petroleum or liquid petroleum as found in the earth, before it is refined into oil products. It is a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in liquid phase in underg round reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing th rough surface separating facilities. Crude oil varies greatly in its properties, namely specific gravity and viscosity. Demersal Living near, deposited on, or sinking to the bottom of the sea. Detrital Refers to dead organic matter; however, some researchers define detritus as both the dead organic matter and the associated microbial community. Dispersant Liquid chemical is applied in large qua ntities to an oil spill to break down the oil into small droplets that will spread throughout the water column. This helps to increase the surface area of the oil spill, which increases the rate at which the oil can be degraded or weathered into less toxic substances. ( See Surfactant.) Dispersant recovery efficiency The operating effectiveness of the disp ersant or the percentage of released oil that is removed or recovered from the water. The greater the efficiency, the more effective the dispersant. Dissolution The transfer of oil components from a slick on the surface into solution in the water column.

Glossary Evaporation Facility response plan (FRP) Fate and effects model Fathom Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) Fireproof boom Fire-resistant boom The preferential transfer of light- and medium-weight components of oil from the liquid phase to the vapor phase and into the atmosphere. Per agreement signed by 27 federal departments and agencies in April 1987 and developed under the authorities of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7701 et seq.) and the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 3231 et seq. ), as amended by the Stafford Disaster Relief Act of 1988, t h i s d e t a i l e d p l a n m u s t b e p r e p a r e d in accordance with the oil pollution prevention regulation (40 CFR 112.20) by facilities that may cause \"substantial harm\" to the environment or exclusive economic zone. The plan must contain an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) and demonstrate that a facility has the resources to respond to a WCD oil spill. The fate or changes in the chemical composition of oil released into the environment is due to weathering. Weathering occurs by evaporation, microbial degradation, chemical oxidation, and photochemical reactions. In offshore environments fate processe s also include the impact of water currents and wind, spreading, evapor ation, dispersion, dissolution, and emulsification. The predicted impact of these fate processes is used in computer models to predict the concentration of a compound in the environment (i.e., surface water). Information on the concentration and ch emical composition, including the toxicity data, of the oil is needed to determine the effects of a spill. The physical and chemical properties of a compound provide valuable information about the likely partitioning behavior of the oil in the environment. The effects of an oil spill on marine organisms, for example, would depend on the organisms exposed, the conditions of the exposure, the volume of oil spilled, and other variables at the time of the spill. Response activities may al so affect the impact of a spill on organisms, benthos, sandy intertidal and rocky intertidal habitat, and human uses such as tourism and recreational. A unit of length equal to 6 ft (1.83 m) used especially for measuring the depth of water.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 7-20 2009 APPENDIX A NATIONAL RESPONSE SYSTEM CONCEPT The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) (40 CFR 300) establishes the National Response System (NRS) to foster effective and efficient preparedness for and response to oil and hazardous substance incide nts wherever they might occur in the United States and its waters. The primary focus of the NCP and the NRS is protection of the environment from harm, or mitigation of that harm in the event of an oil or hazardous substance incident. The NCP establishes a tiered structure of planning and response, commonly referred to as the NRS. There are sixteen agencies listed as the primary federal participants in the NRS. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) share leadership responsibility in both planning and re sponse at all levels. Other participating agencies include: U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration U.S. Department of Interior U.S. Department of Agriculture U.S. Department of Defense U.S. Department of Energy U.S. Department of Health and Human Services U.S. Department of Justice U.S. Department of Labor U.S. Department of State U.S. Department of Transportation U.S. Department of Treasury Federal Emergency Management Administration General Services Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil A-1 2009 A. National Response System Concept The NCP establishes a National Response Team (NRT) for the country, Regional Response Teams (RRTs) for each region of the countr y, and dozens of local Area Committees. The NRT is custodian of the NCP and provides broad policy and planning guidance; commits participating agencies to specific actions in supporting regional- and local-level preparedness, planning, and response efforts; and provides technical support and direction in evaluating new or innovative technologies and response concepts. All sixteen NRS agencies are standing NRT members and participate acti vely in all its missions. Regional representatives of all sixteen NRS agencies are also active in each RRT. Each RRT maintains a Regional Contingency Plan (RCP), which provides regional-level preparedness planning and response guidance, including mechanisms for sharing resources among local communities, and, in conjunct ion with Area Committees, addresses environmental concerns related to region-specific response strategies. State response trustee agencies are critical members of each RRT and participate as equal members in all resource planning and use decisions that might affect their jurisdictions. The local Area Committees develop Area Cont ingency Plans (ACPs) that detail community- specific response strategies. These response strategies are based on the risks fa ced at the local level, the resources available to combat those risks, and the potential impact on the local environment depending on which resources are employed, as well as how quickly and effectively those resources can be employed. Area Committees usually involve participation by subregional representatives from the sixteen NRS agencies, along with state and local response and environmental agencies. In practice, the RRTs and Area Committees closely coordinate their activities to ensure that RCPs and ACPs are maintained and that the response strategies and tactics detailed in those plans are continuously assessed. Their focus is on maintaining healthy and effective response capabilities in the event of an oil or hazardous substance incident. All planning concepts in the RCPs and ACPs are subject to consensus of participating federal and state response and environmental agencies that the concepts, strategies, and tactics in these plans provide optimum protection of the environment and optimum mitigation of environmental impacts.

I NTRODUCTION Environmental conditions and oil characteristics \u2014including oil type, weather, wind, wave conditions, and air and sea temperatures \u2014play important roles in the ultimate fate of spilled oil in the marine environment. After oil is discha rged into the environment, a wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes begin to transform the discharged oil, changing its composition, behavior, routes of exposure, and toxicity. The collective action of these natural processes is called \"weathering.\" There are ten major weathering processes, with brief descriptions being provided in the following subsections: Spreading Advection Evaporation Dissolution Natural dispersion Emulsification Photo-oxidation Sedimentation Shoreline stranding Biodegradation 1 Appendix B is reproduced courtesy of the American Petroleum Institute from Fate of Spilled Oil in Marine Waters: Where Does It Go?

The description of each weathering process is organized according to the relative importance and chronology of each process, and is based on th e assumption that there is an instantaneous, one - time release of oil offshore in a temperate environment. However, weathering processes often occur simultaneously, not in chronological or der, and spill-specific cond itions are important factors in determining the duration and significance of weathering processes. Figure B.1-1 shows the relative incidence and importan ce of individual weathering processes at different stages of the oil spill weathering process. Figure B.1-1 Relative Prevalence and Importance of Weathering Processes over Time Source: Reproduced courtesy of the American Petroleum Institute from Fate of Spilled Oil in Marine Waters: Where Does It Go? What Does It Do? How Do Dispersants Affect It? (March 1999), p. 11. Note: The width of the bars in the graph represents the re lative prevalence and importance of each process over time. B.2. S PREADING AND ADVECTION Spreading is the movement of an entire oil slick horizontally on the surface of the water because of the effects of gravity, inertia, friction, viscosity, and surface tension. On calm water, spreading usually occurs in a circular pattern outward from the center of the release point (CONCAWE, 1983). Advection is the movement of the oil due to the influence of overlying winds and underlying currents (NRC, 1985). Spreading and advection usually dominate the initial stages of a spill and involve the spill in its entirety, as they do not partition the various components of the oil or affect its chemical composition. They occur immediately following the release and continue for up to 1 week to 10 days depending on the size of the slick, or until the oil is contained by shorelines, collection efforts, or other obstructions. These processes increase the surface area of the oil, enhancing its exposure to air, sunlight, and underlying water, thereby increasing the potential for environmental impact s as well as the efficiency of other weathering processes (Exxon Corpor ation, 1985; Mielke, 1990). Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil B-2 2009 B. What Happens to Oil When It Is Spilled in the Ocean Environment? Specific gravity and oil viscosity determine the spreading rate of oil, as heavier oils \u2014thick, less fluid oils with high specific gravity and low API \u00b0 gravity \u2014do not spread as readily as lighter oils. Wind speed, sea state, and currents transport the oil on the water surface; wind determines the movement of the oil slick; sea state determines the breakup of the surface slick; and currents not only play a significant role in the movement of the oil on the water's surface, but also break up the surface slick into a series of thin parallel patches of oil. Oil pour point \u2014the lowest temperature at which an oil or distillate fuel is observed to flow \u2014is a factor in slowing or preventing spreading when the water temperature is below the oil's pour point. Water temperature affects spreading and advection by being a determining factor of oil viscosity and pour point. Finally, salinity directly influences the density of seawater and the buoyancy of oil, thereby affecting spreading and advection. B.3. E VAPORATION Evaporation is the preferential transfer of light- and medium-weight components of oil from the liquid phase to the vapor phase and into the atmosphere, in a process similar to that of gasoline evaporating quickly after accidentally being spilled. Thus, the chemical composition and volume of the oil slick are altered as the light- and medium-weight components evaporate from the spilled oil. The remaining components of the oil, after evaporation takes place, have a greater viscosity and specific gravity, which lead to a thickening of the oil and contribute to the formation of tar balls and tar mats (Lewis and Aurand, 1997). Evaporation starts immediately following the di scharge and continues for approximately 2 weeks and is the primary weathering process involved in the removal of oil from the water surface. The percentage of ev aporation rang es from 20 to 40 percent for cr ude oils and up to 100 percent evaporation for refined products. The majority of evaporation occurs within the first 12 hours, and evaporation is the most important weathering process in terms of volume reduction during the first 24 to 48 hours (Payne and McNabb, 1984). Evapor ation also affects the toxicity of the oil. Some of the most toxic medium-weight components undergo evaporation at a slow rate, remaining in the water long enough to pose a high risk of exposure to biological organisms. Oil composition and oil volatility de termine the evaporation rate of oil \u2014the greater the proportion of components with low boiling points and of lightweight components, the greater the evaporation rate. Spreading enhances evaporation, as larger surface areas of oil exposed to the air increase the rate of evap oration; thus, thinner, bigger s licks will evaporate faster than thick, smaller slicks of the same oil type and volume. Solar radiation increases the oil's surface temperature, making the evaporative process more efficient as more components vaporize. Wind speed increases evaporation rates and, along with high sea states, can cause some of the oil to form a spray or mist, which also evaporates quick ly. Finally, water temperature directly affects evaporation rates. If ambient wa ter temperatures remain above th e oil's pour point, the oil will remain fluid, which enhances the spreading process and thus the evaporation process. B.4. D ISSOLUTION Dissolution is the transfer of oil components from a slick on the surface into solution in the water column. Certain lightweight co mponents of the spilled oil tend to be the most soluble, and, therefore, the ones that dissolve first in th e water column. Dissolution has a relatively insignificant effect on volume reduction since only a small frac tion of the oil is removed by Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil B-3 2009 B. What Happens to Oil When It Is Spilled in the Ocean Environment? natural dissolution, because evaporation rates are significantly higher than dissolution rates and affect many of the same oil components that would otherwise eventually dissolve (CONCAWE, 1983; ITOPF, 1987; Lewis and Aurand, 1997; Neff, 1990). In addition, even after dissolution occurs, actual removal usually takes place thro ugh subsequent evaporation, biodegradation, or photo-oxidation (Mackay and McAuliffe, 1988). Dissolu tion typically occurs only within the first 24 hours after a spill occurs. The components of the oil that dissolve into the water column \u2014 ring-like structure and lightweight components \u2014are typically the more acutely toxic components (NRC, 1985). Therefore, although only a very small amount of the spilled oil dissolves, the dissolved components become bioavailable and have the potential to cause environmental impacts to marine ecosystems (N eff, 1990). However, the risk of toxic exposure in the water column is usually localized an d short-lived because of the effects of evaporation and mixing processes in the water column (NRC, 1989). Water solubility and temperature are the two main environmental conditions that affect dissolution. Dissolution preferentially depletes lightweight components with low boiling point hydrocarbons in a \"ring\" form (aromatic hydrocar bons) because of their greater solubility. Oil with greater concentrations of these aromatic hydrocarbons would more likely lose a higher percentage of its volume to dissolution. B.5. N ATURAL DISPERSION Natural dispersion is the process of forming small oil droplets that become incorporated into the water column in the form of a d ilute oil-in-water suspension. This process occurs when breaking waves mix the oil into the water column. Large droplets (more than 0.1 mm in diameter) are formed when mixing occurs and te nd to concentrate near the wate r surface, while small droplets (less than 0.1 mm in diameter) break away from the main mass and become dispersed in the water column (Neff, 1990). Disper sion reduces the volume of the slick at the surf ace but does not change the physicochemical prop erties of the oil (CONCAWE, 1983). Following evaporation, natural dispersion is the most important process in the breakup and disappearance of a slick. Based on spill observations, the percentage of oil lost from the remaining slick because of natural dispersion has been esti mated to range from 10 to 60 percent per day for the first 3 days of the spill (CON CAWE, 1983). Dispersion begins so on after the oil is spilled onto the water surface, reaches a maximum rate approximately 10 hours after a spill, and may continue for several weeks. Dispersion overtakes spreading as the primary mechanism of transport of oil from the spill site within 100 hour s following a spill (Neff, 1990). Low-viscosity oils undergo dispersion more easily th an high-viscosity oils, so as oil evaporates or weathers, viscosity increases and natural dispersion decreases. Since energy is required to mix the oil into the water column, winds generating breaking waves are the primary forces promoting dispersion. This is why higher sea states result in enhanced dispersion. In addition, slick thickness hinders natural dispersion, since oil cohesion is thickness dependent and makes oil breakup more difficult. In contrast, thinner slic ks require less turbulen ce to be dispersed. Interfacial tension affects the oil's ability to break up into smaller droplets and its ability to recoalesce, so with a lower interfacial tension the oil is more likely to form oil droplets and natural dispersion is enhanced. Finally, many oils have naturally occurring surfactants that aid in the dispersion of the oil into the water column. These surfactants naturally align themselves in the oil to facilitate dropl et formation and to prevent recoalescence (Neff, 1990). Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil B-4 2009 B. What Happens to Oil When It Is Spilled in the Ocean Environment? B.6. E MULSIFICATION Emulsification is the mixing of seawater droplets into oil spilled on the water's surface. As a surface slick undergoes evaporation, some of the heavier components tend to precipitate out of the oil mixture in the form of very fine, solid pa rticles. These particles assist in stabilizing a water-in-oil emulsion because of the presence of na tural surfactants. Emulsions typically contain 30 to 80 percent water, are highly viscous, and have a similar density to seawater (Mackay and McAuliffe, 1988). Emulsification can gr eatly increase the total volume of oil while inhibiting the natural weathering processes that act to redu ce the spill volume. Emulsified oils often have a volume more than three times greater than the original volume of oil, become more viscous and sticky, resist being separa ted back into oil and water, and resu lt in difficult cleanup and disposal issues for decision makers. Over time, emulsions remaining in the water or stranded on the shoreline can result in the formation of tar lumps or patties, which are hard, weathered exteriors with gooey, slightly liquid centers. Emulsification often begins during the first day of the spill and can continue to occur throughout the first year. The largest volume of emulsion is typically formed within the first week of the spill, after loss of the lighter-weigh t components to evaporat ion and dissolution has occurred (Lee, 1980). In general, viscous heavyweight oils tend to form stable water-in-oil emulsions that do not break down under the influence of standing, shearing, heating , or treating with chemicals. In contrast, less viscous oils produce weak emulsions that easily re vert to oil residue and water, so emulsions are uncommon during refined oil spills. Emulsion formation is also more likely with oils containing natural surfactants. In addition, natural mixing energy is required to suspen d the water into the oil for the formation of emulsions \u2014the greater the mixing energy, th e faster an emulsion will be formed and the greater the volume of water that can be incorporated into the emulsions. Emulsions are less likely to be formed under calm sea conditions (CONCAWE, 1983). B.7. P HOTO -OXIDATION Photo-oxidation is the process by which sunlight, in the presence of oxygen, transforms oil into new by-products. It occurs only at the surface of the oil slick, and by-products are usually removed and dissipate into the atmosphere and water column. Some of these by-products typically last only a few hours to a few days, as they are degraded by further photolytic action and are subject to dilution into the water column (Payne and McNabb, 1984). Othe r by-products are more toxic than the parent compounds; as a result, localized impacts to natural resources and the health of response personnel could occur (Mielke, 1990; Neff, 1990). Photo-oxidation also produces heavyweight by-products that are not soluble in oil or water (Neff, 1990) . Photo-oxidation can begin within several hours following a spill and last for several weeks to a month. Photo-oxidation plays a relatively minor role in the overall weathering of oil, as it is light- intensity dependent and is thus affected by the day-night cycle and cloud conditions (Mackay and McAuliffe, 1988). Photo-oxidation is also limited by weather cond itions and the extent of emulsification. Rough sea states mix the oil into th e water column, so as light intensity decreases with water depth, the rate of ph oto-oxidation will decrease as more of the oil is mixed into the water column. Photo-oxidation may also be limited for oil that has undergone extensive evaporation or that has become emulsified. In addition, the greater the surface area of the oil exposed to sunlight, the greater the effectiveness of photo-oxidation. Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil B-5 2009 B. What Happens to Oil When It Is Spilled in the Ocean Environment? B.8. S EDIMENTATION AND SHORELINE STRANDING Sedimentation is the incorporation of oil within suspended and bottom sediments, and it usually occurs with the heavier components of oil that do not dissolve in water. Sedimentation also occurs when marine organisms inge st naturally dispersed oil droplets and eliminate them as part of the fecal matter after passing undigested oil through their systems. Sedimentation can also occur when oil is stranded onshore, becomes incorporated with sediments, and is subsequently transported to subtidal environments. Shorel ine stranding is the visible accumulation of petroleum along the shoreline following an oil spill. This stranded or beached oil can contribute to the volume of oil undergoing sedimentation as the stranded oil becomes sediment laden, sinks, or becomes buried along the shoreline. Sedimentation can begin almost immediately following a spill but increases and peaks several week s into the spill. It is an important process in shallow, rough sea conditions where bottom sediments are repeatedly resuspended. In addition, sedimentation effectively removes oil from additional weathering processes, including natural biodegradation. As a result, the most persistent oil residues are usually those incorporated into subtidal sediments of estuarine or nearshore waters (Gundlach et al., 1983) or those stranded on low-energy shores (Hayes et al., 1993). Water depth and physical energy affect the amount of suspended sediment in the water column, so shallow waters are likely to have higher concentrations of both suspended particles and microscopic organisms that can accelerate the sedime ntation rate of oil. A high-energy, nearshore environment typically will have the necessary combination of suspende d particles and wave action that lead to sedimentation. Low-energy areas are not likely to undergo sedimentation until after the oil has undergone extensive weathering. Wind, wave, and current patterns affect shoreline stranding of the oil. Onshore winds and storm events act to push surface slicks onshore, and wave action combined with tidal cycl es can strand the oil on beaches until the next tidal cycle, when the oil is often lifted off intertidal sediments. B.9. B IODEGRADATION Biodegradation is the process by which natu rally occurring bacteria and fungi consume hydrocarbons found in oil to use as a food sour ce, and excrete carbon dioxide and water as waste products. It is a significant weathering process, albeit a slow one. Biodegradation occurs on the water surface, in the water column, in sedime nts, and onshore. Microbes that can utilize hydrocarbons are found naturally in marine habitats. After a spill occurs, they grow and multiply since additional food so urces (carbon) become available following a spill. For stranded oil, biodegradation becomes a domi nant factor once physical processes reduce the toxic components of the oil (Fucey and Oudot, 19 84). Biodegradation is the dominant weathering process for the light- and medium-weight components remaining after the other weathering processes have been greatly reduced. The biodegra dation process can begin quickly following a spill and will continue as long as degradable hydrocarbons persist. Since the oil is initially toxic to microbes, there is a lag time between when the spill occurs and when the microbes begin to degrade the oil; this time period allows for removal of toxic components through other weathering processes (Hoff, 1992). Microbial degradation typically peaks within the first month after a spill as a result of the growth in the microbial population following the spill. Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil B-6 2009 B. What Happens to Oil When It Is Spilled in the Ocean Environment? Current oil pollution conditions at a specific site determine the abun dance of oil-degrading microbe populations and the biodegradation rates in the event of a spill. Biodegradation is water- temperature dependent, and is typically slower in cold and extremely hot environments (Lewis and Aurand, 1997). Nutrients in the water column can limit biodegradation when scarce, since microbes require nutrients for continued growth and reproduction. The majority of microbes live in aerobic environments since they require oxygen to biodegrade petroleum hydrocarbons. These microbes feed in areas where oxygen is normally plentiful (e.g., water column, water surface, and sediment surface). There are also microbes that degrade petroleum hydrocarbons in areas that lack oxygen but at a much slower rate. Oil in anaerobic environments may degrade very little, with oil persisting often for several years (Hoff, 1992). In ge neral, oils and refined products that contain large quantities of heavyweight components may not undergo biodegradation, since the molecules are too larg e and complex for the microbes to degrade. B.10. I NTERACTION OF THE FATE AND TRANSPORT PROCESSES To understand the complex interaction of the weathering processes described above, it is important to consider that these processes do not occur in isolation from one another, but rather simultaneously and in overlapping fashion through the course of an oil spill. In addition, these processes interact and affect each other in a complex web of feedbacks, and in turn affect the properties of the spilled oil (C ONCAWE, 1983). The following is a limited list of some of the more common and important interactions between the weathering processes: Spreading enhances evaporation, dissolution, dispersion, emulsification, photo-oxidation, and biodegradation. Evaporated oil usually undergoes photo-oxidation in the atmosphere. Evaporation enhances emulsification of the slick, forming thick sludge and tar balls. Dissolved oil components in the water column undergo biodegradation or evaporation at the water surface. Natural dispersion reduces the volume of a slic k on the surface, thus reducing evaporation. Natural dispersion exposes subsurface marine organisms to oil, and the oil may undergo sedimentation as a result of being consumed and reprocessed as fecal matter. Natural dispersion enhances biodegradation. Natural dispersion enhances sedimentation, as droplets bind to suspended sediments. Emulsification and thickening of the slick reduces the surface area of the spill, consequently reducing evaporation. Emulsification inhibits spre ading, evaporation, and natural dispersion, and and Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil B-7 2009 B. What Happens to Oil When It Is Spilled in the Ocean Environment?

D ATA DESCRIPTION \u2014GENERAL To effectively model the potential impacts and be nefits for each proposed alternative, certain assumptions were made regarding ho w effective each response option1 would be in producing its intended benefit. In short, the model requires the following inputs for both the 2,500- and 40,000-barrel (bbl) spill scenarios2 used: Mechanical recovery (Tables D.2-1 through D.2-4) \u2014The volume of spilled oil that would be recovered from the water using booms, skimmers, and storage devices on an hourly basis over the first 96 hours of the spill response. In situ burning (Tables D.3-1 through D.3-4) \u2014The volume of spilled oil that would be contained in fire-resistant boom and burned in place, on water, on an hourly basis over the first 60 hours of the spill respon se, which is the end of the in situ burn operating period contained in the proposed regulation. Chemical dispersion in Gulf of Mexi co region (Tables D.4-1 through D.4-8) \u2014In Gulf waters the regulation proposes that a larger quantity of dispersant be available in the first operational period than is proposed in non -Gulf waters. Hence, data is needed about the amount of oil that would be removed from the water surface and dispersed into the water column on an hourly basis over the first 60 hours of the spill, which is the end of the dispersant application operating period contained in the proposed regulation. 1 The response options analyzed and discussed in this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) \u2014mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion \u2014are for on-water recovery. 2 For a detailed discussion on why these spill scenarios were chosen, see Chapter 4. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil D-1 2009 D. Calculated Efficiency Rates for Response Technologies Chemical dispersion in non- Gulf of Mexico regions (Tables D.4-9 through D.4-16) \u2014 In non-Gulf waters the regulation proposes a lesser quantity of dispersant be available in the first operational period than is proposed in Gulf waters. Hence, data is needed about the amount of oil that would be removed from the water surface and dispersed into the water column on an hourly basis over the first 60 hours of the spill, which is the end of the dispersant application operating period contained in the proposed regulation. More detailed assumptions regarding all mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion tables include the following: The purpose of these tables is to provide hourly estimates of all recovery activity over the course of the response period for use in the Applied Science Associates (ASA) spill model SIMAP. Tables were prepared for spills occurring at midnight (0000), 6 A.M. (0600), noon (1200), and 6 P.M. (1800) to account for variations in effectiveness caused by delays in initiation of response. Response operations are not conducted during darkness because of personnel safety considerations. Daylight is assumed to be from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M. No cleanup operations will be conducted during hours of darkness. It was assumed that mechanical recovery would commence 12 hours after the spill or at first light after hour 12. It was assumed that first dispersant application would occur 7 hours after the spill occurred or at first light after hour 7. Assumed oil is Group II/III medium crude with characteristics that make it amenable to mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion. Based on 33 CFR 155, Appendix B, Table 3, 40 perc ent of natural dissipation will be assumed to occur prior to commencing response operations. The model runs will rely on computer- generated, hourly natural dissipation estimates rela ted to the specific oils used in the scenarios. Changes in oil mass from emulsification are not estimated. Emulsification will be estimated in the computer models along with all the other natural dissipation effects. Based on 33 CFR 155, Appendix B, Table 3, 48 hours of daylight will be assumed over the 4-day response period (96 hours). D.2. D ATA DESCRIPTION \u2014MECHANICAL RECOVERY (TABLES D.2-1 THROUGH D.2-4) All estimates are in barrels. Mechanical recovery operations will continue to hour 96 after the start of the spill. Assumed areas are higher-volume port response areas, which require mechanical recovery to start at hour 12 rather than hour 24. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil D-2 2009 D.

Response will last 4 days. Natural dissipation will be 40 percent (avera ge of evaporation rates for light and medium crude oils). Hourly mechanical recovery rate will be 50 percent of the total oil available on the water at the beginning of that hour divided by 48 (the total number of cleanup hours in the 4-day response).

Assumed response tiers are the same as those used for mechanical recovery. Because the rule proposed to allow in situ burning to offset the existing mechanical recovery requirements by 25 percent, in situ burning is assumed to remove 25 percent of the available oil each hour, while the amount removed using mechanical recovery is reduced by 25 percent.

D ATA DESCRIPTION \u2014CHEMICAL DISPERSION (TABLES D.4-1 THROUGH D.4-16) Dispersant amounts will be listed in gallons; all oil quantities will be listed in barrels. Dispersant operations will be completed at hour 60 after the start of the spill. Tier 1, hours 6 to 12 Tier 2, hours 12 to 36 Tier 3, hours 36 to 60 Two efficiencies will be used for dispersants: Eighty percent \u2014Dispersant/dispersed oil impact on the water column based on theoretically successful dispersant operation. Re cent ecological risk assessments (Pond et al., 2000a, b) done by response communit ies in California and Texas have used 80 percent as a high-end effectiveness estimator. Forty-five percent \u2014Dispersant/dispersed oil impact on the water column based on minimum dispersant effectiveness criteria established in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). For dispersants at all tiers, application will be assumed to be made using one or more C-130 aircraft. According to the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review (USCG, 1999), the C-130 is capable of delivering 5,495 gal of dispersant per sortie. Gulf of Mexico Tier 1 would require delivery of 8,250 gal of dispersant in two sorties over the course of 5 hours starting at hour 7 or at the first hour of daylight: first sortie, 5,494 gal; second sortie 5 hours later, 2,756 gal. Non- Gulf of Mexico Tier 1 would require delivery of 4,125 gal in one C-130 sortie at hour 7 or at the first hour of daylight. Tier II and III each require delivery of 23,375 ga l of dispersant in fo ur sorties of 5,495 gal each and one sortie of 1,395 gal. Sorties will occur at tier start time +1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 hours. When sorties from two tiers overlap because of darkness, both sorties will be assumed to occur simultaneously. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil D-24 2009 D.

It is a necessary part of all response operations and is assumed to be critical to, but not increase, the efficiencies reported in the Tables D.2-1 through -4, D.3-1 through -4, and D.4-1 through -16. Mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion all require continuous aerial tracking to direct response resources to and keep them in the thickest parts of the oil as it spreads over the surface of the water. These resources were previously provided on an ad hoc basis by either government or industry. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil D-51 2009 D.

USEPA has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider that decision. F.3. A TLANTIC REGION The Gulf of Maine Gyre, with currents that exhibit surface speeds of 0.29 kt, and the Georges Bank Gyre, with currents that exhi bit surface speeds of 0.58 kt, influence circulation in the northern section of the Atlantic region (Figure F.2-1). The Slope Sea Gyre, with currents that have been measured upwards of 0.1 kt, affects the waters further south to the Mid-Atlantic region. This gyre lies off the coast and extends seaward out to the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream flows in a northerly direction from southern Florida and veers east off the coast of North Carolina. The Gulf Stream impacts circulation throughout the Atlantic region, with its current's width ranging from 50 to 63 mi and has peak surface velocities of 4 kt (MMS, 1990). Along the most northern parts of the Atlantic region, salinity is greatly influenced by input from local rivers, resulting in a band of lo w-salinity water that extends 12 mi or more from the coast. Throughout the rest of the northwestern Atlantic region \u2014Georges Bank, Great South Channel, Cape Cod Bay, and Stellwagen Bank \u2014salinity remains stable at approximately 31 to 33 parts per thousand (ppt), depending on the location. Mid-Atlantic shelf water has relatively low salinity; howeve r, the Delaware Bay is characterized by high salinities, with 28 ppt at the mouth to 8 ppt in the upper boundary (USCG, 1996). The Gulf Stream influences the chemical characteristics of the southwestern Atlantic region shelf water. This area has a general increase in salinity seaward to a maximum of 36 ppt (USCG, 1996). Atlantic Ocean surface water temperatures vary because of the large geographical distances covered by the area. Annual average temperatures in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean (off the coast of Maine) are between 42.8\u00b0 and 64.9\u00b0F. Temperatures in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean (off the east coast of Florida) average between 78.5\u00b0 and 84.2\u00b0F (NOAA, 2003a). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-2 2009 F.

National Marine Sanctuaries are created to protect areas that have exhibite d high levels of biodiversity, ecological integrity, and/or c ultural legacy. They are the breeding and feeding grounds of whales, se a lions, sharks, and sea turtles an d contain unique marine habit ats. There are three coastal or near-coastal Nationa l Marine Sanctuaries in the Atlantic region. National Marine Sanctuary Description Stellwagen Bank This 842-mi2 stretch of open water and seafloor at the mouth of Massachusetts Bay, offshore of MA is a sand and gravel plateau. This sanctuary is recognized as one of the primary feeding grounds of the highly migratory humpback whale in the North Atlantic; it is also the part-time home of the endangered northern right whale. U.S.S. MONITOR This sanctuary protects the wreck of the famed Civil War ironclad U.S.S.

This sanctuary is located 17.5 nm off Sapelo Island, GA, and its boundaries protect 17 mi2 of open ocean. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-9 2009 F. Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.2-4 ( continued ) National Marine Sanctuaries and National Park Units in the Atlantic Region Congress established the National Park Service to ensure protection and interpretation of some of the finest examples of natura l, cultural, and recreational resources. The National Park Service se ts aside areas of historical and recreational value that are maintained at various stages of development, ranging from a na tural pristine environment to r ecreational facilities and concess ions. The development at any given park unit depends on the primary goal for which it was established. Park units set aside to preser ve specific environments or historic locations may have localized areas developed to accommodate various uses, such as hunting, fishing, shell fishing, swimming, picnicking, hiking, camping, an d boating. These uses must be compatible with the preservation of the environment or the historic location for which the park was established.

Ke nnedy Space Center east of Titusville, FL, this 140,000-acre refuge is approximately one-half brac kish estuaries and marshes. Over 500 species of wildlife inhabit the refuge, with 16 bein g listed as threatened or endangered. St. Johns This 6,194-acre refuge, located west of Ti tusville, FL, was established to provide adequate habitat to recover the dusky seaside sparrow from extinction. However, the species was declared extinct in December 1990, and the refuge's critical habitat was delisted. Archie Carr This linear refuge stretches for 20 mi between Melbourne Beach and Wabasso Beach along FL's east coast. It is the most important nesting area for loggerhead sea turtles in the western hemisphere and the second most important nesting beach in the world. Twenty-five percent of all loggerhead sea turtle and 35% of all green sea turtle nests in the United States occur here, with nesting densities of 1,000 nests per mi. Pelican Island This 5,413-acre refuge is the first official NWR, which was established by President Theodore Roosevelt in March 1903. Located in Indian River County, FL, the refuge was designated to protect brown pelicans and other native birds nesting on the island. It was the first time the federal government set aside land for the sake of wildlife. Hobe Sound This coastal refuge consists of two separate tracts of land located in Martin County, FL. These tracts total only 967 acres in three basi c, distinct plant communities: coastal sand dune, mangrove swamps, and sand pine-scrub oak forest. The 735-acre Jupiter Island beach tract provides some of the most productive sea turtle nesting beach in the United States. Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee This 147,392-acre refuge, the last northernmost portion of the unique Everglades, has over 221 mi2 of Everglades habitat and is home to the American alligator and the endangered Everglades snail kite. In any given year, as ma ny as 257 species of birds may use the refuge's diverse wetland habitats. Crocodile Lake Located in north Key Largo, FL, this 6,606-acre refuge includes the last stands of high tropical hardwood hammock and provides critical habi tat to Key Largo woodrat, cotton mouse, and the only federally listed endangered insect in Florida: Schaus' swallowtail butterfly.

Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.2-6 National Estuarine Research Reserves and National Estuary Programs in the Atlantic Region The National Estuarine Research Reserve Program was established by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451-1464) and is administered by the Sanctuaries and Reserves Di vision, NOAA. A primary objective of Congress in establishing the estuarine research-reserve program is to provide information to be used by coastal managers and fishing industries by providing research information that will help assure the cont inued productivity of estuarine ecosystems. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, established the National Estuarine Sanctuary Program to provide financial assistance awards on a matching basis to states to acquire, develop, and operate estuarine areas as natural field laboratories. The purpos e of the program is to provide long-term protection to vital habitats for estuarine-dependent life, thus preserving relatively unalt ered estuarine areas for baseline scientific research and educational programs. There are thirteen coastal or near-coastal National Estuarine Research Reserves in the Atlantic region, of which two are also National Estuary Programs. National Estuarine Research Reserve Description Wells This 1,600-acre reserve protects fields, fore sts, salt marshes, and sandy beaches on the densely populated southern coast of ME. Gulf of Maine waters join with the Webhannet and Little Rivers to form broad estuaries, in which the salt marshes account for 1,200 acres of the reserve. Great Bay Encompassing over 10,000 acres of tidal waters, this reserve is a complex embayment in the southeastern corner of NH that begins at the mouth of the Piscataqua River. The reserve is a tidally dominated system and the drainage confluence of seven major rivers, several small creeks and their tributaries, and ocean water from the Gulf of Maine. It is one of the largest estuaries on the Atlantic Coast and at 10 mi inland is one of the most recessed. Waquoit Bay Located on the south shore of Cape Cod, MA, in the towns of Falmouth and Mashpee, this reserve encompasses 2,500 acres of open waters, barrier beaches, marshlands, and uplands. Its beaches serve as nesting grounds for the threatened piping plover and foraging grounds for the endangered roseate tern. Narragansett Bay Narragansett Bay is both a National Estuarine Research Reserve and a National Estuary Program, and is located in the geographic cen ter of Narragansett Bay, between Newport and Providence, RI. It encompasses 2,353 acres of land on Prudence, Patience, and Hope Islands and 1,591 acres of water adjoining the islands out to a depth of 18 ft. Hudson River This 4,838-acre reserve is a network of four coastal wetlands\u2014Piermont Marsh, Iona Island, Tivoli Bays, and Stockport Flats\u2014located along 100 mi of the Hudson Estuary in NY state. It is home to more than 200 species of fish, serving as a nursery ground for fish such as sturgeon, striped bass, and American shad. Jacques Costeau Located at Mullica River and Great Bay in NJ, this 114,665-acre reserve is the only National Estuarine Research Reserve in the system to be named after an individual and to expand its boundaries seaward to the Atlantic Ocean. It is regarded as one of the least disturbed estuaries in the densely populated urban corridor of the northeastern United States and, in addition to the ocean environment, encompasses wetlands, riparian habitats, barrier islands, and forested uplands of the NJ Pine Barrens. Delaware Estuary Delaware Estuary is both a National Estuarine Research Reserv e and a National Estuary Program and extends 134 mi from its mouth between Cape May, NJ, and Cape Henlopen, DE, northward to Trenton Falls, NJ. With a water surface area of 768 mi 2, this estuary is one of the largest along the Atlantic coast, covering 8,600 acres. Chesapeake Bay-MD Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the nation, is one of the most productive bodies of water in the world and is highly valued for its commercial and recreational resources. The 4,820-acre reserve in MD has three components: Ju g Bay, which is a tidal freshwater riverine habitat in a developed watershed; Monie Bay, which represents a salt marsh habitat; and Otter Point Creek, which is an upper bay tidal freshwater habitat. Chesapeake Bay-VA Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the nation, is one of the most productive bodies of water in the world and is highly valued for its commercial and recreational resources. The 4,435-acre reserve in VA consists of four components within the York River basin: Goodwin Islands, Catlett Islands, Ta skinas Creek, and Sweet Hall Marsh. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-19 2009 F. Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.2-6 ( continued ) National Estuarine Research Reserves and National Estuary Programs in the Atlantic Region National Estuarine Research Reserve Description North Carolina This reserve, the third largest in the United States, encompasses more than 2 million acres and provides the economic foundation of the coastal area. It is comprised of four sites located near Corolla (Currituck Banks), Beaufort (Rachel Carson), and Wilmington (Mansonboro Island and Zeke's Island), NC. North Inlet-Winyah Bay Located 50 mi north of Charleston, SC, this 12,327-acre reserve features the salt marshes and ocean dominated tidal creeks of the North Inlet Estuary plus the brackish waters and marshes of the adjacent Winyah Bay Estuary, which is the third largest watershed on the East Coast. More than 90 percent of North Inlet' s watershed is in its natural forested state. ACE Basin This 134,710-acre reserve is located 45 mi south of Charleston, SC, and is one of the most undeveloped estuaries on the East Coast. It features outer coastal plain communities that are typically associated with barrier islands, marsh islands, and estuarine rivers. Sapelo Island Sapelo Island is the fourth largest ba rrier island in GA and one of the most pristine. The 17,950-acre reserve, located northeast of Darien, GA, is made up of salt marshes, maritime forests, and beach dune areas. In 1987, the National Estuary Program (NEP) was established by th e Water Quality Act (P.L. 100-4) and is administered by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The purposes of the prog ram are to identify nationally significant estuaries, protect and improve their water quality, and enhance their living resources. Under the administration of USEPA, comprehensive management plans are generated to protect and enhance environmental resources of estuaries designated to be of national importance. The governor of a state may nominate an estuary for the program and request that a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan be developed. Over a 5-year period, representatives from federal, state, and interstate agencies; academic and scientific institutions, and industry and citizen groups do the following: (1) define objectives for protecting the estuary , (2) select the chief problems to be addressed in the plan, and (3) ratify a pollution control and resource management strategy to m eet each objective. Strong public support and subsequent political commitments are needed to accomplish the actions called for in t he plan. There are fourteen coastal or near-coastal National Estuary Programs in the Atlantic region, of which two are also Nation al Estuarine Research Reserves. National Estuary Program Description Casco Bay Located in southeastern ME, the marine habitats of Casco Bay cover 229 mi 2. Because of topography and wide tidal variati ons that are characteristic of the Gulf of Maine, intertidal areas in ME are the most extensive along the Atlantic coast of the United States. The most characteristic intertidal habitat in Casc o Bay is tidal flats covering 11,582 acres. New Hampshire Estuaries NH has over 230 mi of sensitive ti dal shoreline in addition to 18 mi of open ocean coastline on the Gulf of Maine. The largest estuaries in the system are Great Bay Estuary and Hampton-Seabrook Estuary. Great Bay Estuary is a tidally dominated, complex embayment on the southern NH-ME border, with es tuarine tidal waters covering 17 mi 2, with nearly 150 mi of tidal shoreline. Hampton-Seabrook Estuary encompasses 0.75 mi2 of water at high tide and contains the larg est salt marsh in the state. Massachusetts Bays Covering over 800 mi of coastline from the tip of Cape Cod Bay, MA, to the NH border and serving 50 coastal communities, the Massachusetts Bays provide habitats for horseshoe crabs, blue herons, striped bass, and eelgrass. Buzzards Bay Located in southeastern MA, the Buzzards Bay watershed encompasses almost 750 mi2 and provides diverse habitat of salt marshes, sandy beaches, eelgrass beds, small embayments, tidal streams, and urban ports. Narragansett Bay Narragansett Bay is both a National Estuarine Research Reserve and a National Estuary Program, and is located in the geographic cen ter of Narragansett Bay, between Newport and Providence, RI. It encompasses 2,353 acres of land on Prudence, Patience, and Hope Islands and 1,591 acres of water adjoining the islands out to a depth of 18 ft. Long Island Sound Bounded by CT and Westchester County, NY, on the north and by Long Island, NY, on the south, Long Island Sound is approximately 110 mi long and about 21 mi across at its widest point. Unlike most other estuaries, Long Island Sound has two connections with the ocean: through the East River-New York Harbor to the west and through the Race to the east. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-20 2009 F. Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.2-6 ( continued ) National Estuarine Research Reserves and National Estuary Programs in the Atlantic Region National Estuary Program Description Peconic Bay Located between the North and South Forks of Long Island, NY, the Peconic estuarine system consists of over 100 harbors, embaym ents, and tributaries that span more than 110,000 acres of land and 121,000 acres of surface water. Most of the estuary's primary habitats\u2014sandy beaches, cliffs, dunes, salt marshes, and freshwater wetlands\u2014remain in a fairly natural condition. New York-New Jersey Harbor The New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary includes the waters of the harbor and the tidally influenced portions of all rivers and streams that empty into the harbor. Its core area, the Hudson Raritan Estuary, extends from the Piermont Marsh, NY, to the Sandy Hook-Rockaway Point Transect, NJ. The estuary covers approximately 298 mi 2 of surface water. Barnegat Bay The Barnegat Bay Estuary covers over 42 mi of shoreline from the Point Pleasant Canal to Little Egg Harbor Inlet in NJ. The flow of fresh water from rivers, creeks, and groundwater into the bay produces the special conditions that are important for the survival of crabs, fish, birds, and other wildlife. Delaware Estuary Delaware Estuary is both a National Estuarine Research Reserv e and a National Estuary Program and extends 134 mi from its mouth between Cape May, NJ, and Cape Henlopen, DE, northward to Trenton Falls, NJ. With a water surface area of 768 mi2, this estuary is one of the largest along the Atlantic coast, covering 8,600 acres. Delaware Inland Bays These are three bays\u2014Rehoboth, Indian River, and Little Assawoman Bays\u2014located along the southern coast of DE. The surface water of the bays covers 32 mi2. The bays' physical connections with the Atlantic Ocean are limited. Unlike most estuaries that receive the bulk of their freshwater inflow from rivers, the Delaware Inland Bays receive as much as 80 percent of their fresh water from groundwater sources. Maryland Coastal Bays The Maryland Coastal Bays are located off the Eastern Shore of MD. The estuarine study area includes four large, shallow bays as well as some smaller embayments. The bays' watershed totals 119,187 acres in Worcester Co unty, MD, and extends into portions of DE and VA. While the northern portion of the bays is quickly developing, the southern portion maintains a significant amount of forested and agricultural land. Albemarle-Pamlico Sounds The Albemarle-Pamlico Sounds region stretches from Prince George County, VA, to Carteret County, NC, and covers 30,000 mi2 of watershed, making it the second largest estuarine system in the United States after th e Chesapeake Bay. It is composed of seven sounds and five major river basins, as well as beaches, mars hes, and bottomland forests. Indian River Stretching for a total of 155 mi from Ponce de Leon Inlet in New Smyrna Beach, FL, south to Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach, FL, the lagoon forms 40 percent of the FL east coast and has a water surface area of 353 mi2.

Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.3-4 National Park Units in the Caribbean Region Congress established the National Park Service to ensure protection and interpretation of some of the finest examples of natura l, cultural, and recreational resources. The National Park Service se ts aside areas of historical and recreational value that are maintained at various stages of development, ranging from a na tural pristine environment to r ecreational facilities and concess ions. The development at any given park unit depends on the primary goal for which it was established. Park units set aside to preser ve specific environments or historic locations may have localized areas developed to accommodate various uses, such as hunting, fishing, shell fishing, swimming, picnicking, hiking, camping, an d boating. These uses must be compatible with the preservation of the environment or the historic location for which the park was established. There are four coastal or near-coastal National Pa rk units in the Caribbean region. National Park Unit Description San Juan NHS This historic site encompasses the system of massive fortifications that defended the city of Old San Juan, PR, including the forts of El Morro, San Crist\u00f3bal, and El Ca\u00f1ueolo and the 5 mi of stone walls ringing the city. The site is a United Nations-designated World Heritage Site. Virgin Islands NP* This park covers more than 12,908 acres, including three-fifths of St. John, 15 acres of St. Thomas, and Hassel Island (in Charlotte Amalie Harbor, St. Thomas), and provides habitat for over 800 species of plants. The park also consists of 5,650 acres of offshore areas (waters and submerged lands), such as coral reefs, mangrove shorelines, and seagrass beds. The park is part of the United Nation's Biosphere Reserve Network. Buck Island Reef NM Located 1.5 mi off the northeast side of Buck Island near St. Croix, this National Monument encompasses 880 acres \u2014176 acres of land and 704 acres of water and reef system. An elkhorn-coral barrier reef surrounds two-thirds of the island, which is a rookery for endangered brown pelicans and a nesting area for three species of sea turtles. Seasonally the reef supports one of the last remaining protected nesting populations of endangered hawksbill sea turtles in the eastern Caribbean. Salt River Bay NHP and EPres Located near Christiansted, St. Croix, USVI this is the only known site where members of Christopher Columbus' expedition set foot on what is now U.S. territory. The park contains the only ceremonial prehistoric ball court ever discovered in the Lesser Antilles, village middens, and burial grounds. The site is marked by Fort Sale, a remaining earthworks fortification from the Dutch period of occupation.

National Wildlife Refuges were established and are administered by the USFWS under the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a-742j, not including 742 d-l; 70 Stat. 1119) and the National Wild life Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd -668ee). These acts allow the USFWS to ac quire and to administer lands for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources. Most refuges are managed for the enhancement of resident and migratory wildlife and are available for public recreational use, such as fishing, wildlife observation, hunting, and boating. The National Wildlife Refuges of the Caribbean region provide habitat to a variety of migratory waterfowl and aquatic birds, includ ing indigenous species, and several endangered species including gree n, leatherback, and hawksbill sea turtles; yellow-shouldered blackbird; brown pelican; and St. Croix ground lizard. There are eight coastal or near-coastal National Wildlife Refuges in the Caribbean region. National Wildlife Refuge Description Caribbean Islands Complex Desecheo (PR) Cabo Rojo (PR) Laguana Cartegena (PR) Vieques (PR) Culebra (PR) Buck Island (USVI) Green Cay (USVI) Sandy Point (USVI) Located off the west coast of PR, Desecheo is a 360-acre island. Cabo Rojo is a 587-acre refuge along the coastal plain of southwestern PR. Located near Maguayo, PR, the 1,059-acre Laguana Cartegena contains a partially filled lagoon. Vieques is a 3,100-acre refuge located on the western end of Isla de Vieques. The Culebra National Wildlife Refuge is comprised of lands on the main Isla de Culebra plus twenty-two smaller islands in the same vicinity. The 45\u00ad acre Buck Island, located 2 mi off the south coast of St. Thomas, USVI, is a nesting area for hawksbill and green sea turtles. Located directly off the north coast of St. Croix, USVI, Green Cay is a 14-acre refuge that provides critical habitat for one of only two remaining natural populations of the endangered St. Croix lizard. Sandy Point, located at the southwest end of St. Croix, USVI, consists of 327 acres and has the largest beach area in the USVI.

Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.3-6 National Estuarine Research Reserves and National Estuary Programs in the Caribbean Region The National Estuarine Research Reserve Program was established by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451-1464) and is administered by the Sanctuaries and Reserves Di vision, NOAA. A primary objective of Congress in establishing the estuarine research-reserve program is to provide information to be used by coastal managers and fishing industries by providing research information that will help assure the cont inued productivity of estuarine ecosystems. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, established the National Estuarine Sanctuary Program to provide financial assistance awards on a matching basis to states to acquire, develop, and operate estuarine areas as natural field laboratories. The purpos e of the program is to provide long-term protection to vital habitats for estuarine-dependent life, thus preserving relatively unalt ered estuarine areas for baseline scientific research and educational programs. There is one coastal or near-coastal National Estuar ine Research Reserve in the Caribbean region. National Estuarine Research Reserve Description Jobos Bay Located on the southern coast of PR between the municipalities of Guayama and Salinas, this reserve encompasses 2,883 acres of land and water including a chain of fifteen mangrove islets (surrounded by coral reefs an d seagrass beds). Four species of Caribbean mangroves are found in the reserve, which is also home to the endangered brown pelican, peregrine falcon, yellow-shoulder blackbird, hawksbill turtle, and the Antillean manatee. In 1987, the NEP was established by the Water Quality Act (P.L. 100-4) and is administered by USEPA. The purposes of the program are to identify nationally significant estuaries, protect and improve their water quality, and enhance their living res ources. Under the administration of USEPA, comprehensive management plans are generated to protect and enhance environmental resources of estuaries designated to be of national importance. The governor of a state may nominate an estuary for the program and request that a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan be developed. Over a 5-year period, representatives from federal, state, and interstate agencies; ac ademic and scientific institutions, and industry and citizen groups do the following : (1) define objectives for protecting the estuary, (2) select the chie f problems to be addressed in the plan, and (3) ratify a pollu tion control and resource management strategy to meet each objective. Strong public support and subsequent political commitments are needed to accomplish the actions called for in the plan. There is one coastal or near-coastal National Estuary Programs plu s one Marine Conservation District in the Caribbean region. National Estuary Program Description San Juan Bay The first tropical island estuary in the National Estuary Program, San Juan Bay includes a 93-mi2 watershed and consists of coral communities, sea grass beds, and mangrove forests, all of which are designated critical areas. It is home to several threatened or endangered bird species as well as the protected leatherback sea turtle. Hind Bank Marine Conservation This 16-mi2 conservation area is located in the Caribbean waters southwest of St. Thomas, District USVI. This area is noted as a spawning ground for the red hind, a popular commercial fish, and valuable coral reefs. Within the district, fishing, anchoring of fishing vessels, traps, bottom long lines, and the harvesting of \"live rock\" are prohibited.

National Marine Sanctuaries are created to protect areas that have exhibited high levels of biodiversity, ecological integrit y, and/or cultural legacy. They are the breeding and feeding gro unds of whales, sea lions, sharks, and sea turtles, and contain unique marine habitats. There are two coastal or near-coastal National Marine Sanctuaries in the Gulf of Mexico region. National Marine Sanctuary Description Florida Keys This sanctuary protects 3,600 mi2 of diverse marine ecosystems surrounding the Florida Keys, including the productive waters of Florida Ba y, sand flats, seagrass meadows, mangrove- fringed shorelines and islands, and extensive living coral reefs. It includes parts of Florida Bay, the southwest continental shelf, the corals of the Florida Reef Tract that parallel the seaward edge of the Florida Keys, the Keys themselves, and the Straits of Florida. Flower Garden Banks Located 110 mi off the coasts of TX and LA, this sanctuary contains the northernmost East Flower Garden Bank coral reef community in the United States. The area containing both the East and West West Flower Garden Bank Banks equals 41.7 nm2 in size and has 350 acres of reef cr est.

National Wildlife Refuges were established and are administered by the USFWS under the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a -742j, not including 742 d-l; 70 Stat. 1119) and the Nationa l Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd -668ee). These acts allow the USFWS to acquire and to administer lands for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources. Although most refuges are managed for the enhancement of resident and migratory wildlife and are available for public recreational use, such as fishing, wildlife observation, huntin g, and boating, most refuges along the Gulf coast were established as wintering areas for ducks, geese, coots, and other migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. There are also refuges set aside for the protection and enhancement of specific endangered species, f or example the Aransas whooping crane in TX, Mississippi sandhill cr ane in MS, and Crystal River manatee in FL. There are thirty- eight coastal or near-coastal National Wildlife Refuges in the Gulf of Mexico region.

Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.4-6 National Estuarine Research Reserves and National Estuary Programs in the Gulf of Mexico Region The National Estuarine Research Reserve Program was established by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451-1464) and is administered by the Sanctuaries and Reserves Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A primary objective of Congress in establishing the estuarine research-reserve program is to provide information to be used by coastal managers and fishing industries by providing research in formation that will help assure the continued productivity of estuarine ecosystems. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, established the National Estuarine Sanctuary Program to provide financial assistance awards on a matching basi s to states to acquire, develop, and operate estuarine areas a s natural field laboratories. The purpose of the program is to pr ovide long-term protection to vital habitats for estuarine-depen dent life, thus preserving relatively unaltered estuarine areas for baseline scientific research and educational programs. There are three coastal or near-coastal National Estuarine Research Reserves in the Gulf of Mexico region. National Estuarine Research Reserve Description Rookery Bay Located at the northern end of the Ten Thousand Islands on the Gulf coast of FL, this 110,000-acre reserve represents one of the few remaining undisturbed mangrove estuaries in North America. Many threatened and endangered animals and 150 species of birds thrive within the reserve, which also includes mangroves, open bays, creeks, pine flats, hardwood hammocks, oyster reefs, and seagrass beds. Apalachicola Bay This 246,000-acre reserve is one of th e most productive estuarine systems in the Northern Hemisphere. Located on the Florida Panhandle, the reserve features 1,162 subspecies of vascular plants, 308 species of birds, 186 species of fish, and 57 species of mammals. It has the largest natural stand of tupelo trees in the world. Weeks Bay Located between Mobile, AL, and Pensacol a, FL, this 6,000-acre reserve encompasses open shallow waters, with an average depth of le ss than 5 ft, and extensive vegetated wetland areas. Weeks Bay is a critical nursery for shrimp, bay anchovy, blue crab and multitudes of other fish, crustaceans and shellfish. In 1987, the NEP was established by the Water Quality Act (P.L. 100-4) and is administered by USEPA. The purposes of the program are to identify nationally significant estuaries, protect and improve their water quality, and enhance their living res ources. Under the administration of USEPA, comprehensive management plans are generated to protect and enhance environmental resources of estuaries designated to be of national importance. The governor of a state may nominate an estuary for the program and request that a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan be developed. Over a 5-year period, representatives from federal, state, and interstate agencies; ac ademic and scientific institutions, and industry and citizen groups do the following : (1) define objectives for protecting the estuary, (2) select the chie f problems to be addressed in the plan, and (3) ratify a pollu tion control and resource management strategy to meet each objective. Strong public support and subsequent political commitments are needed to accomplish the actions called for in the plan. There are seven coastal or near-coastal National Estuary Programs in the Gulf of Mexico region. National Estuary Program Description Charlotte Harbor Located on the FL west coast, Charlotte Bay is the second largest open-water estuary in the state, with a total area of 270 mi2. It serves as a home, feeding ground, and/or nursery area for more then 270 species of resident, migran t, and commercial fishes of the Gulf of Mexico. Manatees, sea turtles, wood storks, and dolphins are also found in the estuary and its watershed. Sarasota Bay This 283-mi2 estuary is located on the FL west coast. Much of the bay's habitat for young fish was destroyed as the natural mangrove shoreline was replaced by concrete sea walls during development of waterfront communities. Since most sea walls cannot be removed without causing severe damage to homes, different styles of small artificial reefs attached to sea walls are being tested for their ability to provide a home for young fish. Tampa Bay Located on the FL west coat, Tampa Bay is the largest open-water estuary in Florida, with a total area of 398 mi2. As many as 40,000 pairs of birds nest in Tampa Bay every year. The bay is also home to dolphins, sea turtles, and manatees. Mobile Bay Mobile Bay's 44,500-mi2 watershed includes over two-thirds of AL and portions of GA, TN, and MS, making it the nation's sixth largest in area and fourth largest in discharge volume. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-61 2009 F. Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.4-6 ( continued ) National Estuarine Research Reserves and National Estuary Programs in the Gulf of Mexico Region National Estuary Program Description Barataria-Terrebonne Located between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers in south LA, this 4-million acre estuary system is separated by the Bayou Lafourche into two basins, Barataria Basin to the east and Terrebonne Basin to the west. It contains more coastal wetlands than any other estuarine system in the United States. Approximately 735 species of birds, finfish, shellfish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals spend all or part of their life cycle in the estuary. Galveston Bay This estuary is the seventh largest estuary in the United States and the largest in TX, with a watershed covering more than 24,400 mi2. The slow gradients of fresh to saline wetlands and open waters provide great habitat variety and ideal conditions for the growth of fish, crabs, shrimp, and oysters. Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries The twelve counties of this estuarine system encompass an area of 11,500 mi2, with 515 mi2 of bays and estuaries. Rapid population growth in the coastal areas of south TX has led to problems in this estuary system, including the decline of aquatic and wildlife populations, loss of wetlands and other coastal habitats, degradation of water quality, changes in circulation patterns, increasing sources of marine debris, and changes in freshwater flowing into the bay system.

National Marine Sanctuaries are created to protect areas that have exhibited high levels of biodiversity, ecological integrity, and/or cultural legacy. They are the breeding and feedin g grounds of whales, sea lions, sharks, and sea turtles, and contain unique marine habitats. There are five coastal or near-coast al National Marine Sanctuaries in the Pacific region. National Marine Sanctuary Description Channel Islands Located 22 nm off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA, in the Southern California Bight, this sanctuary protects approximately 1,658 mi2 of water surrounding Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara Islands. It contains extensive kelp beds, fish, and shellfish that are highly valued by commercial and sport fishermen, and provides habitat for breeding seabirds, including the endangered brown pelican. Monterey Bay Encompassing the waters of Monterey Bay and adjacent Pacific Ocean off the central CA coast, this vast sanctuary stretches 400 mi north to south, extends an average 30 nm offshore, and covers over 5,300 mi 2.

Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.5-4 ( continued ) National Marine Sanctuaries and Nation al Park Units in the Pacific Region Congress established the National Park Service to ensure protection and interpretation of some of the finest examples of natura l, cultural, and recreational resources. The National Park Service se ts aside areas of historical and recreational value that are maintained at various stages of development, ranging from a natural pristine environment to recreational facilities and concessions. The deve lopment at any given park unit depends on the primary goal for which it was established. Park units set aside to preserve specific envi ronments or historic locations may have localized areas developed to accommodate various uses, such as hunting, fishing, shell fishing, swimming, picnicking, hiking, camping, and boating. These uses must be compatible with the preservation of the environment or t he historic location for which the park was established. There are fi ve coastal or near-coastal National Park units in the Pacific region. National Park Unit Description Channel Islands NP The park consists of 249,354 acres, half of which are under the ocean, and includes San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Barb ara Islands off of CA.. Over 2,000 species of plants and animals can be found within the park; however, only four mammals are endemic to the islands. One hundred and forty-five of these species are unique to the islands and found nowhere else in the world. Golden Gate NRA This recreation area is the largest urba n national park in the world with 75,398 acres of land and water and 28 mi of coastline. Located in San Francisco, CA, it comprises numerous sites, including Alcatraz, the Presidio of San Francisco, and several forts. Point Reyes NS Located north of San Francisco, CA, this seashore comprises over 100 mi2, including 32,000 acres of coastal Wilderness Area. Estuaries, beaches, coastal scrub grasslands, salt and freshwater marshes, and coniferous forests make up 80 mi of undeveloped coastline. Over 45 percent of North American avian species and nearly 18 percent of CA plant species are found here because of the habitat and geology. Twenty-three threatened and endangered species exist within the seashore. It has been designated a part of the Central California Coast Biosphere Reserve. Redwood NSP Located in northern CA below the OR borde r, this park contains 12,613 acres of federal and state lands, including 37 mi of coastline, and c onsists of Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Sm ith Redwoods State Park, and Redwood NP. Together, these four parks are recognized as bo th a World Heritage Site and an International Biosphere Reserve, and they comprise 45 percent of all old-growth redwood forest remaining in CA. This park is also a testing ground for large-scale forest and stream restoration of severely impacted lands. Olympic NP Located in northwestern WA, this park contains over 60 mi of wild Pacific coast, the largest section of wilderness coast in the lower 48 states. About 95 percent of the park is designated wilderness, and the largest undisturbed old-growth and temperate rain forests in the Northwest are found here. In addition, eight kinds of plants and fifteen kinds of animals are found on the Olympic Peninsula but nowhere else on earth.

National Wildlife Refuges were established and are administered by the USFWS under the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a-742j, not including 742 d-l; 70 Stat. 1119) and the National Wild life Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd -668ee). These acts allow the USFWS to ac quire and to administer lands for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources. Although most refuges are managed for the enhancement of resident and migratory wildlife and are available for public recreational use, such as fishing, wildlife observation, hunting, and boati ng, refuges along the Pacific coast were established as wintering areas for ducks, geese, terns, and other migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Threatened and endangered species such as the bald eagle, California least tern, California brown pelican, and sea otters also enjoy protected sanctuary on refuges along the Pacific coast. There are twenty-eight coastal or near-coastal National Wild life Refuges in the Pacific region. National Wildlife Refuge Description San Diego Complex This series of small refuges were established to preserve and protect the rare birds of South San Diego Bay southern California's coastal marshes. The complex protects larger areas of open space in the coastal uplands, rare vernal pool wetlands, and in San Diego Bay. All refuges in the San Diego Complex have been designated \"Globally Important Bird Areas\" by the American Bird Seal Beach Conservancy; South San Diego Bay was recently designated as a Western Hemisphere Sweetwater Marsh Shorebird Reserve site. Tijuana Slough Don Edwards San Francisco Bay As the first urban National Wildlife Refuge es tablished in the United States, this complex Complex spans 23,000 acres of open bay, salt pond, salt marsh, mudflat, upland, and vernal pool Marin Islands habitats located throughout south San Francisco Bay. Located along the Pacific Flyway, the Farallon complex hosts over 280 species of birds each year and provides critical habitat to resident species like the endangered California clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. San Pablo Bay Antioch Dunes Ellicott Slough Salinas River Humboldt Bay This 2,200-acre refuge located in nor thern CA protects wetlands and bay habitats for migratory birds, especially black brant. The refuge includes the Lanphere Dunes, one of the most pristine remaining dune ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest, and the largest remaining eelgrass beds south of Willapa Bay, WA. Oregon Coast Complex This complex spans 320 mi of OR coastline, stretching from Tillamook Head, OR, south to Three Arch Rocks the CA border. Three Arch Rocks, Cape Meares, and Oregon Islands are marine refuges Cape Meares that protect coastal rocks, reefs, islands, and several headland areas; these habitats support some of the most important seabird nesting colonies in the United States, including Nestucca Bay common murres, tufted puffins, cormorants, and Oregon Islands and Bandon Marsh are estuarine reserves that preserve saltmarsh, brackish marsh, riparian Siletz Bay wetland, and wooded upland habitats. Bandon Marsh Lewis and Clark This refuge includes 8,313 acres of island s and sand bars in the Columbia River estuary, plus 35,000 acres of mostly tidelands and open water. Located near Astoria, OR, it provides wintering and resting areas for up to 1,000 tundra swans, 5,000 geese, and 30,000 ducks. Julia Butler Hansen Located in Cathlamet, WA, this re fuge consists of 4,757 acres of diked Columbia River floodplain and undiked islands. It provides critical habitat for the endangered Columbian white-tailed deer. Willapa This 11,000-acre refuge is located in Paci fic County, the southernmost coastal county in WA. Land varies from sand dunes, sand beache s, and mud flats to grasslands, saltwater and fresh marshes, and coniferous forest. Grays Harbor Located west of Hoquiam, WA, this 1,800-acre refuge is composed of tidal flats, salt marsh, freshwater ponds, and deciduous woodland. It is one of four major staging areas for shorebirds in North America, and the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network designated it a hemispheric reserve as a site of international significance. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-78 2009 F.

Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.5-6 National Estuarine Research Reserves and National Estuary Programs in the Pacific Region The National Estuarine Research Reserve Pr ogram was established by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 -1464) and is administered by the Sanctuaries and Reserves Division, NOAA. A primary objective of Congress in establishing the estuarine r esearch- reserve program is to provide information to be used by coastal managers and fishing industries by providing research informati on that will help assure the continued productivity of estuarine ecosystems. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, establishe d the National Estuarine Sanctuary Program to prov ide financial assistance awards on a matching basis to states to acquire, develop, and operate estuarine areas as natural field laboratories. The purpose of th e program is to provide long-term protection to vital habitats for estuarine- dependent life, thus preserving relatively unaltered estuarine areas for baseline scientific research and educational programs. There are four coastal or near-coastal National Estuarine Research Reserves in the Pacific region. National Estuarine Research Reserve Description Tijuana River Located in San Diego County, CA, on the Mexican border, this intertidal coastal estuary is primarily a shallow water habitat, though it is often termed an \"intermittent estuary.\" The reserve encompasses approximately 2,500 acres and is home to eight threatened and endangered species. Elkhorn Slough Located midway between the coastal towns of Santa Cruz and Monterey, CA, this 1,400-acre reserve is one of the relatively few undisturbed coastal wetlands remaining in CA. The main channel of the slough winds inland nearly 7 mi and is flanked by a broad sa lt marsh second in size only to San Francisco Bay. South Slough A 4,700-acre natural area encompassing 600 acres of tidal marshes, mudflats, and open water channels, this reserve connects to the ocean through the Coos estuary mouth, near Charleston, OR. It includes upland forests, freshwater wetlan ds and ponds, salt marshes, tidal floats, eelgrass meadows, and open water habitats. Padilla Bay Located on North Puget Sound near Anacorte s, WA, this 11,000-acre rese rve encompasses extensive seagrass meadows, tidal flats and sloughs, salt mars hes, and upland forests and mangroves. Padilla Bay is an estuary at the saltwater edge of the large delta of the Skagit River. It is about 8 mi long and 3 mi across and contains nearly 8,000 acres of eelgrass. In 1987, the NEP was established by the Water Quality Act (P.L. 100-4) and is administered by USEPA. The purposes of the progra m are to identify nationally significant estuaries, protect and improve their water quality, and enhance their living resources. Under t he administration of USEPA, comprehensive management plans are generated to protect an d enhance environmental resources of estuaries designated to be of national importance. The governor of a state may nominate an es tuary for the program and request that a Comprehensive Conservat ion and Management Plan be developed. Over a 5-year period, representatives from federal, state, and interstate agencies; academic and scientific institutions, and industry and citizen groups do the following: (1) define objectives for protecting the estuary, (2) select th e chief problems to be addressed in the plan, and (3) ratify a pollution control and re source management strategy to meet each objective. Strong pu blic support and subsequent political commitments are needed to accomplish the actions called for in the plan. There are six coastal or near -coastal National Estuary Programs in the Pacific region. National Estuary Program Description Santa Monica Bay Located off the west coast of Los Angeles, CA, this bay has 306 mi2 of surface water and 414 mi2 of watershed. Habitats types include te rrestrial, wetland, and rocky intertidal areas. Kelp beds and coastal scrub are also found in the bay, which is home to many threatened or endangered species. Morro Bay Located between Los Angeles Harbor and San Franci sco Bay in CA, Morro Bay is the largest of relatively unaltered bays; it is actually a lagoon or shallow sound. The 2,300-acre bay and its 48,000-acre watershed include salt marsh, tidal mudflats, and open water habitats. San Francisco Bay As the largest estuary on the western seaboard, the bay has a surface area of approximately 1,600 mi2 and a watershed area of 60,000 mi2, which is 40% of the total area of CA. Water in the bay has huge salinity range. Habitats include open water, intertidal mudfla ts, rocky shores, salt ponds, marshes (salt, brackish, and freshwater), riparian forests, and vernal pools. Tillamook Bay Located along the northern Pacific coast line of OR, Tillamook Bay has a surface area of 11 mi2 and a watershed area of 5,70 mi2. Five rivers largely supply the fresh water in the bay. Habitats include intertidal flats, salt marsh, mud flats, seagrasses, and eelgrass. Lower Columbia River Beginning in Canada and traveling down along the WA and OR coasts, the Lower Columbia River has a 259,000-mi2 watershed, and the program covers 146 mi from the mouth of the river to Bonneville Dam. The river has the second largest volume of flow of any river in the United States. Hundreds of species, including 175 species of birds, use the lower river and estuary as permanent or migratory habitat. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2009 F-80 F.

Table F.6-5 National Wildlife Refuges in the Alaska Region The National Wildlife Refuge System is a network of U.S. land s and waters managed specifically for the enhancement of wildlife. National Wildlife Refuges were established and are administered by the USFWS under the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a-742j, not including 742 d-l; 70 Stat. 1119) and the National Wild life Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd -668ee). These acts allow the USFWS to ac quire and to administer lands for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources. Most refuges are managed for the enhancement of resident and migratory wildlife and are available for public recreational use, such as fishing, wildlife observation, hunting, and boating. There are ten coastal or near-coastal National Wildlife Refuges in the Alaska region. National Wildlife Refuge Description Kenai This nearly 2-million acre refuge consists of the western slopes of the Kenai Mountains and forested lowlands bordering Cook Inlet and includes all AK habitat types \u2014tundra, mountains, wetlands, and forests. The refuge is host to Dall sheep, mountain goat, caribou, coyote, wolf, grizzly bear, black bear, lynx, wolverine, beaver, small mammals, and birds. Kenai Refuge provides undisturbed spawning for many Cook Inlet salmon. Kodiak This refuge consists of 1.65 million acres or about two-thirds of Kodiak Island. In addition, the refuge includes a portion of Afognak Island (50,000 acres) to the north of Kodiak Island. Kodiak Island has an irregular coast line of bays and inlets that up to 2 million seabirds inhabit. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-92 2009 F.

A primary objective of Congress in establishing the estuarine research-reserve program is to provide information to be used by coastal managers and fishing industries by providing research in formation that will help assure the continued productivity of estuarine ecosystems. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, established the National Estuarine Sanctuary Program to provide financial assistance awards on a matching basi s to states to acquire, develop, and operate estuarine areas a s natural field laboratories. The purpose of the program is to pr ovide long-term protection to vital habitats for estuarine-depen dent life, thus preserving relatively unaltered estuarine areas for baseline scientific research and educational programs. There is one coastal or near-coastal National Estuarin e Research Reserve in the Alaska region. National Estuarine Research Reserve Description Kachemak Bay Located approximately 150 mi south of Anchorage, AK, on the western coast of the Kenai Peninsula, this reserve covers 365,000 acres an d is the largest National Estuarine Research Reserve in the system. It is also one of the most diverse, productive, and intensively used estuaries in AK. The reserve contains extensiv e tidal mudflats, subtidal habitat, upland forests, the Kenai Mountains, and nearby glaciers.

National Marine Sanctuaries are created to protect areas that have exhibited high levels of biodiversity, ecological integrit y, and/or cultural legacy. They are the breeding and feeding gro unds of whales, sea lions, sharks, and sea turtles, and contain unique marine habitats. There are two coastal or near-coastal National Marine Sanctuaries in the Oceania region. National Marine Sanctuary Description Hawaiian Islands Humpback The total area of this sanctuary is about 1,400 mi2, encompassing the waters around the Whale main Hawaiian Islands. These waters constitute one of the world's most important North Pacific humpback whale habitats and the only place in the United States where humpbacks reproduce. Approximately two-thirds of the entire North Pacific humpback whale population migrates to these waters to breed, calve, and nurse their young. Fagatele Bay The smallest and most remote of a ll National Marine Sanctu aries, this sanctuary encompasses only 163 acres and is located on Tutuila, American Samo a, with its borders extending from the southernmost point of the island to the island's southwestern shore. It is the only true tropical coral reef in th e National Marine Sanctuaries Program. Hawaii Volcanoes NP Located near Hilo, Hawaii, this park encompasses nearly 218,000 acres, including the earth's most massive volcano, Mauna Loa, and most active volcano, Kilauea. Over half of the park is a designated Wilderness Area, and it has been recognized as an International Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-107 2009 F. Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.7-4 ( continued ) National Marine Sanctuaries and National Park Units in the Oceania Region Congress established the National Park Service to ensure protection and interpretation of some of the finest examples of natura l, cultural, and recreational resources. The National Parks Service se ts aside areas of historical and recreational value that are maintained at various stages of development, ranging from a na tural pristine environment to r ecreational facilities and concess ions. The development at any given park unit depends on the primary goal for which it was established. Park units set aside to preser ve specific environments or historic locations may have localized areas developed to accommodate various uses, such as hunting, fishing, shell fishing, swimming, picnicking, hiking, camping, an d boating. These uses must be compatible with the preservation of the environment or the historic location for which the park was established. State and territorial parks provide for the same protection and enjoyment of similar resources throughout the Oceania region. There are ten coastal or near-coastal National Par k units in the Oceania region. National Park Unit Description Pu'uhonua O Honaunau NHP Located in Ho naunau, Hawaii, this 182-acre park pr eserves a complex of archaeological sites, including the site where Hawaiians who broke an ancient law against the gods could avoid certain death by fleeing to this place of refuge or \"pu'uhonua.\" Kaloko-Honokohau NHP Located in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, this 1,160-acre park preserves, protects, and interprets traditional native Hawaiian activities and cult ure. It is the site of an ancient Hawaiian settlement that encompasses portions of four different traditional sea-to-mountain land divisions. Puukohola Heiau NHS The founding of the Hawaiian kingdom can be directly associated with one structure in the Hawaiian Islands: Pu'ukohola Heiau, a temple constructed by Kamehameha I to incur the favor of the war god Juka'ilimoku. Located in Kawaihea, Hawaii, this 85-acre site includes the temple plus property of John Young, who fought for Kamehameha I. Haleakala NP Located near Kula, Maui, this park preserves the volcanic landscape of the upper slopes of Haleakala and protects the ecosystems of Kipahulu Valley, the scenic pools along Oheo Gulch, and many rare and endangered species. Of its 30,183 acres, 19,270 are Wilderness Areas. It was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980. Kalaupapa NHP Located on the north shore of Molokai, this park contains the historic Hansen's disease settlements of Kalaupapa and Kalawao. Kaulau papa, on the leeward side of the Kalaupapa Peninsula, is still home for many surv iving Hansen's disease patients. U.S.S. ARIZONA Memorial Located in Honolulu, Oahu, the 184-ft memorial straddles the sunken hull of the battleship U.S.S. ARIZONA and commemorates the December 7, 1941, Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It has also attracted the attention of scientists in recent years as they have begun exploration to determine how long the U.S.S. ARIZONA will safely hold the million gallons of oil that it still contains. American Memorial Park Located in Sa ipan, CNMI, this park honors the American and Marianas people who gave their lives during the Marianas Campaign of World War II. Over 5,000 names are inscribed on a memorial, which rests at the park's Court of Honor and Flag Circle, where the U.S. flag flies 24 hours a day. Within the park's 133- acre boundaries is a 30-acre wetland and mangrove forest. War in the Pacific NHP Composed of seven units on Guam, two of which are located in the coastal zone (Asan and Agat), this 2,037-acre park is the only site in the National Park System that honors all people from all nations who participated in the Pacific Theater of World War II. NP of American Samoa This 9,000-acre park is located on three separate islands of American Samoa (Tutuila, Ofu, and Ta'u), with approximately one-quarter of the total park area being offshore waters. The park's two rain forest preserves and coral reef are home to unique tropical animals such as the flying fox, Pacific boa, tortoises, and an array of birds and fish.

Affected Environment Supplementary Information Table F.7-5 National Wildlife Refuges in the Oceania Region The National Wildlife Refuge System is a network of U.S. lands and waters managed specifically for the enhancement of wildlife. National Wildlife Refuges were established and are administered by the USFWS under the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a -742j, not including 742 d-l; 70 Stat. 1119) and the Nationa l Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd -668ee). These acts allow the USFWS to acquire and to administer lands for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources. Most refuges are managed for the enhancement of resident and migratory wildlife and are available for public recr eational use, such as fishing, wildlife observation, hunting, and boating. There are eighteen coastal or near-coastal National Wildlife Refuges in the Oceania region. National Wildlife Refuge Description Big Island Complex This complex consists of the 33,000-acre Hakala u Forest, which is located the eastern slope Hakalau Forest of Mauna Loa, and the 5,300-acre Kona Forest , which is located on the western slope of Kona Forest Mauna Loa. The complex was established specifically for the conservation of endangered birds including the akiapola'au, the Hawaiian akepa, creeper, hawk, o'u, 'elepaio, and oma'o, as well as the Hawaiian hoary bat. Maui Complex This complex includes Kakahaia on Molokai and Kealia Pond on the south coast of Maui. Kakahaia Kakahaia contains a 15-acre pond and a manmade 7-acre impoundment and provides habitat Kealia Pond for the endangered Hawaiian coot and stilt. Kealia Pond consists of 700 acres of some of the last remaining natural wetland habitat in HI and provides habitats for the endangered Hawaiian stilt, coot, and wintering migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Oahu at the northernmost tip of Oahu, the 162-acre James Campbell protects the James Campbell endangered Hawaiian moorhen, coot, stilt, and koloa (Hawaiian duck) and serves as a Pearl Harbor strategic landfall for migratory birds coming from as far AK and Siberia. The 37-acre Honouliuli Unit which borders West Loch and the 25-acre Waiawa Unit bordering Middle Oahu Forest Loch, Pearl Harbor protects some of the last remaining wetlands on Oahu. Oahu Forest is located on the upper slopes of the Ko'olau Mountains and is home to the endangered Oahu tree snails, plants species, and many native birds. Kauai Complex The 917-acre Hanalei, located on the northern coas t of Kauai, consists of river bottom land, Hanalei taro farms, and wooded slopes and protects the endangered koloa (Hawaiian duck) and the Kilauea Point Hawaiian gallinule, coot, and st ilt. Located on the northernmost tip of the island, Kilauea Point consists of 200 acres of cliffs and headlands and is home to red-footed southeast side of Kauai, the 241-acre Huleia provides habitat for four species of endangered waterbirds and migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Midway Atoll Measuring approximately 5 mi in diameter and consisting of three sand islands surrounded by a coral reef, the Midway Atoll is a nesting ground for millions of seabirds, including the Laysan albatross and the black-footed albatross. The refu ge also serves as a major breeding area for the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the threatened green sea turtle, and the spinner dolphin. Hawaiian Islands Consisting of a chain of eight island s, reefs, and atolls extending about 800 mi northwest from the main Hawaiian Islands, this refuge provides breeding grounds for four endangered endemic bird species \u2014Laysan duck, Laysan finch, Nihoa finch, and Nihoa millerbird. The refuge also supports the entire population of endangered Hawaiian monk seal and provides nesting beaches for virtually the entire HI population of threatened green sea turtles. Guam Located at Ritidian Point (the northernmost point of Guam), this 22,500-acre refuge has 401 acres of coral reef and deepwater marine ha bitats backed by 321 acres of high limestone cliffs, native limestone forests, and beach. It provides habitats for the last remaining colonies on Guam of the endangered island swiftlet, Mariana fruit bat, Mariana crow, and common Mariana moorhen. continued Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil F-111 2009 F.

As part of the establishment of the reserve, Executive Order 13178 contains conservation measures that restrict some activiti es throughout the reserve and establishes Reserve Preservation Areas around certain islands, at olls, and banks where all consumptive or extractive uses are prohibited. The coral banks and shoals of the reserve are Nihoa Island, Necker Island, French Frigate Shoals, Gardner Pinnacles , Maro Reef, Island, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Atoll, Kure Atoll, Bank west of the French Frigate Shoals, and the Southeast Brooks Bank. Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve Description Northwestern Hawaiian Islands This reserve encompasses approximately 99,500 nm2 of the marine waters and submerged lands of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands extending approximately 1,200 nm long and 100 nm wide. This stretch of coral islands, at olls, pinnacles, seamounts, banks, and shoals west-northwest of Kauai, HI, is unquestionably some of the healthiest and most extensive corals reefs in the world. Approximately 70 per cent of U.S. coral reefs are located here. This vast area supports a more than 7,000 marine species, of which approximately half are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain. Special Management Areas are unique to Am erican Samoa and are designated under the Administrative Code for the American Samoa Coastal Management Act of 1990, which defines these areas as \"possessing unique and irreplaceable habitat, products or materials, offers beneficial functions and/or affects the cultural values or quality of life significant to the general populat ion of the territory and fa'a (Samoan 'way' or culture).\" Management objectives are established for coral reefs within the management area that include protecting subsistence activities, preventing adverse impacts to reefs and corals, and avoiding discharges of petr oleum products, siltation, and the destruction of productive habitat. There are three Special Management Areas in the Oceania region. Special Management Area Description Pago Pago Harbor This area is delineated by a line draw n from Goat Island Point to the jetty at Leloaloa and includes all land and water resources on the inner harbor side of the American Samoa Highway 001 paralleling the shore around the Pago Pago Harbor. Leone Bay (Leone Pala) Located on the southwest coastal area of American Samoa's island of Tutuila, it consists of 8.4 hector acres of wetlands and 3.6 hector acres of mangroves.

Dispersant may also partition from the oil droplets in the water. This effect has been demonstrated by laboratory toxicity experiments with Corexit\u00ae 9527 and mineral oil, and may be a common phenomenon (N RC, 1989). Dispersant droplets may also directly affect organisms on the water surface. The intent is, or course, to minimize such exposures during operations but they may still occur and need to be considered. All dispersant formulations include surface-active agents (surfactants) as well as solvents. The detailed composition of dispersants is proprietary, and the ac tual compositions of spec ific dispersant products vary significantly. However, based on a review of patent literature, the surfactants used in modern dispersants are generally blends of nonionic and anionic types. The nonionic types onate (Fiocco and Lewis, 1999). Solvents in a dispersant must solubilize the blend of surfactant components and penetrate into the oil when applied, assisting in the diffusion of surfactants through the oil slick to the oil -water interface. Low-toxicity solvents used in modern dispersants include oxyg enated compounds as glycols and glycol some of which are also used in cosmetics and household cleaners. Components such as alcohols and water are sometimes used as co-solvents or co\u00adsurfactants to help solubilize the surfactants and modify visc osity (Fiocco and Lewis, 1999). The chemical cleaners used du ring the earliest oil spill disp ersant applications (e.g., 1967 TORREY CANYON spill) were toxic to marine life because they contained solvents composed of aromatic compounds, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and naphthalenes. None of these components are Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil G-1 2009 G. The Environmental Effects of Dispersants without Oil used in modern dispersants and mo dern dispersants are much less toxic than the oils they are used to disperse. Dispersants do have the potential to increase the dissolution rate of the toxic low molecular weight aromatic compon ents of the crude oil into the water column (Fingas et al., 1991). In practice, however, most or a ll of these components will have already evaporated during the few hours prior to the application of dispersant. Thus, the increase in dissolution of these components because of dispersant use is likely to be very limited (Fiocco and Lewis, 1999; French McCay, 2001, 2002). The modeling analysis in Parts A through F of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) supports this conclusion. Only chemical dispersants that are listed on th e current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Oil and Hazardous Substances Polluti on Contingency Plan (USEPA's NCP) Product Schedule may be used to treat oil spills in U.S. wa ters. Manufacturers who want to list their chemical dispersants on the NCP Product Schedule must complete specific tests demonstrating effectiveness of at least 45 percent, aquatic toxi city, and identify ingredients. The results of these tests are sent to the USEPA for evaluation (FDEP, 2001). The August 2001 edit ion of the NCP Product Schedule includes only seven dispersants from five manufacturers. Only one of these dispersants has hydrocarbon-based solvents (USEPA, 2001). The primary risks in the application and use of dispersants (those which do not mix with oil) are to birds, furry mammals, water-column organisms, and people. In birds and fur-bearing marine mammals, direct contact with dispersants causes fouling of plum age or fur. Dispersants remove the natural oils of feathers and fu rs. This destroys the insulating and water repelling properties of the plumage and fur, allowing water to penetrate to the body surface, resulting in hypothermia and loss of buoyancy. Direct contact can also cause irritation to eyes and skin. While these potential impacts are real, they are relatively easy to minimize or eliminate. The presence of sensitive animals is routinely checked before dispersant application. Given reasonable care, areas not in the immediate vicinity of the slick should not be at risk. Animals located in or very close to the slick are at significantly more risk from th e oil than from mi sapplied dispersant. The use of dispersants also raises the risk to human health. Direct contact between skin and porous membranes may cause irritation or mild toxic effects. Low concentrations, such as those usually used in dispersant application and the concentration found in the water after application, are generally not considered a risk to human health. Risks to pers onnel who make and load the product are covered in the specific product Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), which is available from the manufacturer. Generally, these risks include inhalation hazards, de rmal and internal tissue to xicity risks, and general absorption risks through mucous membranes. While workers could experience some risk of exposure to high concentrations when moving or loading concentrated dispersant, oil spill responders or members of the mo nitoring team will require no special protection equipment or precautions beyond those normally used in spill response operations. Protective measures adequate for minimizing oil ex posure are sufficient to minimize exposure to dispersants. Some water-column toxic effects to marine organisms from disper sants may occur, if dispersant lands directly on the water. For some species, larvae or eggs (which are the most sensitive stages) may concentrate near the surface, and therefore wo uld be at risk. However, such effects would be minor and short-lived due to dilution of the dispersant and recruitment of organisms from unaffected areas (NRC, 1989). These potential impa cts are discussed in more detail below, based on consideration of exposu res that might occur at an actual spill event. The potential for exposure begins with the applic ation rate; too much dispersant places excess chemicals into the water column, with no additional benefit in treating the surface slicks; too little, and the application may not be effective, as the interfacial tension and the oil-water interface may Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil G-2 2009 G. The Environmental Effects of Dispersants without Oil not be sufficiently reduced to di sperse the oil droplets. As of 1997, the recommended chemical dispersant application is typically reported as 1 to 20 dispersant-to-oil ratio based on several laboratory studies In the field, higher dispersa nt-to-oil ratios may be used (reaching the NCP guidelines of dispersant-to-oil rati os of 1 to 10) (Scholz et al., 1999). Dispersant use data from more recent spills show that the dispersant-to-oil ratio has been greatly reduced with new chemical dispersant formulations. During the SEA EMPRESS spill in 1996, the dispersant-to-oil ratio was as little as 1 to 65, and during the CAPTAIN spill in Scotland, the ratio was on average 1 to 80. Dispersant application rates are dependent upon the oil type, the extent of weathering the oil has already undergone, the dispersant used, and the weather/wave conditions at the application site. Lightweight, low-viscosity oils or rough sea condit ions would require less dispersant (1 to 50, 1 to 100, or even less) to break up a slick. On the ot her end of the spectrum, high viscosity oils, oils nearing their pour point, or seas under relatively calm conditions may not disperse even when much higher treatment rates (such as 1 to 10 or more) are used (Scholz et al., 1999). For the purposes of discussion, we will examine the potential for exposure to dispersant only using the most common planning factor, a dispersant-to-oil ratio of 1:20, based on an assumed slick thickness of 0.1 mm. If this information were used to develop an application rate, then the aircraft (or vessel) would attempt to deliver approximately 5 gal per acre. Based on this rate the initial concentration in the water column, if mixing occurs to a depth of 1 m, would be 5 ppm. If the immediate mixing depth is 3 m, then the initial concentration would be approximately 1 ppm. This assumes no lateral mixing, which would immediately begin to dilute the concentrations to even lower levels. Based on reasonable rates of turbulent mixing in the open ocean these concentrations would be maintained for only a few minutes, at most (Lewis and Aurand, 1997). This is, in fact, the basis for the conclusion that \"even initial concentr ations in the water column are below most, but not all, estimated lethal and sublethal concen trations\" (NRC, 1989, p. 123). These concentrations were based on constant exposure tests; when more -recent, spiked-exposure tests are used, species sensitivities tend to be even lower. George-Ares and Clark (2000) reviewed the to xicity data for the tw o commonly stockpiled dispersants in the United States (Corexit\u00ae 9500 and 9527). Their summary data included both continuous exposure tests, for periods of from 24 to 96 hours, as well as spiked (declining) exposures with a half-life of roughly 2.5 hours, still much longer than likely in open marine environments. No reported continuous exposure EC 50 or LC 50 spiked effect concentration was less than approximately 4 ppm. Thei r summary confirms that few, if any, species would be directly affected by anticipated concentrations, and that any such affects would be re stricted to very small water volumes where the app lication initially occurred. Since the intent is always to avoid such exposures by appropriately targeting the oil slick, the relative risk from dispersant alone is minimal in comparison to the risk from dispersed oil. Consequently, subsequent discussions focus on dispersed oil only. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil G-3 2009 G.

A LTERNATIVE 1 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE ATLANTIC REGION For the purpose of this PEIS, the Atlantic region will specifically cover the waters extending from the Gulf of Maine to the Florida Straits (Appendix F, Figure F.2-1). The location selected for modeling and risk assessment purposes was a site offshore Delaware Bay because it is in a high- traffic area at greater risk for oil spills. Modeling re sults from this location were evaluated relative to the geographic area in Section B.1.2 of the technical report (French Mc Cay et al., 2004), herein referred to as the Mid-Atlantic Shelf. The Mid- Atlantic Shelf encompasses three biogeographical provinces: New York-New Jersey Shelf, Delaware Bay, and Delmarva Shelf. In general, the Mid-Atlantic Shelf is representative of offshore sites throughout the region and provides a basis for the modeling of potential environmental ef fects. The results of the modeling \u2014used to evaluate spills of concern in this risk analysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore 1)\u2014are presented in detail in Part B of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and summarized in this section. Table H.2-1 presents the risk ranking for the modeling of Alternative 1 in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) for three spill sizes (sma ll, 200 bbl; medium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). The risk scores presented in the table are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional considerations; however, in any sp ecific oil spill situation local concerns could be higher (see the risk matrix pullout at the end of the document for definitions of the levels of concern). Table H.2-2 summarizes the significance of the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternat ive 1 in the Atlantic region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for an average spill to the region in general. 1 Statute miles were used instead of nautical miles due to default options within the computer-modeling program (1 nm = 1.1508 statute mi). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-1 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Although dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in the Atlantic region (Figure 2.2-1), under the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) of Alternative 1 appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical dispersion; thus, chemical dispersion is not considered in the an alysis of the Atlantic region. Further, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantly change the level of effects identified from those obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. For spills analyzed in this document (i.e., those that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore) using mechanical-only recovery, there are likely to be minor or insignificant regional adverse impacts on all resources for a small spill, based on the speed with which such a spill would weather and dissipate and the small area that could be affected, except for marine and coastal birds, which could be moderate. For a medium spill, adverse impacts are minor or insignificant for all resources except for marine and coastal birds, whic h could be moderate. For a large spill, there is the potential for moderate adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds, intertidal habitats, and areas of special concern. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-2 2009 H.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills H.2.1 Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to water quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect water quality are the soluble aromatics, (monoaromatic hydrocarbons) and PAHs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) (Section 4.3.1.1). Thus, evaluation of potential adverse effects is based on the degree of potential contamination by these compounds. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effect s on water quality are ge nerally low, whether mechanical-only recovery or mechanical recovery plus in situ burning is employed. This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and because of the rapid dilution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column. During periods of extreme turbulence, oil generally mixes into the water column where aromatics may dissolve rapidly, but resurfac ing and dilution of oil drople ts result in only localized contamination at levels of concern unless the dilu tion volume is restricted. Overall, based on the modeling and risk a ssessment results, it is concluded that \u2014using the basic re sponse scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) \u2014adverse water-quality effects under Alternat ive 1 would be low in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Atlantic region. However, if th e spill moved into shallow and confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills under conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence or in areas where oil collects for a few weeks to months after a spill. The variable used to determine potential water-quality effects is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentrat ion for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected wa ter volume increases with spill volume and varies with the level of physical dispersion during the time of the spill. Natural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of water that is c ontaminated above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of water contam inated increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume of water contamin ated for a small spill was extrapolated from the mean medium- and large-spill model results. The estimates of the volume of water contaminated \u2014 and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Atlantic region because the mixing of oil into water and process of dilution are similar in all areas. Coastal Delaware Bay is used as a representative of coastal water for analyzing the Mid-Atlantic Shelf, as well as the Atlantic region. Dela ware Bay is approximately 2,669 km 2 in area and about 10 m deep on average, with a total volume of approximatel y 26,690 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of Delaware Bay to determine the potential consequences of small, medium, and large spills (Table H.2.1-1). This approach yields a very conservative estimate, in that it assumes all of the contamination would occur in coastal water. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-5 2009 H.

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and reco very time would be on th e order of days to weeks (NRC, 1985, 2005). Oil may be inco rporated into shallow water or intertidal sediments where, through leaching, it could become a continuing source of contamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degrad ation in the locality where the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offs hore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Ti er I standards (beginning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concer n to water quality would have evaporated or di ssolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have an insignificant influence on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would apply whether ei ther response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Atlantic region unde r Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spills, and minor for large spills. Marine In marine waters, which are 3 or more statute mi offshore, mechanical recovery and in situ burning currently may be used for spill response in the Atlantic region; although dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in the Atlantic region (Appendix F, Figure F.2-1), chemical dispersion is not used because appropriate response times cannot currently be met. As was done for coastal waters, the estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of the reference area, the Mid-Atlantic Shelf. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-6 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The Mid-Atlantic Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters in the Atlantic region. The total surf ace area of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf is approximately 68,541 km2, so the area of interest is much vaster for marine waters than for coastal waters. Water-quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water\u201418 m deep. which is much shallower than most of the Atlantic region's marine wate rs. The results for the se lected modeling location (Table H.2.1-2) represent conservative estimates of adverse water-quality effects using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit).

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Natural dispersion of the oil would be very rapid after a spill, and recovery time would be on the order of hours to days. Leaching from oil contam ination reaching the sediments would not have a significant effect on marine water quality because of the large dilution volume and natural dispersing forces in marine waters. The results would apply whether a mechanical response is implemented. Since in situ burning would replace some of the mechanical response, and both methods remove oil that would otherwise result in water contaminati on, the potential water-quality effects would not change significantly if in situ burning were used. For a spill in water deeper than the 18 m evaluated here, the potential adverse effe cts would be even smaller. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine water quality in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an oil spill on air quality may involve all vol atile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-7 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills normally very localized and short lived for small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any po tential adverse effects: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. The modeling shows that results do not vary by sp ill location, or size in the Atlantic region. Two possible sources of contamination to the atmosphere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilization of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). The modeling results show that the potential advers e effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-only recovery; hence, the risk scores are virtually identical for small, medium, and large spills. Volatilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standa rds for human health at more than 1 km from the spill site. Evaporation off the water surface and volatilization from the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocarbon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentrations in the atmosphere at th e water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmosphere would be on the order of days. Thus, a low level of concern is expected for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical-only recovery. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via burning. For small spills , it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feas ible (Table H.2.1-3). The maximum area potentially exceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km 2 for a medium spill and 15.8 km2 for a large spill (Table H.2.1-3). If humans or sensitive re sources (i.e., wildlife) are within these areas, they could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, a region of interest equivalent to the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (68,541 km2) would have less than 1 percent of its area adversely affected, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. Thus, low levels of concern are expected from small, medium, and large oil spills involving in situ burning (Table H.2.1-3). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-8 2009 H.

H.2.2 Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals The species of cetaceans inhabiting the Atlantic region (Appendix F, Table F.2-1) have concentrations that vary depending on location and seasonal migrations. The only pinniped of concern in the Atlantic region is the harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina ), which is found along shorelines, near river mouths, and even inland along the north Atlantic coast. Harbor seals are generally found from Maine to New Jersey; their presence south of Maine is seasonal. They gather in small groups when they haul out but are usually solitary when in the water. The Florida manatee ( Trichechus manatus latirostris ), which is a sirenian, inhabits the southern coastal waters of the Atlantic. It has extreme sensitivity to cold temperatures, so th e base population remains along the Florida coast year round. However, manatees have been spotted as far north as the Chesapeake Bay during the warm months of the year. There are no fur-bearing marine mammals of concern inhabiting this region (Section 3.2.2.1). Marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, seals, and manatees are vulnerab le to spilled oil since they spend considerable time at the water's surfa ce, which enhances possible contact with oil. The majority of these species remain offshore, and p opulations vary according to season and migration directions. Cetaceans appear able to detect and are likely to avoid floating oil or oil being recovered by mechanical means (Geraci, 1990). Studies have s hown that cetacean skin is nearly impenetrable to even the highly volatile constituents of oil, indicating that contact with oil probably would be less harmful to cetaceans than often believed. However, the toxic, volatile fractions in fresh crude oils could irritate and damage cetacean soft tissues , such as the mucous membranes of the eyes and airways. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-9 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Marine mammals that are more commonly found in the nearshore regions and intertidal habitats, such as harbor seals, are of greater concern. Ha rbor seals' use of restricted haulout areas and instinctual behavior to return to the same breeding area every year may increase the likelihood of physical contact with oil in the event of a nearby spill. Potential concerns include toxicity from ingestion of oil during grooming and adverse effects on juveniles through contact with contaminated teats when nursing. Overall, the potential adverse effects depend on the spill size, and the number and species of marine mammals present. Based on the surface area in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf, the area equivalent to 100 percent mortality for cetaceans and for pinnipeds and sirenians is less than 0.01 percent of the available habitat, and the risk from floating oil is low. Pinnipeds could also come into contact with oil on the shoreline. Estimated average shoreline length oiled is 11.6 km for a medium spill and 29.2 km for a large spill. The likelihood that these lengths would actually involv e a pinniped haulout area is low. Based on the scattered presence and migratory nature of these mamma ls in the Atlantic region, the potential level of concern was determined to be low for small, medium, and large oil spills. The results of the modeling for marine mammals for the Mid-Atlantic Shelf are presented in Table H.2.2-1. Based on the modeling for the Mid-Atlantic Shel f, the likelihood of adversely affecting large numbers of marine mammals is low unless the spill o ccurs in the immediate vicinity of a pinniped haulout area. Since the difference in shoreline oilin g between the medium and large spills is small, and such locations are rare along most of the Atlantic coast, it is unlikely that more than 1 percent of any regional population of concern would be adversely affected. The addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse effects nor increase risk to marine mammals. If mortality did occur, however, the population would probably require 1 to 3 years to recover.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-10 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds are usually of highest concern during an oil spill because birds are highly susceptible to the acut ely toxic effects from exposure to oil. There are many areas in the Atlantic region where high concentrations of birds may be found along the shore, in nearshore and estuarine habitats, or in offshore marine-water habitats (Section 3.2.2.2). Adverse effects on birds in this region would result mostly from shoreline oiling in sensitive staging and nesting habitats for shorebirds, wading and marsh birds, and waterfowl. Surface water oiling may also adversely affect feeding, rafting, and diving birds and waterfowl (Section 3.2.2.2). Gulls, terns, raptors, and seabirds also occur in the region and use shoreline, offshore, and wetland habitats (see Section 4.3.2.2 for information on th e main issues of concern for birds exposed to an oil spill). The Mid-Atlantic Shelf was selected for the modelin g as representative of the coastal habitats and wildlife in the Atlantic region (Table H.2.2- 2). Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the potential adverse effects on birds. Potential levels of concern for birds in th e Mid-Atlantic Shelf are medium for all spill sizes, as discussed below. However, for a small spill very little oil is likely to strand onshore in staging and nesting habitats, and oil loadin g would be light in most cases. The potential for adverse effects increases for large spills, with gr eatest concern for conditions wh ere sand beaches, wetlands, and tidal flats become heavily oiled. Table H.2.2-2 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills * to Marine and Coastal Birds Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf Spill Size Populations Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 1-5 3D Medium Large (40,000 bbl) 10-20 3B Source: Adapted from Part B of the tec hnical report (French McCay et al., 2004).

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Three Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) sites (a hemispheric site, an international site, and a regional site), three Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance), and six National Wildlife Refuge sites occur in the Mi d-Atlantic Shelf. The presence of these sites indicates that large numbers of shorebirds (W HSRN sites) and wetland birds (Ramsar site) concentrate in the area during migration and/or nest ing and wintering. From 0.95 to over 1.3 million birds have been observed at the Delaware Bay WHSRN site, which is the second largest stopover location in the Western Hemisphere during spring migration. The Delaware Bay site hosts 80 percent of the hemisphere's red and score Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-11 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills determined based on the possibility that a large nu mber of staging birds may be concentrated in a relatively small area that is heavily oiled during a medium or large spill (Table H.2.2-2). It is important to recognize that adverse effects on birds may be more or less severe depending on the time of year and locations of their habitats, as well as the extent of shoreline and surface water oiling. For instance, an oil spill occurring during peak spri ng migration for shorebirds at the Delaware Bay WHSRN site would result in more extreme adverse effects on regional shorebird populations than a spill occurring at a different time of year. Adverse effects on birds in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf for a small spill were determined by extrapolating from the results obtained for a medium spill and th e expectation that recovery from light oiling is usually rapid for all habitat types. The volume of oi l released in the small sp ill was approximately an order of magnitude less than in the medium spill; but the potential adverse effects on the bird population could be similar and pose a medium risk. The modeling of effects on birds for medium and large spills under mechanical-onl y recovery resulted in estimates of 1 to 5 percent and 10 to 20 percent, respectively, of the re gional bird population being potenti ally adversely affected because important wetland nesting areas and shorebird st aging areas (medium spill), and key sand beach habitats used by staging shorebirds and wetland nesting areas (large spill) were oiled. The risk scores in Table H.2.2-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates of 1 to 3 years for most bird species, as was the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2). Al though areas other than the Mid-Atlantic Shelf in the Atlantic region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on bird populations will fall within a similar range throughout the Atlantic region. The addition of in situ burning does not change the significance of these adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these groups are of high concern. As described in Section 4.3.2.3, plankton and fish are adversely affe cted either directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil droplets mixed by wa ves into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is direct upta ke of dissolved oil components, originating directly from surface oil or dissolving from the mi croscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, as spill size increases, so do adverse effects. However, there is great variability related to the environmental conditions after a spill; plankt on and fish suffer much more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather. In addition, many species utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they are more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved components when oil comes ashore. Species and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic components, with species from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stable locations being more sensitive than those from polluted and environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposure during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floa ting oil or the shoreline) to the water column Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-12 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills is gone, concentrations rapidly di sperse to background levels. However, there may be longer-term effects if the spill migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands where dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Juvenile fish are more abundant in salt marshes and seagrass beds than in other shallow subtidal and intertid al areas, so these areas are of most concern (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 1 in most cases, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm of shore1, but the dispersed oil plume could be transported by currents into this area. The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by oil spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes expo sed to toxic oil components. Percent loss multiplied by volume exposed was integrated over time and sp ace to calculate an e quivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes were translated to equivalent areas by multiplying them by water depth at the spill site, allowing comparison with other resources, such as birds and shorelines, which are distributed on a per-area basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniformly distributed when expressed on a per-ar ea basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynth esis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by the similar results fo r the four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, offshore Galveston Ba y, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively, of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) \u2014 the equivalent areas of adverse effect on plankton and fish (both average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in this PEIS. The modeled spill site was 18 m deep water: advers e effects would be less for deeper waters because of greater vertical dilution of both oil compone nts and organisms, and proportionately greater in shallower waters because of the restricted dilution potential. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much less. Thus, the model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortality of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes among response scenarios. The Mid-Atlantic Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the Atlantic region (Table H.2.2-3). The adverse effects were estimated as a percentage of the total area of concern (68,541 km 2). Based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality would be affected for a small spill (Table H.2.1-2), the volume of adverse effects on plankton and fish would be low for a small spill using the basic respon se scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.2.2-3). 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-13 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery ti me would be less than 1 year. Over all, based on the modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 would be localized to the immediate area around the spill site and similar in all marine-water areas of the region. For large spills that might move rapidly into shallow coastal areas due to winds and currents, the concentrations of toxic components might be high enough to cause some level of concern for water column communities, especially early life history stages of fish and inverteb rates using intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Intertidal Habitats Intertidal habitats are always of high concern during oil spills, particularly when sensitive habitats such as marshes and tidal flats are oiled because recovery can take many years. There are few effective cleanup methods for these sensitive habita ts; thus, natural recovery is often the primary response. For a discussion of the relative ranking of the sensitiv ity of intertidal habitats to spilled oil and the processes affecting oil fate and behavior on shorelines, see the explanation of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) in Section 4. 3.2.4. The Atlantic region contains extensive, productive estuaries (Section 3.2.2.4) and numerous tidal inlets and bays through which oil could affect sheltered wetlands and tidal flats. Sheltere d habitats are of special concern because oil is likely to persist for longer periods and have chronic effects on fish and birds that rely on these habitats. Wetland loss and degradation rates in the Atlantic region are high (Section 3.2.2.4), and adverse effects from oil spills can be very important. In addition, sand beaches along the extensive coastal barrier islands in this region are important habitats for migratory and nesting shorebirds, increasing the environmental conse quences of stranded oil. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential fo r adverse effects on inte rtidal habitats in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loadin g on the shoreline and affect larger areas. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-14 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed and, thus, does not reduce potential adverse effects. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats in the Atlantic region are low for a small spill in that very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. However, the potential for adverse effe cts increases with spill volume, with the greatest concer n for conditions where marshes and tidal flats become heavily oiled. The risk scores in Table 2.2-4 are based on estimated effects on the intertidal habitats of Delaware Bay because even large spills usually will not affect large sh oreline areas. For example, the maximum percentage of shoreline oiled under the la rge spill scenarios was only 0.02 percent of the shoreline area in the entire Mid-Atlantic Shelf.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats for a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting re covery from light oiling to usually be rapid for all habitat types. For a medium spill under mechan ical-only recovery, the modeling resulted in an estimated 11.6 km of oiled shoreline, which is a sm all percentage of the total shoreline in the entire Mid-Atlantic Shelf. However, moderate amounts of oil on wetlands could cause long-term adverse effects. For a large spill, the modeling resulted in an estimated 29. 2 km of oiled shoreline. This oiled area represents less than 1 percent of the entire shoreline area in the region but includes 3.5 percent of outer sand beach habitats and heavy oiling of sensitive wetlands that have recovery rates up to 3 to 7 years (Section 4.3.2.4). Although area s other than Delaware Bay in the Atlantic region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS, and it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on intertidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Atlantic region. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insi gnificant for small spills, minor for medium spills, and moderate for large spills. Subtidal Habitats Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-15 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The subtidal (benthic) habitat consists of the bott om substrate below the low tide level, as well as the species that live in, on, and near the substrate. This benthic community includes areas of live, sandy, muddy, and low-relief bottoms; subsurface canyons; and pinnacles. Organisms living \u2014include corals, plants and seagrasses, benthic invertebrates (such as crabs, shrimp, snails, bivalve mollusks, and marine wo rms), and bottom-dwelling fish. Because subtidal benthic communities do not include the intertidal zone, they are at little risk from floating oil because, by definition, this environment is always below the surface. The greatest risk of exposure comes from sinking oil, as well as in situ burn residue, or dispersed oil or the sorption of naturally dispersed or mechanically mixe d oil that has become suspende d on sediments and is deposited onto the ocean floor. However, significant natural dispersion of oil and sediment into the water column only occurs during large storms or for ne arshore oil spills. Oil particles could adhere to bottom substrate, plants, or animals, which could result in both physical coating of organisms, as occurred in the 1993 BRAER spill in the Shetland Islands, and toxic effects from exposure to the chemical constituents (Section 4.3.2.5). Such adverse effects are not normally observed. The risk to fauna and flora of the subtidal benthic habitat is minimal, based on the diluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid diluti on of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil re sidue potentially reaching the bottom substrate. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. It mi ght slightly increase the risk of remaining oil residues sinking to the bottom. Residual oil from in situ burning that reaches the bottom is expected to have little or no adverse effects on subtidal habitats since the majority of its toxic components would have either evaporated or been destroyed during burning and the volume of residue produced is so small (Section 4.3.2.5) . Under the modeled conditions, the quantity of in situ burn residue produced would not result in a level of concern that exceeds low. Based on the data for a medium spill, sediment contamination never exceeded thresholds of concern and the median area equi valent to 100 percent mortality for sensitive demersal species exposed to oil in the water column was less than 0.001 percent of the reference area. For a large spill sediment values did exceed the threshold of c oncern in a small area, but it was less than 0.001 percent of the reference area. Wate r column exposure also increased slightly, but still affected less than 0.02 percent of the reference area. Based on the total subtidal area present in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf the risk from water column exposure or se diment contamination is low (Table H.2.2-5).

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subtidal habitats in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Areas of Special Concern The potential effects on areas of special concern, such as National Marine Sanctuaries and National Wildlife Refuges, are important during an oil spill since these areas are under increased scrutiny and protection. Whereas most coastal and nearshore areas have a wide range of habitats or are very similar to other areas throughout the Atlantic region, areas of special concern are set aside for their uniqueness (Appendix F, Tables D.F-3 through D.F-5 and Figures F.2-1 through F.2-4). The potential risks and adverse effects associated with shoreline areas of special concern are identical to those discussed for intertidal habitats. The risks to subtidal areas, such as those included in National Marine Sanctuaries, are identical to thos e discussed above for subtidal habitats. For this analysis, the risks to areas of special concern ar e assumed to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Appendix H.2.2), whichever are greater. Since the risk to intertidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on data presented for a me dium spill, the estimated average extent of shoreline oiling is 11.6 km; this figure increases to 29.2 km for a large spill. The potential risk of surface oil reaching a shoreline associated with an area of special concern is low in the Mid-Atlant ic Shelf because of the number and scattered locations of these areas. Th e potential adverse effects on areas of special concern are normally low (Table H.2.2-6). However, potential concer ns associated with a large spill increase to medium levels because of the increased shoreline contamination. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-17 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Table H.2.2-6 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Areas of Special Concern Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf Spill Size Areas Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 0-1 Source: Adapted Part B of the tec hnical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Yellow represents a medium level of concern, and green, low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of th e Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Since areas of special concern are scattered along the Atlantic coast, it is unlikely that shoreline associated with areas of special concern would be disproportionately affect ed by an average spill. If an area of special concern was highly adversely affected, it is anticipate d that the recovery time for the affected area would be the same as for other inte rtidal habitats. These areas are most at risk from floating oil and benefit from any ac tions that reduce potential oiling. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, minor for medium spills, and moderate for large spills, based on the risk to intertidal habitats. H.2.3 Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The Atlantic region has a variety of threatened, endangered, or candidate species (Section 3.2.3). The overall regional risk that a threatened, endangered, or candidate species would be adversely affected or even present in the area of a spill is low; however, killing a single individual of such a species can be considered a severe adverse effect. Potential adve rse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, or fish that are threatened , endangered, or candidate species are identical to those discussed in Appendix H.2.2 for these groups. Po tential adverse effects on the six threatened or endangered species of sea turtles were discussed in detail in Section 4.3.3.1 and are similar to those described in Section Appendix H.2.2 (Marine Mammals) for pinnipeds. Se a turtles are a particular concern if the spill occurs in the vicinity of a nesting beach. Overall, the highest risk sc ores were calculated for coastal and marine birds with other types of protected species at lower risk. Regardless of the species, the majority of threatened, endangered, or candid ate species in the Atlantic region mature slowly and do not reach sexual maturity for several years; therefore, any adve rse effects on the reproduction or survival of these species should be considered high. Adverse effects on threatened, enda ngered, or candidate species in the Atlantic region for any spill size are difficult to predict. Depending on the location and season, the number and type of species present will vary. Based on the overall size of the Atlantic region and the low populations of threatened, endangered, or candidate species inhabiting this regi on, the likelihood of adversely affecting an individual of concern would be low unless the spill affects important shoreline or Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-18 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills critical marine habitats. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills, ba sed on the risk to marine and coastal birds. H.2.4 Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat Virtually all waters along the Atlantic coast and out to the limits of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are considered Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). Areas such as bays, river mouths, and harbors are designated EFH for at least one life stage of at least one species and are protected by legislation (Section 3.2.4). The primary issue with respect to EFH is either (1) exposure of sensitive resources in the water column to hydrocarbon concentrations of concern, or (2) the contamination of bottom sediments, both of which could lead to either acute or chronic exposures. Adverse effects would include either the death of individual organisms, the possibility of sublethal effects affecting long-term population viability, or de gradation of habitat that reduces its availability to managed species. For this analysis, the risks to EFH are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Appendix H.2.2), whichever are greater. The results for plankton and fish and for subtidal habitats indicate only low effects and form the basis for the EFH risk score. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce potential adverse effects. The data presented in Appendix H.2.2 indicate that the volume of water or area of sediment contaminated above thresholds of concern never approaches 1 percent of the reference area, so the risk is very low. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, based on the risk to plankton and fish and to subtidal habitats. H.2.5 Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Section 4.3.5, oil spills can pr oduce a variety of adverse social and economic effects. These adverse effects are generally not significant when measured at the regional level, but instead are typically felt in comm unities located near resources oile d by the spill. Specifically, high adverse effects are generally limited to those indu stries and populations that are affected by the spill. Some of the most visible and high effects are likely to include effects on water- and shore-based recreation, commercial and recreational fisheries, and tourism. In addition, large-scale spills hold the potential to adversely affect the well-being of the residents and economies of coastal communities. Individuals who rely on coastal resources for employment and income are at risk of experiencing disproportionately adverse effects from oil spills. This modeling considers the risk of adverse socioec onomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreation al activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceived taint; closure of commer cial fishing grounds or hatcheries, or reduced commercial harvests; and altered marine transportation patterns. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills can have secondar y adverse effects on social and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may caus e changes in employment and firm revenues of resource-based businesses. While these effects ar e not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and relative measur es of the overall risk of adverse social and economic effects of small, medium, and large oil spills using the basic resp onse scenario (current Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-19 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances perm it) in the Atlantic region. (Although dispersant pre-authorization agreement ar eas exist in the Atlantic region [Figure 2.2-1], appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical dispersion.) This modeling evaluates the effects of oil spills based on the risk of adverse effects on various factors of the socioeconomic environment rather than changes in monetary benefits. The methodology assumes that the risk posed by oil sp ills to the socioeconomic environment is directly related to the extent to which coastal resources (e.g., sandy recreational beach, marine waters used for commercial fishing) are oiled above selected thresholds of concern. That is, the proportion of total shoreline or surface water oiled above selected thresholds in the modeled spill area is used to represent the risk of socioeconomic effects (see Appendix I for details on the method used). Comparing the absolute risk of adverse socioeconom ic effects (e.g., meters of sandy shoreline oiled above a recreational threshold of c oncern) across hypothetical spill scen arios, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understand ing of the relative risk of adverse socioeconomic effects across these scenarios. In this section, only basic response scenar io (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) results are examined. Determining relative risk also allows for extrapolation of site-specific results to the entire region. For example, some of the risk estimates presented below are based on modeled spills affecting the Mid-Atlantic Shelf. While any given spill may exhibit dist inctly different patterns of socioeconomic effect, the relative risk measures reported for the Mid-Atlantic Shelf modeling scenario are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations alon g the Atlantic coast. In addition, the conclusions reached for the Mid-Atlantic Shelf modeled area are supported by results for other modeled areas. Extrapolating results from modeled spills in specific areas to other coastal sites is more valid for measures of relative risk of losses than absolute measures of monetary losses. For example, if additional oil spill response in the waters off the New Jersey coast causes a 30 percent reduction in shoreline resources oiled (and, therefore, recreation al beach use affected), that 30 percent could be applied to any site along the Atlantic coast. If losses to New Jersey beaches were evaluated in terms of dollars, however, seasonal and visitation differences between New Jersey and other states such as Maine would prevent accurate application of those monetary losses. For this reason, there is precedent in applying relative risk in evaluati ng potential changes to response regulations; for example, environmental performance of double-hull tanker design alternatives was evaluated based on risk of environmental and socioeconomic effect s of oil spills (Transportation Research Board, 2001). This methodology was used to evaluate socioeconomic risks and differs from that used to address the risks posed to other ecological resources. The rationale behind this deviation is based on the fact that this methodology is judged to most accurately refl ect the threat to these resources while facilitating comparisons across specific modeled areas and gene ralizations to broader contexts (see Appendix I). In addition, the socioeconomic risk metric closely parallels the measure of proportion of resource affected that was quantified in the preceding sections for ecological resources. The risk matrix used for ecological resources defines risk based on the percentage of the resource potentially affected in combination with the time to recovery (Figure I.8-2) . While the percentage of the resource affected is relevant to the modeling of socioec onomic effects, the time to recove ry is difficult to define in a socioeconomic context. The time necessary for soci oeconomic recovery is su bject to factors outside the influence of oil spill cleanup operations, such as national economic trends, recreational preferences, consumption patterns, and public perceptions. Change s in these factors, which are independent of the oil spill, could affect the time to recovery; thus, assigning \"time to recovery\" would be arbitrary. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-20 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills There is no existing standard for \"significance\" related to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface water must be oiled to be considered a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the effect will depend on a numb er of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, loca l), opportunities for resource substitution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of low concern if it is not of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the modeled effects under all modeled scenar ios would likely be low at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that occur would be expected to be localized in nature. Table H.2.5-1 highlights the effects of small, medium, and large oil spills on the Atlantic region's socioeconomic resources by presenting estimates of resources oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute terms (length of shoreline oiled or area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of the total resource base in the modeled area (Mid-Atlantic Shelf). For oiled shoreline, the threshold of concern is 10 g/m 2 and for oiled surface water it is 0.01 g/m2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004] ). This resource area is based on an estimate of the extent to which the coastal community in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf potentially relies on each resource in this specific modeled area. For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life potentially affected by an oil spill. Absolute and relative risk are discussed for coastal communitie s, demography, and employment; general economic status of a coastal community; vessel transporta tion and ports; commercial and recreational fisheries; historic resources; recreation and tourism; and public safety and worker health. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Coastal communities benefit from and rely on the marine environment to provide residents with sustenance, livelihoods, leisure op portunities, and shipping avenues. Individuals who live and work in close proximity to the coast derive both soci al and economic rewards from the natural beauty, recreational opportunities, quality of life, economic resources, and cultural attributes associated with these coastal locations. These rewards are derived from assets such as National Parks, public beaches, fishing opportunit ies, and commercial and tourism-related industries. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-21 2009 H.

The threshold of concern because of oiled shoreline and surface water is 10 g/m 2 and 0.01 g/m2 of oil, respectively (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). || Percentages reflect the proportion of the total modeled area above the threshold of concern. # A 200-bbl spill is assumed to have negligible effect. For a small spill along the Atlantic coast, there is no risk of high adverse effects on coastal communities. In many cases, a spill of this size is expected to pose no risk to shoreline or surface water resources because the spilled oil will never reach the threshol d of concern (Table H.2.5-1). The risk of adverse effects on co astal communities for a medium sp ill is likely to be greater than for a small spill. Using mechanical -only recovery, a medium spill in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf will have a spill area1 above the corresponding threshold of conc ern that will adversely affect approximately 7,122 m of shoreline and sweep approximately 810 million m2 of marine waters used for recreation and by the commercial fishing in dustry, respectively (Table H. 2.5-1). A large spill would sweep 17,458 m of sandy shoreline and 1,155 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.2.5-1). A spill of this size would affect the pleasure that coastal residents and visitors derive from coastal activities and the economic contribution that recreational re sources make to local income and employment. However, when certain weather cond itions and current patterns are combined with specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources at all or at levels above the selected threshold. For medium and large spills along the Mid-Atlantic Shelf shoreline, such conditions prevail 30 and 21 perc ent of the time, respectively, based on the modeled spills when the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) is used in the cleanup. For these spill events, no adverse effects on the shoreline are expected. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-22 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. The adverse impacts of a large spill would be similar to those for a medium spill and wo uld generally be limited to the spill area \u2014the adverse impacts would not be felt at the regional economic level. However, a large spill could result in significant local adverse impacts, even though regionally less than 1 percent of critical surface water and 3 percent of critical shoreline would be affected. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 17,458 m of sandy shoreline and 1,155 m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.2.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Economic Status As noted above, coastal communiti es can suffer direct and indirect adverse economic effects from an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrea se revenue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisheries, by both the an glers themselves and by related industries as catc h opportunities decrease or are eliminated entirely. Tourism and associated businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal areas decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived resource taint. A small spill that is 3 or more statute mi offshor e would have essentially no adverse effects on either the local or regional economies (Table H.2.5-1). There is little to no risk that economically important resources would be oiled, and it is unlikely that any fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. A medium spill, with mechanical recovery and in situ burn operations, could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effect s as a result of oiling recreational beaches, closing fisheries and recreational areas, and degrading the appeal of coastal locations. A large spill's adverse economic effects could be high for the local economy, even with mechanical recovery and in situ burning, based on the anticipated level of shoreline oiling and the possibility that closure of commercial and recreational fishing grounds will occur. Compared with a medium spill, the amount of sandy shoreline oiled above the expected threshold is more than double under the large spill and the surface water area oiled is over 40 percent greater for a large spill (Table H.2.5-1). As noted above, while 30 percent of all modeled medium spills result ed in no adverse effects on the shoreline, only 21 percent of modeled large spills generated no adverse effects. While the adverse effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas de pendent on tourism, could heighten adverse socioeconomic effects. Based on the modeling re sults (see the technical report [F rench McCay et al ., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 17,458 m of sandy shoreline and 1,155 m 2 of surface water above recogn ized thresholds [Table H.2.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshor e are not likely to cause great adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports; any adverse effects would likely be of short duration. However, an Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-23 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills oil spill can disrupt marine commer ce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft move ment as a means of facilitating spill response. Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or increase in tr avel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. These adverse effects might be felt at a number of levels. For example, vessel operators may incur addi tional costs associated with delays and longer shipping distances; businesses that depend on ti mely receipt of feedstock or other goods may experience adverse effects such as production sl owdowns; and individuals who work in adversely affected sectors may be displaced. To the extent that businesses in other locations depend on the affected industries, a longer-term disruption of vessel transportation could yield adverse effects beyond the immediate spill area. However, given substitute suppliers and shipping modes and the expected short-term nature of any disruption in ve ssel traffic, such adverse effects are not likely to be large. Vessel transportation is extremely important to many industries along the Atlantic coast. For example, in the Mid-Atlantic states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia), a spill that interferes with traffic in and out of the Chesapeake Bay would ha ve serious implications for the city of Baltimore. In total, Maryland exported $5 billion worth of goods to foreign markets in 2000, with more than half of this volume or iginating from the port of Baltimore (USDOC-ITA, 2001). Similarly, a spill outside of New York Harbor might slow or even halt traffic in and out of the area. The 8-day shut down of the port of New York in the wake of September 11, 2001, resulted in losses of $58 billion in economic activity, averaging $7.25 billion in economic activity per day (CBSNews.com, 2002). While these data provide a sense of the im portance of marine transportation in some areas, it is important to note that oil spills would not generally be expected to result in closures of this duration or geographic scope. To the extent that mechanical recovery and in situ burning reduce the surface area of slicks above a threshold of concern, some combination of spill response options will reduce the risk of adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports. For a small spill, no large adverse effects on vessel transportation or ports ar e expected (Table H.2.5\u00ad 1), but there is some risk of adverse effects from a medium spill. Therefore, th e nature of the risk to vessel transportation and ports will be a function of the location, area, and pattern of surface water oiling: for a medium spill, only a fraction of surface water area is affected, equal to less than 1 percent of total surface water area in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (810 million m 2) (Table H.2.5-1). A large spill will oil 1,155 million m2 of surface water area (Table H.2.5-1), increasing the degree of adverse effects by 40 percent from a medium spill. However, a spill occurring under specific location, weather, and tidal conditions could adversely affect vessel transporta tion and ports and the in dustries and communities that depend on this traffic. Any adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports would likely be short lived \u2014that is, even if shipping waters or ports are exposed to oil and are therefore closed, as soon as recovery efforts remove surface oil, these facilities would be expected to be reopened. Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. The fraction of the total area affected by these various spills clearly indicates that the adverse impact of most oil spills will be localiz ed; a regional or even statewide adverse impact is unlikely to result from spills in this size range. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-24 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerab le to oil spills because of both closures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to significant revenue losses for the commercial fishing industry, as well as related industries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from commercial fleets. For example, the Atlantic region's commercial fisheries generated over $1.1 billion in 2001, or 38 percent of the nation's total catch, with state catches ranging in size from $280 million in Massachusetts to $44,000 in Pennsylvania (NMFS, 2004a). In addition, oil spills can lead to a decreased demand for fish from affected waters because of actual or perceived taint and can instigate alterations to fishing practices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or decreases reve nues. Large spills can potentially injure fish nursery grounds and impose other risks that could reduce fish harvests longer term. By contaminating key waters, an oil spill may di srupt employment in commercial fisheries and related sectors of the economy. The NORTH CAPE oil spill had a severe effect on the harvest of lobster and shellfish off the coast of southern Rhode Island. With oil covering a large portion of Block Island Sound, a 250-mi 2 area was closed to fishing (NOA A et al., 1999). More than 9 million lobsters were killed in this area (NOAA et al., 1999) , forcing lobstermen to seek alternative fishing grounds. However, while the local adverse effects of a spill on commercial fisheries might be high, such effects should be placed in the context of the state or regional eco nomies. For example, the economy of the state of Rhode Island was $32.5 billion in 1999, of which only 0.3 percent was generated by commercial fishin g activity (Bureau of Econom ic Analysis, 1999; NOAA, 2000c). For a small spill in the Atlantic regi on, the risk to commercial fisheries is negligible using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.2.5-1). For a medium spill, the risk of adverse effects on commercial fisheries is likely to be greater than for a small spill, but th e effects remain localized. A medium spill along the Atlantic coast will sweep approximately 810 million m2 of marine waters used by the commercial fishing industry above the corresponding threshold of concern (Table H.2.5-1). A risk of economic loss to commercial fisheries will occur when waters exc eed relevant management and/or risk-based thresholds. For example, fishing may not be permitted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold of concern, resulting in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting adverse effect s would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decr eases in employment, inco me, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, spill effects on the co mmercial fishing economy may be less severe. These risks to commercial fisheries increase with a large spill, as the size of the area oiled increases. A large spill presen ts risk to appr oximately 1,155 m 2 of marine waters potentially important to commercial fisheries above the corresponding threshold of concer n (Table H.2.5-1). A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in local commercial fishing activities and revenues. These declines may spill over to create additional adverse impacts on businesses associated with the commercial fishing sector. To the extent that commercial fishing operations can, for a time, move to substitute fishing grounds, the potentially severe adverse effects of even a large spill may be avoided. Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will no t generally be at the regional or national level but Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-25 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commercial fishing activities, in square meters of surface water oiled above the corresponding threshold of concern. The effects of an oil spill on recreational fishery-related activities will be felt more heavil y by various populations, in cluding recreational anglers and firms that supply goods and services to recr eational anglers. For example, recreational anglers fish for pleasure or sport, as opposed to monetary ga in. In the wake of an oil spill, such anglers may choose to fish at a substitute location, may experience a reduced quality of experience, or may choose to forgo fishing entirely. The losses suffered will be related to these missed opportunities. In addition, while closing waters to recreational fishing will decrease the social welfare of recreationists, it would also be expected to affect the demand for boat rentals and other services consumed by fishing enthusiasts. For a small spill, adverse effects on recreational fi shing resources in the Atlantic region would likely be negligible (Table H.2.5-1). Medium and large spills may cause decreases in local recreational fishing activities and in the revenues generated from these activities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 17,458 m of sandy shoreline and 1,155 m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.2.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Subsistence Potential adverse effects on marine species are a concern during spills where traditional use of subsistence resources occurs. Information on subsistence use of fish and shellfish in the Atlantic region is limited. While some residents may supplem ent their diets with these resources, subsistence is not known to be a prominent activity in this region (Section 3.2.5.5), as compared to the Alaska region, where Native communitie s may suffer substantial economic and cultural losses due to contamination of subsistence seafood during an oil spill. Tissue tainting would be the primary concern for these subsistence resources. The Mid-Atlantic Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the coastal habitats, fish, and wildlife in the Atlantic region. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does no t reduce the severity of potential adverse effects nor increase risk to subsistence resources. Potential adverse effect s on subsistence resources in the Atlantic region are low for small, medi um, or large spills (Table H.2.5-2). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-26 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Table H.2.5-2 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Subsistence Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf Spill Size Resources Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 0-1 Source: Adapted Part B of the tec hnical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Effects on subsistence resources for a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. For a medium sp ill, the modeling results showed water column exposure to dissolved aromatics to be at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) and to only occur directly outside and inside the entrance to Delaware Bay. Tainting of fish and invertebrates becomes a concern when water concentrations exceed approximately 100 ppb (Section 4.3.5.6). Sediment exposure was estimated to be negligible. For a large spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low concentrations (10 - 100 ppb) in a more widespread area , from inside Delaware Bay to approximately 116 km offshore, and from Maryland to southern New Jersey. Sedi ment exposure was estimated to be negligible. The risk scores in Table H.2.5-2 reflect the pred icted recovery rates for subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill sizes (Section 4.3.5.6). Although areas other than the Mid-Atlantic Shelf in the Atlantic region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on subsistence resources will fall within a similar range througho ut the Atlantic region. While adverse effects on subsistence resources are not likely to be high on a re gional level, they may be high on a local level. Based on the modeling re sults (see the technical report [F rench McCay et al ., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subsistence resources in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Historic Resources Under Alternative 1 using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), adverse effects on historic resources in the Atlantic region would likely be negligible, rega rdless of spill size, (Appendix J). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-27 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Most historic sites in the Atlantic region are ei ther located on land and protected from oiling by bulwarks or other barriers, are buried under offshore sediments and are not at risk of becoming oiled, or are submerged shipwrecks that are typically not well preserved due to strong currents and wave action in the region (Appen dix J). Results from several studie s indicated that direct oiling caused negligible effects on cultural resources following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Bittner, 1996; Dekin, 1993; 1995). Mechanic al-only recovery or mechanical recovery plus in situ burning may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, which will also reduce the amount of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to sensitive historic structures. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Recreation and Tourism Oil spills can adversely affect a coastal community's recreation and tourism assets. For example, stretching from Maryland into Virginia, the Assateague Island National Seashore received approximately 1.9 million visitors in fiscal year 2001 (NPS, 2002). Recreational activities at the seashore include hiking, biking, bird watching, fishing and hunting, kayaking, and swimming. Both residents of and visitors to such areas appreciate the recreational opportunities offered to them by the coast. A large spill occurring in the Atlantic region could contaminate up to 17,458 m of sandy shoreline (Table H.2.5-1), or if it directly hits the Assateague Island National Seashore, 30 percent of the seashore's shoreline would be contaminated above corresponding thresholds of concern. A spill of this size would be expected to result in broader effects on tourism, such as deterring visitors from the spill area. A similar scenario coul d be outlined for the pa rks, seashores, beaches, and recreational fishing areas that line the Atlantic coast. An oil spill would be expected to affect recreationist s' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and economic implications of a spill would reach b eyond direct effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likel y to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment above for more details). For a small spill in the Atlantic region, the risk to recreation and tourism is negligible using the basic response scenario (current le vels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.2.5-1). For a medium spill, the risk of adverse effects on recreation and tourism is likely to be greater than for a sma ll spill. A medium spill near the Atlantic coast will adversely affect ap proximately 7,122 meters (m ) of the total r ecreational shor eline above the corresponding threshold of concer n (Table H.2.5-1). For a large spill, although the nature of the risk remains the same as for a medium spill, the risk to recreation and tourism along the Atlantic coast increases to nearly 17,458 m of the to tal recreational shoreline (Table H.2.5-1). Under these conditions for medium and large spills, be aches in the spill area may be closed to visitors, and fishing and boating may not be pe rmitted in waters exposed to oil, causing losses in revenue to the recreation and tourism sectors of the coastal economy. These effects would be expected to reverberate through the spill area's communities, causing decrea ses in tourism and recreation, and the revenue and employment associated with them. However, when cert ain weather conditions and current patterns are combined with specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources at all or at levels above the selected threshold (i.e., no effects are expect ed). Such conditions prevail in 30 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-28 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills percent of medium mo deled spills and in 21 percent of large modeled spills along the Atlantic coast when using the basic response scenario (cur rent levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit). Based on the modeling results (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regiona l adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest mode led spills (affecting up to 17,458 m of sandy shoreline and 1,155 m2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.2.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are define d as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill. There are many areas in the Atlantic region with high population concentrations along the coast. However, it is unlikely that there would be adverse effects on public safety from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offsho re for any of the spill sizes considered, regardless of the response options used. The USCG has protocols to keep the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are re lated to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill response equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the worker certification and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The ri sk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Atlantic region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. H.3. A LTERNATIVE 1 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE CARIBBEAN REGION For the purpose of this PEIS, the Caribbean region consists of the tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and is enclosed to the so uth by Venezuela, Colombia, and Panama; to the west by Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica ; and to the north, it wraps toward the southeast with the Greater and Lesser Antilles Islands, be ginning with Cuba and ending with Trinidad and Tobago. The tropical waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean are off the north shores of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the U.S.-affiliated islands discussed in this section), and the tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea are off their south and west shores (Figure 3.1-1). There was no location in this region for modeling and risk assessment purposes. However, due to readily available modeling data, the Florida Straits, which is actually in the Atlantic region, was selected for modeling because it contains very similar habitats (mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs) and amenity resources as the Caribbean region. The Florida Straits results were used to evaluate effects in the Caribbean region. Modeling results from this location were evaluated relative to the geographic area in Section D.1.2 of Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-29 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills the technical report (Frenc h McCay et al., 2004), here in referred to as the Flor ida Straits. The Florida Straits encompasses two biogeographi cal provinces: Florida Straits and Florida Bay. The results of the modeling \u2014used to evaluate spills of concern in this risk analysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore) \u2014are presented in Part D of the technica l report (French McCay et al., 2004) and summarized in this section. Table H.3-1 presents the risk ranking for the modeling of Alternative 1 in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) for three spill sizes (sma ll, 200 bbl; medium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). The risk scores presented in the table are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional considerations; however, in any sp ecific oil spill situation local concerns could be higher. Table H.3-2 summarizes the significan ce of the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternat ive 1 in the Caribbean region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for th e average spill to the region in general. Although dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in the Caribbean region (Figure 2.2-1), under the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) of Alternative 1, appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical dispersion; thus, chemical dispersion is not considered in the analysis of the Caribbean region. Further, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantly change the level of effects identified from those obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. For spills analyzed in this document (i.e., those that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore) using mechanical-only recovery, there are likely to be minor or insignificant regional adverse impacts on all resources for a small spill, except for marine and coastal birds and intertidal habitats, which experience moderate impacts, based on the speed wi th which such a spill wo uld weather and dissipate and the small area that could be affected.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a medium spill, adverse impacts are minor or insignificant for all resources except for marine and coastal birds, subtidal habitats, and Essential Fish Habitat, which could be moderate, and intertidal habitats and areas of special concern, which could be significant. Sea turtles are also at risk, and concern is particularly high for mangrove forests. For a large spill, there is the potential for moderate adverse impacts on marine mammals, coastal and marine birds, subtidal habitat, and Essential Fish Habitat, and significant adverse impacts on intertidal habitats and areas of special concern. Such a spill could also cause significant, but localized, adverse, short-term socioeconomic impacts. For extreme events under the large spill scenario, water quality could also be a short-term concern if the spill moved rapidly into shallo w water. All adverse impacts occur despite the treatment or recovery of some of the oil, but are reduced by these actions when they are effective. H.3.1 Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to water quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect water quality are the soluble aromatics, (monoaromatic hydrocarbons) and PAHs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) (Section 4.3.1.1). Thus, evaluation of potential adverse effects is based on the degree of potential contamination by these compounds. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effects on water quality are generally low, whether a mechanical-only recovery or mechanical recovery plus in situ burning is employed. This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid dilution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column. During periods of extreme turbulence, oil generally mixes into the water column where aromatics may dissolve rapidly, but resurfacing and dilution of oil droplets result in only localized contamination at levels of concern unless the dilution volume is restricted. Overall, based on the modeling and risk assessment results, it is concluded that \u2014using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) \u2014adverse water-quality effects under Alternative 1 would be low in marine waters, even in the event of a large sp ill in the Caribbean region . However, if the spill moved into shallow and confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills under conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence or in areas where oil collects for a few weeks to months after a spill. The variable used to determine potential water-quality effects is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected water volume increases with spill vo lume and varies with the level of physical dispersion during the time of the spill. Natural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of water that is contaminated above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of wa ter contaminated increase s exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume of wa ter contaminated for a small spill was extrapolated from the mean medium- and large-spill model re sults. The estimates of the volume of water contaminated \u2014and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Caribbean region because the mixing of oil into water and process of dilution are similar in all areas. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-33 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Coastal Florida Bay is used as a representative of coastal water for analyzing the Florida Straits, as well the Caribbean region. Florida Ba y is approximately 16,288 km2 in area and about 2 m deep on average, with a total volume of approximately 32,576 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of Florida Bay to determine the potential effects of small, medium, and large spills (Table H.3.1-1). This approach yields a very conservative estimate, in that it assumes all of the contamination would occur in coastal water. Table H.3.1-1 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills * to Coastal Water Quality Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Florida Straits Spill Size Volume of Water Contaminated (million m3) Area Contaminated (estimated %) Risk Score \u00a7 Small (200 bbl) < 40 \u00d7 10- 6 8 \u00d7 10- 7 4E Medium (2,500 bbl) 83 1.7 4D Large (40,000 bbl) 326 6.8 4C Source: Adapted from Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil may be incorporated into shallow water or intertid al sediments where, thro ugh leaching, it could become a continuing source of con tamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality wher e the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier I standards (beginning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concern to water quality would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have an insignificant infl uence on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would appl y whether either response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 ar e expected to be insignificant for small spills, and minor for medium and large spills. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-34 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Marine In marine waters, which are 3 or more st atute mi offshore, mechanical response and in situ burning currently may be used for spill response in the Caribbean region; although dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in the Cari bbean region (Figure 2.2-1), chemical dispersion is not used because appropriate response times cannot currently be met. As was done for coastal waters, the estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of the reference area, the Florida Straits. The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters around the islands in the Caribbean region. The total surfac e area of the Florida Straits is approximately 42,689 km 2, so the area of interest is much vaster fo r marine waters than for coastal waters. Water- quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water \u201420 m deep, which is much shallower than most of the Caribbe an region's marine waters. The results for the selected modeling location (Table H.3.1-2) represent conservative es timates of adverse water-quality effects using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit). Table H.3.1-2 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Marine Water Quality Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Florida Straits Spill Size Area Contaminated (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 5 \u00d7 10 - 9 4E Medium (2,500 bbl) 0.1 4E Large (40,000 bbl) 0.4 4E Source: Adapted from Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Natural dispersion of the oil would be very rapid after a spill, and recovery time would be on the order of hours to days. Leaching from oil contam ination reaching the sediments would not have a large effect on marine water quality because of the large dilution volume and natural dispersing forces in marine waters. The results would apply whether a mechanical response is implemented. Since in situ burning would replace some of the mechanical response, and both methods remove oil that would otherwise result in water contamination, th e potential water-quality effects would not change significantly if in situ burning were used. For a spill in water deeper than the 20 m evaluated here, the potential adverse effects would be even smaller. Based on the modeling re sults (see the technical report [F rench McCay et al ., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine water quality in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-35 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential fo r adverse effects (Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an oil spill on air quality may involve all volatile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contamin ants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are normally very localized and short lived for small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any potential adverse effects: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. The modeling shows that results do not vary by sp ill location or size in the Caribbean region. Two possible sources of contamination to the atmosphere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilization of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). The results of the modeling show that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-only recovery; hence, th e risk scores are virtually identical for small, medium, and large spills. Volatilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill site. Evaporation off th e water surface and volatilization from the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocarbon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentrations in the atmos phere at the water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmo sphere would be on the order of days. Thus, a low level of concern is expe cted for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical-only recovery. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via burning. For small spills , it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feas ible (Table H.3.1-3). The maximum area potentially exceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km 2 for a medium spill and 12.7 km2 for a large spill. If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wildlife) are within these areas, they could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, and considering a region of interest equivalent to the Florida Straits (42,689 km2), the area of adverse effects would be less than 1 percent, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. Thus, low levels of concern are expected from small, medium, and large oil spills involving in situ burning (H.9.1-3). Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on air quality in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without in situ burning.

The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. H.3.2. Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals The cetacean and sirenian species inhabiting the Caribbean region (Section 3.3.2.1, Table F.3-1) exist in concentrations that vary depending on seasonal migrations. Cetaceans are found throughout the region and spend their entire lives at sea. The Caribbean monk seal ( Monachus tropicalis) , which is thought to be extinct, is the only native pinniped known to have inhabited this region. In Puerto Rico, there have been rare sightings and reports of hooded seal ( Cystophora cristata ) strandings; however, these occurrences are scattered and rare, and have been attributed to lost seals following cold-water currents. There ar e no indigenous fur-bearing marine mammals of concern inhabiting this re gion (Section 3.3.2.1). Marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, and ma natees are vulnerable to spilled oil since they spend considerable time at the water's surface, which enhances possible contact with oil. The majority of these species remain offshore, and p opulations vary according to season and migration directions. Cetaceans appear able to detect and are likely to avoid floating oil or oil being recovered by mechanical means (Geraci, 1990). Studies have s hown that cetacean skin is nearly impenetrable to even the highly volatile constituents of oil, indicating that contact with oil probably would be less harmful to cetaceans than often believed. However, the toxic, volatile fractions in fresh crude oils could irritate and damage cetacean soft tissues , such as the mucous membranes of the eyes and airways. Marine mammals that are more commonly found in the nearshore regions and intertidal habitats, such as manatees, are of increased concern. Pote ntial concerns include toxicity from ingestion of oil during grooming and adverse effect on juveniles through contact with contaminated teats when nursing. Overall, the potential adverse effects de pend on the spill size, an d the number and species of marine mammals present. Based on the surface area in the Florida Straits, the equivalent area for 100 percent mortality for cetaceans and for pinnipeds and sirenians is 0.00 2 percent (or less) of the available habitat for a medium spill. For a large spill the equivalent area at risk does increase, but remains low \u20140.003 percent for cetaceans and 0.03 percent for pinnipeds and sirenians). There are no known breeding or haulout Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-37 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills areas associated with pinnipeds for this region; ther efore, shoreline oiling will have no adverse impacts on most marine mammals, but there is a low risk for terrestrial species using the shoreline and for nearshore species (in this region, manatees). Based on the scattere d presence of these species, the potential adverse impacts were determined to be low for small and medium oil spills, but may potentially increase to medium levels for large oil sp ills based on the risk to terrestrial or nearshore species. The modeling results for marine mammals in the Florida Straits are presented in Table H.3.2-1.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Based on the modeling for the Florida Straits, the likelihood of adversely affecting large numbers of marine mammals is low. On-water adverse effects are negligible but there is a low risk to species on or near the shoreline. The addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of pote ntial adverse effects nor increase risk to marine mammals. If mortality did occur however, the population would probably require 1 to 3 years to recover. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine mammals in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be minor for small and medium spills, and modera te for large spills. Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds are usually of highest concern during an oil spill because birds are highly susceptible to the acut ely toxic effects from exposure to oil. There are many areas in the Caribbean region where high concentrations of birds may be found along the shore, in nearshore and estuarine habitats, or in offshore marine-water habitats (Section 3.3.2.2). Adverse effects on birds in this region would result mostly from oiling of mangroves, salt marshes, beaches, shallow grass beds, tidal fl ats, and small keys and islands that serve as nesting and foraging habitats for wading birds, diving birds, raptors, gulls, terns, and shorebirds. Surface water oiling Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-38 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills may also adversely affect feeding, rafting, and di ving birds and wintering wa terfowl (Section 3.3.2.2; see Section 4.3.2.2 for information on the main issues of concern for birds exposed to an oil spill). The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the coastal habitats and wildlife in the Caribbean region (Table H.3.2- 2). Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the potential adverse effects on birds. Potential levels of concern for birds in th e Caribbean region are medium for all spills, as discussed below. However, for a small spill very littl e oil is likely to strand onshore in nesting and foraging habitats, and potential exposure to floati ng oil is only likely to occur in a small area. The potential for adverse effects increases for medium and large spills, with greatest concern for conditions where mangroves and sand beaches become heavily oiled and where potential exposure to floating oil occurs in a large area. Table H.3.2-2 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Marine and Coastal Birds Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Florida Straits Spill Size Populations Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 1-5 3D Medium (2,500 Large (40,000 bbl) > 20 3A Source: Adapted from Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Yellow represents a medium level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Two National Parks, one Ramsar site (wetlands of international importance), and two National Wildlife Refuges occur in the Florida Straits and Florida Bay area. The presence of these sites indicates that large numbers of wetland birds (Ramsar site) concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. The ma jority of small keys and mangro ve islands in the area provide important nesting, roosting, and foraging habitats fo r over 250 avian species. Abundant diving birds utilize marine water habitats in this area, and high mortality rates are typical for these species during a spill. In the Caribbean region, the risks to intertidal nesting, roosting, and foraging habitats are greater than in many other regions because a significant amount of shoreline habitats on an island or group of small islands can be affected by a spill. There may not be alternative sites for use until the habitat recovers, which would lead to a higher degree of adverse effects. Thus, the risk score was determined based on the possibility that a large number of birds in sensitive life stages may be concentrated in a relatively small area that is heavily oiled, possibly having limited opportunities for relocation to similar nearby habitats. It is important to recognize that adverse effects on birds may be more or less severe depending on the time of year and locations of their habitats, as well as the extent of shoreline and surface water oiling. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-39 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Adverse effects on birds for a small spill were determined by extrapolating from the results obtained for a medium spill. The volume of oil released in the small spill was approximately an order of magnitude less than in the medium sp ill; therefore, the adve rse effects on the bird population were estimated to be proportionally less but still medium because of the recovery time. The modeling of effects on birds for a medium spill under mechanical-only recovery resulted in estimates of 10 to 20 percent of the regional bird population being potentially adversely affected because 95 percent of the oiled shoreline was mangroves, which are used for nesting, roosting, and feeding and often have a long recovery periods, and the total mean surface water area oiled above a 10-micron threshold was 92 km 2. For a large spill, the modeling resulted in estimates of over 20 percent of the local area bird population being potentially adversely affected because 95 percent of the oiled shoreline was mangroves, and the area of wetlands oiled was over three times as large as for the medium spill. The total mean surface wa ter area oiled above the threshold was 1,100 km2. The adverse effects on mangrove habitats would be considered regionally im portant, particularly considering the small size and extent of intertidal habitats in the Caribbean region. The risk scores in Table H.3.2-2 reflect the predicted recovery rate s for birds of 1 to 3 years for most species, as was the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2) . Although no specific area in the Caribbean region was modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions modeled in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on bird populations will fall within a similar range thro ughout the Caribbean region. The addition of in situ burning does not change the signif icance of these adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these grou ps are of great concern. As described in Section 4.3.2.3, plankton and fish are adversely affected eith er directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil droplets mixed by waves into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is direct uptake of di ssolved oil components, or iginating directly from surface oil or dissolving from the mi croscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, as spill size increases, so do adverse effects. However, there is great variab ility related to the environmental conditions after a spill; plankton and fish suffer much more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather. In addition, many speci es utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they are more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved completely when oil comes ashore. Species and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic co mponents, with specie s from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stab le locations being more sensitiv e than those from polluted and environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposure during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floa ting oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapidly di sperse to background levels. However, there may be longer-term effects if the spill migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands where dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-40 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Juvenile fish are more abundant in salt marshes and seagrass beds than in other shallow subtidal and intertid al areas, so these areas are of most concern (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 1 in most cases, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm of shore1, but the dispersed oil plume could be transported by currents into this area. The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by oil spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percent loss multiplied by volume ex posed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes were translated to equivalent areas by multiplying by water depth at the spill site, allowing comparison with other resources, such as birds and shorelines, which are distributed on a per-ar ea basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniforml y distributed when expressed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by the simila r results for the four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, o ffshore Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively, of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) \u2014the equivalent areas of adverse ef fect on plankton and fish (both average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in this PEIS. The modeled spill site was 20 m deep water: adverse effects would be less for deeper waters because of grea ter vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionatel y greater in shallower waters because of the restricted dilution potential. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much smaller. Thus, th e model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortalit y of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes am ong response scenarios. The Florida Straits, was selected for the modeling as representative of the Caribbean region, because the geography (characterized by islands), bottom topography (steeply sloping away from shore), environmental regime (warm, trade winds, occasi onal severe storms) and ecosystems (subtropical\u00ad tropical, areas of coral reefs, seagrasses, etc.) are similar in the two regions. The adverse effects were estimated as a percentage of the total area of concern (42,689 km 2). Based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality would be affected for a small spill (Table H.3.1-2), the volume of adverse effects on plankton and fish would be low for a small spill using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.3.2-3). Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery ti me would be less than 1 year. Over all, based on the modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Caribbean regi on under Alternative 1 would be localized to the immediate area around the spill site and similar in all marine-water areas of the region. For large spills that might move rapidly into shallow coastal areas due to winds and currents, the concentrations of toxic components might be high enough to cause some level of concern for water column 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-41 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Based on the discussion in Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), if the adversely affected area is marine-water habitat or for water column organisms with broad distribution over all subtidal habitats, a risk score of 4E applies. A risk score of 3C applies to coral reefs, 4E applies to seagrass, and 3D applies to hard-bottom habitat organisms. Given that many species and life stages of plankton and fish on and over coral reefs are more broadly distributed rather than restricted to the coral reefs (for exam ple, they inhabit hard-bottom habitats as well), and that these organisms reproduce on time scales less than 1 year, the overall risk score of 4D is assigned for plankton and fish for the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit). Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 ar e expected to be insignificant for small spills, and minor for medium and large spills. Intertidal Habitats Intertidal habitats in the Caribbean region are of particular concern during oil spills. Because of their relatively small extent, they have a high degree of historical loss and degradation, and ecological importance. Sand beaches that are sea turtle nesting habitat are of high concern: adults concentrate in offshore areas prior to nesting; the nests are at risk of direct oiling; and the hatchlings are at risk of oiling as they escape to sea. Mangroves are very important habitats in this region, providing shoreline protection and key nursery value for fish and shellfish (Section 3.3.2.4). The Caribbean region has extensive areas of thes e sensitive habitats, so reducing the adverse effects of oil spills to mangroves is of high priority because of their very long recovery rates, which can be more than 20 years. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. For a discussion of the relative ranking of the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-42 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills sensitivity of intertidal habitats to spilled oil an d the processes affecting o il fate and behavior on shorelines, see the explanation of the Environmen tal Sensitivity Index (ESI) in Section 4.3.2.4. In the Caribbean region, the risks to intertidal habitats are greater than in many other regions because a significant amount of shoreline habitat on an island or group of small islands can be affected by a spill. Thus, there may not be altern ative sites for use until the habitat recovers, which would lead to a higher degree of adverse effects. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed and, thus, does not reduce potential adve rse effects. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats in the Caribbean region are medium for a small spill, in that very litt le oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. However, the potential for adverse effects increases with spill volume, with the greatest concern for conditions where mangroves and sand beaches become heavily oiled. The risk scores in Table H..3.2-4 are based on estimated effects on the intertidal habitats of the Florida Straits. Table H.3.2-4 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills * to Intertidal Habitats Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Florida Straits Spill Size Habitats Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 0-1 1C Source: Adapted from Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Red represents a high level of con cern, and yellow, a medium level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats from a small spill were determined to be medium by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting oiled mangroves to have a long recovery rate. For a medium spill under mechanical -only recovery, the modeling resulted in nearly 10 km of oiled shoreline. Although this represents less than 1 percent of the total shoreline in the Florida Straits, most of the oiled shoreline would consist of mangroves. The risk score represents the higher percentage of mangroves adversely affected under the highest shoreline effect conditions, which would be more representative of oiling effects on small islands or groups of islands. For a large spill, the modeling resulted in an estimated 27.1 km of oiled shoreline. This oiled area also represents less than 1 percent of the total shoreline in the modeled area, but again mangroves would account for 95 percent of the oiled shoreline, making the effects regionally important given the small size and extent of intertidal habitats in the Caribbean region. Although areas other than the Florida Straits in the Caribbean region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions modeled in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on in tertidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-43 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Caribbean region. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Caribbean region under Alternativ e 1 are expected to be moderate for small spills, and significant for medium and large spills. Subtidal Habitats The subtidal (benthic) habitat consists of the bott om substrate below the low tide level, as well as the species that live in, on, and near the substrate. This benthic community includes areas of live, sandy, muddy, and low-relief bottoms; subsurface canyons; and pinnacles. Organisms living \u2014include corals, plants and seagrasses, benthic invertebrates (such as crabs, shrimp, snails, bivalve mollusks, and marine wo rms), and bottom-dwelling fish. Because subtidal benthic communities do not include the intertidal zone, they are at little risk from floating oil because, by definition, this environment is always below the surface. The greatest risk of exposure comes from sinking oil, as well as in situ burn residue, or dispersed oil or the sorption of naturally dispersed or mechanically mixe d oil that has become suspende d on sediments and is deposited onto the ocean floor. However, significant natural dispersion of oil and sediment into the water column only occurs during large storms or for ne arshore oil spills. Oil particles could adhere to bottom substrate, plants, or animals, which could result in both physical coating of organisms, as occurred in the 1993 BRAER spill in the Shetland Islands, and toxic effects from exposure to the chemical constituents (Section 4.3.2.5). Such adverse effects are not normally observed. The risk to fauna and flora of the subtidal benthic habitat is minimal, based on the diluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid diluti on of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil residue potentially reaching the bottom substrate. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. It mi ght slightly increase the risk of remaining oil residues sinking to the bottom. Residual oil from in situ burning that reaches the bottom is expected to have little or no adverse effects on subtidal habitats since the majority of its toxic components would have either evaporated or been destroyed during burning and the volume of residue produced is so small (Section 4.3.2.5) . Under the modeled conditions, the quantity of in situ burn residue produced would not result in a level of concern that exceeds low. For a medium spill the sediment threshold concentration for dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons was never exceeded, and the th reshold concentration for total hydrocarbons was exceeded only in a very small area (less than 0.001 percent of the reference area). However there are three special subtidal habitats in this region of particular value \u2014seagrass beds, coral reefs, an d hard-bottom habitat. Of these three habitats, the modeling results indicate d that coral reefs were at the most risk from exposure to hydrocarbons in the water column, with 4.6 percent of the total reef area exceeding threshold concentrations for at le ast a limited period. Recovery should occur in 1 to 3 years, perhaps less, from these short-term exposu res. For a large spill the sediment exposures remained low, but the area of coral reefs at risk increased to 5.0 percent of the total reference area. The recovery pattern would be similar, in that exposure is still brief. The results for the selected mo deling location (Table H.3.2-5) represent estimates of adverse impacts on su btidal habitats using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit).

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subtidal habitats in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, and moderate for medi um and large spills. Areas of Special Concern The potential effects on areas of special concern, such as National Marine Sanctuaries and National Wildlife Refuges, are important during an oil spill since these areas are under increased scrutiny and protection. Whereas most coastal and nearshore areas have a wide range of habitats or are very similar to other areas throughout the Caribbean region, areas of special concern are set aside for their uniqueness (Appendix F, Tables F.3-4 thro ugh F.3-6 and Figures F.3-6 through F.3-11). The potential risks and adverse effects associated with shoreline areas of special concern are identical to those discussed for intertidal ha bitats. The risks to subtidal re sources, such as coral reefs in National Parks, are identical to those discussed for subtidal habitats. For this analysis, the risks to areas of special concern are assumed to be the sa me as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Sections H.3.1), whichever are greater. Since the risk to intertidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on data presented for a me dium spill, the estimated average extent of shoreline oiling is 10 km; this figure increases to 27 km for a large sp ill. The potential risk of surface oil reaching a shoreline associated with an area of special concern is low in this region because of the number and scattered locations of these areas. The potential adverse effects on areas of special concern with small spills are medium (Table H.3.2-6). However, potential concer ns associated with a medium or large spill increase to high levels because of the increased s horeline contamination. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-45 2009 H.

Note: Red represents a high level of con cern, and yellow, a medium level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Based on the modeling for the Florid a Straits, the likelihood of affect ing an area of special concern within the localized area of a spill is minimal, unless the spill occurs directly adjacent to such an area. Since areas of special concern are scattered througho ut the Caribbean region, th ey are unlikely to be disproportionately affected by the average spill. If an area of special concern was highly adversely affected, it is anticipated that the recovery time for the affected area would be the same as for other intertidal habitats. These areas are most at risk fr om floating oil and benefit from any actions that reduce potential oiling. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small spill sizes, and significant for medium and large spill sizes, based on the risk to intertidal habitats. H.3.3 Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The Caribbean region has a variety of threatened, endangered, or candidate species (Section 3.3.3). In this region, the overall risk that a threatened, en dangered, or candidate species would be adversely affected or even present in the area of a spill is low; however, killing a single individual of such a species can be considered a severe adverse consequence. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, or fish that are threatened, en dangered, or candidate species are identical to those discussed in Section H.2.2 for these groups. Potential adverse effects on the four threatened or endangered species of sea turtles were discussed in detail in Section 4.3.3.1. Sea turtles are a particular concern if the spill occurs in the vici nity of a nesting beach. Overall, the highest risk scores were calculated for coastal and marine birds with other species at lower risk. Regardless of the species, the majority of threatened, endangered, or candidate species in the Caribbean region mature slowly and do not reach sexual maturity for several years; therefore, any adverse effects on the reproduction or survival of these species or result in death should be considered high. Adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or ca ndidate species in the Ca ribbean region for any spill size are difficult to predict. Depending on the location and se ason, the number and type of species present will vary. Based on the overall size of the Caribbean region and the low populations of threatened, endangered, or candidate species i nhabiting this region, the likelihood of adversely Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-46 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills affecting an individual of concern would be low unless the spill affects important shoreline or critical marine habitats. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse consequences. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills, base d on the risk to marine and coastal birds. H.3.4. Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat Virtually all waters in the Caribbean region out to the limits of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are considered Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). Areas such as bays, river mouths, and harbors are designated EFH for at least one life stage of at least one species and are protected by legislation (Section 3.3.4). The primary issue with respect to EFH is either (1) exposure of sensitive resources in the water column to hydrocarbon concentrations of concern, or (2) the contamination of bottom sediments, both of which could lead to either acute or chronic exposures. Adverse consequences would include either the de ath of individual organi sms, the possibility of sublethal effects affecting long-term population viabil ity, or degradation of habitat that reduces its availability to managed species. For this analysis, the risks to EFH are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Sectio n H.3.2.), whichever are greater. Since the risk to subtidal habitats is greater, th ose risk scores were used. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce potential adverse consequences. The data presented in Section H.3.2. indicate low risk from sediment and water column contamination overall, but subtidal habitats of high value \u2014seagrass beds, coral reefs, and hard-bottom habitat \u2014are more at risk. The risk scores for EFH are based on the estimated risk to coral reef habitat. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for sm all spills, and moderate for medium and large spills, based on the risk to subtidal habitats. H.3.5 Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Sect ion 4.3.5, oil spills can produce a variety of adverse social and economic effects. Some of the most visible and important effects are likely to include effects on water- and shore-based recreation, commercial fisheries, and tourism. In addition, large spills have the potential to adversely affect the well-being of the resident s and economies of co astal communities. This modeling considers the risk of adverse soci oeconomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreati onal activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceived taint; closure of comme rcial fishing grounds or hatcheries, or reduced commercial harvests; and altered mari ne transportation patterns. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on soci al and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may cause change s in employment and firm revenues of resource- based businesses. While these effects are not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and relative measures of the over all risk of adverse social and economic effects of small, medium, and large oil spills using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) in the Caribbean region. (Although dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in the Caribbean region [F igure 2.2-1], appropriate response times cannot Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-47 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills currently be met for chemical dispersion.) The methodology is described in more detail in the Atlantic region (Section H.2.5.). There is no existing standard for \"significance\" rel ated to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface wate r must be oiled to be consider ed a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the ef fect will depend on a number of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, lo cal), opportunities for resource substi tution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of little concern if it did not last l ong enough to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected commun ities are able to find substitute s to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the modeled effects under all modeled scenar ios would likely be low at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that occur would be expected to be localized in nature. This modeling assumes that the risk posed by oil sp ills to the socioeconomic environment is directly related to the extent to which resources are af fected above selected thresholds of concern \u2014for the Caribbean region, the square meters of marine water oiled above the threshold of concern. Comparing the absolute risk of adverse socioeconomic effect s (e.g., meters of sandy shoreline oiled above a recreational threshold of concern) across spill scenarios, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understanding of the rel ative risk of adverse so cioeconomic effects across these scenarios. In this section, only basic the response scenario (current levels of mech anical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) results ar e examined. Determining relative risk also allows for extrapolation of site-spe cific results to the entire region . For example, the risk estimates presented below are based on modele d spills affecting the Florida Straits as an appropriate surrogate for the Caribbean region in this modeling. While any given spill may exhibit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic effect, the relative risk measures are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations, especially in island regions, as long as spills occur in areas where mechanical recovery and/or in situ burning are feasible. In addition, the c onclusions reached for the Florida Straits are supported by results for other modeled areas \u2014the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assumptions across spill size is similar in magnitude. Table H.3.5-1 highlights the effects of small, me dium, and large oil spills on the Caribbean region's socioeconomic resources by presenting estimates of resources oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute terms (area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of the total resource base in the modeled area. The threshold of con cern because of surface water oiled is 0.01 g/m 2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) . This resource area is based on an estimate of the extent to which the coastal community in th e modeled area potentially relies on each resource. For the Caribbean region, length of shoreline oiled above the threshold of c oncern is not considered relevant. A single metric was selected for this regi on because (1) the shoreline oiling results from the Florida Keys area were highly sensitive in the modeled spill location; (2) the ability to identify shoreline with characteristics amiable to use (i.e., sandy shor e) was limited; and (3) area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern was expected to pr ovide a more accurate measure of expected risk, given the region's geographic characteristics.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 Thresholds above which some economic or social risk is expected were determined, and the area of surface water oiled above this threshold for the average modeled spill is reported. The th reshold of concern because of oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m2 of oil (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). || Percentages reflect the proportion of the total modeled area above the threshold of concern. \u00a7 A 200-bbl spill is assumed to have negligible effect. For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life potentially affected by an oil spill. Absolute and relative risk are discussed for coastal communitie s, demography, and employment; general economic status of a coastal community; vessel transporta tion and ports; commercial and recreational fisheries; historic resources; recreation and tourism; and public safety and worker health. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Coastal communities benefit from and rely on the marine environment to provide residents with sustenance, livelihoods, leisure op portunities, and shipping avenues. Individuals who live and work in close proximity to the coast derive both soci al and economic rewards from the natural beauty, recreational opportunities, quality of life, economic resources, and cultural attributes associated with these coastal locations. These rewards are derived from assets such as National Parks, public beaches, fishing opportunit ies, and commercial and tourism-related industries. Thus, oil spills can affect any number of a coastal community's assets, leading to adverse effects on the economic benefits of community activities. Th ese effects, in turn, can impose changes on that community's demographic and employment patterns. In addition to direct employment and other adverse economic effects on mari ne resource-based economic sector s associated with oil spills, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on co astal communities. For example, because the Caribbean region relies on tourism for employment and earnings, plus the importance of maritime activities to various Caribbean coastal communities , coastal communities in this region are at risk of experiencing adverse effects from oil spills that affect tourism. Further, the importance of water transportation in delivering goods to the region' s islands implies a heightened risk of adverse effects from an oil spill. Given their reliance on marine resources, coastal communities on Caribbean islands are likely to be more vulner able to the adverse effects of a spill than communities located on the mainland, whic h have a more diverse economic base. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-49 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The VISTA BELLA spill affected beaches on Puerto Rico and St. John at the height of tourist season. A 1-km stretch of the Playa Larga, Puerto Rico, was reported to have 100 percent oil coverage. In addition to the economic effects of recreational beach oiling in the wake of this spill, the tourism industry suffered from the surface water oiling that affected recreation in the reefs surrounding the islands. Individuals employed in th e tourism industry were likely to have suffered as well (NOAA-HMRAD, 1992). To the exte nt that mechanical recovery and in situ burning reduce the surface area of slicks above a threshold of concern, some combination of spill response options will reduce the risk of adverse effects on coastal communities. For a small spill in the Caribbean region, there is little risk of large adverse effects on coastal communities. Because of the small surface water area exposed to oil, marine-based economic factors such as local commercial fisheries may experience little or no adverse effects. In many cases, a spill of this size is expected to pose no risk to surface water resources because the spilled oil will never reach the threshol d of concern (Table H.3.5-1). The risk of adverse effects on co astal communities for a medium sp ill is likely to be greater than for a small spill. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of me chanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medi um spill will sweep approximately 312 million m 2 of marine waters in the spill area1 above the corresponding threshold of concern (Table H.3.5-1). The economic and social losses will occur in recreational areas and commercial fishing grounds that exceed the threshold of concern. For example, beac hes in the Caribbean region may be closed to visitors and fishing may not be permitted in waters exposed to oil, causing losses in revenue to the tourism and commercial fishery sectors of the coastal economy. The resulting adverse effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing short-term decreases in employment, income, the viability of as sociated businesses, and the appeal of coastal living. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk of ad verse effects on coastal communities. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill will sweep approximately 659 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.3.5-1) potentially important to recreationa l and commercial fishery activities in the spill area. A spill of this size would affect the pleasure that coastal residents and visitors derive from coastal activities and the economic contribution that recreational and commerci al fishing resources make to local income and employment. The scope of potential losses to co mmercial fishing, recreation, and tourism is described in more detail in subsequent sections. Further, the contamination of the shoreline may adversely affect the quality of coastal living. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. The adverse impacts of a large spill would be similar to those of a medium spill and would generally be limited to the spill area \u2014the adverse impacts would not be felt at the regional economic level. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.3.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-50 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, indu stries, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affect ed by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer direct and indirect adve rse economic effects from an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease reve nue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisherie s, by both the anglers themselves and by related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated entirely. Tourism and associated businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal areas decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived resource taint. A small spill 3 or more statute mi offshore would have essentially no adverse effect on either the local or regional economies (Table H.3.5-1). There is little to no risk of oiling of economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any co mmercial fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. A medium spill, with mechanical recovery and in situ burn operations, could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oiling recreational resources, limited closing of fisheries and recreational areas, and needin g to supplement the normal response operation employment base. These adverse effects would probably be very short lived \u2014cleanup operations would not require a long period of time and wo uld be local in nature. A large spill's adverse economic effects could be high for the local ec onomy, even with mechanical recovery and in situ burning, based on the anticipated level of marine -water oiling and the possibility that closure of commercial and recreational fishing grounds will occur. While the adverse e ffects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tour ism, could cause adverse socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total av ailable resources in the modeled area is affected for even the larg est modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H. 3.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized (and could be substantial) \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore are not likely to cause large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports; any adverse effects would likely be of short du ration. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commerce if it occurs in an d around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft movement as a means of fac ilitating spill response. Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or increase in travel ti mes over water can result in hardship for coastal communities as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-51 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills This issue is particularly relevant to the islands of the Caribbean region. St. Thomas is home to the Virgin Islands Port Authority's Edward Wilmoth Blyden IV Marine Facility, which provides important transportation services between the Brit ish and U.S. Virgin Islands (USDOI-OIA, 1999). Further, ports on each island provide berths for cruise ships, bringing tourists and revenue to the islands. Disruption of transportation and cruises is as detrimental as disruption of the movement of cargo ships, which is also critic al to island imports and exports. For example, molasses, a key ingredient in rum, must be imported to support rum production, a key island export. On St. Croix, a $9 million molasses tanker pier was built to facili tate the import of this good for rum production, a major source of revenue for the Virgin Islands (USDOI-OIA, 1999). Substantial funds have been invested in ports like Crown Bay, where a 274 m ca rgo bulkhead and a number of storage facilities have been built. Vessel transportation is of pa ramount importance to the Caribbean region's trade and tourism industries. To the extent that mechanical recovery and in situ burning reduce the surface area of slicks above a threshold of concern, some combination of spill response options will reduce the risk of adverse effects on vess el transportation and ports, and the corresponding trade of essential goods. While these adverse effects would affect the ease with which vess els access ports, they will also affect the economic sectors that depend on the efficient movement of goods to and from ports. Although the possibility exists that the affected area's trade partners will be affected by interruptions in vessel transportation in the spill area, the availability of substitute means of transportation and sources of goods and products indicates that any closures would be unlikely to generate high adverse effect s outside of the spill area. For a small spill, no great adverse effects on vesse l transportation or ports are expected (Table H.3.5-1), but there is some risk of adverse effects for medium and large spills. Therefore, the nature of the risk to vessel transportation will be a function of the locati on, area, and pattern of surface water oiling, as well as the extent of o iling in port areas. A medium or large spill in the Caribbean region, however, would not generally be expected to result in large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports since any effects would likely be short lived \u2014that is, even if shipping waters or ports are exposed to oil and ar e therefore closed, as soon as recovery efforts remove surface oil, these facilities wo uld be expected to be reopened. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.3.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be loca lized (and could be substantial) \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerable to oil spills because of both closures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing opera tions in the wake of an oil spill can lead to significant revenue losses for the commercial fishing industry, as well as related in dustries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from commercial fleets. In addition, oil spills can lead to a decreased demand for fish from affected waters becaus e of actual or perceived taint and can instigate alterations to fishing Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-52 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills practices in a manner that increase s operating costs and/or decrea ses revenues. Large spills can potentially injure fish nursery grounds and impose ot her risks that could reduce fish harvests longer term. In the Caribbean region, commercial fishing is an important economic activity, generating over $5 million per year (NMFS, 2004b). To the extent that mechanical and in situ burning reduce the surface area of slicks above a threshold of concern, some combination of response options will reduce the risk of adverse effects on re gionally important fisheries. For a small spill in the Caribbean region, the risk to commercial fisheries is negligible using the basic response scenario (current leve ls of mechanical recovery and in situ burning as circumstances permit) (Table H.3.5-1). For a medium spill, the risk of adve rse effects on commercial fisheries is likely to be much greater than for a small spill. A medium spill in the Caribbean region will sweep approximately 312 million m2 of marine waters used by the commercial fishing industry above the corresponding threshold of concern (Table H.3. 5-1). A risk of economic loss to commercial fisheries will occur when waters exceed relevant management and/or risk-based thresholds. For example, fishing may not be permitted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold of concern, resulting in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting adverse effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decreases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, spill effects on the commercial fishing economy may be less severe. For a large spill, there is a substa ntial risk to commercial fisheries. This risk to commercial fisheries increases with a large spill, as the size of the area oiled increases. A large spill presents risk to approximately 659 million m 2 of the marine waters potentially important to commercial fisheries above the corresponding threshold of concern (Table H.3.5-1). A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in local commercial fishing ac tivities and revenues, and may negatively affect the revenues of associated businesses. To the ex tent that commercial fishing operations can, for a time, move to substitute fishing grounds, the pote ntially severe effects of even a large spill may be avoided. Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will not generally be at the regional or national levels but could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commercial fishing activities, in square meters of surface water oiled above the corresponding threshold of concern. The effects of an oil spill on recreational fishery-related activities will be felt more heavil y by various populations, in cluding recreational anglers and firms that supply goods and services to recr eational anglers. For example, recreational anglers fish for pleasure or sport, as opposed to monetary ga in. In the wake of an oil spill, such anglers may choose to fish at a substitute location, may experience a reduced quality of experience, or may choose to forgo fishing entirely. The losses suffered will be related to these missed opportunities. In addition, while closing waters to recreational fishing will decrease the social welfare of recreationists, it would also be expected to affect the demand for boat rentals and other services consumed by fishing enthusiasts. Recreational fishing is a popular activity in the Cari bbean region. Although the total recreational catch is not available, it is known that in 2001 recreational fishermen caught 2.1 million fish off the coast of Puerto Rico (NMFS, 2001). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-53 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a small spill, adverse effects on recreational resources in the Caribbean region would likely be negligible (Table H.3.5-1), regardless of the resp onse option used. The risk of adverse effects on recreational fishing activities for a medium spill is likely to be much greater than for a small spill. A medium spill will sweep approximately 312 million m2 of marine waters used by the recreational fishermen above the corresponding threshold of conc ern. For a large spill, there is substantial risk of adverse effects on recreational fishing, approximately 659 million m2 of the marine waters potentially important to recreational fishing in the spill area. A spill of this size may harm businesses associated with recreational fishing. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.3.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Subsistence Potential adverse effects on marine species are a concern during spills wh ere traditional use of subsistence resources occurs. Information on subs istence use of fish and invertebrates in the Caribbean region is limited (Section 3.3.5.5). Recreational fishing for and consumption of spiny lobster and reef fish are popular activities in this area. Tissue tainting would be the primary concern for these subsistence resources. The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the coastal habitats, fish, and wildlife in the Caribbean region. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce th e severity of potential adverse effects nor increase risk to subsistence resources. Potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Caribbean region are low for small, medium, or large spills (Table H.3.5-2). Effects on subsistence resources fo r a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. For a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure to dissolved aromatics to be at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) occurring mostly around the lower Florida Keys, with some sma ll areas of higher concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb). Tainting of fish and invertebrates becomes a concern when water concentrations exceed approximately 100 ppb (Section 4.3.5.6). Sedi ment exposure is expected to be neglig ible. Less than 1 percent of shoreline was oiled, including subsistence resources associat ed with shoreline and intertidal habitats. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-54 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. For a large spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low concentrations (1 - 100 ppb) occurring mostly around the lower Flor ida Keys, with some sm all areas of higher concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb), especially near Marquesas Key. Sediment ex posure is expected to be negligible. The modeling estimated that less than 1 percent of shoreline and intertidal resources were exposed to oil. The risk scores in Table H.3.5-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates for subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill sizes (Section 4. 3.5.6). Although areas other than the Florida Straits for the Caribbean region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions an alyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on subsistence resources will fall within a simila r range throughout the Caribbean region. While adverse effects on subsistence resources are not likely to be high on a regional level, they may be high on a local level. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subsistence resources in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spill sizes. Historic Resources Under Alternative 1 using the basi c response scenario (current leve ls of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), adverse effects on historic resources in the Caribbean region are expected to below. (Section 3.3.5.6). Historic sites in the Caribbean region, such as forts and walls, are located on land and protected from oiling by barriers and proximity to shore; most archaeological artifacts and some shipwrecks are buried under sediment and coral formation and, th erefore, would not become oiled. Results from several studies indicated that direct oiling caused negligible effects on cultural resources following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Bittner, 1996; Dekin, recove ry or mechanical recovery plus in situ burning may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, which will also reduce the amount of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to sensitive historic structures.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Recreation and Tourism The tropical islands of the Caribbean region provid e visitors and residents with the opportunity to enjoy a number of outdoor recreational activities and scenic vistas. For example, the beaches of this region are popular, as are all manner of water sports. In 1997, 2.1 million people visited the U.S. Virgin Islands, with 1,619,000 visitors arriving on cruise ships (USDOI-OIA, 1999). According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, tourist revenues in the Caribbean were $500 million in 1998 (USDOI-USVI, 1998). Further, Nati onal Parks and National Marine Sa nctuaries are key attractions in these islands, and associated water recreation and wildlife viewing are also important (USVIDT, 2002). As an example of these resources being at risk in the event of an oil spill, the VISTA BELLA spill affected beaches on Puerto Rico and St. John at th e height of tourist season despite the fact that the spill occurred 321.8 km from the beaches of Puer to Rico. A 1-km stretch of the Playa Larga, Puerto Rico, was reported to have 100 percent oil coverage, while 14.82 km of beach on St. John was estimated to have been oiled to the extent that clean up was required. Shoreline cleanup in Puerto Rico was significant on beaches popular with tourists visiting the island (NOAA-HMRAD, 1992). An oil spill such as the VISTA BELLA would be expected to affect recreationists' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and economic implications of a spill would reach beyond direct effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potential ly leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment above for more details). For a small spill in the Caribbean region, the risk of adverse effects on recreation and tourism is negligible using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H. 3..5-1). Because of the small surface water area exposed to oil as a result of a small spill, water- based attractions, such as beach visi tation, may experience few or no adverse effects. For a medium spill, the risk of adverse effects on r ecreation and tourism is likely to be greater than for a small spill. A medium spill will adversely affect approximately 312 million m 2 of recreational waters in the spill area above the corresponding threshold of concern (Table H.3.5-1). Under these conditions in the Caribbean region , beaches in the spill area may be closed to visitors, and fishing and boating may not be permitted in waters expo sed to oil, causing losses in revenue to the recreation and tourism sectors of the coastal economy. These effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decreases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with recreation and tourism. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-56 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a large spill, there is a substantial risk of adve rse effects on recreation and tourism. A large spill will adversely affect approximately 659 million m2 of recreational waters in the spill area (Table H.3.5-1). A spill of this size may cause significan t decreases in tourism, recreation, associated business activities and revenues, and the quality of coastal living. Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.3.5- 1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are un likely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are define d as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill. There are many area s in the Caribbean region with high population concentrations along the coast. However, adverse effects on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore for any of the spill sizes considered, regardless of the response options \u2014mechanical recovery and/or in situ burning \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to keep the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are re lated to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill response equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the worker certification and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The ri sk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), po tential regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Caribbean region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. H.4. A LTERNATIVE 1-CONSEQUENCES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO For the purpose of this PEIS, the Gulf of Mexico region will specifically cover the waters that lie south and west of the continental United States; east and north of Mexico, and northwest of Cuba (Figure 3.1-1). The location selected for modeling an d risk assessment purposes was a site offshore of the entrance to Galveston Bay, TX , because it is in a high-traffic ar ea at greater risk for oil spills. Modeling results from this location were evaluated relative to the geographic area in Section C.1.2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), herein referred to as the North Texas Shelf. The North Texas Shelf encompasses Galveston Bay and the Texas portion of the Louisiana-North Texas Shelf. In general, the site is representative of offshore sites throughout the region and provides a basis for the modeling of potential en vironmental effects. The results of the modeling \u2014 used to evaluate spills of concern in this risk analysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore) \u2014are Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-57 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills presented in Part C of the technical report (F rench McCay et al., 2004) and summarized in this section. Table H.4.-1 presents the risk ranking for the modeling of Alternative 1 in the Gulf of Mexico region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with or without the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent recovery efficiency 1 for three spill sizes (small, 200 bbl; medium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). The risk scores presented in the tabl e are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional considerations; however, in an y specific oil spill situation local concerns could be higher. Table H.4-2 summarizes the signific ance of the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 1 in the Gulf of Mexico region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for th e average spill to the region in general. Under Alternative 1, dispersant capa bility is available and its use is feasible in the Gulf of Mexico region (Figure 2.2-1), so chemical dispersion is co nsidered at two levels of efficiency: 45 percent and 80 percent. For spills analyzed in this document (i.e ., those that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore), there are likely to be minor or insignificant regiona l adverse impacts on all resources for a small spill, based on the speed with which such a spill would we ather and dissipate and the small area that could be affected, regardless of response option used, except for marine and coastal birds, which could be moderate. For a medium spill, adverse impacts are mi nor or insignificant for all resources except for marine and coastal birds, which could be moderate regardless of the response option used. Coastal marshes are of particular concern. In addition, adverse impacts could be moderate for intertidal habitat, sea turtles and areas of special concern with on-water mechanical recovery only, but are reduced to minor with chemical dispersion. 1 Recovery efficiency represents the operating effectiveness of th e dispersant: the greater the efficiency, the more effective th e dispersant.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a large spill, there is the potential for mo derate adverse impacts on coastal water quality, marine and coastal birds, intertidal habitats, sea turtles, and areas of special concern. Chemical dispersion does not change these general results. Such a spill could also cause significant, but localized, short-term socioeconomic adverse im pacts. These adverse impacts occur despite the treatment or recovery of some of the oil, but ar e reduced by these actions when they are effective. The availability of a dispersant ca pability under this alternative part icularly helps mitigate potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds, and coastal habitat and shoreline, especially for medium spills, without significantly increasing the risk to water column or subtidal resources. Chemical dispersion is less effective for large spills. Further, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantly change the level of concern identified from those obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. H.4.1 Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to water quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect water quality are the soluble aromatics, (monoaromatic hydrocarbons) and PAHs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) (Section 4.3.1.1). Thus, evaluation of potential adverse effects is based on the degree of potential contamination by these compounds. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effects on water quality are low, regardless of the response option used (current levels of mech anical recovery with or without in situ burning and chemical dispersion). This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid dilution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column, even after periods of extreme turbulence that induce relatively high dissolution rates. Dispersants would be applied to surface oil after much of the evaporation of the toxic components occurs because of logistics (i.e., greater than 12 hours after the spill), such that the resulting increase of concentrations of toxic components in th e water column would be relatively small. Overall, based on the modeling and risk a ssessment results, it is concluded that\u2014using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion \u2014adverse water-quality effects under Alternative 1 would be low in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Gulf of Mexico region. If an offshore spill moved into shallo w and confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills under conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence. Chemical dispersion would not be used in shallow and confined coastal waters (less than 3 nm 1 from shore) under Alternative 3, so it could only contribute to adverse water-quality effects in those areas if the dispersed oil plume drifted into coastal waters with only minimal, or no, dilution. The variable used to determine potential water-quality effects is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentrat ion for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-61 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected water volume increases with spill volume and the level of physical or chemical dispersion during the time of the spill. Na tural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of water that is c ontaminated above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of water contam inated increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume of water contamin ated for a small spill was extrapolated from the mean medium- and large-spill model results. The estimates of the volume of contaminated water \u2014 and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Gulf of Mexico region because the mixing of oil into water and process of diluti on are similar in all areas. Coastal In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi of shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 1. Thus, the model results for the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are used to assess coastal water- quality effects. If dispersants were applied offsho re, the dispersed oil plume could move into these nearshore areas. Since chemical dispersion would not be used in these areas, the level and duration of exposure would be negligible because of dilution. Galveston Bay is used as a repres entative of coastal water for modeling the North Texas Shelf, as well as the Gulf of Mexico region. Galveston Bay is approximately 1,786 km2 in area and about 2 m deep on average, with a total vo lume of approximately 3,572 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of Galveston Bay to determine the potent ial effects of small, medium, and large spills (Table H.4.1-1). This approach was used both with and without dispersant use, and yields very conservative estimates, in that it assumes all of the water column contamination would occur in coastal water. Since dispersants would not be employed in such areas, this would imply that the dispersed oil plume would move di rectly into coastal waters with out any dilution, which will not occur.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the North Texas Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Gulf of Mexico region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil may be incorporated into shallow water or intertid al sediments where, thro ugh leaching, it could become a continuing source of con tamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality wher e the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier I standards (beginning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concern to water quality would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have an insignificant infl uence on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would appl y whether either response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternat ive 1 are expected to be insignificant, minor, and moderate for small, medium, and large spills, respectively, with or without dispersant use. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-63 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Marine In marine waters, which are 3 or more statute mi offshore, mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion currently may be used for spill response in the Gulf of Mexico region. As was done for coastal waters, the estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentr ation for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of the reference area, the North Texas Shelf. The North Texas Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters in the Gulf of Mexico region. The total surface area of the North Texas Shelf is approximately 39,602 km2, so the area of interest is much vaster for marine waters than for coastal waters. Water-quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water \u201410 m deep, which is much shallower t h a n m o s t o f t h e G u l f o f M e x i c o r e g i o n ' s m a r i ne waters. The results for the selected modeling location (Table H.4.1-2) represent conservative es timates of adverse water-quality effects using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit).

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-64 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Natural dispersion of the oil would be very rapid after a spill, and recovery time would be on the order of hours to days. Leaching from oil contam ination reaching the sediments would not have a high effect on marine water quality because of the large dilution volume and natural dispersing forces in marine waters. The results would apply whether a mechanical response is implemented. Since in situ burning would replace some of the mechanical response, and both methods remove oil that would otherwise result in water contamination, th e potential water-quality effects would not change significantly if in situ burning were used. For a spill in water deeper than the 10 m evaluated here, the potential adverse effects would be even smaller. With the addition of chemical dispersion, the results in Table H.4.1.2 are nearly identical (with some uncertainty reflected in the variability of the results) at both 45 and 80 percent efficiency because the amount of dispersants at 45 percent efficiency is sufficient to treat all dispersible surface oil. For a small spill, the volume of w ater contaminated with the addition of chemical dispersion would be the same as for the basic response scenario because, due to logistics, dispersants could only be applied after a small spill has mostly disper sed naturally. Chemical dispersion for medium or large sp ills increases the volume of water contaminated, but would not change the risk score. In situ burning (in combination with mechanical recovery and chemical dispersion) would not significantly change the vo lume contaminated or the consequence on water quality since it would substitute for some of the mechanical response. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even after a large spill, with or without disp ersant use, and recovery ti me would be on the order of days to weeks. The estimates of the volume of water contaminated \u2014and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Gulf of Mexico region because natural and chemical dispersion of oil into the water column and dilution processes are similar in all areas. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine water quality in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an oil spill on air quality may involve all vol atile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are normally very localized and short lived for small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any po tential adverse effects: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. Chemical dispersion reduces the volatiliza tion of unburned oil to the atmosphere to only a slight extent, so that effects are essentially identical with or without dispersant use. The modeling shows that results do not vary by spill location, or size in the Gulf of Mexico region. Two possible sources of contamination to the atmosph ere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilization of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-65 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The results of the modeling show that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-onl y recovery and chemical dispersion; hence, the risk scores are virtually identical for small, medium, and large spills. Volatilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill si te. Evaporati on off the water surface and volatilization fr om the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocarbon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentratio ns in the atmosphere at the water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmosphere would be on the order of days . Thus, a low level of concern is expected for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical -only recovery and chemical dispersion (Table H.4.1-3). Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning, with or without chemical dispersion, would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via in situ burning. For small spills, it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feasible (Table H.4.1-3). The maximum area potentially exceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km2 for a medium spill and 9.5 km2 for a large spill (Table H.4.1-3). If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wildlife) are within these areas, th ey could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, a region of interest equivalent to the North Texas Shelf (39,602 km2) would have less than 1 percent of its area adversely affected, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. The addition of chemical dispersion does not change the results in Table H.4.1-3. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on air quality in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without in situ burning.

H.4.2 Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals The cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sirenians in the Gu lf of Mexico region (App endix F, Table F.4-1) spend their entire lives at sea, and their concentrations vary depending on location and seasonal Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-66 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills migrations. The Florida manatee ( Trichechus manatus latirostris ) is fairly common along the Florida west coast and sporadic elsewhere. There are no fur-bearing marine mammals of concern that inhabit this region (Appendix F). Marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, and ma natees are vulnerable to spilled oil since they spend considerable time at the water's surface, which enhances possible contact with oil. The majority of these species remains offshore, and populations vary according to season and migration directions. Cetaceans appear able to detect and are likely to avoid floating oil or oil being recovered by mechanical means (Geraci, 1990). Studies have s hown that cetacean skin is nearly impenetrable to even the highly volatile constituents of oil, indicating that contact with oil probably would be less harmful to cetaceans than often believed. However, the toxic, volatile fractions in fresh crude oils could irritate and damage cetacean soft tissues , such as the mucous membranes of the eyes and airways. Marine mammals that are more commonly found in the nearshore regions and intertidal habitats, such as manatees, are of greater concern. Manatees tend to inhabit intertidal areas such as bays, rivers, harbors, and estuaries and are very rare ly spotted in deep marine waters. They usually remain in deep channels, feeding for extended periods of time. The likelihood of manatees coming into direct contact with oil from a spill occurring 3 or more statute mi offsho re is low. Overall, the potential adverse effects depend on the spill size, and the numb er and species of marine mammals present. Based on the surface area in th e North Texas Shelf, the equivale nt area for 100 percent mortality for cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sirenians is 0.002 pe rcent (or less) of the available habitat for a medium spill without chemical dispersion. For a large spill without chemical dispersion the equivalent area at risk increases, but remains low (0.002 percent for cetaceans and 0.02 percent for pinnipeds and sirenians). There are no known breeding or haulout areas associated with pinnipeds for this region; therefore, shoreline oiling will have no adverse impacts on most marine mammals, but there is a low risk for terrestrial species usin g the shoreline and for nearshore species (in this region, manatees). Based on the scattered presence of these species, the po tential adverse impacts were determined to be low for all spill sizes wit hout chemical dispersion. If mortality did occur, however, the population would probably require 1 to 3 years to recover. The results of the modeling for marine mammals using the basic resp onse scenario in the North Texas Shelf are presented in Table H.4.2-1. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-67 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the North Texas Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Gulf of Mexico region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. For any spill size, the addition of chemical dispersion is not expected to ch ange the adverse effects on marine mammals. There would be a reduction in the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4), and the equivale nt area of 100 percent mortality for the groups of concern would also be reduced, but the risk is already very low, so the scores do not change. The addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse consequences nor increase risk to ma rine mammals. Adverse effects on marine mammals for a small spill were determin ed by extrapolating from th e results of a medium spill. Although areas other than the North Texas Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on marine mammals wi ll fall within a similar range throughout the Gulf of Mexico region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine mammals in the Gulf of Mexico region under Altern ative 1 are expected to be minor for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds are usually of highest concern during an oil spill because birds are highly susceptible to the acut ely toxic effects of exposure to oil. There are many areas in the Gulf of Mexico region where high concentrations of birds may be found in a variety of habitats. Adverse effects on birds in this region would result mostly from shoreline oiling of sand beaches and mudflats that are staging habitats for migratory shorebirds; oiling of wetlands that are used by wading and marsh birds, waterfowl, diving birds, and raptors for nesting, roosting, and wintering; and surface water oiling in marine-w ater habitats that are used by diving birds and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-68 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills seabirds (Appendix F) (see section 4.3.2.2 for info rmation on the main issues of concern for birds exposed to an oil spill). The North Texas Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the intertidal habitats and wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico region (Table H.4.2-2). Under Alternative 1, the addition in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the potential adverse effects on birds. Potential levels of concern for birds in the North Texas Shelf are medium for all spill sizes, as discussed below. However, for a sma ll spill very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. The potential for adverse effects increases for medium and large spills; most concerning are conditions where wetlands and sand beaches that are used by nesting birds become heavily oiled. Two international Western Hemispheric Shoreb ird Reserve Network (W HSRN) sites and four National Wildlife Refuges occur in the North Texas Shelf. The presence of these sites indicates that large numbers of shorebirds (WHSRN sites) concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. Approximately 300,000 shorebirds, including wintering piping plover ( Charadrius ) (designated as a threatened species), use Ga lveston Bay beaches and flats as staging areas during the fall, winter, and spring. Wetlands, estuarie s, and nearshore waters serve as habitats for large numbers of diving birds, raptors, nesting wading birds, and wintering waterfowl. Thus, the risk rankings were determined based on the possibility that a large number of birds may be concentrated on heavily utilized beaches or in wetlands that are significantly oiled. Also, high mortality rates are typical for diving birds and waterfowl that are exposed to oil on the water's surface. It is important to recognize that adverse effects on birds may be more or less severe depending on the time of year and locations of their habitats, as well as the extent of shoreline and surface water oiling. For instance, an oil spill occurring during peak stag ing and wintering in Galveston Bay would result in more extreme adverse effects on regional bird populations than a spill occurring at a different time of year.

Note: Yellow represents a medium level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the North Texas Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Gulf of Mexico region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Under the basic response scenario, adverse effects on birds in the North Texas Shelf for a small spill were determined by extrapolating from th e results obtained for a medium spill and the expectation that recovery fr om light oiling is usually rapid for a ll habitat types. The volume of oil released in the small spill was approximately an order of magnitude less th an in the medium spill; therefore, the adverse effects on bird populations were estimated to be proportionally less. For a small spill, oiling is expected to be light, affect ing only outer sand beaches. The modeling of effects on birds for a medium spill under mechanical-only reco very resulted in estimates of 5 to 10 percent of the regional bird population being adversely affe cted because outer sand beaches that are used as staging habitats by large numbers of shorebirds were oiled. For a larg e spill under mechanical- only recovery, the modeling result ed in estimates of over 20 percent of the local area bird population being adversely affected. Nearly 10 percent of outer sand beach habitat in the North Texas Shelf was oiled, and 9.4 km of interior marsh habitats that have long recovery periods were also oiled. Shorebirds, wading birds, and waterf owl heavily use the shoreline areas oiled in this scenario. The risk scores in Table H.4.2-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates of 1 to 3 years for most bird species, as wa s the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2). With the addition of chemical dispersion for a medium spill, 45 and 80 percent efficiency reduced the length of oiled shoreline by 50 and 65 percen t, respectively, and adve rse effects on important bird habitats were also reduced. The risk scores were the same, regardless of dispersant efficiency (Table H.4.2-2). For a large spill, 45 and 80 percent efficiency only reduced shoreline oiling by 11 and 21 percent, respectively, so the decrease in the amount of shoreline oiling in sensitive bird habitats with chemical dispersion was not enough to change the risk score, regardless of dispersant efficiency (Table H.4.2-2). Although areas other th an the North Texas Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions modeled in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of effects on bi rd populations will fall within a Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-70 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills similar range throughout the Gulf of Mexico region. On an overall regional level, adverse effects from medium spills to birds are reduced when ch emical dispersion is modeled. For large spills, adverse effects on marine and coastal birds are not consistently reduced when chemical dispersion is used in the Gulf of Mexico modeling scenario, but are in most other regions. The addition of in situ burning does not change the significance of these adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these groups are of high concern, particularly when chemical dispersion is considered as a potential response option. As described in Section 4.3.2.3 and Appendix H.3.3, plankton and fish are adversely affected either directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil droplets mixed by waves into the wate r (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of ex posure is direct uptake of dissolved oil components, originating directly from surface oil or dissolving from the microscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, as spill size increases, so do adverse effects. However, there is great variability related to the environmental cond itions after a spill; plankton and fish suffer much more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather. In addition, many species utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they are more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved components when oil comes ashore. Species and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic components, with species from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stable locations being more sensitive than those from polluted and environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposure during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floa ting oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapidly disperse to background levels. There may be longer-term effects if an offshore spill occurs in or migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands where dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Juvenile fish are more abundant in salt marshes and seagrass beds than in other shallow subtidal and intertidal areas, so these areas are of most concern (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 1 in most cases, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm of shore 1, but the dispersed oil plume could be transported by currents into this area. 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-71 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by oil spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percent loss multiplied by volume ex posed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes were translated to equivalent areas by multiplying by water depth at the spill site, allowing comparison with other resources, such as birds and shorelines, which are distributed on a per-ar ea basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniforml y distributed when expressed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by the simila r results for the four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, o ffshore Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively, of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) \u2014the equivalent areas of adverse ef fect on plankton and fish (both average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in this PEIS. The modeled spill site was 10 m deep water: adverse effects would be smaller for deeper waters because of gr eater vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionately greate r in shallower waters because of the restricted dilution potential. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much less. Thus, the model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortality of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes among response scenarios. The North Texas Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the Gulf of Mexico region (Table H.4.2-3). The adverse effects were estimated as a percentage of the total area of concern (39,602 km 2). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-72 2009 H.

With the addition of chemical dispersion, the results for 80 percent efficiency were only slightly higher than those for 45 percent efficiency beca use more than sufficient dispersant would be available under both conditions to disperse available surface oi l for spills up to 40,000 bbl (with some variability, as reflected in the results in Table H.4.2-3). For a sm all spill, based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality woul d be affected for a sma ll spill (Tables H.4.1-2), the volume of adverse effects on plankton and fish would be low for all response options under Alternative 1. Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery time would be less than 1 year. Overall, based on the modeling results, adverse effects on plan kton and fish in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 \u2014 using mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion \u2014would be localized to the immediate area around the spill site and similar in all marine water areas of the region. For large spills that might move rapidly into shallow co astal areas during rare storm events, the concentrations of toxic components might be high enough to cause some concern for water column communities, especially early life history stages for fish and invertebrates using intertidal and shallow subtidal areas. For large spills in the relatively shallow area within 12 statute mi of the coast, the adverse effects due to winds and current s without chemical dispersion would be greater than those for the average spill event where chemical dispersion is used. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on plankton and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-73 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills fish in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Intertidal Habitats Intertidal habitats are always of great concern during oil spills, particularly when sensitive habitats such as salt marshes are oiled because recovery can take many years. The sand beaches fronting the coastal barrier islands throughout the Gulf of Mexico region support high concentrations of overwintering birds, making these intertidal habitats highly susceptible to major adverse effects from oil spills. The wetlands along the many estuaries and bays support large populations of wildlife and provide nursery habitats for many commercially importan t fish and shellfish (Appendix F). Oil spills in these extensive and sh allow wetland areas would be very difficult to contain and clean up. Thus, oil often is left to degrade naturally, and the ecological functions of the wetlands can be affected throughout the recovery period. The Gulf of Mexico region has extensive areas of these sensitive habitats, and many areas are regionally important for different wildlife species. For a discussion of the relative ranking of th e sensitivity of intertidal habitats to spilled oil and the processes affecting oil fate and behavior on shorelines, see the explanation of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) in Section 4.3.2.4. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential fo r adverse effects on inte rtidal habitats in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loadin g on the shoreline and affect larger areas. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed and, thus, does not reduce potential adverse effects. Adve rse effects on intertidal habitats in the Gulf of Mexico region are low for a small spill in that very little oil is likely to strand onshore, only outer beaches are likely to be oiled, and oil loading would be light in most cases. However, the potential for adverse effects increases with spill volume, with the greatest concern for conditions where salt marshes and sand beaches become heavily oiled. The North Texas Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the intertidal habitats in the Gulf of Mexico region (H.4.2-4). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-74 2009 H.

Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the North Texas Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Gulf of Mexico region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats for a small spill were determined to be small by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting recovery from mostly light oiling of outer sand beaches within 1 year. For a medium spill under mechanical-only recovery, the modeling resulted in 16 km of oiled shoreline, which is a small perc entage of the total shoreline in the entire North Texas Shelf. However, most of this oiled shoreline consisted of outer sand beaches, representing 1 to 5 percent of this habitat in the North Texas Shelf. The risk scores in Table H.4.2-4 reflect the predicted recovery rate for o iled sand beaches being 1 to 3 years. For a large spill under mechanical-only recovery, the modeling resulted in an estimated 56.4 km of oiled shoreline. This value is still less than 1 percent of the entire shoreline area but ne arly 10 percent of the outer sand beach habitat in the North Texas Shelf. An estimated 9.4 km of interior marsh habitat were also affected. Oiled marshes are expected to take 3 to 7 years to recover. With the addition of chemical dispersion for a medium spill, 45 and 80 percent efficiency reduced the length of oiled shoreline by 50 and 65 percent, respectively, and the amount of oil that stranded in wetlands was very low (0.3 km). The risk scores were the same, regardless of dispersant efficiency (Table H.4.2-4). For a large spill, 45 and 80 percent efficiency reduced shoreline oiling by 11 and 21 percent, respectively, so the decrease in the amount of shoreline oiling in sensitive bird habitats with chemical dispersion was not enough to change the risk score, regardless of dispersant efficiency (Table H.4.2-4). However, chemical disp ersion did significantly increase the number of times no oil came ashore at all, which is a signif icant benefit. For large spills, chemical dispersion does not change the significance of adverse effects on intertidal habitats based on the median event. Although areas other than the North Texas Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those fo r all other regions modeled in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effect s on intertidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-75 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Gulf of Mexico region. Under Al ternative 1, the addition of in situ b u r n i n g d o e s n o t c h a n g e t h e amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant and moderate for small and large spill sizes, respectively, with or without dispersant use. For medium spill sizes, adverse impacts are expected to be mode rate but are reduced to minor levels of concern when chemical dispersion is used. Subtidal Habitats The subtidal (benthic) habitat consists of the bottom substrate below the low tide level, as well as the species that live in, on, and near the substrate. Th is benthic community includes areas of live, sandy, muddy, and low-relief bottoms; subs urface canyons; and pinnacles. The East and West Flower Garden Banks, located off the Loui siana-Texas coast, are particularly valuable coral habitats. Organisms living in this area \u2014demersal species \u2014include corals, plants and seagrasses, benthic invertebrates (such as crabs, shrimp, snails, bivalve mollusks, and marine worms), and bottom-dwelling fish. Because subtidal benthic communities do not include th e intertidal zone, they are at littl e risk from floating oil because, by definition, this environment is always below the surface. The greatest risk of exposure comes from sinking oil, as well as in situ burn residue, dispersed oil, or th e sorption of naturally dispersed or mechanically mixed oil that has become suspende d on sediments and is deposited onto the ocean floor. However, significant natural dispersion of oil and sediment into the water column only occurs during large storms or for nearshor e oil spills. Oil particles could adhe re to bottom substrate, plants, or animals, which could result in both physical co ating of organisms, as occurred in the 1993 BRAER spill in the Shetland Islands, and toxic effects from exposure to the chemical constituents (Section 4.3.2.5). Such adverse effect s are not normally observed. The risk to fauna and flora of the subtidal benthic habitat is minimal, based on the diluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid diluti on of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil re sidue potentially reaching the bottom substrate. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. It may slightly increase the risk of remaining oil residues sinking to the bottom. Residual oil from in situ burning that reaches the bottom is expected to have few or no adverse effects on su btidal habitats since the majority of its toxic components would have either evaporated or been destroyed during burning and the volume of residue produced is so small (Section 4.3.2.5) . Under the modeled conditions, the quantity of in situ burn residue produced would not result in a level of concern that exceeds low. For a medium spill without chemical dispersion the sediment threshold concentrations for dissolved aromatic and for total hydrocarbons were never exceeded. For a large spill the sediment threshold for total hydrocarbon exposure was exceeded, but only in an area of less than 0.0002 percent of the total reference area and less than 0.005 percent of Galveston Bay. Benthic habitat was also assumed to be at risk if there threshold of con cern for dissolved aromatic hydrocar bons affected stationary demersal species (those living at the sedime nt-water interface). With mechanic al-only recovery less than 0.001 percent of the North Texas Shelf was affected by water column concentrations above the threshold for the medium spill. For a large sp ill, the percentage increased to 0.087 percent.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the North Texas Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Gulf of Mexico region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 an d 80 percent efficiency for medium spills (Table H.4.2-5), the modeling resu lts show essentially no change in sediment contamination. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percen t efficiency for a large spill, sediment exposure increases to 0.002 and 0.004 percen t of the total reference area, respectively, which are still low risks. The area of exposure of stationary demersal species to dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations above the th reshold increased to 0.022 and 0.023 pe rcent of the total reference area for a medium spill and to 0.17 and 0.19 percent for a large spill at 45 and 80 percent efficiency, respectively. Overall the potentia l increase in adverse effects associated with the addition of chemical dispersion to subtidal habitat is small because the affected area is small relative to the North Texas Shelf reference area. Although areas other than the North Texas Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for many other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of ad verse effects on subtidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Gulf of Mexico region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subtidal habitats in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-77 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Areas of Special Concern The potential adverse effects on areas of special concern, such as National Marine Sanctuaries, National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, and National Estuarine Research Reserves, are important during an oil spill since these areas are under increased scrutiny and protection. Whereas most coastal and nearshore areas have a wide range of habitats or are very similar to other areas throughout the Gulf of Mexico, areas of special concern are set aside for their uniqueness (Appendix F, Tables F.4-3 through F.4-5 and Figu res F.4-1 through F.4-3). The potential risks and adverse effects associated with sh oreline areas of special concern are identical to those discussed above for intertidal habitats. The risks to subtidal resources, such as those included in National Marine Sanctuaries, are identical to those discusse d above for subtidal habitats. For this analysis, the risks to areas of special concern are assumed to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Appendix I), whichever are greater. Since the risk to intertidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on data presented for a medium spill using mechanical-only recovery , the estimated average extent of shoreline oiling is 16 km; this figure increases to 56 km for a large spill. The potential risk of surface oil reaching a shoreline associated with an area of special concern is low in the North Texas Shelf because of the number and scattered locations of these areas. The potential adverse effects of small spills to areas of special concern are low. Th e level of concern increases to moderate for medium and large spills based on the extent of the shor eline oiling (Table H.4.2-6). Potential concerns associated with a large spill are moderate if the spi ll occurs in close proximity to an area of special concern. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent efficiency for a medium spill (Table H.4.2-6), the average amount of shoreline oiling decreases by an estimate d 61 percent, and for a large spill, by over 70 percent. For a medium sp ill, chemical dispersion will also increase the number of times no oil reaches shore, an important be nefit that did not occur for large spills.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-78 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the North Texas Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Gulf of Mexico region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Based on the modeling for the North Texas Shelf, th e likelihood of adversely affecting an area of special concern in the lo calized region of a spill is minimal, un less the spill occurs directly adjacent to such an area. Since these areas are few and scat tered throughout the Gulf of Mexico region, they are unlikely to be disproportionately affected by th e average spill. If an area of special concern was highly adversely affected, it is anticipated that the recovery time for the affected area would be the same as for other intertidal habitats. These areas are most at risk from floating oil and, therefore, benefit from any action that reduces potential shoreline oiling. Although areas other than the North Texas Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of ad verse effects on areas of special concern will fall within a similar range throughout the Gulf of Mexico region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Gulf of Mexico region unde r Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant and moderate for small an d large spills, respectively, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to intertidal habitats. For medium spills, adverse impacts are expected to be moderate but are reduced to minor levels of concern when chemical dispersion is used. Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The Gulf of Mexico region has a variety of threat ened, endangered, or cand idate species (Appendix F). The overall regional risk that a threatened, endangered, or candidate sp ecies would be adversely affected or even present in the area of a spill is low; however, killing a single individual of such a species can be considered a severe effect. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, or fish that are threatened, enda ngered, or candidate species are identical to those discussed in Appendix H.3.2 for these groups. Potent ial adverse effects on the four threatened or endangered species of sea turtles were discusse d in Section 4.3.3.1 and are similar to those described in Appendix H.3.2 (Marine Mammals) for pinnipeds. Sea turtles are a particular concern if the spill occurs in the vicinity of a nesting beach. Overall, risk scores were highest for marine and coastal birds. While the risks to these groups have been described, the level of concern for threatened, endangered, or candidat e species tends to be higher. Th erefore, any adverse effects on breeding or that result in death should be considered high. Adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or candid ate species in the Gulf of Mexico region for any spill size are difficult to predict. Depending on the location and season, the nu mber and type of species present will vary. Based on the overall size of the Gulf of Mexico region an d the sporadic distribution of threatened, endangered, or candidate species inhabiting the region, the likelihood of adversely affecting an individual of concern would be low unless the spill affects important shoreline or critical marine habitats. However, if a threatened, endangered, or candidate sp ecies were present in the spill area, the resulting adverse effect would be high. Th e severity of the effect varies depending on the sensitivity of the individuals present. The addition of chemical dispersion at 45 or 80 percent efficiency will decrease the average amount of surface oilin g and shoreline oiling, which would benefit the species in these areas, such as se a turtles or coastal birds. No addi tional risk from ch emical dispersion is expected for fish. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-79 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium , and large spills, with or withou t dispersant use, based on the risk to marine and coastal birds. H.4.3 Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat Virtually all waters in the Gulf of Mexico region out to the limits of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are considered Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). Areas such as bays, river mouths, and harbors are designated EFH for at le ast one life stage of at least one species and are protected by legislation (Appendix F). Th e primary issue with respect to EFH is either (1) exposure of sensitive resources in the water column to hydrocarbon concen trations of concern, or (2) the contamination of bottom sediments, both of which could lead to either acute or chronic exposures. Adverse effects would include either the death of in dividual organisms, the possibility of sublethal effects affecting long-term population viability, or degr adation of habitat that re duces its availability to managed species. For this analysis , the risks to EFH are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Appendix H.3), whichever are greater. The results for plankton and fish and for subtidal habitats indicate only low ef fects and form the basis for the EFH risk score. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), pote ntial regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to plankton and fish and to subtidal habitats. H.4.4 Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Sect ion 4.3.5, oil spills can produce a variety of adverse social and economic effects. These adverse effects are generally not large when measured at the regional level, but instead are typically felt in communities located near resources oiled by the spill. Specifically, high adverse effects are generally limited to those industries and populati ons that are affected by the spill. Some of the most visible and high effects are likely to incl ude effects on water- and shore-based recreation, commercial fisheries, and the overa ll well-being of the residents of coastal communities in the Gulf of Mexico region. This modeling considers the risk of adverse socioec onomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreation al activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceived taint; closure of commer cial fishing grounds or hatcheries, or reduced commercial harvests; and altered transportation patterns. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills may generate other dire ct, as well as secondary, effects on social and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may cause chan ges in the employment and revenues of resource-based businesses. While th ese effects are not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and rela tive measures of the overall risk of adverse social and economic effects of small, medium, and large oil spills using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), with or without chemical dispersion, in the Gulf of Mexico region. The methodology is described in more detail in the Atlantic region (Appendix H). The resources most likely to be affected by any oi l spill are important to the Gulf coast economy. For example, Galveston Island bo asts 32 mi of sandy beachfro nt (GIC&VB, 2002). This island Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-80 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills generated a large portion of the almost $480 millio n in tourism revenues for Galveston County in 2000 (Texas Tourism, 2002). Furt hermore, Texas has been rank ed as one of the top three producers of shrimp nationally since 1950. In 2000, approximately 73.8 million pounds of shrimp were landed in Texas for a total value of $210 million (Maril, 2002). Both the natural resources and the revenues generated by these resources are susc eptible to the adverse effects of an oil spill. There is no existing standard for \"significance\" rel ated to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface wate r must be oiled to be consider ed a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the ef fect will depend on a number of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, lo cal), opportunities for resource substi tution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of low concern if it is not of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the modeled effects under all modeled scenar ios would likely be low at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that occur would be expected to be localized in nature. The risk factor reflects the ratio of the percentag e of the shoreline or surface water oiled using the basic response scenario to the percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion. For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of risk equal to one-fifth that expected given response options limited to mechanical recovery and in situ burning. This modeling assumes that the risk posed by oil sp ills to the socioeconomic environment is directly related to the extent to which resources (meters of recreational beach and square meters of marine waters) are oiled above thresholds of concern for the Gulf of Mexico region. By comparing the absolute and relative degree of ri sk to the socioeconomic environmen t under various spill sizes, this modeling considers the degree of risk reduction achieved under a given sp ill response option (see Appendix I for details on the method used). The risk estimates presented (Table H.4.4-1) are based on modeled spills affecting the North Texas Shel f. While any given spill may exhibit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic effect, these re sults are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations along the entire Gulf coast, as long as spills occur in areas where mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion are feasible. In addition, the conclusions reached for the North Texas Shelf are supported by results for other modeled areas \u2014the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assump tions across spill size is similar in magnitude. Table H.4.4-1 highlights the effects of small, medium, and large spills on the Gulf of Mexico region's socioeconomic resources by presenting es timates of resources oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute terms (area of shoreline and surface water oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of the total resource base in the modeled spill area (North Texas Shelf). The threshold of concern due to oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m 2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). The resource area is based on the estimated extent to which the coastal community in the modeled area potentially relies on each resource. Table H.4.4-1 presents the shoreline and surface water oiled under the basic scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), with or without chemical dispersion. Table H.4.4-1 illustrates that an 80 pe rcent effective dispersant results in less oiled Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-81 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills shoreline than a 45 percent effective dispersant, for similar spill sizes, and that the spatial extent of oiling is also less under the scenario with th e most efficient dispersant (i.e., 80 percent). For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life potentially affected by an oil spill. Absolute and relative risk are discussed for: coastal communities, demography, and employment; general economic status of a coastal community; vessel transportation and ports; commercial and recreational fisheries; historic resources; recreation and tourism; and public safety and worker health. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Coastal communities benefit from and rely on the marine environment to provide residents with sustenance, livelihoods, leisure op portunities, and shipping avenues. Individuals who live and work in close proximity to the coast derive both soci al and economic rewards from the natural beauty, recreational opportunities, quality of life, and cultural attributes associated with these coastal locations. These rewards are derived from assets su ch as National Parks, public beaches, fishing opportunities, and commercial and tourism-related industries. Thus, oil spills can affect multiple aspects of a coastal community's assets, leading to adverse effects on the economic benefits of community activities. These effects, in turn, can impose changes on an affected community's demographics and employment patterns.

The threshold of c oncern because of oiled shoreline and surface water is 10 g/m2 and 0.01 g/m2 of oil, respectively (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). || Percentages reflect the proportion of the total modeled area above the threshold of concern. # A risk factor reflects the ratio of the percentage of the model area or volume oiled using the basic response scenario to the m odel area or percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills In addition to the direct employment and other ad verse effects associated with oil spills on marine resource-based economic sectors, spills may generate secondary adverse effects on coastal communities. For example, in Texas it has been estimated that $1 of revenue from the shrimping industry translates into $3 in the local economy (Texas Shrimpers, 2002). Canneries, distribution facilities, transportation companies, restaurants, and grocery stores are essential to the industry's supply chain and as an outlet for its catch. Thus, oil spills can affect commercial fishing operations, as well as upstream suppliers and downstream purchasers. The adverse effects of an oil spill on commercial fishing and its dependent industries may affect coastal residents throug h decreased income and employment opportunities. Because of its large pop ulation and the importance of many maritime activities to various coastal communities, the entire Gulf coast is at ri sk of experiencing adverse social and economic effects from an oil spill. A number of spills have affected the entire Gulf coast in the past. The 1979 BURMAH AGATE spill in Galveston Bay, for example, led to the accumula tion of tarballs on the shores of Padre Island, a popular vacation spot for beach goers (NOAA-HMRA D, 1992). In addition to closing the Houston Shipping Channel, the Apex Barge-Greek Tank Vessel SHINOUSSA collision resulted in the closure of shellfish, shrimp, and finfish fisheries througho ut Galveston Bay. Although the ban on finfishing lasted only a few days, the shellfish and shrimp fisheries were closed for a longer time (NOAA\u00ad HMRAD, 1992). To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water oiling, some combination of spill response options can be expected to reduce the ri sk to coastal communities in the Gulf of Mexico region. For a small spill in the Gulf of Mexico region, the risk of large adverse effects on coastal communities is negligible (Table H. 4.4-1). In many cases, a spill of this size is expected to pose no risk to shoreline resources because the spilled oil will never reach the shoreline above a threshold of concern. In addition, because of the small surface water area exposed to oil as a result of a small spill, marine-based econom ic factors such as local commercial fisheries may experience little or no effect (Table H.4.4-1). The risk to coastal communities for a medium spill is likely to be greater than for a small spill. However, when certain weather cond itions and current patterns are combined with specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources at all or at levels above the selected threshold. For a medium spill along the Nort h Texas Shelf, such conditions prevail in only 1 percent of modeled spills when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are modeled in the cleanup process. With dispersant application, the model indicates that fewer medium spills will reach shore. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, dispersants reduce the number of medium spills reaching shore by 18 and 27 percent, respectively. For these spill events, no adverse effects are expected on the shoreline. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium spill near the North Texas Shelf will have a spill area 1 above the corresponding thresholds of concern that will advers ely affect approximately 9,386 m of recreational shoreline and sweep approximately 338 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.4.4-1). The risk of social and economic losses will occur in areas of both sandy shoreline and fishery waters that exceed the risk-based thresholds. For example, beaches along the entire Gulf coast may be closed to visitors, 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-84 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills and fishing may not be permitted in waters exposed to oil, causing losses in revenue to both the tourism and commercial fishery sectors of the coastal economy. These effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill by affecting employment opportunities, earnings, and the value of coastal living. The risk to coastal communities from a medium spill can be further mitigated with chemical dispersion. With the addition of chemical dispersion, a medium spill in the North Texas Shelf will adversely affect approximately 3,315 to 4,109 m of recreational shoreline and sweep approximately 86 million to 121 million m2 of marine waters in the spill area used for recreation and by the commercial fishing industry, respectively, above the corresponding thresholds of concern (Table H.4.4-1). At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the risk to resources essential to tourism, recreation, and commercial fisheries is dramatically reduced, falling 56 and 64 percent, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are modeled. In the Gulf of Mexico region, these estimates of expected risk reduction for medium oil spills are assumed to be valid as proxy indicators of the overall expected risk reduction for the well-bei ng of coastal communities' residents. For a large spill using the basic respons e scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), there is a substantial risk of adverse effects on coastal communities because, based on the modeling results, the likelihood of a spill reaching the shoreline is very high. The addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent efficiency results does not reduce the risk because there is only a minor reduction (1 percent) in the number of spills that reach shore above a threshold of concern. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill will sweep approximately 28,531 m of sandy shoreline and approximately 789 million m 2 of marine waters (Table H.4.4-1) . A spill of this size may disrupt tourism, recreation, and commercial fishing, affecting the revenues, employment, and income directly and indirectly associated with these industries. Furt her, an oil spill may temporarily reduce the quality of coastal living in a given area. The risk to coastal communities of a large spill can be mitigated with the addition of chemical dispersion. With the addition of chemical disper sion, a large spill in the North Texas Shelf will adversely affect approximatel y 23,049 to 25,468 m of recre ational shoreline and sweep approximately 652 million to 706 million m2 of marine waters in the sp ill area used for recreation and by the commercial fishing industry, respectively, above the corresponding thresholds of concern (Table H.4.4-1). The risk to resources e ssential to tourism, recreation, and commercial fisheries are significantly reduced from the basic response scenario, falling 10 to 20 percent for the 45 and 80 percent removal efficiency scenarios, respectively. These measures of risk reduction are assumed to be valid as proxy indicators of the overall expected reduction in risk to coastal communities of a large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be minor for small, medium, and large spill sizes, with or wit hout dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any advers e impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-85 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, indu stries, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affect ed by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer direct and indirect adve rse economic effects from an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease reve nue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisherie s, by both the anglers themselves and by related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated entirely. Tourism and associated businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal areas decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived resource taint. The shrimp industry is the most important sector of the commercial fishing industry in Texas. In fact, Texas has been ranked as one of the t op three producers of shrimp nationally since 1950 (Maril, 2002). In 2000, approximately 73.8 million lb of shrimp were landed in Texas for a total value of $210 million, composing approximately 91 percent of the value of all commercial marine products landed in Texas (NMFS, 2002). In 1993, th e blue crab harvest generated 3.9 million lb of product, valued at $8.2 million (Texas Shrimper s, 2002). According to Texas Oysters (TDA, 2001), an association of local oyster harvesters, oyster landings have a $50 m illion impact on the Texas economy and account for 13 percent of the national supply of this shellfish. In total, the Galveston area is responsible for 60 to 70 percent of the total Texas harvest of oysters (Texas Tourism, 2001). This year-round activity provides jobs for shucke rs, packers, and shellsto ck shippers. Further, the local oyster harvest is important to restaurant s and supermarket chains (TDA, 2001). A spill such as the one that resulted from the Apex Barge-Greek Tank Vessel SHINOUSSA collision can cause substantial damage to local econo mies; this spill closed fishing gr ounds through Galveston Bay for more than a month in 1990 (NOAA-HMRAD, 1992). A small spill that is 3 or more statute mi offshore would have essentially no adverse effect on either the local or regional economies (Table H.4.4-1). Th ere is little to no risk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any co mmercial fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. A medium spill, with mechanical recovery, an in situ burn, and dispersant operations, could be expected to have short-term adve rse economic effects as a result of oiling recreati onal beaches and closing fisheries and recreational areas, plus th e need to supplement the normal response operation employment base, especially if shoreline oiling occurs. These adverse effects would probably be very short lived, in that cleanup operations would not require a long period of time. Further mitigating the effects is that when certain weat her conditions and current patterns are combined with specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to re ach shoreline resources at all or at levels above the selected threshold. For a medium spill in the North Texas Shelf, such conditions prevail in only 1 percent of modeled spills when the basic resp onse scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstance s permit) is used in the cleanup. With the addition of chemical dispersion, the modeling indicates th at fewer medium spills will reach shore: at 45 percent efficiency, dispersants reduce the number of medium spills reaching shore above relevant thresholds by 18 percent, and at 80 percent efficiency, by 27 percent. For these spill events, no adverse effe cts on shoreline are expected. For a large spill, the adverse economic effects could be high, even with mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion, based on the anticipated level of sh oreline oiling and the likelihood that closure of commercial and recreati onal fishing grounds will occur. In addition, the potential level of shoreline oiling would require a much larger cleanup effort. While the adverse effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-86 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills return to the coastal resources, especially in ar eas dependent on tourism, could cause the adverse socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are ex pected to be minor for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized\u2014 that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offsho re are not likely to cause considerable adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports; any adverse effects would likely be of short duration. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commerce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on wate rcraft movement as a means of facilitating spill response. Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or incr ease in travel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. These adverse effects might be felt at a number of levels. For example, vessel operators may in cur additional costs asso ciated with delays and longer shipping distances; businesses that depend on timely receipt of feedstock or other goods may experience adverse effects such as producti on slowdowns; and indi viduals who work in adversely affected sectors may be displaced. To the extent that businesses in other locations depend on the affected industries, a longer-term disruption of vessel transportation could yield adverse effects beyond the immediate spill area. However, given substitute suppliers and shipping modes and the expected short-term nature of any disruption in vessel traffic, such adverse effects are not likely to be large. Vessel transportation is of para mount importance for many industries on the Texas Gulf coast. The port of Galveston is a regional hub for maritime ac tivity; in 2003, the port of Galveston handled 3.43 million tons of shipped product, hosted 582 ships and 84 barges, and provided a port of call for 208 cruise ships that took 373,345 vaca tioners to Mexico and the Caribbe an (Board of Trustees of the Galveston Wharves, 2004). An oil spill can disrup t maritime commerce if it occurs in a shipping channel or port, or if the spill results in a moratorium on the use of watercraft in an effort to facilitate spill response. For example, on Ju ly 31, 1990, the Houston Shipping Channel was completely closed to traffic for 3 days following the Apex Barge-Greek Tank Vessel SHINOUSSA collision, after which only single-width barge tows were allowed to travel inbound. On August 3, the channel was opened to one-way traffic, alternating directions every 8 to 12 hours; 7 days later, the channel was clear and reopened to two-way traf fic (NOAA-HMRAD, 1992). Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or an increase in travel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities, as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue stream within the local economy falls. To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water o iling, some combination of spill response options can be expected to reduce the risk to vessel trans portation and ports in the Gulf of Mexico region. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium spill could affect up to 338 million m 2 and a large spill, up to 789 million m2 of surface water above recognized thresh olds (Table H.4.4-1). While these adverse Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-87 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills effects would affect the movement of cargo to and from ports, they will also affect th e entities that rely on this efficient flow of goods to and from th e coast. The scope of poten tial losses will depend on the location of the spill; however, there is the po tential to reduce any sort of impediment to the flow of goods by 10 to 20 percent when dispersants are applied, depending on the assumed recovery efficiency (45 percent vs. 80 percent). For a small spill regardless of response option, no large adverse effects on vessel transportation or ports are expected (Table H.4.4.-1), but there is some risk of adverse effects for medium and large spills. Therefore, the nature of the risk to vesse l transportation and ports will be a function of the location, area, and pattern of surf ace water oiling, as well as the ex tent of oiling in port areas. A medium spill in the North Texas Shelf would not generally be expected to result in large adverse effects; however, there is some risk of adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports for a large spill. While the risk to vessel transportation and ports of medium and large spills in the North Texas Shelf is limited, chemical dispersion would be expected to re duce this risk even further. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, chemical dispersion would be expected to decrease risk by 64 and 75 percent for a medium spill and by 10 and 20 percent for a large spill, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are modeled. To the exte nt that these represent reasonable proxy measures to reduce the risk of oiling port facilities along the en tire Gulf coast, the risk of port closures or the risk of other advers e effects, they will be further reduced with the addition of chemical dispersion. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, an d large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerable to oil spills because of both closures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to significant losses in revenue for the commercial fishing industry, as well as rel ated industries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from co mmercial fleets. In addition, oil spills can lead to the closure of fisheries, decrease demand for fish from affected waters because of actual or perceived taint, and instigate alterations to fishing pr actices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or decreases revenues. Large spills can potentially injure fish nursery grounds and impos e other risks that could reduce fish harvests in the longer term. Commercial fishing is an important economic ac tivity on the Texas Gulf coast. In 2000, approximately 73.8 million lb of shrimp were landed in Texas for a total value of $210 million, composing approximately 91 percent of the value of all commercial marine products landed in Texas (NMFS, 2002). According to Texas Oysters (TDA, 20 01), an association of local oyster harvesters, oyster landings have a $50 million impact on the Texas economy and account for 13 percent of the national supply of this shellfish. The Apex Barge-Greek Tank Vessel SHINOUSSA collision on Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-88 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills July 31, 1990 resulted in the closure of shellfish, shrimp, and finfish fisheries throughout Galveston Bay; although the ban on fin fishing lasted only a few days, the shellfish and shrimp fisheries were not reopened until September 2, 1990 (NOAA-HMRAD, 1992). To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water oiling, some combination of spill response options can be expected to reduce the risk to regionally important fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico region. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium sp ill could affect up to 338 million m2 and a large spill, up 789 million m2 of surface water above recognized threshol ds (Table H.4.4-1). While adverse effects would be felt directly by commercial fishermen, local income and employment in sectors tied to this industry could also be affected. The risk to commercial fisheries shrinks by 10 to 20 percent when dispersants are applied, depending on the assumed recovery efficiency (45 percent vs. 80 percent). For a small spill in the Gulf of Mexico region, the risk to commercial fisheries is negligible using the basic response scenario (Table H.4.4-1). Any adverse effects that occur, however, would be reduced with chemical dispersion. For a medium spill, the risk to commercial fisheries is likely to be greater than for a small spill, but the effects remain localized. A risk of economic loss to commercial fi sheries will occur when waters exceed relevant thresholds. For example, fishing ma y not be permitted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold of concern. This would result in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting adverse effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decreases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, spill effects on the commercial fishing economy may be less severe. The risks to commercial fisheries of a medium sp ill can be mitigated significantly with chemical dispersion. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the risk to resources essential to commercial fisheries is dramatically reduced by 64 and 80 percent, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are modeled. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk to commercial fisheries. A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in commercial fishing activities and revenues, as well as those of associated businesses. Again, to the extent that commercial fishing operations can, for a time, move to substitute fishing grounds, the po tentially severe effects of even a large spill may be avoided. With chemical dispersion the percentage of risk reduct ion for a large spill is not as dramatic as for a medium spill. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, chem ical dispersion could be expected to reduce the risk to commercial fisheries by approximately 10 and 20 percent, respectively. Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will no t generally be at the regional or national levels but could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commercial fishing activities, in square meters of surface water oiled above the corresponding threshold of concern. Coastal regions offer outdoor recreational activi ties that residents and visitors valu e. For example, in 1993 there were Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-89 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills more than 831,000 saltwater fishermen in Texas, ac cessing marine waters fr om piers, shallow wade fishing areas, private boats, and charter boats (B enefield, 2002). A subset of these fishermen would be affected in the wake of an oil spill su ch as the Apex Barge-Greek Tank Vessel SHINOUSSA collision that caused the closure of commercial fi sheries. Although these individuals may not see monetary losses, recreational fishermen's social welfare will likely be affected. For a small spill regardless of response option, adverse effects on recreational resources in the Gulf of Mexico region would likely be negligible (Table H.4.4-1). The risk to recreational fisheries for a medium spill is likely to be greater than for a sma ll spill. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanic al recovery and in situ burning when circumstances pe rmit), a medium spill in the North Texas Shelf will sweep approximately 338 million m2 of marine waters used by recreational fishermen. However, the risk to recreational fisheries can be mitigated significantly with chemical dispersion. With chemical dispersion a medium sp ill in the Texas Gulf coast will adversely affect approximately 86 million to 121 million m2 of marine waters in the spill area used by the recreational fishing industry above the corresponding thresholds of concern (Table H.4.4-1). At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the risk to resources essential to recreational fishing is dramatically reduced by 64 and 80 percent, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are modeled. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk to recreational fisheries. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill presents risk to approximately 789 million m 2 of the marine waters potentially important to recreational fishermen. Although chemical dispersion would mitigate the damages, the percentage of risk reduction for a large spill is not as dramatic as for a medium spill. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, chemical dispersion could be expe cted to reduce the risk to recreational fishing grounds by approximately 10 and 20 percent, respectively. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Gulf of Mexic o region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, an d large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills. Any adverse impact s are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Subsistence Potential adverse effects on marine species are a concern during spills wh ere traditional use of subsistence resources occurs. Inform ation on subsistence use of fish and shellfish in the Gulf of Mexico region is limited. While some residents may supplement their diets with these resources, subsistence is not known to be a prominent activi ty in this region, as compared to the Alaska region, where Native communities may suffer su bstantial economic and cultural losses due to contamination of subsistence seafood during an oil spill. Tissue tainting would be the primary concern for these subsistence resources. The North Texas Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the coastal habitats, fish, and wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico regi on. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse effects on subsistence resources. Potentia l adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Gulf of Mexico region are low for small, medium, and large spills (Table H.4.4-2). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-90 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Effects on subsistence resources for a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. Using mechanical-only recovery for a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure to dissolved aromatics to be at low concentrations (1- 100 ppb) and to only occur directly outside Galveston Bay. Sediment exposure was negligible. Tainting of fish and invertebrates becomes a concern when water concentrations exceed approximately 100 ppb (Section 4.3.5.6). A very small percentage of shoreline habitats we re oiled; therefore, a proportionally small percentage of subsistence resource s associated with these habitats ar e likely to be exposed. Using mechanical-only recovery for a large spill, the modeling results were similar to those of a medium spill for water column and sediment exposure, with the exception of higher concentrations (100 - 10,000 ppb) of dissolved aromatics occurring mostly in nearshore areas. Less than 1 percent of shoreline habitat was oiled. The risk scores in Table H.4.4-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates for subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill volumes (Section 4.3.5.6). Table H.4.4-2 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Subsistence Using the Basic Response Scenario with the Addition of Chemical Di spersion in the North Texas Shelf Spill Size Response Option (% dispersant efficiency) Resources Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) Basic 0-1 Source: Adapted from Part C of the tec hnical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the North Texas Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Gulf of Mexico region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 an d 80 percent efficiency for a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) in a more widespread area outside and within Galveston Bay and at high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in localized areas. Because of the increase in potent ial exposure to oil for water column resources and the decrease in potential exposur e for intertidal and shoreline resources, the risk scores did not change at either dispersant efficiency. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-91 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 pe rcent efficiency for a large spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low (1 -100 ppb) concentr ations, with higher (100- 1,000 ppb) concentrations in a larger area; at 80 percent efficiency, the results showed exposure at high (1 -10,000 ppb) concentrations co vering a larger area outside an d within Galveston Bay. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, shoreline oiling was reduced by 11 and 21 percent, respectively. A slightly higher percent of subsistence resources may be adversely affected at 80 percent efficiency than at 45 percent efficiency, but recovery should be rapid in either scenario. Although areas other than Galveston Bay in the Gulf of Mexico region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on subsistence resources will fall wi thin a similar range throughout the Gulf of Mexico region. While adverse effects on subsiste nce resources are not likely to be high on a regional level, they may be high on a local level. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subsistence resources in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alte rnative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spills, with or without dispersant use. For large spills, impacts are expected to be insignificant, but increase to minor with the addition of chemical dispersion at 80 percent efficiency. Historic Resources Under Alternative 1 using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), with or without the addition of chemical dispersion, adverse effects on historic resources in the Gulf of Mexico region would likely be negligible, regardless of spill size, (Section 3.4.8). Adverse effects on historic resour ces are expected to be low, rega rdless of spill volume or response option. Most historic sites in the Gulf of Mexico region are submerged shipwrecks located located 3 to 9 mi offshore in deepwater benthic habitats (Section 3.4.8), and therefore are not at risk of oiling due to depth. Some sites may be buried un der sediments on barrier islands, river channels, floodplains, and terraces, and possibly in the intertid al zone.There are limited data that identify long-term or chronic degradation to historic resources due to chemical dispersion. Results from several studies indicated that direct oiling caused negligible effects on cultural resources following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Bittner, 1996; Dekin, recove ry or mechanical recovery plus in situ burning may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, which will also reduce the amount of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to sensitive historic structures. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alte rnative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Recreation and Tourism The Texas Gulf coast offers a range of outdoor r ecreational activities that residents and visitors value. In 2000, there were 368 million person-days of travel logged in Texas; more than 20 percent of these visits were in the Galveston-Brazor ia-Houston area (Texas Tourism, 2001). Of all destinations along the Texas Gulf coast, this area attracts the most visitors and is second only to Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-92 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Dallas-Fort Worth area for number of visitors within the entire state of Texas (Texas Tourism, 2001). In 1993 there were more than 831,000 saltwater fishermen in Texas, accessing marine waters from piers, shallow wade fish ing areas, private boats, and ch arter boats (Benefield, 2002). In addition, several natural reserves surroundi ng the northern Gulf offer wildlife viewing opportunities, and millions of users come to the Te xas Gulf coast beach areas each year. In fact, 67 percent of visits to the Galveston-Brazoria-Houston area represented leisure travel, and 16 percent of leisure travelers participated in nature-based activities (Texas Tourism, 2001). Numerous beaches located along the Texas Gulf co ast offer recreational opportunities such as swimming, camping, boating, windsurfing, and bird watching. These beaches serve as the primary coastal tourist attraction and recreational outlet for residents and tourists; for example, rich in plants and wildlife, Galveston Island boasts 32 mi of sandy beachfront (GIC&VB, 2002). The island generated a large portion of the almost $480 million in tourism revenues for Galveston County in 2000 (Texas Tourism, 2002). Although less important in relative dollar terms to Texas tourism, other areas along the shoreline also offer a number of recreational opportunities. The Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, for example, offers visitors the oppor tunity to view some of the 300 bird species that inhabit the area (Texas Tourism, 2002). Port Lavaca also attracts bi rd enthusiasts, in addition to beach goers and recreational fishermen (Texas Tourism, 2002). The 1979 BURMAH AGATE spill in Galveston Bay led to the accumulation of tarballs on the shores of Padre Island, a popular vacation spot for beac h goers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimated that 8 bbl of oi l washed up on the shores of Padre Island. An additional 6 bbl of oil reached Smith Point and Ga lveston Island, key recreational areas for outdoor enthusiasts and bird watchers (NOAA-HMRAD, 1992). These consequences can affect the appeal of recreational areas, deterring beach goers and affectin g the abundance of wildlife. An oil spill would be expected to affect recreationists' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and economic implications of a spill would reach beyond direct effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue an d jobs (see Coastal Comm unities, Demography, and Employment above for more details). To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water o iling, some combination of spill response options can be expected to reduce the risk to recreation and tourism in the Gulf of Mexico region. For a small spill in the Gulf of Mexico region, the risk to recreation and touris m is negligible (Table H.4.4-1). In many cases, a spill of this size would be expected to pose no ri sk to shoreline resources because the spilled oil will never reach the shoreline above a threshold of concern. In addition, because of the small surface water area exposed to oil as a re sult of a small spill, water-based attractions such as beach visitation may experience little or no adverse effect (Table H.4.4-1). The risk to recreation and tourism for a medium spi ll is likely to be greater than for a small spill. However, when certain weather conditions and cu rrent patterns are combined with specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources at all or at levels above the selected threshold. For a medium spill in the North Texas Shelf, such conditions prevail in only 1 percent of modeled spills when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are modeled in the cleanup process. With dispersant application, the model indicates that fewer medium spills will reach shore. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, dispersants reduce th e number of medium spills reaching shore by 18 and 27 percent, respectively. For these spill events , no adverse effects are expected to the shoreline. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-93 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium spill in the Nort h Texas Shelf will have a spill area above the corresponding thresholds of co ncern that will adversely affect approximately 9,386 m of the recreational shoreline (Table H.4.4-1). Under th ese conditions, beaches in the spill area may be closed to visitors, and fishing and boating may not be permitted in waters exposed to oil, causing losses in revenue to the recreation and tourism sectors of the coastal economy. These effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, affecting tourism, recreation, employment opportunities, and associated revenues. The risk to recreation and tourism from a medium spill can be further mitigated significantly with chemical dispersion. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the risk to resources essential to recreation and tourism along the Texas Gulf coast is dramatically reduced by 50 and 66 percent, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are modeled. For a large spill, there is a substan tial risk to recreation and touris m. However, when certain weather conditions and current patterns are combined with sp ecific spill res ponse options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources at all or at le vels above the selected th reshold. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent effi ciency, the modeling results indicate a 1 percent reduction in the number of large spills that reach shore above a threshold of concern. For these spill events, no adverse effects on shoreline are expected. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill will adversely affect up to 28,531 m of sandy shoreline above recognized thresholds (Table H.4.4-1). While th ese adverse effects would directly affect the pleasure that coastal residents and visitors derive from coastal activities, they will also indirectly affect the economic contribution that recreational resources make to local income and employment. The length of sandy shoreline advers ely affected by a large spill falls by 10 to 20 percent when dispersants are applied, depending on the assumed recovery efficiency (45 percent vs. 80 percent). A large spill may cause significant decreases in tourism, recreation, and businesses revenues associated with these industries. With chemical dispersion the percentage of risk reduction for a large spill is not as dramatic as for a medium spill, but it is still significant. Although the elimination of the risk to shoreline-dependent activities is not possi ble for large spills, at 45 and 80 percent efficiency, chemical dispersion could be expected to reduce e ffects on recreation and tourism by approximately 10 and 20 percent, respectively. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Gulf of Mexico region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected fo r even the largest modeled spills. Any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public sa fety are defined as the risk to th e public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill. There are many ar eas in the Gulf of Mexico region with high-population concentrations along the coast. Howeve r, adverse effects on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or mo re statute mi offshore for any of the spill sizes considered, regardless Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-94 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills of the response options \u2014mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to protect the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the pub lic from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are re lated to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill response equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the worker certification and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The ri sk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. There are also protocols in place for the proper application and handling of dispersants. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), po tential regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Gulf of Mexico region un der Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. H.5. A LTERNATIVE 1 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE PACIFIC REGION For the purpose of this PEIS, the Pacific region c onstitutes the coastal area in which the states of California, Oregon, and Washington border the Pa cific Ocean (Figure 3.1-1). The location selected for modeling and risk assessment purposes was a site offshore of the entrance to San Francisco Bay because it is in a high-traffic area at greater risk of oil spills. Modeling results from this location were evaluated relative to the geographic area in Section E.1.2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), herein referred to as the Central California Sh elf. The Central California Shelf encompasses two biogeographical provinces: the Ce ntral California Coast and San Francisco Bay. In general, the site is representative of offshore sites throughout the region and provides a basis for the modeling of potential environmental effects. Th e results of the modeling \u2014used to evaluate spills of concern in this risk analysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore 1)\u2014are presented in detail in Part E of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and summarized in this section. Table H.5-1 presents the risk ranking for the mode ling of Alternative 1 in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) for three spill sizes (small, 200 bbl; medium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl ). The risk scores presented in the table are based on the modelin g results for an average spill and on regional considerations; however, in any sp ecific oil spill situation local c oncerns could be higher. Table H.5-2 summarizes the significance of the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 1 in the Pacific region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for an average spill to the region in general. Although dispersant pre-authorization agreement ar eas exist in the Pacific region (Figure 2.2-1), under the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) of Alternative 1 appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical dispersion; thus, chemical dispersion is not considered in the analysis of the Pacific region. Further, the modeling shows that in situ bu rning would not significantly change the level of concern identified from those obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. 1 Statute miles were used instead of nautical miles due to default options within the computer-modeling program (1 nm = 1.1508 statute mi). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-95 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For spills analyzed in this document (i.e., those that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore), using mechanical-only recovery there are likely to be mi nor or insignificant regional adverse impacts on all resources except for marine and coastal birds, whic h could be moderate, for a small spill, based on the speed with which such a spill would weather an d dissipate and the sma ll area that could be affected. For medium and large spills, adverse impacts are minor or insignif icant for all resources except for marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, intertidal habitats, and areas of special concern, which could be moderate. A large spill could also cause significant, but localized, short-term socioeconomic adverse impacts. These adverse impacts occur despite the treatment or recovery of some of the oil but are reduced by these actions when they are effective.

Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to water quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect wa ter quality are the soluble aromatics, MAHs (monoaromatic hydrocarbons) and PAHs (polynucle ar aromatic hydrocarbon s) (Section 4.3.1.1). Thus, evaluation of potential adverse effects is based on the degree of pot ential contamination by these compounds. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effect s on water quality are ge nerally low, whether a mechanical-only recovery or mechanical recovery plus in situ burning is employed. This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid dilution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column. During periods of extreme turbulence, oil generally mixes into the water column where aromatics may dissolve rapidly, but resurfacing and dilution of oil droplets result in only localized contamination at levels of concern unless the dilution volume is rest ricted. Overall based on the modeling and risk assessment results, it is concluded that\u2014using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) \u2014adverse water-quality effects under Alternative 1 would be low in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Pacific region. However, if the spill moved into shallow an d confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills un der conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence or in areas where oil coll ects for a few weeks to months after a spill. The variable used to determine potential water-quality effects is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentrat ion for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected wa ter volume increases with spill volume and varies with the level of physical dispersion during the time of the spill. Natural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of water that is c ontaminated above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of water contam inated increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume of water contamin ated for a small spill was extrapolated from the mean medium- and large-spill model results. The estimates of the volume of contaminated water \u2014 and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Pacific region because the mixing of oil into water and the pr ocess of dilution are si milar in all areas. Coastal San Francisco Bay is used as a representative of coastal water for analyzing the Central California Shelf, as well as the Pacific region. Sa n Francisco Bay is approximately 1,733 km 2 in area and about 5 m deep on average, with a total volume of approximately 8,665 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of the San Francisco Bay to determine the potential effects of small, medium, and large spills (Table H.5.1-1). This approach yields a very conservative estimate, in that it assumes that all water column contamination would occur in coastal water. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-98 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Table H.5.1-1 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Coastal Water Quality Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Central California Shelf Spill Size Volume of Water Contaminated (million m3) Area Contaminated (estimated %) Risk Score \u00a7 Small (200 bbl) < 41 \u00d7 10 - 6 5 \u00d7 10- 7 4E Medium (2,500 bbl) 66 0.8 4E Large (40,000 bbl) 385 4.4 4D Source: Adapted from Part E of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil may be incorporated into shallow water or intertid al sediments where, thro ugh leaching, it could become a continuing source of con tamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality wher e the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier I standards (beginning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concern to water quality would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have an insignificant infl uence on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would appl y whether either response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spills, and minor for large spills. Marine In marine waters, which are 3 or more statute mi offshore, mechanical recovery and in situ burning currently may be used for spill response in the Paci fic region; although dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in the Pacific region (Figure 2.2-1), chemical dispersion is not used because appropriate response times cannot currently be met. As was done for coastal waters, the estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concer n (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of the reference area, the Central California Shelf. The Central California Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters in the Pacific region. The total surface area of the Central California Shelf is approximately 16,639 km 2, so the area of interest is much vaster for marine waters than for coastal waters. Water- quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water \u201430 m deep, which is much shallower than most of the Pacific region 's marine waters. The results for the selected Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-99 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills modeling location (Table H.5.1-2) represent conservative estimates of adverse water-quality effects using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit).

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Natural dispersion of the oil would be very rapid after a spill, and recovery time would be on the order of hours to days. Leaching from oil contam ination reaching the sediments would not have a large effect on marine water quality because of the large dilution volume and natural dispersing forces in marine waters. The results would apply whether a mechanical response is implemented. Since in situ burning would replace some of the mechanical response, and both methods remove oil that would otherwise result in water contamination, th e potential water-quality effects would not change significantly if in situ burning was used. For a spill in water deeper than the 30 m evaluated here, the potential adverse effects would be even smaller. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine water quality in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignif icant for small, medium, and large spills. Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an oil spill on air quality may involve all vol atile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are normally very localized and short lived for small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any po tential adverse effects: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-100 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The modeling shows that results do not vary by sp ill location, or size in the Pacific region. Two possible sources of contamination to the atmosphere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilization of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). The results of the modeling spills sh ow that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-only recovery; hence, the risk scores are virtually identical for small, medium, and large spills. Volatilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill site. Evaporation off th e water surface and volatilization from the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocarbon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentrations in the atmos phere at the water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmo sphere would be on the order of days. Thus, a low level of concern is expe cted for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical-only recovery. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via burning. For small spills , it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feas ible (Table H.5.1-3). The maximum area potentially exceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km 2 for a medium spill and 11.1 km2 for a large spill If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wild life) are within these areas, they could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, a regi on of interest equivalent to th e Central California Shelf (16,639 km2) would have less than 1 percent of the area adversel y affected, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. Thus, low levels of concern are expected from small, medium, and large oil spills involving in situ burning (Table H.5.1-3).

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on air quality in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without in situ burning. H.5.2. Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) are found throughout the Pacific region (Section 3.5.2.1, Table F.5-1) and spend their entire lives at sea. Their concentrations vary depending on seasonal migrations. Pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) are carnivorous aquatic mammals that spend the majority of their lives swimming and eating in water but venture on to land to bear their young, sunbathe, and molt. There are six pinnipeds of conc ern in the Pacific region that use the Channel Islands and other less-populated islands off central California as breeding-birthing grounds. These pinnipeds haul out and give birth to pups during the late-spring to mid-summer months. Thus, the severity and likelihood of adversel y affecting these animals increases if an event occurs during the spring through mid-summer. The greatest risk of adverse effects would be related to surface and shoreline oiling that occurs in breeding or molting areas. The California sea otter ( Enhydra lutris nereis) is the only species of fur-bearing marine mammal inhabiting this region, and its range is localized to an area extending from Half Moon Bay to Morro Bay. Females and pups are often found rafting in large groups, while males tend to remain in separate groups except during the mating season. Marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, seals, an d manatees are vulnerable to spilled oil since they spend considerable time at the wate r's surface, which increases possible contact with oil. The majority of these species remains offshore, and populations va ry according to season and migration directions. Cetaceans appear able to detect and are likely to av oid floating oil or oil being recovered by mechanical means (Geraci, 1990). Studies have shown that cetacean skin is nearly impenetrable to even the highly volatile constituents of oil, indic ating that contact with oil probably would be less harmful to cetaceans than often believed. Howeve r, the toxic, volatile fractions in fres h crude oils could irritate and damage cetacean soft tissues, such as the mucous membranes of the eyes and airways. Marine mammals that are more commonly found in the nearshore regions and intertidal habitats, such as seals, sea lions, and sea otters, are of gre ater concern. Their use of restricted haulout areas and instinctual behavior to return to the same br eeding area every year may increase the likelihood of physical contact with oil in the event of a nearby spill. Potent ial concerns include toxicity from ingestion of oil during grooming and adverse effects on juveniles through contact with contaminated teats when nursing. Overall, the potential adverse effects depend on the spill size and the number and species of marine mammals present. Based on the habitat availability in the Central Calif ornia Shelf, the equivalent area for 100 percent mortality for a medium spill is less than 0.001 pe rcent of the reference ar ea for cetaceans, 0.007 percent for pinnipeds, and 0.54 percent for fur-bear ing marine mammals (sea otters). For a large spill these values increase to 0.003, 0.04, and 2.9 percent, respective ly. Clearly, the overall risk to marine mammals is driven by the risk to sea otters. Pinnipeds could also come into contact with oil on the shoreline. Estimated average shoreline leng th oiled is approximately 18 km for a medium spill and 45 km for a large spill. The likelihood that these lengths would actually involve a pinniped haulout area is low, but also represents a potenti ally medium risk (see the discussion on intertidal habitats). Based on the distribution of mammals in the Pacific region, the potential level of concern was determined to be low for small spills but wo uld increase to medium levels for medium and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-102 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills large spills. The results of the modeling for mari ne mammals for the Central California Shelf are presented in Table H.5.2-1. The addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse consequences nor increase risk to marine mammals. On-water effects are negligible except for sea otters, and s horeline oiling may potentially reach medium levels of severity, depending on the time of year and lo cation of the spill. If mortality did occur, however, the population would probably require 1 to 3 years (f or a small spill) to 3 to 7 years (for a medium or large spill) to recover.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine mammals in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be minor for small spills, and moderate for medium and large spills. Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds are usually of highest concern during an oil spill because birds are highly susceptible to the acutely toxic effects from exposure to oil. Adverse effects on birds in the Pacific region would result mostly from surface water oiling in nearshore and offshore areas where rafting seabirds concentrate, as well as oi ling of beaches, mud flats , marshes, and estuarine waters used by shorebirds, waterfowl, wading birds, and raptors (Section 3.5.2.2) (see Section 4.3.2.2 for information on the main issues of conc ern for birds exposed to an oil spill). The Central California Shelf was selected for the mo deling as representative of the coastal habitats and wildlife in the Pacific region (Table H.5. 2-2). Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the potential adverse effects on birds. Potential levels of concern for birds in the Central California Shelf are medium for all spill sizes, as discussed below. However, for a small spill very little oil is likely to strand onshore in staging areas, and the natural removal rates are high along the outer co ast. The potential for adverse effects increases for medium and large spills, with greatest concern fo r conditions where the more sheltered interior Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-103 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills wetlands and tidal flats become he avily oiled and surface oiling occurs in areas where rafting birds congregate. Two Western Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) sites (one hemispheric and one regional), one Ramsar site (a wetland of international importance), and two National Wildlife Refuge sites occur in the Central California Shelf. The presence of these sites indicates that large numbers of shorebirds (WHSRN sites) and wetland birds (Ramsar sites) concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. Extrapolated total monthly populations of 1.4 to 1.6 million seabirds comprising over 100 species have been observed at sea along the northern and central California coast, and 0.70 to 0.85 million seabirds may be nesting in the area with high concentrations on offshore islands. Over 1.5 m illion shorebirds have been observed in San Francisco Bay and environs during the migratory and wintering period. Therefore, if this area were oiled during important staging, nesting, or nearshore rafting periods regional adverse effects would probably be high. Thus, the risk factor rankings were determin ed based on the possibility that a large number of birds may be concentrated both in marine water and on shoreline habitats that are significantly oiled. It is important to recognize that adverse effects on birds may be more or less severe depending on the time of year and locations of their habitats, as well as the extent of shoreline and surface water oiling.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on birds in the Central California Shelf for a small spill were determined by extrapolating from the results obtained for a medium spill. The volume of oil released in the small spill was approximately an order of magnitude less than in the medium spill; therefore, the adverse effects on the bird population were estimated to be propor tionally less but still medium because of the recovery time. The modeling of effects on birds for a medium spill under mechanical-only recovery resulted in estimates of over 5 to 10 percent of the regional bird population being potentially affected because a high percentage of beaches used as shoreb ird staging habitats were o iled. Also, surface water oiling (121.5 km 2) directly outside of San Francisco Bay an d around the Farallon Islands corresponded to an area of high seabird biomass year-round. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-104 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The modeling of effects on birds for a large spill un der mechanical-only recovery resulted in estimates of over 20 percent of the regional bird population being potentially affected because sand beaches and tidal flats used by staging shoreb irds were heavily oiled. The mean water area swept by oil above a threshold of 10 microns was 659 km2, which represents 4 percent of the total Central California Shelf and includes the same area of high seabird biomass outside of San Francisco Bay oiled for a medium spill. The risk scores in Table H.5.2-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates of 1 to 3 years for most bird species, as was the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2). Although areas other than the Central California Shelf in the Pa cific region were not mo deled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on bird populations will fall within a similar range throughout the Pacific region. The addition of in situ burning does not change the signif icance of these adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these groups are of high concern. As described in Section 4.3.2.3, plankton and fish are adversely affe cted either directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil droplets mixed by wa ves into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is direct upta ke of dissolved oil components, originating directly from surface oil or dissolving from the mi croscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, as spill size increases, so do adverse effects. However, there is great variability related to the environmental conditions after a spill; plankt on and fish suffer much more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather. Species and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic components, with species from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stable locations being more sensitive than those from polluted and environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposures during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floating oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapidly di sperse to background levels. However, there may be longer-term effects if the spill migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands where dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Fish are particularly abundant in kelp beds in the nearshore, so these areas, along with salt marshes and seagrass beds, are of most concern. California grunion ( Leuresthes tenuis ) spawns in the intertidal zone; thus, it is particularly vuln erable to oil reaching the shoreline (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 1 in most cases, chemical dispersion could not Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-105 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills be used within 3 nm1 of shore, but the dispersed oil plume could be transported by currents into this area. The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by oil spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percent loss multiplied by volume ex posed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes were translated to equivalent areas by multiplying by water depth at the spill site, allowing comparison with other resources, such as birds and shorelines, which are distributed on a per-ar ea basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniforml y distributed when expressed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by the simila r results for the four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, o ffshore Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively, of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) \u2014the equivalent areas of adverse ef fect on plankton and fish (both average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in this PEIS. The modeled sp ill site was in 30 m deep water: adverse effects would be smaller for deeper waters because of gr eater vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionately greate r in shallower waters because of the restricted dilution potential. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much smaller. Thus, th e model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortalit y of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes am ong response scenarios. The Central California Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the Pacific region (Table H.5.2-3). The adverse effects were estimated as a percentage of the total area of concern (16,639 km 2). Based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality would be affected for a small spill (Table H.5.1-2), the volume of adverse effects on plankton and fish would be low for a small spill using the basic respon se scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.5.2-3). 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-106 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery ti me would be less than 1 year. Over all, based on the modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Pacific regi on under Alternative 1 wo uld be localized to the immediate area around the spill site and similar in all marine water ar eas of the region. For large spills that might move rapidly into shallow coastal areas due to winds and currents, the concentrations of toxic components might be high enough to cause some level of concern for water column communities, especially early life history stages of fish and inverteb rates using intertidal and shallow subtidal areas. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Intertidal Habitats Intertidal habitats are always of great concern during oil spills. Although much of the Pacific region can be characterized as exposed rocky shores, grav el beaches, and sand be aches with high natural removal rates, there are numerous estuaries that provide important habitats for a wide range of marine species (Section 3.5.2.4). These estuaries contain extensive areas of salt marshes and tidal flats that are at high risk of long-ter m damage from oil spills. For a discussion of the relative ranking of the sensitivity of intertidal habitats to spilled oil and the processes affecting oil fate and behavior on shorelines, see the explanation of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) in Section 4.3.2.4. Shoreline protection is seldom effective in these areas of large tides and strong currents. There are few effective cleanup methods for these sensitive habitats; thus, natural recovery is often the primary response. Effects on fish and wildli fe will persist during this recove ry period, which can be slow in the sheltered estuarine setting. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. The time of year of a spill is also an extremely important factor. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-107 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills In the Pacific region, adverse effects of small spills on intertidal habitats ar e low because very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and natural removal rates are high along the outer coast. However, the potential for adverse effects increases with spill volume, with the greatest concern for conditions where the more sheltered interior wetlands and tidal flats become heavily oiled. The results of the modeling for intertidal habitats for the Central California Shelf are presented in Table H.5.2-4.

Calculations are based on the appropriate po rtions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representati ve of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats for a small spi ll were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting that rocky intertidal communities would recover within 1 to 3 years (Section 4.3.2.4). For a medium spill unde r mechanical-only recovery, the modeling resulted in an estimated 17.1 km of oiled shoreline. This is less than 1 percent of the total shoreline in the area, but a high percentage of the rocky shores was affect ed. For a large spill, the modeling resulted in an estimated 45 km of oiled shoreline. This oiled area represents less than 1 percent of the entire shoreline area in the region, but a high percentage of the important outer rocky shores in the San Francisco Bay would be affected. A large spill woul d also likely affect more of the sensitive and sheltered tidal flats that have longer recovery times; thus, the risk score increased to reflect the longer recovery rate of oiled ti dal flats and wetlands. Although areas other than the Central California Shelf in the Pacific region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS, and it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on intertidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Pacific region. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be minor for small spills, and moderate for medium and large spills. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-108 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Subtidal Habitats The subtidal benthic habitat consists of the bottom substrate below the low tide level, as well as the species that live in, on, and near the substrate. This benthic community includes areas of live, sandy, muddy, and low-relief bottoms; subsurface canyons; and pinnacles. Organisms living \u2014include corals, plants and seagrasses, benthic invertebrates (such as crabs, shrimp, snails, bivalve mollusks, and marine wo rms), and bottom-dwelling fish. Because subtidal benthic communities do not include the intertidal zone, they are at little risk from floating oil because, by definition, this environment is always below the surface. Kelp forests are an exception because the fronds extend all the way to the surf ace. The greatest risk of exposure comes from sinking oil, as well as in situ burn residue, or dispersed oil or the sorption of naturally dispersed or mechanically mixed oil that has become suspended on sediments and is deposited onto the ocean floor. However, significant natural dispersion of oil and sediment into the water column only occurs during large storms or for nearshore oil spills. Oil particles could adhere to bottom substrate, plants, or animals, which could result in both physical coating of organisms, as occurred in the 1993 BRAER spill in the Shetland Islands, and toxi c effects from exposure to the chemical constituents (Section 4.3.2.5). Su ch adverse effects are not normally observed. Floating oil does represent a risk to kelp, especially in nearshore areas and in protected areas where oil may accumulate. Damage to the plants can occur in such areas, and animals living in the canopy may be affected. The low degree of risk to subtidal habitats is attributed to the diluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate rather than dissolve, and the rapid dilu tion of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil residue pote ntially reaching the bottom substrate. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. It mi ght slightly increase the risk of remaining oil residues sinking to the bottom. Residual oil from in situ burning that reaches the bottom is expected to have little or no adverse effects on subtidal habitats since the majority of its toxic components would have either evaporated or been destroyed during burning and the volume of residue produced is so small (Section 4.3.2.5) . Under the modeled conditions, the quantity of in situ burn residue produced would not result in a level of concern that exceeds low. For a medium spill with mechanical-only recovery, the sediment threshold concentrations for dissolved aromatic and for total hydrocarbons were not exceeded. For a large spill only the sediment threshold for total hydrocarbon exposure was exceeded, but only in an area of less than 0.006 percent of the total reference area, and less than 0.06 percent of San Francisco Bay. Benthic habitat was also assumed to be at risk if th ere threshold of concern for dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons affected stationary demersal species (those living at the sediment-water interface). With mechanical-only recovery less than 0.01 percent of the Central California Shelf was affected by water column concentrations above the threshold for a medi um spill. For a large spill, the percentage increased to approximately 0.01 percent. The results for the se lected modeling location (Table H.5.2-4) represent estimates of adverse impacts on subtidal habitats using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit).

Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subtidal habitats in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Areas of Special Concern The potential effects on areas of special concern, such as National Marine Sanctuaries, National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, and National Estuarine Research Reserves, are important during an oil spill since these areas are under increased scru tiny and protection. Wh ereas most coastal and nearshore areas have a wide range of habitats or ar e very similar to other areas throughout the Pacific region, areas of special concern are set aside for their uniqueness (Appendix F, Tables F.5-4 through F.5-6 and Figures F.5-4 through F.5-6). The pote ntial risks and adverse effects associated with shoreline areas of special concern are identical to those discussed above for intertidal habitats. The risks to subtidal areas, such as those included in kelp forests in National Marine Sanctuaries, are identical to those discussed above for subtidal habitats. For this analysis, the risks to areas of special concern are assumed to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Sections H.5.2.), whichever are greater. Since the risk to intertidal ha bitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on data presented for a me dium spill, the estimated average extent of shoreline oiling is 18 km; this figure increases to 45 km for a large sp ill. The potential risk of surface oil reaching a shoreline associated with an area of special concern is low in the Pacific region because of the number and scattered locations of these areas. Th e potential adverse effects on areas of special concern are low for a sm all spill, but become medium for medium and large spills because of increased shoreline contam ination (Table H.5.2-5). Since areas of special concern are scattered along the Pacific coast, it is unlikely that they will be disproportionately adversely affected by an average spill. If an area of special concern were Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-110 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills seriously adversely affected, it is anticipated that the recovery time for the affected area would be the same as for other intertidal habitats. These areas are most at risk from floating oil and benefit from any actions that reduce potential oiling. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), pote ntial regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be minor for small spills, and moderate for medium and large spills, based on the risk to intertidal habitats.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. H.5.3. Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, and Candidate Species The Pacific region has a variety of threatened, enda ngered, and candidate species (Section 3.5.3). In this region. The overall risk that a threatened, endangered, or candidate species would be adversely affected, or even present in the area of a spill is low; however, killing a single individual of such a species can be considered a severe effect. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, or fish that are threatened, enda ngered, or candidate species are identical to those discussed in Section H.5.2. for these groups. Po tential adverse effects on mollusks were described above in subtidal habitats. In addition, poten tial adverse effects on the four threatened or endangered species of sea turtles were discusse d in Section 4.3.3.1 and are similar to those described in Section H.5.2. (Marine Mammals) for pinnipeds. Overall, the highest risk scores were calculated for coastal and marine birds and for ma rine mammals with other species at lower risk. Regardless of the species, the leve l of concern for threatened, endangered, or candidate species is higher; therefore, any adverse effects on the reprod uction or survival of these species, or death, should be considered high. Adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or cand idate species in the Pacific region for any spill size are difficult to predict. Depending on the location and season, the number and type of species present will vary. Based on the overall size of the Pacific region and the low populations of threatened, endangered, or candidate species inhabiting this regi on, the likelihood of adversely affecting an individual of concern would be low unless the spill affects important shoreline or critical marine habitats. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-111 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medi um, and large spills, based on the risk to marine mammals and to marine and coastal birds. H.5.4. Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat Virtually all waters in the Pacific region out to the limits of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are considered Essential Fish Habitat (EFH), including most of the continental shelf. Areas such as bays, river mouths, and harbors are designated EFH for at least one life stage of at least one species and are protected by legislation (Section 3.5.4). The primary issue with respect to EFH is either (1) exposure of sensitive resources in the water column to hydrocarbon concentrations of concern, or (2) the contamination of bottom sediments, both of which could lead to either acute or chronic exposures. Adverse effects would include either the death of individual organisms, the possibility of sublethal effects affecting long-term population viability, or de gradation of habitat that reduces its availability to managed species. For this analysis, the risks to EFH are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Section H.5.2.), whichever are greater. The results for plankton and fish and for subtidal habitats indica te only small effects and form the basis for the EFH risk score. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the consequences. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, based on the risk to plankton and fish and to subtidal habitats. H.5.5. Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Section 4.3.5, oil spills can pr oduce a variety of adverse social and economic effects. These adverse effects are generally not la rge when measured at the regional level, but instead are typically felt in comm unities located near resources oile d by the spill. Specifically, large adverse effects are generally limited to those indu stries and populations that are affected by the spill. Some of the most visible and significant ef fects are likely to be on water- and shore-based recreation; commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing; and the overall well-being of the residents of coastal communities in the Pacific re gion. The state parks along the Pacific coast draw tourists, and local residents depend on these natural resources as re creational outlets. In 2000, there were approximately 4 million visitors to San Francisco area state parks (Visit California, 2002) and an additional 19 million visitors to the national park system in the San Francisco area (NPS, 2001b). Commercial fishing is an im portant economic activity for the states along the Pacific coast, generating close to $ 330 million in landings in 2001 (NMFS, 2004a). This modeling considers the risk of adverse socioec onomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreation al activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceived taint; closure of commercial fishing grounds or hatcheries; and oiling of marine resources important to low-income and minority communities or populations that practice subsistence. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills can have secondary effects on social and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may cause changes in employment and firm revenues of resource-based businesses. While these effects are not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and relative measures of the overall risk of adverse social and economic effects of small, medium, and large spills using the basic Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-112 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills response scenario (current levels of mechanical and in situ burning when circumstances permit) in the Pacific region. (Although dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in the Pacific region [Figure 2.2-1], appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical dispersion.) The methodology is described in more detail in the Atlantic Region (Section H.2.5.). There is no existing standard for \"significance\" related to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface water must be oiled to be considered a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the effect will depend on a numb er of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, loca l), opportunities for resource substitution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of little concern if it is no t of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the modeled effects under all modeled scenar ios would likely be low at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that occur would be expected to be localized in nature. This modeling assumes that the risk posed by o il spills to the socioeconomic environment is directly related to the extent to which resour ces are affected above selected thresholds of concern \u2014meters of recreational beach oiled and square meters of marine waters oiled. Comparing the absolute risk of adverse socioeconomic effect s (e.g., meters of sandy shoreline oiled above a recreational threshold of concer n) across spill scenarios, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understanding of the relative risk of adverse socioeconomic effects across these scenarios. In this section, only basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances pe rmit) results are examined. Determining relative risk also allows for extrapolation of site-specific results to the entire region. For example, the risk estimates presented below are based on modeled hypothetical spills affecting the San Francisco Bay. While any given spill may exhibit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic effect, the relative risk measures are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations along the Pacific coast, as long as the spills occur in areas in where mechanical recovery and/or in situ burning are feasible. In addition, the conclusions reached for the Sa n Francisco Bay modeled area are supported by results from other areas \u2014the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assumptions across spill size is similar in magnitude. Table H.5.5-1 highlights the effects of small, me dium, and large oil spills on the Pacific region's resources by presenting estimates of resources oi led as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute (length of shoreline oiled or area of oiled surface water above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of the total resource base in the modeled area (Central California Shelf). The threshold of concern from oiled shoreline is 10 g/m 2 and from oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). The resource area is based on an estimate of the extent to which the coastal community in the Central California Shelf potentially relies on each resource in this sp ecific modeled area.

For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life potentially affected by an oil spill. Absolute and relative risks are discussed for coastal communitie s, demography, and employment; general economic status of a coastal community; vessel transportation and ports; commercial and recreational fisheries; subsistence; historic resources; recreation and tourism; and public safety and worker health. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Coastal communities benefit from and rely on the marine environment to provide residents with sustenance, livelihoods, leisure op portunities, and shipping avenues. Individuals who live and work in close proximity to the coast derive both soci al and economic rewards from the natural beauty, recreational opportunities, quality of life, economic resources, and cultural attributes associated with these coastal locations. These rewards are derived from assets such as National Parks, public beaches, fishing opportunit ies, and commercial and tourism-related industries. Thus, oil spills can adversely affect multiple asp ects of a coastal community's economy, culture, and quality of life. These effects, in turn, ca n impose changes on an affected community's demographics and employment patterns. In addition to the direct employment and other economic effects associated with oil spills on marine reso urce-based sectors, su ch spills can generate secondary effects on coastal communities. For ex ample, because of its large population and the importance of maritime activities to various Pacific coast communities, the Pacific region is at risk of experiencing the adverse effects of an oil sp ill. To the extent that me chanical recovery and in situ burning can reduce shoreline oiling and the geog raphic scope of water oiling, these response options will act to reduce effects on these coastal communities with a more diverse economic base. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-114 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The risk of social and economic losses occurs in areas of both sandy shoreline and marine waters that exceed the thresholds of concern. For exampl e, beaches along the Pacific coast may be closed to visitors and fishing may not be permitted in wate rs exposed to oil, causing losses in revenue to both the tourism and commercial fishery sectors of the coastal economy. These effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the spill area, ca using short-term decreases in employment opportunities, income, the viability of associated busine sses, and the appeal of coastal living. In addition, an oil spill may reduce the appeal of coastal living in a given area. For a small spill along the Pacific coast, there is no risk of large adverse effects on coastal communities. In many cases, a spill of this size wo uld be expected to pose no risk to shoreline or surface water resources because the spilled oil w ill never reach the thresh old of concern (Table H.5.5-1). The risk to coastal communities for a medium spill is likely to be greater than for a small spill. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium spill in the San Francisco Bay will have a spill area 1 above the corresponding threshold of concern that will adversely affect approximately 5,993 m of shoreline and sweep approximately 421 million m2 of marine waters used for recreation and by the commercial fishing industry, respectively (Tab le H.5.5-1). A large spill would affect 14,232 m of sandy shoreline and 672 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.5.5-1). A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in tourism, recreation, associated business activities and revenues, commercial fishing, and quality of coastal living. However, when certain weather conditions and current patterns are combined with specific spill respon se options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources either at all or at levels above the selected thre shold. For medium and large spills along the Pacific coast, such conditions prevail 10 and 7 percent of the time, respectively, based on the modeled spills when the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) is used in the cleanup process. For these spill events, no adverse effects on shoreline are expected. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, industri es, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affected by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer direct and indirect adverse economic effects from an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease revenue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisherie s, by both the anglers themselves and by related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated enti rely. Tourism and associat ed businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal area s decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived resource taint. 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas poten tially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-115 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills A small spill that is 3 or more statute mi offshore would have essentially no adverse effect on either the local or regional economy (Table H.5.5-1). There is little to no risk of oiling of economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any commercial or recreational fisheries would be affected. A medium spill, with mechanical recovery and in situ burn operations, could be expected to have short-term economic adverse effects as a result of oiled recreational beaches, closed fisheries and recreational areas, and by the need to supplem ent the normal response operation employment base, especially if shoreline oiling occurs. A large spill's adverse economic effects could be high for the local economy, even with mechanical recovery and in situ burning, based on the anticipated level of shoreline oiling and the possibility that closures of commercial and recreational fishing grounds will occur. In addition, the potential level of shoreline oiling would require a much larger cleanup effort. While the adverse effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, could cause adverse socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore are not likely to cause large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports; any adverse effects would likely be of short duration. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commer ce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft move ment as a means of facilitating spill response. Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or increase in tr avel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. Although the possibility exists for the affected area's trade partners to be adversely affected by interru ptions in marine transportation in the spill area, the availability of substitute means of transportati on, sources of goods, and products indicates that any closures would be unlikely to generate large adverse effects outside of the spill area. Vessel transportation is of paramount importance for the retail, wholesale, and manufacturing industries along the Pacific coast. Cargo ships carrying goods to and from international production facilities in Asia Pacific rely on quick and easy a ccess to West Coast storage facilities. During the West Coast longshoremen's dispute of 2002, it wa s estimated that a 10-day closure of these ports from a strike would cost the U.S. economy more than $19 billion; an estimated 40 percent of U.S. waterborne trade passes through West Coast ports (Nyhan, 2002). If an oil spill were to cause a port closure along the West Coast, the costs would not be as severe as those associated with this strike event, given that there would be alternative ports of call. However, the magnitude of damage caused by such a closure does highlight the importan ce of the free flow of goods into and out of all ports in the Pacific region. For a small spill, no large adverse effects on vessel transportation or ports are expected (Table H.5.5-1), but there is some risk of adverse effe cts from medium or large spills. Therefore, the nature of the risk to vessel transportation and ports will be a function of the location, area, and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-116 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills pattern of surface water oiling, as well as the extent of oiling in port areas. Medium or large spills along the Pacific coast, however, would not generally be expected to result in large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports. Any adverse effects would likely be short lived \u2014that is, even if shipping waters or ports are exposed to oil and ar e therefore closed, as soon as recovery efforts remove surface oil, these facilities would be expected to be reopened. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerab le to oil spills because of both closures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to high revenue losses for the commercial fishing industry, as well as related indu stries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from commercial fleets. Commercial fishing is an important economic activity for the states along the Pacific coast, gene rating close to $330 million in revenues in 2001; Washington and California generated more than 70 percent of this total (NMFS, 2004a). In addition, oil spills can lead to a decreased demand for fish from affected wa ters because of actual or perceived taint and can instigate alterations to fishing practices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or decreases revenues. For a small spill in the Pacific region, the risk to commercial fisheries is negligible using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.5.5-1). For a medium spill, the risk to commercial fisheries is likely to be greater than for a small spill, but the effects remain loca lized. A medium spill along the Pacific coast will sweep approximately 421 million m 2 of marine waters used by the commercial fishing industry above the corresponding threshold of concern (Table H. 5.5-1). A risk of economic loss to commercial fisheries will occur when waters exceed relevant management and/or risk-based thresholds. For example, fishing may not be perm itted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold of concern, resulting in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting adverse effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decreases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, spill effects on the commercial fishing economy may be less severe. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk to co mmercial fisheries. A large spill presents risk to approximately 672 m 2 of marine waters potentially important to commercial fisheries above the corresponding threshold of concer n (Table H.5.2-4.). A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in local commercial fishing activities and revenues. These declines may spill over to create additional adverse effect s on businesses associated with th e commercial fishing sector. To the extent that commercial fishing operations can, for a time, move to substitute fishing grounds, the potentially severe adverse effects of even a large spill may be avoided. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-117 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will no t generally be at the regional or national level but could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commercial fishing activities, in square meters of surface water oiled above the corresponding threshold of concern. The effects of an oil spill on recreational fishery-related activities will be felt more heavil y by various populations, in cluding recreational anglers and firms that supply goods and services to recr eational anglers. For example, recreational anglers fish for pleasure or sport, as opposed to monetary ga in. In the wake of an oil spill, such anglers may choose to fish at a substitute location, experience a reduced quality of experience, or choose to forgo fishing entirely. The losses suffered will be related to these missed opportunities. In addition, while closing waters to recreational fishing will decrease th e social welfare of recreationists, it would also be expected to affect the demand for boat rentals and other services consumed by fishing enthusiasts. Recreational fishermen caught an estimated 34. 8 million fish along the Pacific coast in 2001. California's recreational fishing activity was larger than that in Oregon and Washington: California recreational fishermen caught 24. 7 million fish in 2001, while Oregon and Washington recreational fishermen caught 10.1 million (NMFS, 2001). For a small spill, adverse effects on recreational fishing resources in the Pacific region would likely be negligible (Table H.5.5-1). The risk to recre ational fishing for a medium spill is likely to be greater than for a small spill. Using the basic res ponse scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a me dium spill along the Pacific coast will sweep approximately 421 million m 2 of marine waters used for recreational fishing above the corresponding thresholds of co ncern (Table H.5.5-1). The risk of economic loss will occur in fishery waters that exceed these thresholds. For ex ample, fishing may not be permitted in waters exposed to oil, causing losses for boat rental companies and other establishments associated with recreational fishing. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk to local recreational fishing waters. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill presents ri sk to approximately 672 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.5.5\u00ad 1). A spill of this size may caus e decreases in recreational fishin g activities and revenues, spilling over into sectors that depend on strong demand for recreational fishing goods and services. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affect ed for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Subsistence Potential adverse effects on marine species are a concern during spills wh ere traditional use of subsistence resources occurs. Salm on and intertidal shellfish have been the major species gathered for subsistence in the Pacific region in recent times (Section 3.5.5.5). Tissue tainting would be the primary concern for these subsistence resources. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-118 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The Central California Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the coastal habitats, fish, and wildlife in the Pacific region. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse effects nor increase risk to subsistence resources. Potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Pacific region are low for small, medium, or large spills (Table H.5.5-2). Effects on subsistence resources for a small spill were determined to be small by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. For a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure to dissolved aromatics to be at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) and to only occur in a small area directly outside of San Francisco Bay. Tainting of fish and invertebrates becomes a concern when water concentrations exceed approximately 100 ppb (Section 4.3.5.6). Sediment exposure also only occurred in a few small areas. Less than 1 percent of shoreline was oiled, including subsistence resources associated with shoreline and intertidal habitats.

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. For a large spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low concentrations (1 - 100 ppb) in a more widespread area and for higher concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in localized, mostly offshore, areas. Sediment exposure also oc curred in very few areas. The modeling estimated that less than 1 percent of shoreline and intertidal resources were exposed to oil. The risk scores in Table H.5.5-2reflect the predicted recovery rates fo r subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill sizes (Section 4.3.5.6). Although areas other than the Central California Shelf in the Pacific region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected th at the severity of adve rse effects on subsiste nce resources will fall within a similar range throughout the Pacific region. While adverse effects on subsistence resources are not likely to be high on a regional level, they may be high on a local level. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subsistence resources in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-119 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Historic Resources Under Alternative 1 using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), adverse effects on historic resources in the Pacific region would likely be negligible, regardless of spill size. (Section 3.5.5.8). Historic structures on land are numerous, and a large number of submerged shipwrecks occur in nearshore waters. Results from severa l studies indicated that direct oiling caused negligible effects on historic resources following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Bittner, 1996; Dekin, 1993; 95). Mechanical-only recovery or mechanical re covery plus in situ burning may help reduce the amount of oil that stra nds on the shoreline, which will also reduce the amount of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to sensitive archaeological sites and historic structures. Offshore historic resources are not at risk of becoming oiled. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Recreation and Tourism Coastal regions offer outdoor recreational activities that residents and visitors value. For example, in 2000 there were approximately 4 million visitors to San Fr ancisco area state parks (Visit California, 2002) and an additional 19 million visito rs to the national park system in the San Francisco area (NPS, 2001b). An oil spill along the Paci fic coast has the potential to affect visits to National Parks. In addition to the parks that coul d be threatened by an o il spill, the beaches along the Pacific coast, such as Venice Beach and Malibu Beach in southern California, could be affected. An oil spill would be expected to affect recreationist s' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and economic implications of a spill would reach b eyond direct effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likel y to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment above for more details). For a small spill in the Pacific region, the risk to recreation and tourism is negligible using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.5.5-1). In many cases, a spill of this size would be expected to pose no risk to shoreline resources because the spilled oil will ne ver reach the shoreline above a threshold of concern. For a medium spill, the risk to recreation and touris m is likely to be greater than for a small spill. A medium spill near the Pacific coast will advers ely affect approximately 5,993 m of the total recreational shoreline above the corresponding threshold of concern (Table H.5.5-1). Under these conditions, beaches along the Pacific coast in the sp ill area may be closed to visitors, and fishing and boating may not be permitted, causing losses in revenue to the recreation and tourism sectors of the coastal economy. These effects would be ex pected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing d ecreases in tourism, recreation, and associated employment and business opportunities. For a large spill, although the nature of the risk re mains the same as for a medium spill, the risk to recreation and tourism along the Pacific coast increases to nearly 14,232 m of the total recreational shoreline (Table H.5.5-1). A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in tourism, recreation, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-120 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills associated business activities and revenues, and the quality of coastal living. As previously mentioned, with certain weather conditions an d current patterns, only a portion of modeled spills is expected to reach shore, so no effects are expected. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Pacific region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total av ailable resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest mode led spills; any adverse impa cts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are define d as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the sp ill. There are many areas in the Pacific region with high-population concentrations along the coast. However, adverse effects on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore for any of the spill sizes considered, regardless of the response options \u2014mechanical recovery and/or in situ burning \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to protect the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are rel ated to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill respon se equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the worker certific ation and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The risk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), po tential regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Pacific region under Al ternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. H.6. A LTERNATIVE 1 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE ALASKA REGION The coastal shoreline of Alaska measures about one-third of the total shoreline of the United States and its possessions (Appendix F). Because of the Alaska region's immense size, a range of information primarily from the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Beaufort Sea will provide a discussion about this region for the purpose of this PEIS. Beginning south of the state, the body of water bordering the state's southern coastline and Canada's west coast is the GOA. Traveling counterclockwise, these far-reaching adjoin the Bering and Chukchi Seas; finally, the Beaufort Sea is located along the north coast of Alaska (Figure 3.1-1). Each of these marine environments differs through various surface current s and physical inputs from Alaskan rivers. The location selected for modeling and risk assessment purposes was in Prince William Sound because it is in a high-traffic area at greater risk for oil spills. Modeling results fr om this location were evaluated relative to the geographic area in Section F.1.2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), herein referred to as Pr ince William Sound. In general, the site is representative of offshore sites throughout the region and provides a basis for the modeling of potential effects. The Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-121 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills results of the modeling \u2014used to evaluate spills of concern in this risk an alysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore) \u2014are presented in Part F of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and summarized in this section. Table H.6-1 presents the risk rankings for the modeling of Alternative 1 in the Alaska region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with or without the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent recovery efficiency 1 for three spill sizes (small, 200 bbl; me dium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). The risk scores presented in th e table are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional considerations; however, in any specific o il spill situation local concerns could be higher. Table H.6-2 summarizes the significance of the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 1 in the Alaska region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for the average sp ill to the region in general. Under Alternative 1, dispersant capability is available and its use is feasible in the Alaska region (Figure 2.2-1), so chemical dispersion is considered at two levels of efficiency: 45 percent and 80 percent. For spills analyzed in this document (i.e ., those that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore), there are likely to be minor or insignificant regiona l adverse impacts on all resources for a small spill, except for marine and coastal birds, which could be moderate, based on the speed with which such a spill would weather and dissipate and the small area that could be affected, regardless of response option used. For a medium spill, adverse impacts are minor or insignificant for all resources except for marine and coastal birds, and fisheries, which could be moderate. For a large spill using mechanical-only recovery, there is the potential for moderate adverse impacts on marine mammals and areas of special concern, and significant advers e impacts on marine and coastal birds, intertidal habitats, and fisheries.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Chemical dispersion provides protection to all of these resources, but does increase the potential risk to coastal water quality to moderate. Such a spill coul d also cause significant, but localized, short-term adverse impacts on other socioe conomic resources. These adve rse impacts occur despite the treatment or recovery of some of the oil, but are reduced by these actions when they are effective. The availability of a dispersant ca pability under this alternative part icularly helps mitigate potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds, and coastal habitat and shoreline, especially for large spills, with some increase in the risk to water quality if the dispersed oil plume enters restricted coastal waters. Further, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantly change the level of concern identified from those obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. H.6.1 Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to water quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect water quality are the soluble aromatics, (monoaromatic hydrocarbons) and PAHs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) (Section 4.3.1.1). Thus, evaluation of potential adverse effects is based on the degree of potential contamination by these compounds. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effects on wate r quality are low for all spill sizes, regardless of the response option used (current levels of mechanical recovery with or without in situ burning and chemical dispersion). This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid d ilution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column. During periods of extreme turbul ence, oil generally mixes into the water column where aromatics may dissolve rapidly, but resurfac ing and dilution of oil droplets result in only localized contamination at leve ls of concern unless the dilution volume is restricted. Overall, based on the modeling and risk as sessment results, it is concluded that when using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion , adverse water-quality effects under Alternative 1 would be low in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Alaska region. However, if the spill moved into shallow and confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills under conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence or in areas where oil collects for a few weeks to months after a spill. Chemical dispersion would not be used in shallow and confined coastal waters (less than 3 nm 1 from shore) under Alternative 3, so it could only contribute to adverse water-quality effect s in those areas if the dispersed oil plume drifted into the area before being diluted. The variable used to determine potential water-quality effects is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentrat ion for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected water volume increases with spill volume and the level of physical or chemical dispersion during the time of the spill. Na tural dispersion increases with stronger winds and 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-125 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills currents, lessening the volume of water that is c ontaminated above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of contaminated water increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume of contaminated water for a small spill was extrapolated from the medium- and large-spill model results. The estimates of the volume of water contaminated \u2014and its variability\u2014 are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Alaska region because the mixing of oil into water and process of dilution are similar in all areas. Coastal In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi of shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 1. Thus, the model results for the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are used to assess coastal water quality effects. If dispersants were applied offsho re, the dispersed oil plume could move into these nearshore areas. Since chemical dispersion would not be used in these areas, the level and duration of exposure would be negligible because of dilution. The Valdez Arm is used as a repr esentative of coastal water for modeling Prince William Sound, as well as the Alaska region. The Va ldez Arm is approximately 109 km2 in area and about 200 m deep on average, with a total volume of approximatel y 21,800 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardl ess of location) were compared with the total volume of Prince William Sound to determine the potential effects of small, medium, and large spills (Table H.6.1-1). This approach was used bot h with and without dispersant use, and yields very conservative estimates, in that it assumes all of the water column contamination would occur in coastal water. Since dispersants would not be em ployed in such areas, this would imply that the dispersed oil plume would extend more directly into coastal waters without any dilution, which will not occur.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of Prince Wil liam Sound (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Alaska region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil can be incorporated into shallow water or intert idal sediments where, through leaching, it could become a continuing source of con tamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality wher e the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier 1 standards (beginning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concern to water quality would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have little influence on th e volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would apply whet her either response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, with or without dispersant use. For medium and large spills, impacts are expected to be insignificant and minor, respective ly, but increase to minor and mo derate, respectively, with the addition of chemical dispersion. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-127 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Marine In marine waters, which are 3 or more statute mi offshore, mechanical response, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion currently may be used for spill response in the Alas ka region. As was done for coastal waters, the estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of the reference area, the Prince William Sound. Prince William Sound was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters in the Alaska region. The total surf ace area of Prince William So und is approximately 10,080 km2, so the area of interest is much vaster for marine waters than for coastal waters. Water-quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water \u2014312 m deep, which is shallower than most marine waters in Prince William Sound and the Alaska region. The results for the selected modeling location (Table H.6.1-2) represent conservative estimates of adverse water-quality effects using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit).

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of Prince William Sound (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Alaska region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Natural oil dispersion would be very rapid after a sp ill, and recovery time wo uld be on the order of hours to days. Leaching from oil contamination reac hing the sediments would not have a large effect on marine water quality because of the large dilution volume and natural dispersing forces in marine waters. The results would apply whether or not a mechanical response is implemented. Since in situ burning would replace some of the mechanical re sponse, and both methods remove oil that would otherwise result in water contamination, the potential water-quality effects would not change significantly if in situ burning was used. For a spill in water deeper than the 312 m evaluated here, the potential adverse effects would be even smaller. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-128 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills With the addition of chemical dispersion, the resu lts in Table H.6.1-2 are identical for 45 and 80 percent efficiency because the amount of dispersant s at 45 percent efficiency is sufficient to treat all dispersible surface oil. For a small spill, the vo lume of water contaminated with the addition of chemical dispersion would be the same as for the ba sic response scenario because, due to logistics, dispersants could only be applied after a small spill has mostly dispersed naturally. Chemical dispersion for medium or large spills increases the volume of water contaminated, but would not change the overall level of concern. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even after a large spill, with or without ch emical dispersion, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. The estimate s of the volume of water contaminated \u2014and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Alaska region because natural and chemical dispersion of oil into the water column and dilution processes ar e similar in all areas. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine water quality in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignif icant for small, medium, and large spills, with or wi thout chemical dispersion. Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an oil spill on air quality may involve all vol atile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are normally very localized and short lived for small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any po tential adverse effects: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. Chemical dispersion reduces the volatiliza tion of unburned oil to the atmosphere to only a slight extent, so that effects are essentially identical with or without dispersant use. The modeling shows that results do not vary by sp ill location or size in the Alaska region. Two possible sources of contamination to the atmosphere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilization of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-129 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The results of the modeling show that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-onl y recovery and chemical dispersion; hence, the risk scores are virtually identical for small, medium, and large spills. Volatilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill si te. Evaporati on off the water surface and volatilization fr om the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocarbon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentratio ns in the atmosphere at the water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmosphere would be on the order of days . Thus, a low level of concern is expected for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical -only recovery and chemical dispersion (Table H.6.1-3).

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of Prince William Sound (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Alaska region for modeling. The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning, with or without chemical dispersion, would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via in situ burning. For small spills, it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feasible (Table H.6.1-3). The maximum area potentially ex ceeding the NAAQS or thre sholds of concern is 1.6 km2 for a medium spill and 12.7 km2 for a large spill (Table H.6.1-3). If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wildlife) are within these areas, th ey could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, a region of interest equivalent to Prince William Sound (10,080 km2) would have less than 1 percent of its area adversely affected, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. The addition of chemical dispersion does not change th e results in Table H.6.1-3. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-130 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on air quality in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without in situ burning. H.6.2 Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals Concentrations of cetaceans (whales and porpoises) in the Alaska region (Section 3.6.2.1., Table F.6-1) vary depending on seasonal migrations. Pinnipeds (seals and walruses) are carnivorous aquatic mammals that spend the majority of their lives swimming and eating in water; they venture onto land to bear their young, sunbathe, and molt. Two pinnipeds of concern in the Alaska region are the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) and the harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina ). The Steller sea lion does not breed in Prince William Sound but do es use a number of haulout areas located throughout the area. Harbor seals are the most common of the pinnipeds present in this region; they use tidewater glaciers and coastal shorelines as haulout areas and rookeries for bearing young. The sea otter ( Enhydra lutris ) is the only species of fur-bearing marine mammal of concern inhabiting this region. The majority of the local p opulation is localized to the southeastern sector of Prince William Sound. Females and pups are of ten found rafting in large groups, while males tend to remain in separate groups, except during the mating season. The greatest threat to pinnipeds and otters is from surface water and shor eline oiling that occurs in feeding, breeding, or molting areas. Marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, and manatees are vulnerable to spilled oil since they spend considerable time at the water's surface, whic h increases possible contact with oil. The majority of these species remains offshore, and populations vary according to season and migration directions. Cetaceans appear to be able to detect and are like ly to avoid floating oil or oil being recovered by mechanical means (Geraci, 1990). St udies have shown that cetacean sk in is nearly impenetrable to even the highly volatile constituents of oil, indicating that contact with oil probably would be less harmful to cetaceans than often believed. However, the toxic, volatile fractions in fresh crude oils could irritate and damage cetacean soft tissues, such as th e mucous membranes of the eyes and airways. Marine mammals that are more commonly found in the nearshore regions and in tertidal habitats, such as pinnipeds and sea otters, are of greater concern. Their use of restri cted haulout or feeding areas and instinctual behavior to return to the same breedi ng area every year may increase the likelihood of physical contact with oil in the event of a nearby spill. Potential concerns include toxicity from ingestion of oil during grooming, and effects on juveniles through contact with contaminated teats when nursing. Overall, the potential effects depend on the size of the spill, and the number and species of marine mammals present. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-131 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the area of appropriate habitat in the Prince William Sound, the equivalent areas for 100 percent mortality using mechanical-only recovery only for cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sea otters are less than 0.001, 0.007, and 0.5 percent, respectively, of the available habitat for a medium spill. For a large spill without chemical dispersion, the values increa se to 0.005, 0.05, and 3.42 percent, respectively. Chemical dispersion reduces all of these percentages except for sea otters: the values are already so low that the difference is not important. For sea otters, chemical dispersion reduced the areas by about 25 percent for a medium spill and 50 percent for a large spill, but this improvement did not change the overall level of risk, primarily because of the expected recovery time. Pinnipeds are also at risk from shoreline oiling. The likel ihood that oiling would actually involve a pinniped haulout area is low, based on the predicted length of shoreline contaminated, but does contribute to the potential risk (see the discussion on intertidal habitats). This risk is also reduced by chemical dispersion. Based on the distribution of mammals in the Alaska regi on, the potential level of concern was determined to be low for small and medium spills but would increase to medium levels for large spills. The results of the modeling for marine mammals for Prince William Sound are presen ted in Table H.6.2-1.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-132 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds are usually of highest concern during an oil spill because birds are highly susceptible to the acutely toxic effects of exposure to oil. There are many areas in the Alaska region where high concentrations of birds may be found in a variety of habitats, and the remoteness of the Alaskan shoreline can ma ke protection and cleanup of intertidal habitats very difficult. Adverse effects on birds in this region would result mostly from oiling of gravel beaches, tidal flats, and small islands that are used by shorebirds and seabirds and of surface water in marine-water habitats used by seabirds, gulls, terns, and migratory waterfowl (Section 3.6.2.2) (see Section 4.3.2.2 for information on the main issues of concern for birds exposed to an oil spill). Prince William Sound was selected for the modeling as representative of the intertidal habitats and wildlife in the Alaska region (Table H.6.2-2). Under Alte rnative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the potential adverse effects on birds. Potential levels of concern for birds ar e in Prince William Sound are medium for a small spill, in that the length of shoreline oiled and th e amount of oil that stranded would both be very small. However, the levels of concern increase with spill volume, with greatest concern for conditions where sheltered rocky shores and gravel beaches used by seabirds and shorebirds become heavily oiled, and where su rface water oiling is extensive.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-133 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills A hemispheric Western Hemisphe re Shorebird Reserv e Network (WHSRN) site, the Copper River Delta, is located in Prince William Sound. The presence of this site indicates that large numbers of shorebirds concentrate in the area during migration and/or nesting and wintering. Total nesting and feeding seabirds in Prince William Sound range from tens to hundreds of thousands annually. Tens of thousands of migratory shorebirds are present on gravel beaches and tidal flats in embayments and on islands. High concentrations of waterfowl nest in wetlands and stage and molt in sheltered areas. Thus, the risk rankings were determined based on th e possibility that a large number of birds may be concentrated on heavily utilized beaches or in sh eltered embayments and marine-water areas that are significantly oiled. It is important to recognize that adverse effects on birds may be more or less severe depending on the time of year and locations of their habitats, as well as the extent of shoreline and surface water oiling. Use of nesting and staging habitats are seasonal in the Alaska region; therefore, a spill occurring during the peak season for these sensitive life stages would result in greater adverse effects on regional bird populations than a spill occurring at a different time of year. Under the basic response scenario, adverse effects on birds in Prince William Sound for a small spill were determined by extrapolating from the results obtained for a medium spill. The volume of oil released in the small spill was approximately an order of magnitude less than in the medium spill; therefore, the adverse effects on bird populations were estimated to be proportionally smaller. The modeling of effects on birds for a medium spill unde r mechanical-only recovery resulted in estimates of 5 to 10 percent of the regional bird population being adversely affected because some important shorebird staging areas were oiled. Approximately 68 km 2 of surface water were oiled above the 10\u00ad micron threshold, including waterfowl and seabird concentration areas around islands and in inlets and bays. For a large spill under mechanical-only recovery , the modeling resulted in estimates of over 20 percent of the local area bird population being af fected. Two percent of the shoreline in Prince William Sound was oiled, including many important shorebird staging areas. Gravel beaches, which are used by staging shorebirds, composed 30 to 60 percent of the oiled shorelin e, and heavy oiling in gravel beaches can persist for a decade. Approximately 468 km 2 of surface water was oiled above the 10-micron threshold, including waterfowl and seabir d concentration areas in the northern and western areas of Prince William Sound. The ri sk scores in Table H.6.2-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates for birds of 3 to 7 years for medium and large spills. Recovery will likely occur in 1 to 3 years for most species, but recovery times for other species, such as black oystercatchers an d harlequin ducks, were longer after the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill and ranged from 3 to 9 years (Section 4.3.2.2). Black oystercatchers, harlequin ducks, and other species with longer recovery times ar e present, sometimes in high concentrations, in areas oile d under the medium and large spill scenarios. The predicted recovery rates were less for birds in a small spill because a smaller area was affected; therefore, it is unlikely that large numbers of species with longer recovery times were present. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 percent efficiency for a medium spill, the length of oiled shoreline was reduced by nearly 60 percent and surface water effects were reduced by 24 percent. Adverse effects on impo rtant bird habitats were slight ly reduced; but the risk score remained the same with 5 to 10 percent of the estimated regional bird population being affected. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 80 pe rcent efficiency for a medi um spill, the amount of shoreline and surface water oiling was only slig htly reduced compared with the 45 percent efficiency scenario, but less-important bird habitats were oiled. Therefore, the risk score was reduced to 1 to 5 percent of the estimated bird population being affected. When dispersants at 45 and 80 percent efficiency were used on a large spill, shoreline oiling was reduced by approximately 50 and 65 percent, respectively; and similar reductions in surface water oiling occurred. Several sensitive bird habitats were still significantly oile d; therefore, the risk scores were only reduced slightly to 10 to 20 percent of the estimated bird population being affected (Table H.6.2-2). On an overall regional level, adverse effects from medi um and large spills to birds are reduced when Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-134 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills chemical dispersion is modeled. The addition of in situ burning does not change the significance of these adverse effects. Although areas other than Prince William Sound in the Alaska region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on ma rine and coastal birds will fall within a similar range throughout the Alaska region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Alaska region under Alternat ive 1 are expected to be moderate for small and medium spill sizes, and significant for large spills, with or without dispersant use. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse e ffects on these groups are of high concern, particularly when chemical dispersion is considered as a potential re sponse option. As described in Section 4.3.2.3 and Appendix H.2.2, plankton and fish are adversely affected either dire ctly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil droplets mixed by wa ves into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is direct uptake of dissolved oil components, originating directly from surface oil or dissolving from the microscopic oil dr oplets in the water. Overall, as spill size increases, so do adverse effect s. However, there is great variability related to the environmental conditions after a sp ill; plankton and fish suffer much more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oi l into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather. In addition, many species utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they ar e more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved components when oil comes ashore. Species and life s tages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic components, with species from rela tively unpolluted and environmenta lly stable locations being more sensitive than those from polluted an d environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposure during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floa ting oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapidly di sperse to background levels. However, there may be longer-term effects if an offshore spill occu rs in or migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands where diluti on and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juve nile stages in these shallow areas. In Alaska, Pacific herring spawns in shallow areas on macroa lgae and other structural material, while pink salmon often utilize intertidal zones for spawning and larval development, making these species particularly vulnerable to oil reaching shorelines (s ee discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 1, in most cases, chem ical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm 1 of shore, but the dispersed oil plume could be transported by currents into this area. 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-135 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The percentage of plankton and fish adversely af fected by oil spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percent loss mult iplied by volume exposed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes were translated to equivalent areas by multiplying them by water depth at the spill site, a llowing comparison with other resources, such as birds and shorelines, which are distributed on a per-area basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundanc e is much more uniformly distributed when expressed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by the similar results for the four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, offshore Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively, of the technical re port [French McCay et al., 2004])\u2014 the equivalent areas of adverse effect on plankton and fish (both average and variab le) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water dept h in any region considered in th is PEIS. In Prince William Sound, the modeled spill site was is 312 m deep water, so thes e results are applicable to any spill site in the Alaska region where water depth is close to 312 m. The results from the other regions' modeled spill sites, which are based on 10 to 30 m of water, would be applicable to spills in the Alaska region in similarly shallow waters. Likewise, the results for Prince William Sound are applicable to waters of about 312 m in all the regions. Advers e effects would be smal ler for deeper waters because of greater vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionally greater in shallower waters because of the restricted dilution potential. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much less. Thus, the model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortality of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes among response scenarios. Prince William Sound was selected fo r the modeling as representative of the Alaska region (Table H.6.2-3). The adverse effects were estimated as a percentage of the total area of concern (10,080 km 2). With the addition of chemical dispersion, the results for 45 percent efficiency were not significantly different from those for 80 per cent efficiency because more than sufficient dispersant would be available under both conditions to disperse available surface oil for spills up to 40,000 bbl. For a small spill, based on the evaluati on of the volume wher e water quality would be affected for a small spill (Tables H.6.1-1), the volume of advers e effects on plankton and fish would be low for all response options under Alternative 1. and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-136 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of Prince Wil liam Sound (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Alaska region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery time would be less than 1 year. Overa ll, based on the modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 \u2014using mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion \u2014would be localized to th e immediate area around the spill site and similar in all marine water areas of the region. For large spills that might move rapidly into shallow coastal areas due to winds and currents, the concentrations of toxic components might be high enough to cause some level of con cern for water column communities, especially early life history stages for fish and invertebrates using intertidal and shallow subtidal areas. Deepwater chemical dispersion would remove oil floating on the surface that might otherwise come ashore and adversely affect shallow-water and intertidal biota, including herring and salmon in early life history stages in those habitats. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Intertidal Habitats Potential effects on intertidal habitats are always of great concern during oil spills, particularly in the Alaska region where the remoteness of the shoreline can make shoreline protection and cleanup very difficult. The Alaskan shorelines vary widely in type and degree of exposure to natural removal processes (Section 3.6.2.4). Of gre atest concern are the more sheltere d habitats such as sheltered rocky Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-137 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills shores and wetlands where recovery from oil sp ills can take many years. Gravel beaches are of particular concern because of the potential for deep penetration of oil that can persist for decades under heavy oiling. These beaches are used as spaw ning substrates for important commercial fisheries such as herring and salmon; thus, persistent oil provides a pathway for chronic exposure to these sensitive life stages. The Alaska region has extensive areas of thes e sensitive habitats along major oil transportation routes. For a discussion of the relative ranking of the sens itivity of intertidal habitats to spilled oil and the processes affecting oil fate and behavior on shorelines, see the explanation of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) in Section 4.3. 2.4. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on th e shoreline and affect larger areas. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed and, thus, does not reduce potential adverse ef fects. Tn the Alaska region, adverse effects on intertidal habitats are small for a small spill because very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. However, the potential for adverse effe cts increases with spill volume, with the greatest concern for conditions where sheltered rocky shores and gravel beaches become heavily oiled. Prince W illiam Sound was selected for the mo deling as representative of the intertidal habitats in the Alaska region (Table H.6.2.4). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-138 2009 H.

Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of Prince William Sound (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Alaska region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats from a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting recovery from lightly oiled shorelines within 1 year. For a medium spill under mechanical-only re covery, the modeling resu lted in approximately 24.1 km of oiled shoreline, which is less than 1 percent of the entire shoreline in Prince William Sound. However, most of this o iled shoreline consisted of rocky shores, which are expected to recover within 1 to 3 years from light-to-moderate oiling, as reflected in the risk scores in Table H.6.2.4. For a large spill under mechanical-only re covery, the modeling resulted in an estimated 89.3 km of oiled shoreline. This value represents 2 percent of the entire shoreline area. Gravel beaches compose 30 to 60 percent of the oiled shoreline, depend ing on the spill conditions. Heavy oiling in gravel beaches can persist for at least a decade, so the risk scores in Table H.6.2.4 reflect this long recovery pe riod (Section 4.3.2.4). With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 percen t efficiency for a medium sp ill, the length of oiled shoreline was reduced by nearly 60 percent \u2014to 10.8 km \u2014and no wetlands were affected. There was little difference in the modeled shoreline oiling betw een the two levels of dispersant efficiency for a medium spill. With the addition of chemical disp ersion at 45 percent efficiency for a large spill, shoreline oiling was reduced by 50 percent, to less than 1 percent of the total shoreline. At 80 percent efficiency, the extent and degree of shoreline oiling wa s reduced by 65 percent, to 34.7 km. Less than 1 percent of the shoreline in Prince William Sound was oiled, but there were still areas of moderate oiling on gravel beaches. Mode rately oiled beache s would recover within 3 to 7 years. Although areas other than Prince William Sound in th e Alaska region were no t modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions modeled in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on in tertidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-139 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Alaska region. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant from small spill sizes, with or without dispersant use. For medi um and large spills, the potential adverse impacts are minor and significant, respectively, but decrease to insignificant and moderate, respectively, with the addition of chemical dispersion. Subtidal Habitats The subtidal (benthic) habitat consists of the bottom substrate below the low tide level, as well as the species that live in, on, and near the substrate. Th is benthic community in the Alaska region includes seagrass beds and kelp forests, as well as areas of live, sandy, muddy, and low-relief live bottoms, and subsurface canyons. Organisms living in this area \u2014demersal species \u2014include corals, plants and seagrasses, benthic inverteb rates (such as crabs, shrimp, snails, bivalve mollusks, and marine worms), and bottom-dwelling fish. Because subtidal benthic communities do not include the intertidal zone, they are at little risk from floating oil because, by definition, this environment is always below the surface. Kelp forests are an exception, since the fr onds may reach the surface; they are at risk from floating oil, as is the associated animal community . The greatest risk of exposure comes from sinking oil, as well as in situ burn residue, or dispersed oil or the sorption of naturally dispersed or mechanically mixed oil that has become suspende d on sediments and is deposited onto the ocean floor. However, significant natural dispersion of oil and sediment into the water column only occurs during large storms or for nearshore oil spills. Oil particles could adhere to bottom substrate, plants, or animals, which could result in both physical coating of organisms, as occurred in the 1993 BRAER spill in the Shetland Islands, and toxic effects from exposure to the chemical constituents (Section 4.3.2.5). Such adverse effect s are not normally observed. The risk to fauna and flora of the subtidal benthic habitat is minimal, based on the diluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid diluti on of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil re sidue potentially reaching the bottom substrate. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-140 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. It mi ght slightly increase the risk of remaining oil residues sinking to the bottom. Residual oil from in situ burning that reaches the bottom is expected to have little or no adverse effects on subtidal habitats since the majority of its toxic components would have either evaporated or be en destroyed during burning, and the volume produced is very small (Section 4.3.2.5). For a medium spill without chemical dispersion the sediment threshold concentrations for dissolved aromatic and for total hydrocarbons were never exceeded. For a large spill the sediment threshold for total hydrocarbon exposure was ex ceeded, but only in an area of less than 0.003 percent of the total reference area. Benthic habitat was also assumed to be at risk if there threshold of concern for dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons affected stationary demersal species (those living at the sediment-water interface). When mechanical-only recovery was used, less than 0.001 percent of Prince William Sound was affected by water column concentrations above the threshold for a medium spill, which increased to 0.001 percent for a large spill. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent efficiency for medium and large spills (Table H.6.2.5), the modelin g results show essentially no chan ge in sediment contamination. The exposure area of stationary demersal species to dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations above threshold remained at 0.001 pe rcent for both medium and large spills at 45 and 80 percent efficiency.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-141 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Se ction 4.3), potential regional advers e impacts on subtidal habitats in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spill sizes, with or without dispersant use. Areas of Special Concern The potential adverse effects on areas of special concern, such as National Marine Sanctuaries, National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, and Nati onal Estuarine Research Reserves, are important during an oil spill since these areas are under increased scrutiny and protection. Whereas most coastal and nearshore areas have a wide range of habitats or are very similar to other areas along the Alaskan coast, areas of special concern are set aside for their uniqueness (Appendix F, Tables F.6-3 through F.6-6 and Figures F.6-1 through F.6-4). The potential risks associated with shoreline areas of special concern are identical to those discussed above for in tertidal habitats. The risk s to subtidal resources, such as those in Marine Sanctuaries, are identical to those discussed for subtidal habitats. For this analysis, the risks to areas of special concern are assu med to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Appendix H.6), whichever are gr eater. Since the risk to intertidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the data presented for a medium spill, th e estimated average extent of shoreline oiling using mechanical-onl y recovery is 24 km; this figure incr eases to 89 km for a large spill. The potential risk of surface oil reaching a shoreline associated with an area of special concern is low in the Alaska region because of the number and scattered locations of these areas. The potential adverse effects on areas of special concern with or without dispersant use are low for a small spill but increase to medium for medium and large spills based on the extent of shoreline oiling (Table H.6.2.6). It should be noted that the assumed re covery times for large spills were reduced over those reported for intertidal habitat, which were based on oiling of gravel beaches. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent efficiency for a medium spill (Table H.6.2.6), the average amount of shoreline oiling de creases by an estimated 60 percent. For a large spill shoreline oiling was reduced by 50 to 65 perc ent of the original amount (45 and 80 percent efficiency, respectively). While this changed the risk scores, the overall level of concern remained low for small and medium spills , and medium for large spills. Since areas of special concern are scattered along the Alaskan coast, they are unlikely to be disproportionately affected by the average spill. If an area of special concern was affected, it is anticipated that the recovery time for the affected area would be the same as for similar intertidal habitats elsewhere. These areas are most at risk from floating oil and, therefore, benefit from any action that reduces potential shoreline oiling. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-142 2009 H.

Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small spills and moderate for large spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to intertidal habitats. For medium spills, impacts are expected to be minor, but decrease to insignificant with the addition of chemical dispersion. Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The Alaska region has a variety of threatened, enda ngered, or candidate species (Section 3.6.4). The overall regional risk that a threatened, endangered , or candidate species would be adversely affected or even present in the area of a spill is low for small spills and medium for medium spills, but increases greatly for large spills. Killing a single in dividual of such a speci es can be considered a severe effect. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, or fish that are threatened, endangered, or ca ndidate species are identical to those discussed in Appendix H.2 for these groups. Overall, risk scores were highes t for marine and coastal birds. While the risks to these groups have been described, the level of concern for threatened, endangered, or candidate species tends to be higher. Therefore, any adverse effects that affect breeding or result in death should be considered high. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-143 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species in the Alaska region for any spill size are difficult to predict. Depending on the location and season, the number and type of species present will vary. Based on the overall size of the Alaska re gion and the distribution of threatened, endangered, or candidate species inhabi ting the region, the likeli hood of affecting an individual of concern would probably be higher than in many other regions in th is PEIS. The addition of chemical dispersion at 45 or 80 percent efficiency will decrease the average amount of surface oiling and shoreline oiling, which would benefit the species in these areas. No additional risk from chemical dispersion is expected for fish. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small an d medium spills, and significant for large spills, with or with out dispersant use, based on the risk to mari ne and coastal birds. H.6.3 Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat Virtually all waters along the Alaskan coast and ou t to the limits of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are considered Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). Areas such as bays, river mouths, and harbors are designated EFH for at least one specie s and are protected by legislation (Section 3.6.4). The primary issue with respect to EFH is either (1) exposure of sensitive resources in the water column to hydrocarbon concentrations of concern, or (2) the contamination of bottom sediments, both of which could lead to either acute or chronic exposures. Adverse effects would include either the death of in dividual organisms, the possibility of sublethal effects affecting long-term population viability, or degradation of habitat that reduces its availability to managed species. For th is analysis, the risks to areas of spec ial concern are assumed to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Appendix H.2 ), whichever are greater. The results for plankton and fish and for subtidal habitats in dicate only low effects and form the basis for the EFH risk score. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insign ificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to plankton and fish and to subtidal habitats. H.6.4 Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Sect ion 4.3.5, oil spills can produce a variety of adverse social and economic effects. These adverse effects are generally not high when measured at the regional level, but instead are typically felt in communities located near resources oiled by the spill. Specifically, large adverse effects are generally limited to those industries and populati ons that are affected by the spill. Some of the most visible and significant of these adverse effects are likely to include eff ects on water- and shore- based recreation, commercial fisheries, and the ov erall well-being of the residents of coastal communities in the Alaska region. This modeling considers the risk of adverse soci oeconomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreational activity because of limited accessibility or perceived taint, closure of commercial fishing grounds or hatcheries, and oiling of marine resources that are important to low-income and minority populations that use subsistence resources. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills may gene rate secondary effects on social Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-144 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills and economic welfare along the coast. For exam ple, an oil spill may cause changes in the employment and revenues of resource-based businesses. While these effects are not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and relative measures of the overall risk of adverse social and economic effect s of small, medium, and large oi l spills using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), with or without chemical dispersion, in the Alaska region. The methodology is described in more detail in the Atlantic region (Section H.2.5). There is no existing standard for \"significance\" rel ated to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface wate r must be oiled to be consider ed a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the ef fect will depend on a number of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, lo cal), opportunities for resource substi tution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of low concern if it is not of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the modeled effects under all modeled scenar ios would likely be low at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that occur would be expected to be localized in nature. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-145 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The risk factor reflects the ratio of the percentag e of the shoreline or surface water oiled using the basic response scenario to the percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion. For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of risk equal to one-fifth that expected given response options limited to mechanical recovery and in situ burning. This modeling assumes that the risk posed by oil sp ills to the socioeconomic environment is directly related to the extent to which resource s are oiled above thresholds of concern \u2014for the Alaska region, the square meters of marine waters used for recr eational activities and commercial fishing oiled above the threshold of concern. By comparing the absolute and relative degree of ri sk to the socioeconomic environment under various spill sizes, this modeling considers the degree of risk reduction achieved under a given spill response option (see Appendix I. for details on the method used). The risk estimates presented Table H.6.4-1 are based on modeled spills affecting Prince William Sound. While any given spill can exhibit distinctly different p atterns of socioeconomic e ffect, these results are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of sp ill locations along the enti re Alaskan shoreline, as long as spills occur in areas where mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion are feasible. In addition, the conclusions reached for Prince William Sound are supported by results for other modeled areas \u2014the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assumptions across spill size is similar in magnitude. Table H.6.4-1 highlights the effects of small, medi um, and large oil spills on the Alaska region's socioeconomic resources by presenting estimates of resources oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute terms (area of surface wa ter oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of the total resource base in th e modeled spill area (Pri nce William Sound). The threshold of concern due to oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m 2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). This resource area is base d on an estimate of the extent to which the coas tal community in the modeled area potentially relies on each resource. For the Alaska region, length of shoreline oiled above the threshold of concern is not considered relevant. A single metric was selected for this region because (1) the shoreline oiling result s for the Alaska region were sensitive in the modeled spill location; (2) the ability to identify s horeline with characterist ics amenable to use was limited; and (3) area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern was expected to provide a more accurate measure of expected risk, given the region's geographic characteristics. For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life pot entially affected by an oil spill. Absolute and re lative risk are discussed for coastal comm unities, demography, and employment; general economic status of a coastal community; vessel transpor and ports; recreation and tourism; and publ ic safety and worker health.

The threshold of concern because of oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m 2 of oil (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). || Percentages reflect the proportion of the total modeled area above the threshold of concern. # A risk factor reflects the ratio of the percentage of the mode l area or volume oiled using the basic response scenario to the model area or percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion. For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of risk equal to one-fifth that expected wi th response limited to the basic response scenario. ** A 200-bbl spill is assumed to have negligible effect. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Coastal communities benefit from and rely on the marine environment to provide residents with sustenance, livelihoods, le isure opportunities, and shipping avenue s. Individuals who live and work in close proximity to the coast derive both social and economic rewards from the natural beauty, recreational opportunities, quality of life, and cultural attributes associated with these coastal locations. Thus, oil spills can affect multiple aspects of a co astal community's assets, leading to adverse effects on the economic benefits of communit y activities. These effects, in turn, can impose changes on an affected community's demographi cs and employment patterns. In addition to the direct employ ment and other adverse effects a ssociated with oil spills on marine resource-based economic sectors, spills can ge nerate secondary adverse effects on coastal communities. For example, tourist-related spending in the south-central and southwest regions of Alaska fell after the EXXON VALDEZ spill by 8 and 35 percent, resp ectively, representing a loss of approximately $19 million (McDowell Group, 1990). Commerci al fishing activities were similarly affected. Such dramatic revenue declines most likely affected employment in these sectors. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-147 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills In addition, because goods must either be flown or shipped in to Prince William Sound, their cost is higher than in other, more accessible regions. Limitations on water access may therefore decrease the availability and increase the price of goods that are imported to the region, significantly affecting coastal communities. To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water o iling, some combination of spill response options can be expected to reduce the risk to coastal communities in the Alaska region. For a small spill in the Alaska region, the risk to coastal communities is low. Because of the small surface water area exposed to oil as a result of a small spill, marine-based economic factors such as local commercial or subsistence fi sheries may experience little or no effect (Table H.6.4-1). Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechan ical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium spill in Prince William Sound will have a spill area 1 above the corresponding threshold of concern that will sweep approximately 419 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.6.4-1). The risk of social and economic and social losses will occur in areas of fishery waters that exceed the thresholds of concern. For example, recreational and commercial fishing may not be permitted in waters exposed to oil, causing loss es in revenue to the tourism, recreation, and commercial fishery sectors of th e coastal economy. These effects wo uld be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill by affecting employment opportunities, ea rnings, and the value of coastal living. The risk to coastal communities from a medium spill can be further mitigated with chemical dispersion. With the addition of chemical dispersion, a medium spill in Prince William Sound will sweep approximately 234 million to 238 million m 2 of marine waters in the spill area above the corresponding thresholds of concer n (Table H.6.4-1). At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the risk to resources essential to tourism, recreation, and commercial fisheries is dramatically reduced, falling 43 and 45 percent, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are used. These estimates of expected ri sk reduction are assumed to be valid as proxy indicators of the overall expected reduction in risk to the well-being of residents of coastal communities of a medium oil spill along the Alaskan coast. 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-148 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Large spills pose a substantial ri sk for coastal communities. Usin g the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill will present risk to approximately 770 million m2 of the marine waters potentially important to commercial fisheries and recreational activities in the spill area. A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in tourism, recreation, asso ciated business activities and revenues, and the quality of coastal living. The percentage reduction in risk achieved through chemical dispersion for a large spill scenario is also significant, but slightly less dramatic than the reduction achieved for a medium spill. With the addition of chemical dispersion, a large spill in Prince William Sound will sweep approximately 436 million to 503 million m2 of marine waters in the spill area above the correspond ing thresholds of concern (Table H.6.4-1). At 45 and 80 percent ef ficiency, the risk to resources essential to recreation, tourism, and commercial fisheries are reduced from the basic response scenario by 34 and 42 percent, respectively. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be minor for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, indu stries, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affect ed by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer direct and indirect ad verse economic effects from an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease reve nue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisherie s, by both the anglers themselves and by related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated entirely. Tourism and associated businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal areas decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived resource taint. The ability of Prince William Sound to provide sustai nable populations of marine organisms is critical to several communities. Commercial fishing prov ides both direct and indirect employment opportunities for residents. In Cordova, for example, three of the ten largest employers are tied to the fishing industry, and fish processing employs the greatest number of individuals outside the government (Fried and Windisch -Cole, 1999). A study conducted by the University of Alaska, Anchorage, estimated that more than one-third of Cordova's workforce is employed in fish harvesting or processing and that about half of the households in the area have someone working in the commercial fishing industry (Fried and Wind isch-Cole, 1999). The economic importance of the marine life to coastal communities, however, extend s beyond Cordova to other towns, both within and outside of Prince William Sound (Boucher, 2000). Valdez is home to three fish processing plants, two of which are among the community's top ten employers (Fried and Windisch-Cole, 1999). A small spill that is 3 or more statute mi offshore would have essentially no adverse effect on either the local or regional economies (Table H.6.4-1). Th ere is little to no risk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any co mmercial fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-149 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills A medium spill, with mechanical recovery, in situ burn, and dispersant operations, could be expected to have short-term adve rse economic effects as a result of oiling recreati onal beaches and limited closing of fisheries, plus the need to supplement the norm al response operation employment base, especially if shoreline oiling occurs. These adverse e ffects would probably be very short lived, in that cleanup operations would not require a long period of time. The risk to the economic status of coastal communities from a medium spill can be mitigated significantly with chemical dispersion. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the modeling indicated that the risk to economically important resources is dramatically reduced. These measures of risk reduction for Prince William So und are assumed to be valid indicators of the overall expected risk reduction to coastal commun ities for this size spill in Alaskan waters. Thus, overall risk to coastal communities in the Alaska region is expected to fall when spill response options involve chemical dispersion. Coastal commu nities will experience reduced risks of fishery closures, decreased tourism, and any negative effe cts on coastal living that an oil spill might have. For a large spill, the adverse economic effects co uld be high, even with mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion, based on the lik elihood that closures of commercial fisheries and recreational fishing grounds will occur. In addition, the potential level of shoreline oiling would require a much larger cleanup effort. While the adverse effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, could cause the adverse socioeconomic effect s to be higher. As assumed under Alternative 1, chemical dispersion will help mitigate the adverse eff ects of a large oil spill by reducing the surface area oiled, but it may not have the sa me effect on public perception. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be minor for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore are not likely to cause large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports; any adverse effects would likely be of short duration. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commerce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft movement as a means of facilitating spill response. Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or increase in travel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, an d the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. Although the possibility exists for the affected area's trade partners to be affected by interruptions in marine transportation in the spill area, the availab ility of substitute suppliers and shipping modes and the expected short-term nature of any disruption in ve ssel traffic, such adverse effects are not likely to be large. Vessel transportation is vital to the welfare of Alaskan commun ities. In Prince William Sound, specifically, only Whittier and Valdez are connected to the major highway system in Alaska. The ferry that runs between Cordova, Valdez, Whittier, Tatitlek, and Chanenga Bay provides critical transportation services (A DOT&PF, 2001). The importance of ferry services is not unique to Prince William Sound; it is common in many parts of Al aska. In addition, because goods must either be flown in or shipped to Alaska, their cost is higher than in other, more accessible regions. Limitations on water access can therefore decrease the availab ility and increase the price of goods that are Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-150 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills imported to the region, significantly affecting coastal communities without immediate access to Anchorage or other major cities. To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water oiling, some combination of spill response options can be expected to reduce the risk to vessel transpor tation and ports in the Alaska region. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium spill could affect up to 419 million m2 and a large spill, up to 770 million m2 of surface water above recognized thresholds (Tables H.6.4-1). These adverse effects would affect commercial navigation in the vicinity of the spill and would likely affect income and employment either directly or indirectly relying on the swift movement of goods to and from local ports. For a small spill regardless of response option, no high adverse effects on vessel transportation or ports are expected (Table H.6.4-1), but there is some risk for medium and large spills. Therefore, the nature of the risk to vessel trans portation and ports will be a function of the location, area, and pattern of surface water oiling, as well as the extent of oi ling in port areas. A medium spill along the Alaskan coast would not generally be expected to result in large adverse effects; however, there is some risk to vessel transportation and ports for a large spill. To the extent that it will shorten the cleanup period, chemical dispersion would be expected to reduce the risk to the spill area. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, chemical dispersion would be expected to reduce the overall risk to marine traffic and of port closures by 43 to 45 percent for a medium spill and by 34 to 42 percent for a large spill, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are used. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4. 3), potential regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills; any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerable to oil spills because of both closures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to significant losses in revenue for the commercial fishing industry, as well as rel ated industries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from co mmercial fleets. In addition, oil spills can lead to the closure of fisheries, decrease demand for fish from affected waters because of actual or perceived taint, and instigate alterations to fishing pr actices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or decreases revenues. Large spills can potentially injure fish nursery grounds and impos e other risks that could reduce fish harvests in the longer term. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-151 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Commercial fishing is an important economic activity in th e Alaska region. In 2001, the salmon harvested from Prince William Soun d yielded $45.58 mi llion, with a total catch of 41.14 million fish, representing approximately 20 percent of Alaska's total salmon harvest (ADF&G, 2001). To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water oiling, some combination of spill response options can be expected to reduce the risk to regionally important fisheries in the Alaska region. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium sp ill could affect up to 419 million m2 and a large spill, up 770 million m2 of surface water above recognized threshol ds (Table H.6.4-1). While adverse effects would be felt directly by commercial fishermen, local income and employment in sectors tied to this industry could also be affected. For a small spill in the Alaska region, the risk to commercial fisheries is negligible using the basic response scenario (Table H.6.4-1). Any adverse effects that occur, however, would be reduced with chemical dispersion. For a medium spill, the risk to comme rcial fisheries is likely to be greater than for a small spill. A risk of economic loss to commercial fisheries will occu r when waters exceed management and/or relevant thresholds. For example, fishing may not be perm itted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold of concern, resulting in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following the spill. The resulting adverse effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decr eases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, spill effects on the commercial fishing economy may be less severe. The risk to commercial fisheries of a medium sp ill can be mitigated significantly with chemical dispersion. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the risk to resources essential to commercial fisheries is reduced by 43 and 45 percent, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery and in situ burning are used. For a large spill, there is a substanti al risk to regional commercial fisheries. A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in commercial fishing ac tivities and revenues, as well as of associated businesses. Again, to the extent th at commercial fishing operations can, for a time, move to substitute fishing grounds, the potentially se vere effects of even a large spill can be avoided. With chemical dispersion, the percentage of risk re duction for a large spill scenario is slightly smaller than that for a medium spill, but is nevertheless high. At 45 and 80 percent efficien cy, chemical disp ersion could be expected to reduce the risk to commercial fish eries by 34 to 42 percent, respectively. Recreational Fisheries Fishing and camping are popular recreational activi ties in Prince William Sound. The prime fishing and camping sites in Prince W illiam Sound and the Chugach Nation al Park along the coast are accessible only by air and water. In fact, the majority of the park along the coast near Whittier was designated the Nellie Juan-College Fiord Wilderness Study Area in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (USDA Forest Serv ice, 2002). Because much of this shoreline is wilderness, thus inaccessible by land, charter boats are a popular means of accessing recreational fishing waters in Prince William Sound; the numb er of boat charters almost doubled between 1997 and 1999 (Fried and Windisch-Cole, 1999). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-152 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a small spill regardless of response option, ad verse effects on recreational resources in the Alaska region would likely be negligible (Table H.6.4-1). The risk to recreational fisheries for a medium spill is likely to be greater than for a sma ll spill. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances pe rmit), a medium spill near the Alaskan coast will sweep approximately 419 million m2 of marine waters used by recreational fishermen. However, the risk to recreational fisheries can be mitigated significantly with chemical dispersion. With chemical dispersion a medium sp ill will adversely affect approximately 234 million to 238 million m 2 of marine waters in the spill area used by the recreational fishing industry above the corresponding thresholds of concern (Table H.6.4-1). At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the risk to resources essential to recreational fishing is reduced by 43 and 45 percent, respectively, from those resources at risk when mechanical recovery in situ burning are used. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk to recreational fisheries. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of me chanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill presents risk to approximately 770 million m 2 of the marine waters potentially important to recreational fishermen. Although chemical dispersi on would mitigate the damages, the percentage of risk reduction for a large spill is slightly smaller than for a medium spill, but is nevertheless high. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, chemical dispersion could be expected to reduce the risk to recreational fishing grounds by 34 to 42 percent, respectively. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be minor, moderate, and significant for small, medium, and large spills, respectively, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills. Any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Subsistence Potential adverse effects on marine species are a concern during spills wh ere traditional use of subsistence resources occurs. Fish, shellfish, an d marine mammals are the major species gathered for subsistence in the Alaska region (Section 3.6.5.5). Tissue tainting would be the primary concern for these subsistence resources. Prince William Sound was selected for the modeling as representative of the coastal habitats, fish, and wildlife in the Alaska region. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential advers e effects on subsistence resources. Potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Alaska region are low for small and medium spills, and higher for large spills (Table H.6.4-2).

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of Prince William Sound (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Alaska region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Effects on subsistence resources for a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. Using mechanical-only recovery for a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure to dissolved aromatics to be at low concentrations (1- 100 ppb) and to only occur in a small area. Sediment exposure was negligible. Tainting of fish and invertebrates becomes a concern when water concentrations exceed approximately 100 ppb (Section 4.3.5.6). A very small percentage of shoreline habi tats were oiled; therefore, a proportionally small percentage of subsistence resources associated with these habitats are likely to be exposed. Using mechanical-only recovery for a large spill, the modeling results were similar to those of a medium spill for water column and sediment exposure. Two percent of the entire s horeline area was oiled; th erefore, the risk score increased for a large spill because of the likelihood of more shoreline and in tertidal resources being affected. The risk scores in Table H.6.4-2 reflect th e predicted recovery rates for subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill volumes (Section 4.3.5.6). With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 an d 80 percent efficiency for a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) in a more widespread area and at high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in localized areas. The length of oiled shoreline was reduced by ne arly 60 percent when at both 45 and 80 percent efficiency. Because of the increase in potential exposure to oil for water column resources and the decrease in potential exposure for intertidal and shoreline resources, the risk scores did not change at either dispersant efficiency. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 an d 80 percent efficiency for a large spill, the modeling results showed water colu mn exposure at both low (1- 100 ppb) and high (100 -10,000 ppb) concentrations in a more widespread area. At 45 and 80 percent efficiency, shoreline oiling was reduced by 50 and 65 percent, respectively. Chemical dispersion increased water column exposure but decreased shoreline and intertidal exposure; therefore, the risk scores did not change at either dispersant efficiency. Although areas other than Prince William Sound in the Alaska region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all ot her regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on su bsistence resources will fall within a similar range Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-154 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills throughout the Alaska region. On a regional level, adverse effects on subsistence resources are not expected to be high, and on a local level, a large spill may cause high adverse effects on Native Alaskan communities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subsistence resources in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spills, and minor for large spills , with or without dispersant use. Historic Resources Under Alternative 1 using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), with or without the addition of chemical dispersion, adverse effects on historic resources in the Alaska region would likely be negligible, regardless of spill size. historic resources in this region occu r on- and offshore, and su bmerged shipwrecks occur offshore (Section 3.6.5.7). Over 1,000 prehistoric sites have been documented in the Gulf of Alaska. Most of these sites lie next to the shore and consist of subsiste nce resource-gathering areas. Historic sites consist mainly of early Russian settlements, fish and mining camps, and Wo rld War II artifacts. Some of these are located along the coast (Appendix F). There are limited data that identify lo ng-term or chronic degradation to historic resources due to chemical dispersion. Result s from several studies indicated that direct oiling caused negligible effects on cultural resources following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Bittner, 1996; Dekin, 1993; Reger et al., 1992; Wooley and 1995). Mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical dispersion may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, which will also reduce the amount of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to sensitive cultural resources. Offshore historic resources are not at risk of becoming oiled, and onshore sites tend to be above the affected area but could be protected during cleanup operations. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Recreation and Tourism Recreation and tourism are essential components of the Alaskan economy, generating $952 million in revenue per year and providing 18, 900 jobs. Approximately 1.3 million people visit Alaska annually traveling to the state for its wildlife, outdoor recreational opportunities, and scenery (ADC&ED, 2002). An oil spill would be expected to affect recreationis ts' overall social welf are; in addition, the social and economic implications of a spill would re ach beyond direct effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment above for more details). An analysis of the effect of the EXXON VALDEZ spill on the tourist industry highlights the importance of unconstrained travel within Prince William Sound to the economic health of the recreation and tourism sector. In the wake of the EXXON VALDEZ spill in 1989, tourism and corresponding revenues in Prince William Sound decreased. A survey c onducted by the McDowell Group (1990) estimated that tourist-related spendi ng in the south-central and southwest regions of Alaska fell after the spill by 8 and 35 percent, re spectively, representing a loss of approximately $19 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-155 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills million; 20 percent of visitors to south-central an d southwest Alaska reported changing their plans in the wake of the spill. In addition following the sp ill, 59 percent of busine sses in the area reported cancellations, with lodges, resorts, package tour co mpanies, guided outdoor activities, and charter and sightseeing boats feeling the greatest effects. Al though the demand for lodging, food, and other services remained constant in some parts of Prince William Sound because individuals involved in the remediation efforts required them, at times the needs of the cleanup crews were so great that tourists were squeezed out of popular destinations, unable to find accommodations or charter boats. This trend dominated areas close to the sp ill. Further, the perceived taint of Prince William Sound extended the negative effects of the spill beyond the immedi ate spill area. In recreational areas at some distance from the spill, perceived taint kept visitors away, and as a result to urism-related businesses in these areas experienced greater losses than those in other areas (McDowell Group, 1990). To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and chemical di spersion can reduce the geographic scope of surface water oiling, some combination of spill response options can be expected to reduce the risk to recreati on and tourism in the Alaska region. For a small spill in the Alaska region, the risk to recreation and tourism is low. In many cases, a spill of this size would be expected to pose little or no risk to marine-based activities because the spilled oil will never reach the shoreline above a threshold of concern. Any adverse effects that occur, however, would be reduced with chemical dispersion. The risk to recreation and tourism from a medium spill is likely to be greater than from a small spill. Using the basic response scenario (cu rrent levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium spill near the Alaskan coast will have a spill area above the corresponding thresholds of concern that will adversely aff ect approximately 419 million m 2 of marine waters used for recreation and tourism (T able H.6.4-1). Under these conditions, fishing, boating, and wildlife viewing may not be permitted in waters exposed to oil, causing losses in revenue to the recreation and tourism sectors of the coastal economy. These effects would be expected to reverber ate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decreases in tourism and recreation, and the revenue and employ ment associated with these industries. The risk to recreation and tourism of a medium spill can be further mitigated significantly with chemical dispersion. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent efficiency, the risk to resources essential to recreation and tourism along the Alaskan coast is reduced by approximately 45 percent, regardless of removal efficiency. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill will sweep approxim ately 770 million m 2 of marine waters used for recreation and tourism (Table H.6.4-1). A large spill may cause significant decreases in tourism, recreation, and the revenues of businesses associated with these industries. With chemical dispersion, the percentage of risk reduction for a large spill is slightly less dramatic than for a medium spill. Although eliminating the risk to shorel ine-dependent acti vities is not possible for large spills, at 45 and 80 percent efficien cy, chemical dispersion could be expected to reduce effects on recreation and tourism by 35 and 43 percent, respectively. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Alaska region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spill sizes, with or with out dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills. Any adverse Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-156 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are defined as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill, or through consumption of contaminated water or organisms. There are many areas in the Alaska region with high-population concentrations along the coast. However, adverse effects on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore for any of the spill sizes considered, regardless of the response options \u2014 mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to protect the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on workers' health are rela ted to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill respon se equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the worker certific ation and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The risk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. There are also protocols in place for the proper application and handling of dispersants. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Alaska region under Alternat ive 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. H.7. A LTERNATIVE 1 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE OCEANIA REGION Oceania is a collective name used for the islands sc attered throughout most of the Pacific Ocean. In its broadest sense, the term embraces the entire insular region between Asia and the Americas. For the purposes of this PEIS, the Oceania region will specifically cover the tropical waters surrounding the islands of Hawaii, Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Samoa (Figure 3.1-1). Midway, Jarvis , and Wake Islands are also included in some of the analysis. There was no location in this region with readily available data for modeling and risk assessment purposes, but the risks can be inferred from the range of effects observed in the five modeled locations. However, in some cases the modeling result s for the Florida Straits (actually in the Atlantic region) were used because it has similar resources of concern. The results of the Florida Straits modeling are detailed in Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Table H.7-1 presents the risk ranking for the modeling of Alternative 1 in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) for three sp ill sizes (small, 200 bbl; medium , 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). The risk scores presented in the table are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional considerations; however, in any specific oil spill situation local concerns could be higher. Table H.7-2 summarizes the significance of the potential beneficial and adverse impacts associated with Alternative 1 in the Oceania region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for an average spill to the region in general. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-157 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Although dispersant pre-authorization agreement ar eas exist in the Oceania region (Figure 2.2-1), under the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) of Alternative 1, appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical dispersion; thus, chemical dispersion is not considered in the analysis of the Oceania region. Further, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantly change the level of concern identified from those obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. For spills analyzed in this document (i.e., those that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore), there are likely to be minor or insignifican t adverse impacts on all resources except marine and coastal birds and intertidal habitats, which could be moderate, for a small spill using mechanical-only recovery. For medium and large spills, adverse impacts are insign ificant or minimal for all resources except for marine and coastal birds and sea turtles, which could be moderate, and intertidal habitats and areas of special concern, which could be significant. For a large spill, there is the additional potential for moderate adverse impacts on subsistence as well. All adverse impacts occur despite the treatment or recovery of some of the oil, but are reduced by these actions when they are effective. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-158 2009 H.

Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to w ater quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect water quality are the soluble aromatics, (monoaromatic hydrocarbons) and PAHs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) (Section 4.3.1.1). Thus, evaluation of potential adverse effects is based on the degree of potential contamination by these compounds. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effects of water quality are generally low, whether a mechanical-only recovery or mechanical recovery plus in situ burning is employed. This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid dilution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column. During periods of extreme turbulence, oil generally mixes into the water column where aromatics may dissolve rapidly, but resurfacing and dilution of oil droplets result in only localized contamination at levels of concern unless the dilution volume is rest ricted. Overall based on the modeling and risk assessment results, it is concluded that\u2014using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) \u2014adverse water-quality effects under Alternative 1 would be low in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Oceania region. However, if the spill moved into shallow an d confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills un der conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence or in areas where oil collect s for a few weeks to months after a spill. The variable used to determine potential water-quality effects is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentrat ion for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected wa ter volume increases with spill volume and varies with the level of physical dispersion during the time of the spill. Natural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of water that is c ontaminated above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of water contam inated increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume of water contamin ated for a small spill was extrapolated from the mean medium- and large-spill model results. The estimates of the volume of water contaminated \u2014 and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of th e same size throughout the Oceania region because the mixing of oil into water and process of dilution are similar in all areas. Coastal Florida Bay is used as a representative of coastal water for analyzing the Florida Straits, as well the Oceania region. Florida Ba y is approximately 16,288 km 2 in area and about 2 m deep on average, with a total volume of approximately 32,576 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of Florida Bay to determine the potential consequences of small, medium, and large spills (Table H.7.1-1). This approach yields a very conservative estimate, in that it assumes all of the contamination would occur in coastal water. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-161 2009 H.

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil may be incorporated into shallow water or intertid al sediments where, thro ugh leaching, it could become a continuing source of con tamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality wher e the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier I standards (beginning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concern to water quality would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have a low influence on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would apply whet her either response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expect ed to be insignificant for small spills, and minor for medium and large spills. Marine In marine waters, which are 3 or more stat ute mi offshore, mechanical response and in situ burning currently may be used for spill response in the Ocea nia region; although disp ersant pre-authorization agreement areas exist in the Oceania region (Figure 2.2-1), chemical dispersion is not used because appropriate response times cannot currently be met. As was done for coastal waters, the estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other ch emicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of the referen ce area, the Florida Straits. The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters around the islands in the Oceania region. The total surface area of the Florida Straits is approximately 42,689 km 2, so the area of interest is much vaster fo r marine waters than for coastal waters. Water- quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water \u201420 m deep, which is much shallower than most of the Oceania region's mari ne waters.

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Natural dispersion of the oil would be very rapid af ter a spill, and recovery time would be on the order of hours to days. Leaching from oil contamination reaching the sediments would not have a large effect on marine water quality because of the large dilution volume and natural dispersing forces in marine waters. The result s would apply whether or not a mechan ical response is implemented. Since in situ burning would replace some of the mechanical response, and both methods remove oil that would otherwise result in water contamination, the pot ential water-quality effects would not change significantly if in situ burning was used. For a spill in water deeper than the 20 m evaluated here, the potential adverse effects would be even smaller. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impact s on marine water quality in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expe cted to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an oil spill on air quality may involve all vol atile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are normally very localized and short lived for small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any po tential adverse effects: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-163 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The modeling shows that results do not vary by spill location or size in the Oceania region. Two possible sources of contamination to the atmosphere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilization of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). The results of the modeling show that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-only recovery; hence, th e risk scores are virtually identical for small, medium, and large spills. Volatilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill site. Eva poration off the water surfac e and volatilization from the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocarbon gases that disperses quic kly after a spill, such that the concentrations in the atmosphere at th e water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmosphere would be on the order of days. Thus, a low level of concern is expected for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical- only recovery. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via burning. For small spills, it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feasible (Table H.7.1-3). The maximum area potentially exceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km2 for a medium spill and 12.7 km2 for a large spill. If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wildlife ) are within these areas, they could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, and considering a region of inte rest equivalent to the Florida Straits (42,689 km2), the area of adverse effects would be less than 1 percent, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. Thus, low levels of concern are expected fr om small, medium, and large oil spills involving in situ burning (H.7.1-3).

Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals The species of cetaceans inhabiting the Oceania region (Section 3.7.2.1, Table F.7-1) have concentrations that vary depending on seasonal migrations. The only pinniped of concern in this region is the Hawaiian monk seal ( Monachus schauinslandi ); however, sightings are rare and scattered. There are no fur-bearing marine mammals of concern that inhabit this region. Thus, local populations of cetaceans, which are abundant in the Oceania region, are the primary concern during an oil spill (Section 3.7.2.1). Cetaceans such as whales and dolphins are vulnerable to spilled oil since they spend considerable time at the water's surface, which enhances possible contact with oil. The majority of these species remains offshore, and populations vary according to season and migration directions. Cetaceans appear able to detect and are likely to avoid floating oil or oil being recovered by m echanical means (Geraci, 1990). Studies have shown that cetacean skin is ne arly impenetrable to even the hi ghly volatile constituents of oil, indicating that contact with oil probably would be less harmful to cetaceans than often believed. However, the toxic, volatile fractions in fresh crude oils could irritate and damage cetacean soft tissues, such as the mucous membranes of the eyes and airways. The equivalent area for 100 percent mortality for ce taceans (the only marine mammals of concern) at all five modeled locations ranged from 0.08 to 0.11 km 2 (average area of 0.09 km2) for a medium spill and from 0.46 to 1.33 km2 (average 0.85 km2) for a large spill. Relative to the surface area available, this is a very small area, much less than 1 percent. Recovery would be relatively rapid, given that only sublethal effects, if any, would be expected. The results for marine mammals in the Oceania region are presented in Table H.7.2-1.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-165 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds are usually of highest concern during an oil spill because birds are highly susceptible to the acut ely toxic effects from exposure to oil. There are many areas in the Oceania region where high concentrations of birds may be found along the shore, particularly on small islands, in nearshore and estuarine habitats, or in offshore marine-water habitats (Section 3.7.2.2). Adverse effects on birds in this region would result mostly from oiling of small islands, wetlands, mangroves, and small marine-water habitats that serve as nesting and foraging habitats for seabirds, wading and marsh birds, shorebirds, gulls, terns, raptors, and waterfowl. Surface water oiling may also adversel y affect feeding and rafting seabirds (Section 3.7.2.2; see Section 4.3.2.2 for information on the main issues of concern for birds exposed to an oil spill). The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the Oceania region because this area has similar types of intertidal habitats and physical settings, and the spec ies present have similar habitat usage and behavior (Table H.7.2-2). The re sults from the other modeled locations were also considered. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the potential adverse effects on birds. Potential levels of concern for birds in the Oceania region are medium for all spill sizes, as discussed below. However, for a small spill very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and potential exposure to floating oil is only likely to occur in a small area. The potential for adverse effects increases with spill volume, with greatest concern for conditions where mangroves and sand beaches become heavily oiled and where exposure to floating oil occurs in a large area.

The majority of small islands in the area provide important nesting and roosting habitats for seabirds, while most mangroves and marshes provide important habitats for wading birds and waterfowl. Also, abundant seabirds, gulls, and terns use marine water habitats in this area, and high mortality rates are typical for these species during a spill. In the Oceania region, the ri sks to intertidal nesting, roosting, and foraging habitats are greater than in many other regions because a significant amount of shoreline habitat on Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-166 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills an island or group of small island s can be affected by a spill. Ther e may not be alternative sites for use until the habitat recovers, whic h would lead to a higher degree of adverse effect. Thus, the risk score was determined based on the possibility that a large number of birds in sensitive life stages may be concentrated in a relatively small area that is heavily oiled, possibly having limited opportunities for relocation to similar nearby habitats. It is important to recognize that adverse effects on birds may be more or less severe depending on the time of year and locations of their habitats, as well as the extent of shoreline and surface water oiling. Adverse effects on birds in the Oceania region for a small spill were determined by extrapolating from the results obtained for a medium spill in several regions. The volume of oil released in the small spill was approximately an or der of magnitude less than in the medium spill; therefore, the adverse effects on the bird populat ion were estimated to be propo rtionally less. The modeling of effects on birds for a medium spill under mechanical -only recovery resulted in estimates of 10 to 20 percent of the regional bird population being pote ntially adversely affected in most of the modeled locations, including the Florida Straits. Estimates of over 20 percent of regional bird populations being potentially affected at this spill volume were only determined for regions where large percentages of species flyways are documented to occur in the modeled locations (Delaware Bay). For a large spill, the modeling resulted in estimates of over 20 percent of the local area bird population being potentially adversely affected in all modeled locations. Th e risk scores in Table H.7.2-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates for birds of 1 to 3 years for most species, as was the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2). The estimated results for the Oceania region are consistent with those for all other regions modeled in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of effects on bird populations will fall within a similar range throughout this region. The addition of in situ burning does not change the significance of these adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these grou ps are of great concern. As described in Section 4.3.2.3, plankton and fish are adversely affected eith er directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil droplets mixed by waves into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is direct uptake of di ssolved oil components, or iginating directly from surface oil or dissolving from the mi croscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, as spill size increases, so do adverse effects. However, there is great variab ility related to the environmental conditions after a spill; plankton and fish suffer much greater adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather. In addition, many speci es utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they are more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved completely when oil comes ashore. Species and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic co mponents, with specie s from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stab le locations being more sensitiv e than those from polluted and environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposure during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-167 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floating oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapidly di sperse to background levels. However, there may be longer-term effects if the spill migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands where dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Juvenile fish are more abundant in salt marshes and seagrass beds than in other shallow subtidal and intertidal areas, so these areas are of most conc ern (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 1 in most cases, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm 1 of shore, but the dispersed oil plume could be transported by currents into this area. The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by oil spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percent loss multiplied by volume exposed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes we re translated to equivalent areas by multiplying by water depth at the spill site, allo wing comparison with other resources, such as birds and shorelines, which are distribute d on a per-area basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniforml y distributed when expres sed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by th e similar results for the four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, offshore Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Fran cisco (Parts B, C, D, and E, re spectively, of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) \u2014the equivalent areas of adverse effect on plankton and fish (both average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in this PEIS. The modeled sp ill site was in 20 m deep water: adverse effects would be smaller for deeper waters because of greater vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionately greater in shallower waters because of the restricted dilution potential. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much smaller. Thus, th e model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortality of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes am ong response scenarios. The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the Ocea nia region (Table H.7.2\u00ad 3) because the geography (characterized by islands), bottom topography (steeply sloping away from shore), environmental regime (warm, trade wind s, occasional severe storms) and ecosystems (subtropical-tropical, areas of coral reefs, seagrasses, etc.) are similar in the two regions. The adverse effects were estimated as a percentage of the total area of concern (42,689 km 2). Based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality would be affected for a small spill (Table H.7.1-2), the volume of adverse effects on plankton and fish woul d be low for a small spill using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.7.2-3). 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-168 2009 H.

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery ti me would be less than 1 year. Over all, based on the modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Oceania regi on under Alternative 1 would be localized to the immediate area around the spill site and similar in all marine water ar eas of the region. For large spills that might move rapidly into shallow coastal areas due to winds and currents, the concentrations of toxic components might be high enough to cause some level of concern for water column communities, especially early life history stages of fish and inverteb rates using intertidal and shallow subtidal areas. Based on the discussion in Pa rt D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), if the adversely affected area is marine-water habitat or for water column organisms with broad distribution over all subtidal habitats, a risk score of 4E applies. A risk score of 3C applies to co ral reefs, 4E applies to seagrass, and 3D applies to hard-bottom habitat organisms. Given that many spec ies and life stages of plankton and fish on and over coral reefs are more broadly distributed rather than restricted to the coral reefs (for example, they inhabit hard-bottom habitats as well), and that these organisms reproduce on time scales less than 1 year, the overall risk score of 4D is assign ed for plankton and fish for the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit). Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, and minor for medium and large spills. Intertidal Habitats Intertidal habitats in the Oceania region are always of great concern during oil spills, particularly when sensitive habitats such as mangroves are oiled because recovery can take decades. Mangroves and wetlands on many islands in this region are degraded and fragmented (Section 3.7.2.4), increasing the effects of an oil spill on the ov erall wetland functionality. Sand beaches are important ecologically and economically because of their high tourism value (Section 3.7.2.4). Sand beaches that are sea turtle nesting habitats are of great concern: adults concentrate in offshore areas Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-169 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills prior to nesting, the nests are at risk of direct oiling, and the hatchling are at risk of oiling as they escape to sea. The Oceania region has extensive ar eas of these sensitive habitats. For a discussion of the relative ranking of the sensitivity of in tertidal habitats to sp illed oil and the processes affecting oil fate and behavior on shorelines, see the explanation of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) in Section 4.3.2.4. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. In the Oceania region, the risks to intertidal habitats are greater than in many other regions because a significant amount of shoreline habitat on an island or group of small islands can be affected by a spill. Thus, there may not be altern ative sites for use until the habit at recovers, which would lead to a higher degree of adverse effects. The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the intertidal habitats in the Oceania region because they have similar types of intertidal habitats (mangroves, coral/rocky platforms and rubble, sand beaches) and physical settings. The results from the other modeling analyses were also considered. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed and, thus, does not reduce potential adverse effects. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats in the Oceania region are medium fo r a small spill, in that very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. However, the potential for adverse effects increases with spill volume, with the greatest concern for conditions where mangroves and sand beaches become heavily oiled. The risk scor es in Table H.7.2-4 are based on estimated effects on the intertidal habitats of the Florida Straits. Table H.7.2-4 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills * to Intertidal Habitats Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Oceania Region (Based on the Florida Straits) Spill Size Habitats Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 0-1 1E Medium > 20 1A Source: Adapted from Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Red represents a high level of con cern, and yellow, a medium level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the Florida Straits (as disc ussed in the text) as repr esentative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats for a small sp ill were determined to be medium by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting oiled mangroves to have a long reco very period. For a medium spill under mechanical-only recovery, the effects would vary widely depending on the spill location and the wind and current patterns. Spills on the leeward side of an island are not likely to strand onshore, while spills on the windward side of an island could result in extensive oiling of intertidal habitats. The modeling in offshore areas (excluding Prince William Sound) resulted in an average length of oiled shoreline of 13.8 km (range of 9.9 to 17.5 km). This extent of shoreline oiling Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-170 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills could represent a high percentage of an island's intertidal habitats. The risk score represents the conditions where the oil moved onshore rather than offshore and affected wetlands with a long recovery period. For a large spill, the modeling resulted in an average length of oiled shoreline in the f o u r m o d e l i n g a n a l y s e s o f 2 5 . 4 k m ( r a n g e o f 2 7 t o 5 6 k m ) . T h i s e x t e n t o f s h o r e l i n e o i l i n g c o u l d represent more than 20 percent of an island's intert idal habitats. Oiled wetlan ds could take more than 7 years to recover. Although no specific areas in Oceania were analyzed, results from other modeled locations can be used to represent the potential effects for spills where the oil moved onshore. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be mode rate for small spills, and significant for medium and large spills. Subtidal Habitats The subtidal (benthic) habitat consists of the bottom substrate below the low tide level, as well as the species that live in, on, and near the substrate. The O ceania region is unique in that most areas lack a broad shallow shelf and instead have a very narrow band of shallow subtidal habitat. The two most important habitat types in this area are seagrass be ds and coral reefs. The benthic coral community includes areas of hard substrate inhabited by dens e growth of sessile forms, including interspersed algae, corals, and sponges, and sandy or mu ddy bottoms. Organisms living in this area \u2014demersal species \u2014include corals, plants and seagrasses, benthic invertebrates (such as crabs, shrimp, snails, bivalve mollusks, and marine worms), and bot tom-dwelling fish. Because subtidal benthic communities do not include the intertidal zone, they are at little risk from floating oil because, by definition, this environment is al ways below the surface. The greatest risk of exposure comes from sinking oil, as well as in situ burn residue, dispersed oil, or the sorption of naturally dispersed or mechanically mixed oil that has become suspende d on sediments and is deposited onto the ocean floor. However, significant natural dispersion of oil and sediment into the water column only occurs during large storms or for nearshor e oil spills. Oil particles could adhe re to bottom substrate, plants, or animals, which could result in both physical co ating of organisms, as occurred in the 1993 BRAER spill in the Shetland Islands, and toxic effects from exposure to the chemical constituents (Section 4.3.2.5). Such adverse effects are not normally observed. The risk to fauna and flora of the subtidal benthic habitat using mech anical-only recovery is minimal, based on the diluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Relative to the results for the Florida Straits modeling location, the effects here will be substantially smaller because of the much greater w ater depth. This limits the exposure of demersal species to dissolved hydrocarbons, which was a concern at the Florida Straits location. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid dilution of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil residue potentially reaching the bottom substrate. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. It mi ght slightly increase the risk of remaining oil residues sinking to the bottom. Residual oil from in situ burning that reaches the bottom is expected to have little or no adverse effects on subtidal habitats since the majority of its toxic components would have either evaporated or been destroyed during burning and the volume of residue produced is so small (Section 4.3.2.5) . Under the modeled conditions, the quantity of in situ burn residue produced would not result in a level of concern that exceeds low. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-171 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the data for medium and large spills for th e other regions' modeled locations (especially the Florida Straits), the potential adverse effects on subtidal habitat are considered to be low (Table H.7.2-5). Table H.7.2-5 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Subtidal Habitats Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Oceania Region Spill Size Habitats Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 0-1 3E Source: Adapted from Parts B through F of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the five modeled locations (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Se ction 4.3), potential regional advers e impacts on subtidal habitats in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spills, and minor for large spills. Areas of Special Concern The potential adverse effect on areas of special concern, such as National Marine Sanctuaries and National Wildlife Refuges, are impor tant during an oil spill since these areas are under increased scrutiny and protection. Whereas most coastal and ne arshore areas have a wide range of habitats or are very similar to other areas throughout the Oceania region, areas of special concern are set aside for their uniqueness (Appendix F, Tables F.7-4 thro ugh F.7-6 and Figures F.7-6 through F.7-11). The potential risks associated with shoreline areas of special concern are identical to those discussed for intertidal habitats. The risks to subt idal resources, such as protected coral reefs, are identical to those discussed for subtidal habitats. For this analysis, th e risks to areas of specia l concern are assumed to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Sections H.7.2), whichever are greater. Since the risk to intertidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. The potential effects on areas of special concern are medium for a small spill but may increase to high levels for medium and large spills, depending on the location of the spill (Table H.7.2-6). Potential concerns associated with medium and large spills increase to high levels because of the potential to contaminate a major portion of the intertidal zone of a small island (see discussion of intertidal habitats). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-172 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Table H.7.2-6 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Areas of Special Concern Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Oceania Region Spill Size Areas Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 0-1 1E Medium > 20 1A Source: Adapted from Parts B through F of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Red represents a high level of con cern, and yellow, a medium level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the five modeled locations (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Since areas of special concern are scattered througho ut the Oceania region, th ey are unlikely to be disproportionately affected by the average spill. If an area of special concern was highly adversely affected, it is anticipated that recovery time would be the same as for other intertidal habitats. These areas are most at risk from floating oil and bene fit from any actions that reduce the potential for oiling. Although tropical areas other than the Florida Straits were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS ; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on areas of special concern will fall within a similar range throughout the Oceania region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), pote ntial regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small spills, and significant for medium and large spills, based on the risk to intertidal habitats. H.7.3. Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species The Oceania region has a variety of threatened, endangered, or candidate species (Section 3.7.3). The overall regional risk that a threatened, endangered, or candidate species would be adversely affected or even present in the area of a spill is low; however, killing a single individual of such a species can be considered a severe adverse effect. Potential adve rse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, or fish that are threatened , endangered, or candidate species are identical to those discussed in Section H.8.2 for these groups. Potential adverse effects on the five species of threatened or endangered sea turtles (not included with other biological resources) were discussed in Section 4.3.3.1. Sea turtles are a particular concern if the spill occurs in the vicinity of a nesting beach. Overall, the highest risk scores were calculated for coastal an d marine birds with other species at lower risk. Regardless of species, any effects affecting the re production of these species or resulting in death should be considered high. Adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species in the Oceania region for any spill size is difficult to predict. Depending on the location and season, the number and type of species present Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-173 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills will vary. Based on the overall size of the Oceani a region and the small populations of threatened, endangered, or candidate species i nhabiting this region, the likelihoo d of affecting an individual of concern would be low unless the spill affects impor tant shoreline or critical marine habitats. The severity of the effect will vary depending on the sensitivity of the individuals present. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce potential adverse effects. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills, ba sed on the risk to marine and coastal birds. H.7.4. Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat Virtually all waters (both water column and benthic substrate) in the Oceania region from shore to 400 m depth are Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). The primary issue with respect to EFH is either (1) exposure of sensitive resources in the water column to hydrocarbon concentrations of concern, or (2) the contamination of bottom sediments, both of which could lead to either acute or chronic exposures. Adverse effects would include either the death of individual organisms, the possibility of sublethal effects affecting long-term population viability, or de gradation of habitat that reduces its availability to managed species. For this analysis, the risks to EFH are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Section H.7.2), whichever are greater. Since the risk to plankton and fish is greater, those risk scores were used. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce potential adverse effects. The data presented for medium spills in Section H.7.2 indicate low risk from both sediment and water column contamination. In comparison to the situation in the Florida Straits, deep water is present in most of the Oceania region very close to shore, providing a high degree of protection to EFH resources. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, and minor for medium and large spills, based on the risk to plankton and fish. H.7.5. Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Section 4.3.5, oil spills can produ ce a variety of adverse economic and social effects. Some of the most visible and large adverse effects on the Oceania region are likely to include effects on water- and shore-based recreation, commercial fish eries, and tourism. In addition, large spills have the potential to adversely affect residents and econo mies of coastal communities to a greater extent than the general population. This modeling considers the risk of adverse soci oeconomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreati onal activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceived taint; closure of comme rcial fishing grounds or hatcheries, or reduced commercial harvests; and altered mari ne transportation patterns. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on soci al and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may cause change s in employment and firm revenues of resource- based businesses. While these effects are not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and relative measures of the over all risk of adverse social and economic effects of small, medium, and large oil spills using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) in the Oceani a region. (Although disper sant pre-authorization Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-174 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills agreement areas exist in the Oceania region [F igure 2.2-1], appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical dispersion.) The methodology is described in more detail in the Atlantic Region (Section H.2.5). There is no existing standard for \"significance\" related to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface water must be oiled to be considered a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the effect will depend on a numb er of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, loca l), opportunities for resource substitution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of low concern if it is not of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the modeled effects under all modeled scenar ios would likely be low at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that occur would be expected to be localized in nature. This modeling assumes that the risk posed by oil sp ills to the socioeconomic environment is directly related to the extent to which resources are affected above selected thresholds of concern \u2014for the Oceania region, the square meters of marine water oiled above the threshold of concern. Comparing the absolute risk of adverse socioeconomic effects (e.g., meters of sandy shoreline oiled above a recreational threshold of concern) across spill scenarios, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understanding of the relative risk of adverse socioeconomic effects across these scenarios. In this section, only basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) results are examined. Determining relative risk also allows for extrapolation of site-specific results to the entire region. For example, the risk estimates presented below are based on modeled hypothetical sp ills affecting the Florida Straits. (Because of its geographic and economic similarities to the Oceania region, the Florida Straits is an appropriate surrogate for the Oceania region in this modeling .) While any given spill may exhibit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic effect, the rela tive risk measures are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations, especially in island regions, as long as spills occur in areas where mechanical recovery and/or in situ burning are feasible. In addi tion, the conclusions reached for the Florida Straits are supported by results for other modeled areas \u2014the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assumption s across spill size is similar in magnitude. Table H.7.5-1 highlights the effects of small, medium, and large oil spills on the Oceania region's socioeconomic resour ces by presenting estimates of resour ces oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute terms (area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of the total resource base in the modeled area (Florida Straits). The threshold of concern because of surface wa ter oiled is 0.01 g/m 2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). This resource area is based on an estimate of the exte nt to which the coastal community in the modeled area potentially relies on each resource. For the Oceania region, length of shoreline oiled above the threshold of concern is not considered relevant. A si ngle metric was selected for this region because (1) the shoreline oiling results from the Florida Straits were highly sensitive in the modeled spill location; (2) the ability to identify shoreline with characteristics amiable to use (i.e., sandy shore) was limited; and (3) area of surface water oiled above th e threshold of concern was expected to provide a more accurate measure of expected risk, given the region's geographic characteristics. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-175 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life potentially affected by an oil spill.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 Thresholds above which some economic or social risk is expected were determined, and the area of surface water oiled above this threshold for the average modeled spill are reported. The threshold of concern because of oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m 2 of oil (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). || Percentages reflect the proportion of the total modeled area above the threshold of concern. \u00a7 A 200-bbl spill is assumed to have negligible effect. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Coastal communities benefit from and rely on the marine environment to provide residents with sustenance, livelihoods, le isure opportunities, and shipping avenue s. Individuals who live and work in close proximity to the coast derive both social and economic rewards from the natural beauty, recreational opportunities, quality of life, economic re sources, and cultural attr ibutes associated with these coastal locations. These reward s are derived from asse ts such as National Parks, public beaches, fishing opportunities, and commercial and tourism-related industries. Thus, oil spills can affect any number of a coastal community's assets, leading to adverse effects on the economic benefits of community activities. Thes e effects, in turn, can impose changes on that community's demographic and employment patterns. In addition to direct employment and other adverse economic effects on marine resource-based economi c sectors associated with oil spills, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on coas tal communities. For example, the islands of the Oceania region\u2014 Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and CNMI \u2014are at risk of ad verse economic and social effects from an oil spill that affects tourists because of their reliance on tourism for employment and revenues. In 2 000, Hawaii logged almost 62 milli on visitor-days and generated $10.9 billion in tourism-related expenditures (HDBEDT, 2001a). Further, the lure of these coastal communities to their residents and visitors alike is the pristine na tural surroundings. To the extent that an oil spill disrupts these amenities, coasta l communities will face adverse economic effects. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-176 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The importance of marine transportation to the deli very of goods to these islands of the Oceania region implies an added vulnerability. Although there are substitute mean s of transportation, a disruption in waterborne commerce can be costly in terms of delivery delays. Finally, commercial fishing is important to all these communities and to American Samoa in particular. The American Samoa Office of Tourism (ASOT, 2002) estimates that the local canned tuna industry employs one- third of the island's population; tuna fishing and processing are thought to be the \"backbone\" of the island's private sector. Given their reliance on mari ne resources, coastal communities on the Oceania region's islands are likely to be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of a spill than communities located on the mainland. For a small spill in the Oceania region, there is little risk to coastal communities (Table H.7.5-1). The risk to coastal communities under the medium spill s cenario is likely to be greater than under a small spill. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium sp ill will sweep approx imately 312 million m 2 of marine waters in the spill area1 above the corresponding threshold of concern (Table H.7. 5-1). The economic and social losses will occur in marine waters that exceed the thresholds of concern. For example, beaches in the Oceania region may be closed to vi sitors and fishing may not be permitted in waters exposed to oil, causing losses in revenue to the tourism and commercial and recreational fishery sectors of the coastal economy. The resulting adve rse effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing short-term decreases in employment, income, the viability of associated businesses, and the appeal of coastal living. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk to co astal communities. Using th e basic response scenario (current levels of m echanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill will sweep approximately 659 million m 2 of marine waters (Table H. 7.5-1) potentially important to commercial and recreational fishery activities in the spill area. A spill of this size would affect the pleasure that coastal residents and visitors derive from coastal acti vities and the economic contribution that recreational and commercial fishing resources make to local income and employment. A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in local to urism, commercial and recreational fishing sectors, and the employment and revenues they generate, as described in more detail in subsequent sections. Further, the contamination of the shoreline may adversely affect the quality of coastal living. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. The adverse impacts of a large spill would be similar to those for a medium spill and wo uld generally be limited to the spill area \u2014the adverse impacts would not be felt at the re gional economic level. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affe cted for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.7.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the la rgest spill scenarios. Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, indu stries, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affect ed by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer direct and indirect adve rse economic effects from an oil 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-177 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease reve nue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisherie s, by both anglers and by related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated entirely. Tourism and as sociated businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected co astal areas decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived resource taint. A small spill that is 3 or more statute mi offshore would have essentially no adverse effect on either the local or regional economies (Table H.7.5-1). Th ere is little to no risk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any co mmercial fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. A medium spill, with mechanical recovery and in situ burn operations, could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oiling recreational resources, limited closing of fisheries and recreational areas, and the need to supplement the normal response operation employment base. These adverse effects would probably be very short lived \u2014cleanup operations would not require a long period of time and wo uld be local in nature. A large spill's adverse economic effects could be high for the local ec onomy, even with mechanical recovery and in situ burning, based on the anticipated level of marine -water oiling and the possibility that closure of commercial and recreational fishing grounds will occur. While the adverse e ffects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tour ism, could cause adverse socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.7.5-1]); any advers e impacts are expected to be localized (and could be substantial) \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impact s are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore are not likely to cause large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports; any adverse effects would likely be of short duration. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commerce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft movement as a means of facilitating spill response. Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or increase in travel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, an d the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. This issue is particularly relevant to the island s of the Oceania region. In 2000, 5.3 million tons of cargo was transported to Honolulu , Hawaii, on 1,292 vessels, and an additional 2 million tons of cargo were transported to Hono lulu from other Hawaiian Island s (HDBEDT, 2001b). In Guam, the port authority estimates that it handles 2 milli on tons of cargo per year with its five cargo- handling piers and 26.5 acres of container storag e (PAOG, 2002). To the ex tent that mechanical recovery and in situ burning reduce the surface area of slic ks above a threshold of concern, some combination of spill response options will reduce the risk to marine transportation and port facilities. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-178 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills While these adverse effects would affect the ease with which vessels access ports, they will also affect the economic sectors that depend on the efficient movement of goods to and from ports. Although the possibility exists that the affected area's trade partners will be affected by interruptions in vessel transportation in the spill area, the availability of substitute means of transportation and sources of goods and products indicates that any closures wo uld be unlikely to generate large adverse effects outside of the spill area. For a small spill, no great adverse effects on vesse l transportation or ports are expected (Table H.7.5-1), but there is some risk of adverse effects for medium and large spills. Therefore, the nature of the risk to vessel transportation will be a function of the locati on, area, and pattern of surface water oiling, as well as the extent of o iling in port areas. A medium or large spill in the Oceania region, however, would not generally be ex pected to result in large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports since any effects would likely be short lived \u2014that is, even if shipping waters or ports are exposed to oil and ar e therefore closed, as soon as recovery efforts remove surface oil, these facilities would be expected to be reopened. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4. 3), potential regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m 2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Table H.7.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized (and could be substantial) \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerab le to oil spills because of both closures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to high revenue losses for the commercial fishing industry, as well as related indu stries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from commercial fleets. In addition, oil spills can lead to a decreased demand for fish from affected waters because of actual or perceived taint and can instigate alterations to fishing practices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or decreases revenues. In the Oceania region, commercial fishing is an important economic activity. Tuna dominates the catch in Hawaii and American Samo a: in 2001, 70 percent of Hawaii's total fish landings were tuna (NMFS, 2004a), and 20 percent of U.S. canned tuna is supplied by American Samoa, with almost one-third of the island's population employed in co mmercial operations related to this industry (ASOT, 2002). To the exte nt that mechanical and in situ burning reduce the surface area of slicks above a threshold of concern, some combination of response op tions will reduce the risk to regionally important fisheries. For a small spill in the Oceania region, the risk to commercial fisheries is negligible using the basic response scenario (cur rent levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.7.5-1). For a medium spill, the risk to commercial fisheries is likely to be much greater than for a small spill. A medium spill in the Oceania region will sweep approximately 312 million m2 of marine waters used by the commercial fishing industry above the corresponding Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-179 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills threshold of concern (Table H.7.5-1). A risk of economic loss to commercial fisheries will occur when waters exceed relevant management and/or risk ba sed-thresholds. For example, fishing may not be permitted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold of concern, resulting in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting adverse effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the ar ea of the spill, causing decreases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, sp ill effects on the commercial fishing economy may be less severe. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk of adverse effects on commercial fisheries. This risk to commercial fisheries increases with a large spill, as the size of the oiled area increases. A large spill presents risk to approximately 659 million m 2 of the marine waters potentially important to commercial fisheries above the corr esponding threshold of concern (Table H.7.2-4). A spill of this size may cause significant decreases in local commercial fi shing activities and revenues, and may negatively affect the revenues of associated businesses. To th e extent that commercial fishing operations can, for a time, move to substitute fishing grounds, the potentially severe effects of even a large spill may be avoided. Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will not generally be at the regional or national levels but could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commercial fishing activities, in square meters of oiled surface water above the corresponding threshold of concern. The effects of an oil spill on recreational fishery-related activities will be fe lt more heavily by various populations, including recreational anglers and firms that supply goods an d services to recreational anglers. For example, recreational anglers fish for pleasure or sport, as opposed to monetary gain. In the wake of an oil spill, such anglers may choose to fish at a substi tute location, may experience a reduced quality of experience, or may choose to forgo fishing entirely. The losses suffered will be related to these missed opportunities. In addition, while closing waters to recreational fishing will decrease the social welfare of recreationists, it would also be expected to affect the demand for boat rentals and other services consumed by fishing enthusiasts. For a small spill, adverse effects on recreational re sources in the Caribbean region would likely be negligible (Table H.7.5-1). The risk to recreational fi shing activities for a medium spill is likely to be much greater than for a small spill. A medium spill will sweep approximately 312 million m 2 of marine waters used by the recreational fishermen above the corresponding threshold of concern. For a large spill, there is substantial risk to re creational fishing, approximately 659 million m2 of the marine waters potentially important to recreational fishing in the spill area. A spill of this size may harm businesses associated with recreational fishing. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m2 of surface water above recognized threshol ds [Table H.7.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-180 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Subsistence Potential adverse effects on marine species are a concern during spills where traditional use of subsistence resources occurs. Pelagic and reef fish and shellfish collected on reefs and in intertidal habitats have been the major species gathered for subsistence in the Oceania region in recent times (Section 3.7.5.5). Tissue tainting would be the primary adverse effect for these subsistence resources. The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of subsistence resources in the Oceania region because they have similar types of species (pelagic and reef fish and invertebrates) and intertidal (mangroves, coral/rocky platforms, rubble, sand beaches) and subtidal (coral reefs/hard bottom, seagrass beds, macroalgae) habitats. The resu lts from the other modeled locations were also considered. Under Alternative 1, the addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse effects nor increase risk to subsistence resources. Potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Oceania region are low for small spills (Table H.7.5-2). However, the potential for adverse effects increases with spill volume, with greatest concern for conditions where nearshore habitats around small islands with subsistence communities become heavily oiled. Table H.7.5-2 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills * to Subsistence Using the Basic Response Scenario in the Oceania Region Spill Size Resources Affected (estimated %) Risk Score\u00a7 Small (200 bbl) 0-1 4E Medium > 20 4A Source: Adapted from Part B through F of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Yellow represents a medium level of c oncern, and green, a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the five modeled locations (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Effects on subsistence resources fo r a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. For a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure to dissolved aromatics to be at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) and to only occur in small areas. Tainting of fish and invertebrates becomes a concern when water concentrations exceed approximately 100 ppb (Sectio n 4.3.5.6). Sediment exposure also on ly occurred in a few small areas. The extent of adverse effects on intertidal re sources for a medium spil l using mechanical-only recovery would vary widely depending on the spill location and wind and current patterns. Modeling of medium spills in offshore areas resulted in an average length of shorelin e oiled of 12.2 km (range of 9.4 through 17.5 km), which would represent a significant percentage of an island's intertidal habitats (5 -10%). Accounting for both pelagic resources (which are less likely to be affected) and intertidal resources, the estima ted percentage of subsistence resources adversely affected for a medium spill in the Oceania region was 1 to 5 per cent. The risk scores in Table H.7.5-2 reflect the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-181 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills predicted recovery rates for subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill volumes (Section 4.3.5.6). For a large spill, the modeling results showed wa ter column exposure at high concentrations (100 - 10,000 ppb) in a widespread area. (Water column exposure at high concentrations was more localized and/or farther offshore in the Pacific and Alaska regions.) Sediment exposure was negligible in all cases. The average length of shoreline oiled in the four offshore modeling analyses for a large spill was 25.4 km (range of 27 through 47 km), which would represent over 20 percent of the intertidal habitats on an island. Because subsistence use of resources makes up a substantial portion of the diets of some Native Islanders in the Pacific, and relocating to non-oiled areas may be impossible on a small island that is heavily affected by a large spill, the risk scores for pelagic resources were based on the Oceania region model, where water column exposure at high concentrations was widespread. Accounting for both intertidal and pelagic resources , the estimated risk for subsistence resources for a large spill in the Oceania region was over 20 percent. While adverse effects on subsistence resources are not likely to be high on a regional level for a small spill, they may increase with spill volume. On a local level, medium or large spills may cause hi gh adverse effects on subsistence communities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on subsistence resources in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant, minor, and moderate for small, medium, and large spills, respectively. Historic Resources Under Alternative 1, using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), adverse effects on historic resources in the Oceania region are expected to be low. Known cultural resources in this region occur mostly onshore or in shallow coastal waters (Section 3. 7.5.7). Results from several stud ies indicated that direct oiling caused negligible effects on cultural resources following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Bittner, 1996; Dekin, 1993; 1995). Mechanic al-only recovery or mechanical recovery plus in situ burning may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, which will also reduce the amount of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to sensitive historic structures. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. Recreation and Tourism The islands of the Oceania region provide visitors and residents the opportunity to enjoy a number of outdoor recreational activities and scenic vistas. For example, the be aches, water sports, and natural beauty of these areas make them popular with vaca tioners. In 2000, Hawaii logged almost 62 million visitor-days, which generated $10.9 billion in ex penditures (HDBEDT, 2001a). Guam heavily depends on tourism to support its economy: In 1995, 7 mill ion visitors arrived on Guam. The government of this island considers tourism to be \"the drivin g force of the Guam economy.\" A recent government report estimated that the tourism in dustry generates more than 50 pe rcent of private sector revenues (Hiles and Webb, 1996). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-182 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills An oil spill would be expected to af fect recreationists' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and economic implications of a sp ill would reach beyond direct ef fects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment). For a small spill in the Oceania region, the risk to recreation and tourism is negligible using the basic response scenario (cur rent levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.7.5-1). Because of the small surface water area exposed to oil as a result of a small spill, water-based attractions, such as beach visitati on, may experience little or no adverse effects. For a medium spill, the risk to recreation and touris m is likely to be greater than for a small spill. Using the basic response scenario (curre nt levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a medium spill will adversely affect approximately 312 million m 2 of recreational waters in the spill ar ea above the corresponding thresh old of concern (Table H.7.5-1). Under these conditions in the Ocea nia region, beaches in the spill ar ea may be closed to visitors, and fishing and boating may not be permitted in wate rs exposed to oil, causing losses in revenue to the recreation and tourism sectors of the coasta l economy. These effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decreases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with recreation and tourism. For a large spill, there is a substantial risk to recreation and tourism. Using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit), a large spill will adversely affect approximately 659 million m2 of recreational waters in the spill area (Table H.7.5-1). A spill of this size may cause signif icant decreases in tourism, recreation, associated business activities and revenues, and the quality of coastal living. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Oceania region under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (affecting up to 659 million m2 of surface water above recognized thresholds [Tab le H.7.5-1]); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are defined as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill. Most areas in the Oceania region have high population concentrations along the coast. However, adverse effe cts on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore for an y of the spill sizes considered, regardless of the response options \u2014mechanical recovery and/or in situ burning \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to protect the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are re lated to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill response equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the worker certification and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The ri sk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-183 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Oceania regi on under Alternative 1 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills. H.8. A LTERNATIVE 3 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE ATLANTIC REGION For the purpose of this PEIS, the Atlantic region wi ll specifically cover the waters extending from the Gulf of Maine to the Florida Straits (Figure 3.1-1). The location selected for modeling and risk assessment purposes was a site offshore Delaware Bay because it is in a high-traffic area at greater risk for oil spills. Modeling results from this location were evaluated relative to the geographic area in Section B.1.2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), herein referred to as the Mid- Atlantic Shelf. The Mid-Atlantic Shelf encompasses three biogeographical provinces: New York-New Jersey Shelf, Delaware Bay, and Delmarva Shelf. In general, the Mid-Atlantic Shelf is representative of offshore sites throughout the region and provides a basis for the modeling of potential environmental effects. The results of the modeling \u2014used to evaluate spills of concern in this risk analysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore) \u2014are presented in detail in Part B of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and summarized in this section. Table H.8-1 presents the risk ranking for the modeling of Alternative 3 in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent recovery efficiency 1 for three spill sizes (small, 200 bbl; medium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). (Based on the discussion of Alternative 3 presented in Section 2.8.3, a 25 percent increase in mechanical recovery capability would not change the effect iveness of the basic response scenario under Alternative 1.) The risk scores presented in the table are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional cons iderations; however, in any sp ecific oil spill situation local concerns could be higher. Table H.8-2 summarizes the significance of the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 3 in the Atlantic region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for the average spill to the region in general. Without the addition of chemical dispersion, the results are unchanged from the basic response scenario (see the discussion in Section H.2). In su mmary, there is a minor or insignificant regional adverse impact to all resources, except for moderate impacts on marine and coastal birds, for small and medium spills, and moderate im pacts on intertidal habitats and areas of special concern for 80 percent dispersant efficiency for large spills. Furt her, as explained in the introduction to Section 4.7, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantl y change the level of concern identified from those obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. Under the available response options of Alternative 3, the addition of chemical dispersion helps mitigate, but does not eliminate, potential adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds, intertidal habitats, and areas of special concern for medium and large spills without significantly increasing the risk to water column or subtidal resources. There is a slight increase in the risk score for coastal water quality when chemical dispersion is used on large spills. 1 Recovery efficiency represents the operating effectiveness of the dispersant: the greater the efficiency, the more effective t he dispersant.

Risk factors reflect the ratio of the percentage of the model area or volum e oiled using the basic response scenario to the percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion. For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of risk equal to one-fifth that expected with response limited to the basic response scenario. ** Index cannot be calculated for small spills since they were not modeled. Length of shoreline oiled above the threshold of concern is not considered relevant: (1) the shoreline oiling results were hig hly sensitive in the modeled spill location; (2) the ability to identify shoreline with characteristics amenable to use was limited ; and (3) area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern was ex pected to provide a more accurate measure of expected risk, given the region's geographic characteristics.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills H.8.1 Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to water quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect wa ter quality are the soluble aromatics, MAHs (monoaromatic H.2.1), even with chemical dispersion. Thus, evaluation of potential adverse effects is based on the degree of potential contamination by these comp ounds. Under Alternative 3, chemical dispersion could increase soluble aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in areas where dispersants are applied. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effects on water quality are low for small, medium, and large oil spills, regardless of the response option used (mechanical recovery with or without in situ burning and chemical dispersion). This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid di lution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column, even after periods of extreme turbulence that induce relatively high dissolution rates. Dispersants would be appl ied to surface oil after much of the evaporation of the toxic components occurs because of logi stics (i.e., greater than 12 hours after the spill), such that the resulting increase of concentratio ns of toxic components in the water column would be relatively small. Overall, based on the modeling and risk assessment results, it is concluded that \u2014using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion \u2014adverse water-quality effects under Alternative 3 would be low in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Atlantic region. If an offshore spill moved into shallow and confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills under conditions where o il is mixed into water by strong turbulence. Chemical dispersion would not be used in shallow and confined coastal waters (less than 3 statute mi from shore) under Alternative 3, so it could only contribute to adverse water-quality effects in those areas if the dispersed oil plume drifted into the area before being diluted. The variable used to determine the potential effects on water quality is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentrat ion for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected water volume increases with spill volume and the level of physical or chemical dispersion during the time of the spill. Natural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of wate r that is contaminated above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of water contaminated increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume of wate r contaminated for a small spill was extrapolated from the mean medium- and large- spill model results. Potential adverse water-quality effects in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.1 and summarized in Tables H.2.1\u00ad 1 and H.2.1-2 for coastal and marine waters, respectively (the results for coastal and marine water quality are included in Tables H. 8.1-1 and H.8.1-2 for comparison). Coastal In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi of shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 3. In marine waters 3 or more statute mi from shore, the basic response scenario Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-187 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion could be used under Alternative 3 in the Atlantic region. If dispersants were applied offshore, the dispersed oil plume could move into these nearshore areas. Since chemical dispersion would not be used in these areas, the level and duration of exposure would be negligible beca use of dilution. Delaware Bay is used as a representative of coastal water for analyzing the Mid-Atlantic Shelf, as well as the Atlantic region. Delaware Bay is approximately 2,669 km 2 in area and about 10 m deep on average, with a total volume of approximately 26,690 million m3. The estimated tota l volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of Delaware Bay to determine the potential consequences of smal l, medium, and large spills (Table H.8.1-1). This approach was used both with and without dispersant use, and yields a very conservative estimate in that it assumes all of the contamination would occur in coastal water. Since dispersants could not be employed in such areas, this would imply that the dispersed oil plume moved directly into coastal waters without dilution, which will not occur. Because of natural dilution, eva poration, and biological processe s, contaminati on levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil may be incorporated into shallow water or intertidal sediments where, through leaching, it could become a continuing source of contamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality where the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Be cause mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier I standards (begin ning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concern to water qualit y would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have little influenc e on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would appl y whether either response is implemented.

Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expect ed to be insignificant fo r small and medium spill sizes, and minor for large spill sizes, with or wi thout dispersant use. Marine The Mid-Atlantic Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters in the Atlantic region. The total surf ace area of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf is approximately 68,541 km2, so the area of interest is much vaster for marine waters than for coastal waters. Water-quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water\u201418 m deep, which is much shallower than most of the Atlantic region's marine wate rs.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biolog ical processes, oil contamination levels would decrease rapidly even after a large spill, with or without chemical dispersion, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. The estimated volume of contaminated water \u2014and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Atlantic region because natural and chemical oil dispersion into the water column and dilution processes are similar in all areas. The results in Table H.8.1-2 are nearly identical (w ith some uncertainty reflected in the variability of the results) for 45 and 80 percent efficiency because the amount of dispersants used at 45 percent efficiency is sufficient to treat all dispersi ble surface oil, for spills up to 40,000 bbl. For a small spill, the volume of water contaminated would be the same as under Alternative 1 because, due to logistics, dispersants could only be applie d after a small spill has mostly dispersed naturally. Chemical dispersion for medium or large spills increases the volume of water contaminated \u2014and the percentage of the area of concern \u2014that would be adversely affected by about a factor of two, which is still a small volume relative to that of the entire modeled area. In situ burning (in combination with mechanical recovery and chemical dispersion) would not significantly change the volume contaminated or the effect on water quality since it would substitute for some of the mechanical response. Based on the modeling results (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on marine water quality in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-190 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an oil spill on air quality may involve all volatile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and ot her contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concer n. However, adverse air quality ef fects from oil spills are normally very localized and shor t lived for small, medium, and la rge oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any potential adverse ef fects: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized an d rapidly diluted. Chemical dispersion reduces the volatilization of unburned oil to the atmosphere to only a slight extent, so that effects are essentially identical with or without dispersant use. Potential adverse effects on air quality in the Atlant ic region using the basic response scenar io (current levels of mechanic al recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.1 and summarized in Table H.2.1-3. Two possi ble sources of atmospheric contamination were evaluated for their potential effect s on air quality: volatilization of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). As discussed in Section H.2.1, the results of the modeling show that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving me chanical-only recovery; he nce, the risk scores are virtually identical for medium and large spills . Volatilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill site. Evaporation off the water surface and volatilization from the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocarbon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentrations in the atmosphere at the water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmosphere would be on the order of days. Thus, a low level of concern is expected for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3, the addition of chemical di spersion does not change the results from those under Alternative 1 (Table H.2.1- 3), which were already low. Chem ical dispersion would disperse some of the volatile hydrocarbons into the water resulting in the volatile hydrocarbons entering the atmosphere over a larger area than would occu r without chemical dispersion. Thus, dispersants further dilute hydrocarbon concentrations in the atmosphere. The modeling shows that results are low for a spill of any size involving some combination of mechanical response and chemical dispersion at any spill site in the Atlantic region. Adverse effects of in situ burning on air quality are summarized in Table H.2.1-3; these results ap ply whether chemical di spersion is modeled on unburned oil, and they do not vary by the location of the burn. Thus, the results for Alternative 1 apply to Alternative 3 for all areas in the Atlant ic region. The modeling was performed for weather conditions where dilution in the air would be relatively slow, so the estimated adverse effects are overestimated for other conditions. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning, with or without chemical dispersion, would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via in situ burning. For small spills, it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feasible (Table H.2.1-3). The maximum area potentially exceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km 2 for a medium spill and 15.8 km2 for a large spill (Table H.2.1-3). If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wildlife) are within these areas, th ey could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, a region of interest e quivalent to the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (68,541 km2) would have less than 1 percent Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-191 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills of its area adversely affected, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. The addition of chemical dispersion does not change the results under Alternative 1 in Table H.2.1-3. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on air quality in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without in situ burning. H.8.2 Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals Potential adverse effects on marine mammals in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.2 and summarized in Table H.2.2-1(the results in Table H.2.2-1 are included in Table H.8.1-3 for comparison). Exte nsive marine mammal populations are not at risk in the Atlantic region. The likelihood of a spill affecting an area where these populations are found is low unless a spill occurs in the immediate vicini ty of a haulout area, which is reflected in the low risk scores. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on marine mammals in that larger spills tend to spread across a larger surface water area and have higher shoreline oil loading. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3 for small, medium, and large sp ills, the contaminated surface water area is small when compared with the overall surface wate r area in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (68,541 km2), so the likelihood of marine mammals becomi ng oiled at the surface is minimal. Very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. Thus, the potential risk of oiling a haulout area or breeding grounds is small. Potential adverse effects increase as spill volume increases, with greatest concern for conditions where haulout areas, bays, estuaries, and known breeding grounds could become heavily oiled. If a local population of marine mammals is affected, it is estimated that it would take 1 to 3 years to recove r. The results of the modeling for marine mammals for the Mid-Atlantic Shelf are presented in Table H.8.1-3. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-192 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. The addition of chemical dispersion is only expected to minimally reduce adverse effects on marine mammals. There would be a beneficial reduction in the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4), and the equivalent area of 100 percent mortality would al so be reduced, but these values were already low. Based on the estimated minimal risk associated with adversely affecting marine mammals during any spill, chemical dispersion wo uld produce low adverse effects similar, if not identical, to those of a mechanical response. Although areas other than the Mid-Atlantic Shelf in the Atlantic region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on mari ne mammals will fall within a similar range throughout the Atlantic region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine mammals in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be minor for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.2 and summarized in Table H.2.2-2 (the results in Table H.2.2-2 are included in Table H.8.1-4 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on birds in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. It is important to recognize that birds are not uniformly distributed spatially or temporally in the Atlantic region, and potential adverse effects Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-193 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills depend on the types and locations of habitats affected and the number of individuals present at the time of the event. The addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse ef fects or increase the risk to marine and coastal birds. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill, very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. However, potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds increase if sand beaches, wetlands, and tidal flats in nesting and stag ing areas become heavily oiled (see Section 3.2.2.2. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse e ffects on these habitats by reducing the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4). The risk scores in Table H.8.1-4 reflect the predicted recovery rates of 1 to 3 ye ars for most bird species, as was the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2). For a small spill, shoreline oiling was expected to be light, but if birds are affe cted, recovery could still take 1 to 3 years. For a medium spill using 80 percent efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by nearly 85 percent. The area of equiva lent mortality due to surface water oiling was reduced by over 65 percent. In a ddition, chemical dispersi on doubled the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 17 (Alterna tive 1) to 34 (Alternative 3) ou t of the 100 model runs (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). Adverse effects on marine and co astal birds in this region are more likely to result from shor eline oiling than from surface water oiling because of the large concentrations of birds on beache s, wetlands, and tidal flats during staging periods (Section H.2.2). The results for 45 percent efficiency were the same as for 80 percent efficiency (Table H.8.1-4); some important waterbird nesting areas were still oiled, but adverse effects on heavily used shorebird sites and wetlands were reduced.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-194 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency , the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 70 percent. The area of equivalent mortality due to su rface water oiling was reduced by over 83 percent. In addition, chemical dispersion increased the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 19 (Alternative 1) to 35 (Alternative 3) out of 10 0 model runs (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). However, wetlands made up 60 percent of the shoreline oiled, including important nesting and staging areas for wading birds and waterfowl; the reduced area of total shoreline oiling was not sufficient to lower the estimated risk to birds in th e modeling at 80 percent dispersant efficiency. For a large spill using 45 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 72 percent from Alternative 1; in particular, adverse effects on important shorebird staging and waterbird nesting areas in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf were reduced. The difference in estimated risk sc ores by dispersant efficiency for large oil spills was unique to the Mid-Atlantic Shelf model. For large oil spills in other regions modeled in this PEIS, adverse effects on birds were estimated to be the same regardless of dispersant efficiency. Therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on birds fo r a medium oil spill will typically be reduced with chemical dispersion at either efficiency and will be reduced in some situations for a large oil spill. The reduction of adverse effects on birds when ch emical dispersion is used is contingent upon whether the reduction of adverse shoreline effect s coincides with heavily used habitats. On an overall regional level, adverse effects of medium oil spills are reduced when chemical dispersion is modeled. For a large oil spill, adverse effects are not consiste ntly reduced when chemical dispersion is modeled, but may be less than wh en mechanical-only recovery is modeled. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for small and large spills, with or without dispersant use. For medium spi lls, impacts are expected to be moderate, but are reduced to minor with the addi tion of chemical dispersion. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these groups are of high concern, particularly when chemical dispersion is considered as a potential response option. As described in Sections 4.3.2.3 and H.2.2, plankton and fish are adversely affected either directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil droplets mixed by wa ves into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is direct upta ke of dissolved oil components, originating directly from surface oil or dissolving from the mi croscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, adverse effects increase the larger the spill size. However, th ere is great variability related to the environmental conditions after a spill; plankton and fish suffer much more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather. In addition, many species utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they are more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved components when oil comes ashore. Species and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic components, with species from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stable locations being more sensitive than those from polluted and environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposure during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-195 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floa ting oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapidly disperse to background levels. There may be longer-term effects if an offshore spill migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands wher e dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Juvenile fish are more abundant in salt marshes and seagrass beds than in other shallow subtidal and intertidal areas, so these areas are of most co ncern (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 3, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm1 of shore; therefore, it would not contribute to adverse effects on plankton and fish in these areas. The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by oil spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percentage loss multiplied by volume expo sed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes we re translated to equivalent areas by multiplying by water depth at the spill site, allo wing comparison with other resources, such as birds and shorelines, which are distribute d on a per-area basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniforml y distributed when expres sed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by th e similar results for the four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, offshore Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco Bay (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively, of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004])\u2014 the equivalent areas of adverse effect on plankton and fish (both average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in this PEIS. The modeled spil l site was 18 m deep water: adverse effects would be smaller for deeper w aters because of greater vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionately greater in shallower waters because of the restricted dilution potential and generally higher organism abundance. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much smaller. Thus, th e model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortalit y of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes am ong response scenarios. Potential adverse effects on plankton and fish in th e Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of m echanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.2 and summarized in Table H.2.2-3 (the results in Table H.2.2-3 are included in Table H.8.1-5 for comparison). The Mid-Atlantic Shelf was selected the modeling as representative of the Atlantic region. The adverse effects were estimated as a percentage of the total area of concern (68,541 km 2). Under Alternative 3, the results for 45 percent dispersant efficiency were not significantly different from those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency b ecause more than sufficient dispersant would be available under both conditions to disperse available surface oil for spills up to 40,000 bbl (with some 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-196 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills variability, as reflected in the results in Table H.8.1- 5). For a small spill, based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality would be affected (Tables H.2.1-1 and H.2.1-2), the volume of adverse effects on plankton and fish would be negligible for all response options under Alternative 3. The volumes and areas of adverse effect are about three times larger than those events without chemical dispersion.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of t he Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery time would be less than 1 year. Overall, based on th e modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 would be localized to the immediate area around the spill site and similar in all marine-water areas of the region. Even without chemical dispersion, concentrations of toxic components could become high enough to cause concern for plankton and fish for medium or large spills if the slick moved into shallow coastal areas and embayments under conditi ons where storm-generated waves mixed large amounts of fresh oil into the water column. Under Alternative 3, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm 1 of shore or in enclosed coastal lagoons; therefore, it would not contribute to such risk, and might even reduce concerns by disper sing portions of the slick before it can enter shallow waters. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-197 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Intertidal Habitats Potential adverse effects on intertidal habitats in th e Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of m echanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.2 and summarized in Table H.2.2-4 (the results in Table H.2.2-4 are included in Table H.8.1-6 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats i n t h a t l a r g e r s p i l l s t e n d t o h a v e h i g h e r o i l loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill, very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. Ho wever, the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats increase as spill volume increases, with greatest concern if marshe s and tidal flats become heavily oiled. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse effects on these habitats by reducing the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4). The risk scores in Tables H.2.2-4 and H.8.1-6 were based on estimated adverse effects on the in tertidal habitats of Delaware Bay because even large spills usually will not affect large shoreline areas. For example, the maximum percentage of shoreline oiled under the large spill scenarios was only 0.02 percent of the shoreline area in the entire Mid-Atlantic Shelf. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats for a small spi ll were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and ex pecting recovery from light oiling to usually be rapid for all habitat types. For a medium spill using 80 percent dispersa nt efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by nearly 85 percent, from 11.6 km under Alternative 1 to 1.8 km under Alternative 3. Most shoreline oiling was very light and restricted to outer sand beaches, which were expected to recover within 1 year. In addition, chemical dispersion doubled the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 17 (Alternative 1) to 34 (Alternative 3) out of 100 model runs (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). The results for the 45 percent dispersant efficiency were the same as for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.8.1-6). Most importantly, there was no wetland oiling under any chemical dispersion scenario, in cluding worst case scenarios. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-198 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 70 percent, from 29.2 km un der Alternative 1 to 8.6 km under Alternative 3. In addition, chemical dispersion increased the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 19 (Alternative 1) to 35 (Alternative 3) out of th e 100 model runs (technical report [French McCay et al, 2004]). However, wetlands made up 60 percent of the shoreline oiled, so the recovery rate was still expected to be 3 to 7 years (Section 4.3.2. 4). For a large spill using 45 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was re duced by 72 percent from Alternative 1, with adverse effects mostly to sand beaches. Although areas other than Delaware Bay in the Atlantic region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on intertidal habitats will fall wi thin a similar range throughout the Atlantic region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, with or without dispersant use. For medium spills, impacts are expected to be minor, but are reduced to insignificant with the addition of chemical disper sion. For large spillss, impacts are expected to be moderate, but are reduced to minor with the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 percent efficiency. There is no change in impact at 80 percent efficiency 1. On an overall regiona l level for medium or large spills, adverse impacts are reduced when chemical dispersion is modeled. 1 The shoreline lengths affected are similar assuming either 45 or 80 percent dispersant efficiency because more than sufficient dispersant would be available to disperse the floating oil be fore it reached shore (see Section A.3.7 of the technical report Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-199 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Subtidal Habitats Potential adverse effects on subtidal habitats in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of m echanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.2 and summarized in Table H.2.2-5 (the results in Table H.2.2-5 are included in Table H.8.1-7 for comparison) . The addition of in situ burning does not change the potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. The risk to fauna and flora of the subtidal benthic habitat is minimal, based on the diluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate, rather than dissolve, an d the rapid dilution of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil re sidue potentially reaching the bottom substrate. Adverse effects on subtidal habitats under the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are small for a small spill because the contaminated area of sediment or bottom-water contamination is small when compared with the overall subtidal habitat area present in the Atlantic region (Table H.8.1-7). Chemical dispersion is not expected to change the already small adverse effects on subtidal habitats. There would be an increase in the amount of oil that is dispersed into the water column (Section 4.3.2.5). Given the available depth for mixing and dilution, this does not increase the risk. Adverse effects on subtidal habitats for a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill. For a medium spill using 45 or 80 percent dispersant efficiency, sediment concentrations still never exceeded the th reshold of concern for either dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons or total hydrocarbons. Water column exposure to dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons was unchanged from mechanical-only recovery (<0.001 percent of the reference area). For a large spill, sediment contamination was unchanged from the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit). Exposure of demersal species increased slightly over the basic response scenario , but at either dispersant efficiency the equivalent area of 100 percent mortality was still less than 0.06 percent of the re ference area (Table H.8.1-7). [French McCay et al., 2004]). However, slight differences in th e trajectories and timing of the dispersion can result in differ ent shore segments being oiled, which in some cases can be of di fferent shoreline habitat types. In this case, more sensitive wetland areas were oiled under 80 percent efficiency than un der 45 percent efficiency, but the difference is within the uncertainty caused by the random variability of physical transport.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-At lantic Shelf (as discussed in th e text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Although areas other than the Mid-Atlantic Shelf in the Atlantic region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for many other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of ad verse effects on subtidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Atlantic region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Se ction 4.3), potential regional advers e impacts on subtidal habitats in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Areas of Special Concern For this analysis, the risks to areas of special conc ern are the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Section H.8.2), whichever are greater. Since the risk to intertidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Potential adverse effects on areas of special concern in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (c urrent levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Sect ion H.2.2 and summarized in Table H.2.2-6 (the results in Table H.2.2-6 are included in Table H.8.1-8 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on areas of special concern in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. Since areas of special concern are scattered along the Atlantic coast, they are unlikely to be disproportionately affected by the average spill, and recovery would be similar to that for other intertidal habitats. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-201 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Adverse effects on areas of special concern for a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting recovery from light oiling to usually be rapid for all habitat types. For a medium spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by over 90 percent, fr om 11.6 km under Alternative 1 to 1.8 km under Alternative 3. Most shoreline oiling was very light and was restricted to outer sand beaches that are expected to recover within 1 year. The results for the 45 percent dispersant efficiency were the same as for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.8.1-8).

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-At lantic Shelf (as discussed in th e text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 73 percent, from 29 km under Alte rnative 1 to 8.6 km under Alternative 3. Therefore, the risk ranking was reduced to reflect this reduction in shoreline oiling. However, wetlands composed 60 percent of the shorelin e oiled, so the recovery rate is still exp ected to be 3 to 7 yea rs (Section 4.3.2.4). For a large spill using 45 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 82 percent from Alternative 1, and in this case adve rse effects were mostly on sand beaches. Overall, information on subsistence use of fi sh and shellfish in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf is limited. While some residents may supplement their diets with these resources, subsistence is not known to be a prominent activity in this area, as compared to Alaska, where Native communities may suffer substantial economic and cultural losses due to c ontamination of subsistence seafood during an oil spill. Chemical dispersion could reduce shoreline ef fects for a large oil spill, but the potential benefit depends on the specific fate of the untreated oil. Although areas other than the Mid-Atlantic Shelf in the Atlantic region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-202 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills severity of adverse effects on ar eas of special concern will fall with in a similar range throughout the Atlantic region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), pote ntial regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to intertidal habitats. For medium spills, impacts are expected to be minor, but are reduced to insignificant with the addition of chemical dispersion. For large spillss, impacts are expected to be moderate, but are reduced to minor with the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 percent efficiency. There is no change in impact at 80 percent efficiency 1. H.8.3 Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species Potential adverse effects on threatened, endanger ed, or candidate species in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.3. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, fish, or sea turtles that are threatened, endangered, or candidate species are identical to those discussed in Section H.8.2 for these groups. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species in that larger sp ills tend to spread across a larger surface water area and have higher shoreline oil loading. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. When chemical dispersion is used under Altern ative 3 for small, medium, and large spills, the contaminated surface water area is reduced, especial ly when compared with the overall surface water area in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (68,541 km 2). Thus, the likelihood of threatened, endangered, or candidate species becoming oiled at the surface is reduced from the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit). Less oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. Potential adverse effects increase as spill volume increases, with greatest concern for cond itions where haulout area s, bays, estuaries, and known breeding grounds of these sp ecies become heavily oiled. Although populations are sporadic and vary with migration, if a threatened, endangered , or candidate species were present in the area of an oil spill, the resulting adverse effects could be low. The severity of the effect varies depending on the sensitivity of the individuals present. Overall, risk scores were highest for marine and coastal birds. While they were reduced from the levels in Alternative 1, they remained medium. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for small and large spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to marine and coastal birds. For medium spills, impacts are expect ed to be moderate, but are reduced to minor with the addition of ch emical dispersion. 1 The shoreline lengths affected are similar assuming either 45 or 80 percent dispersant efficiency because more than sufficient dispersant would be available to disperse the floating oil be fore it reached shore (see Section A.3.7 of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). However, slight differences in th e trajectories and timing of the dispersion can result in differ ent shore segments being oiled, which in some cases can be of di fferent shoreline habitat types. In this case, more sensitive wetland areas were oiled under 80 percent efficiency than un der 45 percent efficiency, but the difference is within the uncertainty caused by the random variability of physical transport. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-203 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills H.8.4 Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat For this analysis, the risks to Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Section H.8.2), whichever are greater. The risk to both resources was determined to be low, regardless of response option used. Potential adverse effects on EFH in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.2.4. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insign ificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to plankton and fish and to subtidal habitats. H.8.5 Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Sect ion 4.3.5, oil spills can produce a variety of adverse social and economic effects. These adverse effects are generally not large when measured at the regional levels, but instead are typically felt in communities located near resources oiled by the spill. Specifically, large adverse effects are generally limited to those industries and populati ons that are affected by the spill. Some of the most visible and large effects are likely to incl ude effects on water- and shore-based recreation, commercial and recreational fisheries, and tourism. In addition, large-scale spills hold the potential to adversely affect the well-being of the reside nts and economies of co astal communities. This modeling considers the risk of adverse soci oeconomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreati onal activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceived taint; closure of comme rcial fishing grounds or hatcheries, or reduced commercial harvests; and altered mari ne transportation patterns. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on soci al and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may cause change s in employment and firm revenues of resource- based businesses. While these effects are not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and relative measures of the over all risk of adverse social and economic effects of small, medium, and large oil spills using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion in the Atlantic region. This modeling evaluates the effects of oil spills based on the risk of adverse effects on various factors of the socioeconomic environment rather than changes in monetary benefits. The methodology assumes that the risk posed by oil sp ills to the socioeconomic environment is directly related to the extent to which coastal resources (e.g., sandy recreational beach, marine waters used for commercial fishing) are oiled above selected effect thresholds. That is, the proportion of total shoreline or surface water oiled above selected th resholds in the modeled spill area is used to represent the risk of socioeconomic effects (see Se ction 4.4.1.2 for details on the method used). Comparing the absolute risk of adverse socioecono mic effects (e.g., meters of sandy shoreline oiled above a recreational threshold of concern) across spill scenarios, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understanding of the relative risk of adverse socioeconomic effects across these scenarios. In this section, the results of Alternative 3 \u2014basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion \u2014are examined. Determining relative risk also allows for extrapolation of site-specific results to the entire region. For example, some of the risk estimates presented below are based on modeled hypothetical spills affecting the Mid-Atlantic Shelf. While any given spill may exhibit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic effect, the relative risk measures reported for the Mid-Atlantic Shelf modeling scenario are expected to be broadly Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-204 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills applicable to a range of spill locations along the At lantic coast. In addition, the conclusions reached for the Mid-Atlantic Shelf are supported by results for other modeled areas. Extrapolating results from modeled spills in specific areas to other coastal sites is more valid for measures of relative risk of losses than absolute measures of monetary losses. For example, if a given level of additional oil spill response in th e waters off the New Jersey coast causes a 30 percent reduction in shoreline resources oiled (and, therefore, recreational beach use affected), that 30 percent can be applied to any site along the Atlantic coast. If losses to New Jersey beaches were evaluated in terms of dollars, however, seasonal and visitation differences between New Jersey and other states such as Maine would prevent accurate application of those monetary losses. For this reason, there is precedent in applying relative ri sk in evaluating potential changes to response regulations; for example, environmental performance of double-hull tanker design alternatives was evaluated based on risk of environmental and soci oeconomic effects of o il spills (Transportation Research Board, 2001). This methodology was used to evaluate socioeconomic risks and differs from that used to address the risks posed to other ecological resources. The rationale behind this deviation is based on the fact that this methodology is judged to most accurately refl ect the threat to these resources while facilitating comparisons across specific modeled areas and generalizations to broader contexts (see Section 4.4). In addition, the socioeconomic risk metric closely parallels the measure of proportion of resource affected that was quantified in the preceding sections for ecological resources. The risk matrix used for ecological resources defines risk based on the percentage of the resource potentially affected in combination with the time to recovery (Figure I.8-2) . While the percentage of the resource affected is relevant to the modeling of socioec onomic effects, the time to recove ry is difficult to define in a socioeconomic context. The time necessary for soci oeconomic recovery is su bject to factors outside the influence of oil spill cleanup operations, such as national economic trends, recreational preferences, consumption patterns, and public perceptions. Change s in these factors, which are independent of the oil spill, could affect the time to recovery; thus, assigning \"time to recovery\" would be arbitrary. There is no existing standard for \"significance\" rel ated to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface wate r must be oiled to be consider ed a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the ef fect will depend on a number of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, lo cal), opportunities for resource substi tution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of low concern if it is not of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effects modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the modeled effects under all modeled scenar ios would likely be low at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that occur would be expected to be localized in nature. The risk factor reflects the ratio of the percentag e of the shoreline or surface water oiled using the basic response scenario to the percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion. For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of risk equal to one-f ifth that expected given response options limited to mechanical recovery and in situ burning. Under Alternative 1, a risk factor of 1.0 is assigned to medium and large spills (small spills are a ssumed to have a negligible effect), indicating that no additional response options are taken in this modeled area. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-205 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi of shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 3. In marine waters 3 or more statute mi from shore, the basic response scenario with the addition of chemical dispersion could be used under Alternative 3 in the Atlantic region. Potential adverse effects on coastal communities in the Atlantic region for oiled shoreline and oiled surface water using the basic res ponse scenario are presented in Section H.2.5 and summarized in Table H.2.5-1 (the results in Table H.2.5-1 are included in Table H.8.5-1 for comparison). These tables highlight the effects of small, medium, and large oil spills on the Atlantic region's socioeconomic resources by presenting estimates of resources oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute terms (length of shoreline oiled or area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of the total resource base in the mode led area (Mid-Atlantic Shelf). The threshold of concern because of oiled shoreline is 10 g/m 2 and of surface water oiled is 0.01 g/m2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). Ta ble H.8.5-1 summarizes potential adverse effects on coastal communities in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 \u2014the basic response scenario with the addition of chemical dispersion. Both the shoreline oiling index and the surface water oiling index are greatly reduced for both medium and large spills. This means that, in general, chemical dispersion will decrease the severity of social or economic effects, as discussed below. This is of greatest potential benefit on a local, rather than a regional, basis. This modeling assumes that the risk posed to the so cioeconomic environment by oil spills is directly related to the extent to which resources are af fected above selected thresholds of concern \u2014for the Atlantic region, the meters of recreational beach oi led and the square meters of marine waters oiled above the threshold of concern. Comparing the absolute risk of adverse so cioeconomic consequences across spill scenarios, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understanding of the relative risk of adverse socioeconomic conseque nces across spill scenarios. Determining relative risk allows for extrapolation of site-specific results to the entire region. For example, the risk estimates presented in Table H.8.5-1 are based on modeled hypot hetical spills affecting the Mid-Atlantic Shelf, which is an appropriate surrogate for the Atlantic region in this modeling. While any given spill may exhi bit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic consequence, the relative risk measures are expect ed to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations, especially in island regions, as long as the spills occur in areas where chemical dispersion is feasible. In addition, the conclusions reached for the Mid-Atlantic Shelf are supported by results for other modeled areas \u2014the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assumptions across spill size is similar in magnitude. For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life pot entially affected by an oil spill.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Oil spills affect the pleasure that coastal residents and visitors derive from coastal activities and the economic contribution that resources make to lo cal income and employment. To the extent that the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of ch emical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and surface water oiling, this combination of spill re sponse options will act to reduce adverse effects on coastal communities. As a result of oiling, beaches in th e immediate vicinity of a spill may be closed to visitors, and fishing may not be permitted in waters ex posed to oil, causing losses in revenue to both the tourism and commercial and recreational fishery sectors of the coastal economy. These eff ects would be expected to reverberate through comm unities in the area of the spill, causin g short-term decreases in recreation and tourism; commercial and r ecreational fishing; and the empl oyment opportunities, income, and businesses these industries support. In addition, an oil spill may te mporarily reduce the appeal of coastal living in a given area. For a small spill along the Atlantic coast, there is no risk of large adverse effects on coastal communities. In many cases, a spill of this size wo uld be expected to pose no risk to shoreline or surface water resources because the spilled oil w ill never reach the thresh old of concern (Table H.8.5-1). While the risk to coastal communities increases wi th spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion, a medium spill in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf will have a spill area 1 above the corresponding thresholds of con cern that will adversely affect approximately 1,20 5 to 1,346 m of shoreline and sweep approximately 73 to 87 million m2 of marine waters used for recreation and by the commercial fishing industry, respectively (Table H.8.5-1). A large spill will affect approximately 5,022 to 5,253 m of shoreline and swee p approximately 219 to 268 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.8.5-1). However, when certain weather conditions and current patterns are combined with specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expect ed to reach shoreline resources either at all or at levels above the selected threshold of concern. Fo r medium and large spills along the Mid-Atlantic Shelf shoreline, such conditions prevail approxim ately 75 and 55 percent of the time, respectively, based on modeled spills when the basic re sponse scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion is used in the cleanup, regardless of dispersant efficiency. For these spill events, no adverse effects on the shoreline are expected. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills: regionally less than 1 percent of sandy shoreline and 0.2 percent of surface water would be affected, even for the largest spills modeled. Any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts ar e unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-208 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, industri es, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affected by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer direct and indirect adverse economic effects from an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease revenue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisherie s, by both the anglers themselves and by related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated enti rely. Tourism and associat ed businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal area s decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived resource taint. A small spill 3 or more statute mi offshore would have essentially no adverse effect on either the local or regional economies (Table H.8.5-1). Th ere is little to no risk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any co mmercial fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. While the risk increases as spill size increases, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion, a medium spill in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf will have a spill area above the corre sponding thresholds of concern that will adversely affect approxim ately 1,205 to 1,346 m of shoreline and sweep approximately 73 to 87 million m 2 of marine waters used for recreation and by the commercial fishing industry, respective ly, (Table H.8.5-1). A larg e spill will affect approximately 5,022 to 5,253 m of shoreline and sweep approx imately 219 to 268 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.8.5-1). However, when certain weather conditions and curr ent patterns are combined with specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources either at all or at levels above the selected threshold of concern. For medium an d large spills along the Atlantic coast, such conditions prevail approximately 75 and 55 percent of the time, respectively, based on modeled spills when the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion is used in the cleanup, re gardless of dispersant efficiency. For these spill events, no adverse effects on shoreline are expected. Despite chemical dispersion, a medium or large sp ill could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oiling recreational beaches, closures of commercial and recreational fishing grounds, and degradation of the appeal of coastal locations. While the adverse effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, an y reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, could cause socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills: regionally less than 1 percent of sandy shorelin e and 0.2 percent of surface water would be affected, even for the largest spills modeled. Any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-209 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore are not likely to cause large adverse effects to vessel transportation and ports. Local resources would ea sily handle whatever response operations are implemented. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commerce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft movement as a means of facilitating spill response. Since vessel transportation is of paramount importance for many industries along the Atlantic coast, any interruption in the standard use of vessels or increase in travel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. Thes e adverse effects might be felt at a number of levels. For example, vessel operators may incur a dditional costs associated with delays and longer shipping distances; businesses that depend on ti mely receipt of feedstock or other goods may experience adverse effects such as production sl owdowns; and individuals who work in adversely affected sectors may be displaced. To the extent that businesses in other locations depend on the affected industries, a longer-term disruption of vess el transportation could yield adverse effects beyond the immediate spill area. However, given substitute suppliers and shipping modes and the expected short-term nature of any di sruption in vessel traffic, such adverse effects are not likely to be high. For a small spill, no large adverse effects on vessel transportation or ports are expected (Table H.8.5-1). While the risk to the vessel transportati on industry increases with spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion a medium spill in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf will have a spill area above the corresponding thresholds of concer n that will adversely affect approximately 73 to 87 million m 2 of surface water area; a large sp ill, approximately 219 to 268 million m2 of surface water area (Table H.8.5-1). Howe ver, a spill occurring under specifi c location, weather, and tidal conditions could adversely affect vessel transportation and ports and the industries and communities that depend on this traffic. Any adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports would likely be short lived \u2014that is, even if shipping waters or ports are exposed to oil and are therefore closed, as soon as recovery efforts remove surface oil, these facilities would be expected to be reopened. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4. 3), potential regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills: regionally less than 0.2 pe rcent of surface water woul d be affected, even for the largest spills modeled. Any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerable to oil spills because of both cl osures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to significant revenue losses for the commercial fishing industry, as well as related industries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from commercial fleets. By contaminat ing key waters, an oil spill may disrupt employment in commercial fisheries and related sectors of th e economy. In addition, oil spills can lead to a decreased demand for fish from affected waters because of actual or perceived taint and can instigate alterations to fishing practices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-210 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills decreases revenues. Large spills can potentially injure fish nursery grounds and impose other risks that could reduce fish harvests in the longer term. For a small spill in the Atlantic regi on, the risk to commercial fisheries is negligible (Table H.8.5-1). While the risk to the commercial fishing indust ry increases with spill si ze, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion a medium sp ill along the Atlantic coast will have a spill area above the corresponding threshol ds of concern that will adversel y affect approximately 73 to 87 million m2 marine waters used by the commercial fishing industry (Table H.8.5-1). A large spill will present risk above the correspo nding threshold of concern to approximately 219 to 268 million m2 of marine waters potentially important to commercial fisheries (Table H.8.5-1). A risk of economic loss to commercial fish eries will occur when waters exceed relevant management and/or risk-based thre sholds. For example, fishing may not be permitted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold, resulting in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting ad verse effects would be ex pected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, ca using decreases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, spill effects on the commercial fishing econ omy may be less severe. Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will not generally be at the regional or national levels but could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commercial fishing activities, in square meters of surface water oiled above the corresponding threshold of concern. The effects of an oil spill on recreational fishery-related activities will be felt more heavil y by various populations, in cluding recreational anglers and firms that supply goods and services to recr eational anglers. For example, recreational anglers fish for pleasure or sport, as opposed to monetary ga in. In the wake of an oil spill, such anglers may choose to fish at a substitute location, may experience a reduced quality of experience, or may choose to forgo fishing entirely. The losses suffered will be related to these missed opportunities. In addition, while closing waters to recreational fishing will decrease the social welfare of recreationists, it would also be expected to affect the demand for boat rentals and other services consumed by fishing enthusiasts. For a small spill, adverse effects on recreational fi shing resources in the Atlantic region would likely be negligible (Table H.8.5-1). Medium and large spills may cause decreases in local recreational fishing activities and in the revenues generated from these activities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Atlantic re gion under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills: regionally less than 0.2 percent of surface water would be affected, even for the largest spills modeled. Any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-211 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Subsistence Potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section and summarized in Table H.2.5- 2 (the results in Table H.2.5-2 are included in Table H.8.5-2 for comparison). The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery alone. Under Alternative 3, potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Atlantic region are low for small, medium, and large spills. Chemical dispersion may increa se adverse effects on subsistence resources by increasing water colu mn exposure to dissolved aromatics; however, effects on intertidal subsistence resources may be reduced because chemical dispersion is expected to reduce the amount of oil that strands in intert idal habitats (Section 4.3.2.4). The risk ranking using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chem ical dispersion is presented in Table H.8.5-2. Table H.8.5-2 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills* to Subsistence Using the Basic Response Scenario with the Addition of Chemical Dispersion (Option A) in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf Spill Size Response Option (% dispersant efficiency) Resources Affected (estimated %) Risk Score \u00a7 Small (200 bbl) Basic 0-1 4E Chemical Dispersion 4E or 80) 1-5 4D Source: Adapted from Part B of the tec hnical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Mid-Atlantic Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Atlantic region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Effects on subsistence resources fo r a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 percent efficiency for a medium spill, the modeling results showed wa ter column exposure at low concentrations (1 - 100 ppb) in a more widespread area outside Delaware Bay and at high concentrations (100 - 10,000 ppb) in localized area s. Sediment exposure was expected to be negligib le. The risk scores in Table H.8.5-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates fo r subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill volumes (Section 4.3.5.6). With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 per cent efficiency for a large spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at both low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) covering a small area outside of Delaware Bay and high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) occurring dir ectly outside the bay. Sediment exposure was expected to be negligible. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 80 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-212 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills percent efficiency, water column exposure of dissolved aromatics covered a larger area than at 45 percent efficiency; otherwise, the results were similar at 45 and 80 percent efficiency. Although areas other than the Mid-Atlantic Shelf in the Atlantic region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on subsis tence resources will fall within a similar range throughout the Atlantic region. Adverse effects on subsistence resources are not likely to be high on a regional level, but may be high on a local level. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potent ial regional adverse impacts on subsistence in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spills, with or without dispersant use. For larg e spills, impacts are expected to be insignificant, but increase to minor with the addition of chemical dispersion. Historic Resources Potential adverse effects on historic resources in the Atlantic region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section . Under Alternative 3, adverse effects on historic resources in the Atlantic region would likely be negligible, regardless of spill size, Most historic sites in the Atlantic region are either located on land and protected from oiling by bulwarks or other barr iers, or are buried under offshore sediments and are not at risk of becoming oile d or coming in contact with di spersants. Submerged shipwrecks typically not well preserved due to strong current s and wave action in the region (Section 3.2.5.6). Chemical dispersion may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, which will reduce the amount of shoreline cleanup and potenti al disturbance to sensitive historic structures. There are limited data that identify long-term or chronic degrad ation to cultural resources due to chemical dispersion. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Recreation and Tourism Oil spills can adversely affect a coastal community' s recreational and tourism assets. There are parks, seashores, beaches, and recreational fishing areas that line the Atlantic coast, and both residents of and visitors to the Atlantic coast appreciate the re creational opportunities offered to them by these resources. An oil spill would be expected to cause significant local decreases in tourism, recreation, associated business revenues, and the qu ality of coastal living. An oil spill would be expected to affect recreationists' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and econom ic implications of a spill would reach beyond direct effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment above and in Section for more details). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-213 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a small spill along the Atlantic coast, the adverse effects on recr eation and tourism are negligible (Table H.8.5-1). There is little to no ri sk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. While the risk to recreation and tourism increases wi th spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion, a medium spill in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf will have a spill area above the corresponding thresholds of concer n that will adversely affect appr oximately 1,205 to 1,346 m of shoreline and sweep approximately 73 to 87 million m2 of marine waters used for recreation and by the commercial fishing industry, respectively (Table H.8.5-1). A large spill will affect approximately 5,022 to 5,253 m of shoreline and sweep approximately 219 to 268 million m 2 of marine waters (Table H.8.5-1). However, when certain we ather conditions and current patterns are combined with specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources either at all or at levels above the selected threshold of c oncern. For medium and large spills along the Mid-Atlantic coast, such conditions prevail approximately 75 and 55 percent of the time, respectively, based on modeled spills when the basic response s cenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion is used in the cleanup, regardless of dispersant efficiency. For these spill events, no adverse effects on shoreline are expected. Despite chemical dispersion, a medium or large sp ill could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oiling recreational beaches, closures of commercial and recreational fishing grounds, and degradation of the appeal of coastal locations. While the physical effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, an y reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, could cause socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills: regionally less than 1 percent of sandy shoreline and 0.2 percent of surface water would be affected, even for the largest spills modeled. Any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are defined as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill. There are many areas in the Atlantic region with high population concentrations along the coast. However, adverse effects on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offs hore for any of the spill sizes considered, regardless of the response options \u2014mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to protect the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are rel ated to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill respon se equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the worker certific ation and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The risk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), po tential regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Atlantic region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. H.9. A LTERNATIVE 3 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE CARIBBEAN REGION For the purpose of this PEIS, the Caribbean region consists of the tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and is enclosed to the so uth by Venezuela, Colombia, and Panama; to the west by Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica ; and to the north, it wraps toward the southeast with the Greater and Lesser Antilles Islands, be ginning with Cuba and ending with Trinidad and Tobago. The tropical waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean are off the north shores of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the U.S.-affiliated islands discussed in this section), and the tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea are off their south and west shores (Figure 3.1-1). There was no location in this region for modeling and risk assessment pu rposes. However, the Florida Straits, which is actually in the Atlantic region, was selected for modeling because it contains very similar habitats (mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs) and amenit y resources as the Caribbean region. The Florida Straits results were used to evaluate effects in the Caribbean region. Modeling results from this location were evaluated relative to the geographic area in Section D.1.2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), herein referred to as the Florida Straits. The Florida Straits encompasses two biogeographical provinces: Florida Straits and Florida Bay. The results of the modeling \u2014used to evaluate spills of concern in this risk analysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore) \u2014are presented in Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and summarized in this section. Table H.9-1 presents the risk ranking for the modeling of Alternative 3 in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent recovery efficiency1 for the three spill sizes (small, 200 bbl; medium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). (Based on the discussion of Alternative 3 presented in Section 2.8.3, a 25 percent increase in mechanical recovery capability would not change the effectiveness of the basic response scenario under Alternative 1.) The risk scores presented in Ta ble H.9-1 are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional consider ations; however, in any specific oil spill situation local concerns could be higher. Table H.9-2 summarizes the sign ificance of the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 3 in the Caribbean region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for the average spill to the region in general. 1 Recovery efficiency represents the operating effectiveness of the dispersant: the greater the efficiency, the more effective t he dispersant.

Concern is particul arly high for mangrove forests. A large spill could also cause significant, but localized, adve rse, short-term socioeconomic impact s. All adverse impacts occur despite the treatment or recovery of some oil, but are reduced by those actions when they are effective. Further, as explained in the introduction to Section 4.7, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantly change the level of concern identified from thos e obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. Under the available response options of Alternative 3, the addition of chemical dispersion helps mitigate, but does not eliminate, potential adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds, marine mammals, and coastal habitat and shoreline, espe cially for larger spills, without significantly increasing the risk to water column or subtidal resources. There is an increase in the risk score for coastal water quality when dispersants are used on large spills. Chemical dispersion also greatly reduces the likelihood of adverse impacts on socioeconomic resources. H.9.1 Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to w ater quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect water quality are the soluble aromatics, (monoaromatic and Appendix H), even with dispersant use. Thus, evaluation of potential adverse effects is base d on degree of potential contamination by these compounds. Under Alternat ive 3, dispersant use could increase soluble aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in areas where di spersants are applied. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effects on water quality are low for small and medium oil spills, and medium for large oil spills, regardless of the response option used (mechanical with or without in situ burning and chemical dispersion). This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid d ilution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column, even after periods of extreme turbulence that induce relatively high dissolution rates. Dispersants would be applied to surface oil after much of the evaporation of the toxic components occurs because of logistics (i.e., greater than 12 hours after the spill), such that the resulting increase of concentrations of toxic components in the water column would be relatively small. Overall, based on the modeling and risk assessment results, it is concluded that \u2014using the basic response scenario (cur rent levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion \u2014adverse water-quality eff ects under Alternative 3 would be low to medium in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Caribbean region. If an offshore spill moved into shallow and confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills under conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence or in areas where oil collects for a few weeks to months after a spill. Chemical dispersion would not be used in shallow and confined coastal waters (less than 3 nm 1 from shore) under 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-218 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Alternative 3, so it could only contribute to advers e water-quality effects in t hose areas if the dispersed oil plume drifted into the ar ea before being diluted. The variable used to determine the potential effects on water qualit y is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected water volume increases with spill volume and the level of physical or chemical dispersion during the time of the spill. Natural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of water that is con taminated above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of water contam inated increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume contam inated for a small spill was extrapolated from the mean medium- and large-spill model results. Potent ial adverse water-quality effects in the Caribbean region with using the basic re sponse scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Appe ndix H.3.1 and summarized in Tables H.3.1-1 and H.3.1-2 for coastal and marine waters, respectively (t he results for coastal and marine water quality are included in Table H.9.1-1 and H.9.1-2 for comparison). Coastal In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statue mi of shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 3. In marine waters 3 or more statute mi from shore, the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion could be used under Alternative 3 in the Caribbean region. If dispersants were applied offshore, the dispersed oi l plume could move into these nearshore areas. Since chemical dispersion would not be used in th ese areas, the level and duration of exposure would be negligible because of dilution. Florida Bay is used as a representative of coastal water for analyzing the Florida Straits, as well the Caribbean region. Florida Ba y is approximately 16,288 km2 in area and about 2 m deep on average, with a total volume of ap proximately 32,576 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of Florida Bay to determine the potential consequences of smal l, medium, and large spills (Table H.9.1-1). This approach was used both with and without dispersant use, and yields a very conservative estimate in that it assumes all of the contamination would occur in coastal water. Since dispersants could not be employed in such areas, this would imply that the dispersed oil plume moved directly into coastal waters without dilution, which will not occur. and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-219 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the te xt) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil may be incorporated into shallow water or intertid al sediments where, thro ugh leaching, it could become a continuing source of con tamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality wher e the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier I standards (beginning about 12 hou rs after the spill), many of the soluble components of concern to water quality would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, m echanical recovery and in situ burning would have a small influence on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would apply whether eith er response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potent ial regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small spills and minor for medium spills, without or without dispersant use. Fo r large spills, impacts are expected to be minor, but increase to moderate with the ad dition of chemical dispersion. Marine The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the ma rine waters around the islands in the Caribbean region, because the geogra phy (islands), bottom topography (steeply dropping off away from shore), environmental conditions (war m trade winds, intermittent severe storms), and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-220 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills ecosystems (subtropical-tropical, areas of coral reefs, seagrasses) are similar. The total surface area of the Florida Straits is approximately 42,689 km2, so the area of interest is much vaster for marine waters than for coastal waters. Water-quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water\u2014 20 m deep, which is much shallower than most of the Caribbean region's marine waters. The results for the selected modeling location (Table H. 9.1-2) represent conservative estimates of adverse water-quality effects \u2014adverse effects would be reduced in deeper waters because of the larger dilution volume \u2014using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even after a large spill, with or without ch emical dispersion, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. The estimate s of the volume of contaminated water \u2014and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Caribbean region because natural and chemical dispersion of oil into the water column and dilution processes are similar in all areas. The results in Table H.9.1-2 are nearly the same for 45 and 80 percent efficiency because the amount of dispersant used at 45 pe rcent efficiency is sufficient to treat all dispersible surface oil, for spills up to 40,000 bbl. For a small spill, the volume of w ater contaminated would be the same as under Alternative 1 because, due to logistics, dispersants could only be applied after a small spill has mostly dispersed naturally. Chemical dispersion for medium or large spills increases the volume of water contaminated \u2014and the percentage of the area of concern \u2014that would be adversely affected by about a factor of three, which is still a small volume relative to that of the entire modeled area. In situ burning (in combination mechanical recovery and chemical dispersion) would not significantly change the volume contaminated or the effect on water qualit y since it would substitute for some of the mechanical response.

Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impact s on marine water quality in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (see Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an o il spill on air quality may involve al l volatile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are normally very localized and short lived fo r small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any potential adverse effect s: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. Chemical dispersion reduces the volatilization of unburned oil to the atmosphere to only a slight extent, so that effects are essentially identical with or without dispersant use. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-222 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Potential adverse effects on air quality in the Ca ribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.1 and summarized in Table H.3.1-3. Two possible sources of contamination to the atmosphere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilization of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protecti on Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and othe r thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). As discussed in Section H.3.1, the results of the modeling show that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-only recovery; hence, the risk scores are virtually identical for medium and large spills. Vo latilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill site. Evaporation off the water surface and volatilization from the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocar bon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentrations in the atmosphere at the water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmosphere would be on the order of hours to days. Thus, a lo w level of concern is expected for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3, the addition of chemical dispersion does not change the results from those under Alternative 1. Chemical disp ersion would disperse some of the volatile hydrocarbons into the water resulting in the volatile hydrocarbons entering the atmosphere over a larger area than would occur without chemical dispersion. Thus, dispersants further dilute hydrocarbon concentrations in the atmosphere. The modeling shows that concentrations are low for a spill of any size involving some combination of mechanical response and chemical dispersion at any spill site in the Caribbean re gion. Adverse effects of in situ burning on air quality are summarized in Table H.3.1-3; these results apply whether chemical dispersion would be used on unburned oil, and they do not vary by the location of the burn. Thus, the results for Alternative 1 apply to Alternative 3 for all areas in the Caribbean region. The modeling was performed for weather conditions where dilution in the air would be relatively slow, so the estimated adverse effects are overestimated for other conditions. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning, with or without chemical dispersion, would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via in situ burning. For small spills, it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feasible (Table H.3.1-3). The maximum area potentially exceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km2 for a medium spill and 12.7 km2 for a large spill (Table H.3.1-3). If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wildlife) are within these areas, th ey could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, a region of interest equivalent to the Flor ida Bay-Florida Keys area (42,689 km2) would have less than 1 percent of its area affected, and the atmosphere wo uld recover in a matter of hours. The addition of chemical dispersion does not change the results under Alternative 1 in Table H.3.1-3. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on air quality in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without in situ burning. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-223 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills H.9.2 Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals Potential adverse effects on marine mammals in th e Caribbean region using the basic response option (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Appendix H.2 and summarized in Table H.9.2-1 (the results in Table H.9.2-1 are included in Table H.9.2-1 for comparison). In the Caribbean region, marine mammal populations of concern are limited to cetaceans, which are widely distributed, and many are not common. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on marine mammals in that larger spills tend to spread ac ross a larger surface water area and have higher shoreline oil loading. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3 for small spills, the contaminat ed surface water area is small when compared with the overall surface water area in the Caribbean region, so the likelihood of cetaceans becoming oiled at the surface is minimal and the exposure would ha ve little effect in any case. Very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. Potential adverse effects increase as spill volume increases, with greatest concern for bays, estuaries, and known breeding grounds. If a local population of marine mammals is af fected, it is estimated that it would take 1 to 3 years to recovery. The results of the modeling for marine mammals are presented in Table H.9.2-1. The addition of chemical dispersion is only expe cted to have minimal effects on the adverse effects on marine mammals. There would be a reduction in the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4), and the equivalent area of 100 percent mortality would al so be reduced. Based on the estimated minimal risk associated with adversel y affected marine mammals during a small spill, chemical dispersion would produce small adverse effects similar, if not identical, to those of a mechanical response. For medium and large spills, the risk to cetaceans remains very low, but the extent of shoreline oiling becomes a factor for mammals that may be in the inte rtidal zone or very near the shore. For a large spill the affected shoreline area could lead to more than 1 percent of such populations being affected, which was the basis for an increased level of concern. Chemical dispersion would reduce the risk, but would not be expected to change the overall risk ranking. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-224 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Although areas other than the Florida Straits in the Caribbean region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on marine mammals will fall within a similar range throughout the Caribbean region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine mammals in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be minor for small and medium spills, and moderate for large spills, with or without dispersant use. Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal bird s in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.2 and summarized in Table H.3.2-2 (the results in Table H.3.2-2 are included in Table H.9.2-2 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on birds because la rger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. Potential adverse effects increase with spill volume, with the greatest concern for conditions where mangroves and sand beaches become heavily oiled and potential exposure to floating oil occurs in a large area. The addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the seve rity of potential adverse effects or increase the risk to marine and coastal birds. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill, very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. During oil spills in the Caribbean region, the potential adverse effects on intertidal nesting, roosting, and foraging habitats for birds are of particular concern because a Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-225 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills significant amount of shoreline habitat on an island or group of small islands can be oiled by a spill. As a consequence, there may not be alternative sites for use until the habitat recovers, particularly in mangrove habitats, which would lead to a high degree of adverse effects on birds. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse effects on these habitats primarily by reducing the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4). Surface water oiling may also adversely affect feeding, rafting, and diving birds and waterfowl (Section 3. 1.2.2), and chemical dispersion is expected to reduce the extent of surface slicks that birds encoun ter. The risk scores in Table H.9.2-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates of 1 to 3 years for most bird species, as was the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2). For a small spill, shoreline oiling was expected to be light and to not persist. For a medium spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shorel ine oiling was reduced by 72 percent. The area of surface water oiling was reduced by 55 percent. In addition, chemic al dispersion ne arly doubled the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 10 (Alternative 1) to 19 (Alternative 3) out of the 100 model runs (technical report [Fre nch McCay et al., 2004]). Also, th e extent of oiled mangroves was very small. The results for 45 percent dispersant efficiency were similar to those for 80 percent efficiency (Table H.9.2-2); some important nesting sites were still oiled, but the reduction in shoreline length and surface water area oiled would likely reduce adverse effects on birds.

For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 62 percent. The area of surface water oiling wa s reduced by 75 percent. In addition, chemical dispersion increased the number of times that no o il stranded onshore, from 12 (Alternative 1) to 18 (Alternative 3) out of 100 model runs (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). However, oil loading in mangrove habitats was high. The resu lts for 45 percent dispersant efficiency were essentially the same as those for 80 percen t dispersant efficiency (Table H.3.1-1). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-226 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Although areas other than the Florida Straits for the Caribbean region were not analyzed, the results are consistent with those for other regions an alyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on birds will typically be reduced with chemical dispersion at either efficiency. The reduction of adverse effects on birds with chemical dispersion is contingent upon whether the reduction of adverse shoreline effects coincides with heavily used habitats. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On an overall regional level for medium and large spills, even though chemical dispersion reduces the risk score, the expected impacts remain moderate because of the extent of oiling. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, ar e important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these groups are of high concern, particularly when chemical dispersion is considered as a potential re sponse option. As describe d in Section 4.3.2.3 and H.3.2, plankton and fish are adversely affected either directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil dr oplets mixed by wave s into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is di rect uptake of dissolved oil com ponents, originatin g directly from surface oil or dissolving from the microscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, adverse effects increase the larger the spill size. However, there is great variability related to the environmental conditions after the spill; plankton and fish suffer much more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather . In addition, many species utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they are more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved components when oil comes ashore. Sp ecies and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic components, with species from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stable locations more sensitive than those from polluted an d environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposures during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floating oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapi dly dilute to background levels. There may be longer-term effects if an offshore spill migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands wher e dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Juvenile fish are more abundant in wetlands, coral reefs, and seagrass beds than in other shallow subtidal and intertidal areas, so these areas are of most concern (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 3, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm 1 of shore; therefore, it would not contribute to ad verse effects on plankton an d fish in these areas. 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-227 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by oil spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percentage loss multiplied by volume expo sed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes we re translated to equivalent areas by multiplying by water depth at the spill site, allo wing comparison with other resources, such as birds and shorelines, which are distribute d on a per-area basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniforml y distributed when expres sed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by th e similar results for the four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, offshore Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco Bay (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively, of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004])\u2014 the equivalent areas of adverse effect on plankton and fish (both average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in this PEIS. The modeled spil l site was 20 m deep water: adverse effects would be smaller for deeper w aters because of greater vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionately greater in shallower waters because of the restricted dilution potential and generally higher organism abundance. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much less. Thus, the model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortality of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes among response scenarios. Potential adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.2 and summarized in Table H.3.2-3 (the results in Table H.3.2-3 are included in Table H.9.2-3 for comparison). The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the Caribbean region, because the geography (cha racterized by islands), bottom topography (steeply sloping off away from shore), envi ronmental regime (warm trade winds, occasional severe storms), and ecosystems (subtropical-tropical, areas of coral reefs, seagrasses, etc.) are similar in the two regions. Under Alternative 3 the results for 45 percent dispersa nt efficiency were not si gnificantly different than those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency because more than sufficient dispersant would be available under both conditions to disperse available surface oil for spills up to 40,000 bbl (with some variability, as reflected in the results in Table H.9.2-3). For a small spill, based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality would be affected (Tables H.3.1- 1 and H.3.1-2), the volume of adverse effect on plankton and fish would be neglig ible for all response options unde r Alternative 3. For medium and large spills, the volumes and areas of adverse effect are up to three times larger than those without chemical dispersion. and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-228 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the te xt) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Since the adverse effects occur in a small percentag e of the area of concern and are less than the range of natural variability, the recovery time would be less than 1 year. Overall, based on the modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 would be localized to the immediate area around the spill site and similar in all marine water areas of the region. Even without chemical dispersion, concentrations of toxic components could become high enough to cause levels of concern for pl ankton and fish for medium or large spills if the slick moved into shallow coastal areas and embayments under conditions where storm-generated waves mix large amounts of fresh oil into the water column. Under Alternative 3, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm1 of shore or in enclosed coastal lagoons; therefore, it would not contribute to such risk, and might even reduce concerns by dispersing portions of the slick before it can enter shallow waters. Based on the discussion in Pa rt D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), if the adversely affected area is marine water habitat or for water column organisms with broad distribution over all subtidal habitats, a risk score of 4E applies. A risk score of 3C applies to coral reefs, 4E to seagrass, and 3D to hard-bottom habitat organisms. The risk scores do not change with chemical dispersion. Given that many species and life stages of plankton and fish on and over coral reefs are more broadly distributed rather than restricted to the coral reef s (for example, they inhabit hard-bottom habitats as 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-229 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills well), and that these organisms reproduce on time scales of less than 1 year, the overall risk score of 4D is assigned for plankton and fish for the ba sic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with or without dispersant use. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant fo r small spills, and minor for medium and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Intertidal Habitats Potential adverse effects on intertidal habitats in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.2 and summarized in Table H.3.2-4 (the results in Table H.3.2-4 are included in Table H.9.2-4 for comparison). Potential adverse effects on intertidal habitats during oil spills in the Caribbean region are of particular concern because of their relatively small extent, a high degree of historical loss and degradation, and their ecologi cal importance (Appendix F). Reducing oil effects on mangroves is of high priority because of their very long recovery rates, which can be more than 20 years (Section 4.3.2.4). There is often a direct re lationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline, which can kill mangroves, and affect larger area s. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill, very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. However, potential for advers e effects on intertidal habitats increases as spill volume increases, with greatest concern where mangroves and sand beaches become heavily oiled. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse e ffects on these habitats by reducing the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4). The risk sc ores in Tables H.3.2-4 an d H.9.2-4 were based on estimated adverse effects on intertidal habitats of the Florida Straits.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats for a sm all spill were determined to be medium by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting mangroves to recover quickly under light oiling. For a medium spill using 80 percent disper sant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 72 percent, from nearly 10 km under Alternative 1 to 2.7 km under Alternative 3. In addition, chemical dispersion nearly doubled the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 10 (Alternative 1) to 19 (Alternative 3) ou t of the 100 model runs (t echnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). The extent of oiled mangrove s was very small and oil loading was light, with recovery estimated to take 1 to 3 years. The result s for 45 percent dispersant efficiency were similar to those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Tab le H.9.2-4), except that oil loading on mangroves was higher with a longer recovery time. For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficien cy, the length of oiled shoreline was reduced by 62 percent, but the oil loadings on mangrove habitat were high enough to predict recovery at greater than 7 years. The number of times that no oil stranded onshore increased from 12 (Alternative 1) to 18 (Alternative 3) out of the 100 model runs (techni cal report [French McCay et al., 2004]). The results for 45 percent dispersant efficiency were essentially the same as those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.9.2-4). Although areas other than the Florida Straits for the Caribbean region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on intertidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Caribbean region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for sm all spills and significant for large spills, with or without dispersant use. For large spills, even though chemical dispersion Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-231 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills reduces the risk score, the expected impacts remain significant because of the extent of oiling. For medium spills, adverse impacts are expected to be significant but are reduced to moderate and minor levels of concern when chemical dispersion is used \u2014the benefits increase with increasing efficiency. Subtidal Habitats Potential adverse effects on subtidal habitats in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.2 and summarized in Table H.3.2-5 (the results in Table H.3.2-5 are included in Table H.9.2-5 for comp arison). In the Caribbean region, there is particular concern for the possible effects to coral re efs and seagrass beds near the shoreline. The addition of in situ burning does not change the potential adverse impacts from those with mechanical-only recovery. Usually, subtidal habitats are protected by the d iluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate rather than dissolve, and the rapid dilu tion of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil residue pote ntially reaching the bottom substrate. Subtidal habitat can be affected either by contamination of the sediment or by exposure of demersal organisms to dissolved hydrocarbons. In the case of the the Florida Straits model, the threshold concentration for dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons was never exceeded for a medium spill regardless of response option used. For a la rge spill it was exceeded when dispersants were used, only in an area of less than 0.001 percent of even the small area of Florida Bay. The total hydrocarbon threshold was exceeded for both spill sizes, but the equivalent area of 100 percent mortality was never more than 0.005 percent of the total area. Table H.9.2-5 presents the results for subtidal habitats in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Exposure of demersal organisms to dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons is also a potential risk, and of the three key habitats \u2014seagrass beds, coral reefs, and hard-bottom communities \u2014coral reefs were at the greatest risk of exposure. Model results fo r a medium spill indicated that 4.6 percent of coral reef habitat could be affected under the basi c response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit). Chemical dispersion at 45 or 80 percent efficiency increased the risk, but not substantially (4.9 and 4.8 percent, respectively). For a large spill the model estimate was that 5.0 percent of the coral reef habitat coul d be affected under the basic response scenario. Again, chemical dispersion increased the risk, bu t very little (both values were 5.6 percent). Recovery from the short-term exposures likely unde r these scenarios should occur in 1 year or less for small spills, and should not exceed 1 to 3 years for medium and large spills. These results are consistent with those for other re gions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of ad verse effects on subtidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Caribbean region. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-233 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Se ction 4.3), potential regional advers e impacts on subtidal habitats in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are exp ected to be insignificant for small spills, and moderate for medium and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Areas of Special Concern For this analysis, the risks to areas of special conc ern are assumed to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Section H.9.2), whichever are greater. Potential adverse effects on areas of special concern in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.2 and summarized in Table H.3.2-6 (the results in Table H.3.2-6 are included in Table H.9.2-6 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on areas of spec ial concern in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse consequences from those with mechanical-only recovery alone. Under Alternative 3 the risk to intertidal habitats was the higher of the two for small or large spills, but the pattern for medium spills was inconsistent in that chemical dispersion reduce d the risk to intertidal habitats to the point that the risk to subtidal habitat s was now the greater of the two. This is the only modeled location where this occurred and reflects the sensitive nature of the shallow subtidal habitat in the region. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse effects on shoreline areas of special concern by reducing the amount of oil that strand s onshore (Section 4.3.2.4) but would not increase the risk to subtidal areas (Table H.9.2-6). This is also potentially bene ficial for habitats like coral reefs and seagrass beds because they are at risk from oil that erodes offshore. Although areas other than the Florida Straits were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; theref ore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on areas of special concer n will fall within a similar range throughout the Caribbean region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), pot ential regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Caribbean region un der Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small spill sizes. For medium spills, the potential impacts are strongly influenced by ch emical dispersion, which reduces intertidal impacts on the point where the moderate impacts on subtidal habitats become relatively more important. The su btidal habitat impacts are not affected by chemical dispersion. For large spills the potential impacts are significant for intertidal habitats re gardless of response option used, although there was a reduction in the affected area with chemical dispersion. Subtidal impacts were unchanged and less than thos e for intertidal habitats. On an overall regional level for medium and large spills, adverse impacts on areas of specia l concern are reduced when chemical dispersion is used. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-234 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. H.9.3 Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species Potential adverse effects on threatened, endangered , or candidate species in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.3. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, fish, or sea turtles that are threatened, endangered, or candidate species are identical to those discusse d in Appendix H.9.2 for these groups. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effect on threatened, endangered, or candidate species in that larger sp ills tend to spread across a larger surface water area and have higher shoreline oil loading. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse consequences from those with mechanical-only recovery. With the addition of chemical dispersion under Alternative 3 for a small spill, the contaminated surface water area is small when compared with the overall surface water area in the Caribbean region, so the likelihood of thre atened, endangered, or candidate species becoming oiled at the surface is minimal. Very little oil is likely to stra nd onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. Potential adverse effects increase as spill volume increases, with greatest concern for bays, estuaries, and known breeding grounds. Although populations are sporadic and vary with migration, if a threatened, endangered, or candidate sp ecies were present in the area of an oil spill, the resulting adverse effects could be great. The severity of the effect varies depending on the sensitivity of the individuals present. Overall, risk scores were highest for marine and coastal birds. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce advers e effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species by reducing both the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4) and the amount of floating oil. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-235 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to marine and coastal birds. On an overall regional level for medium and large spills, even though chemical dispersion reduces the risk score, the expected impacts remain moderate because of the extent of oiling. H.9.4 Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat For this analysis, the risks to Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Section H.9.2), whichever are greater. Since the risk to subtidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Potential adverse effects on EFH in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.4. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for sm all spills, and moderate for medium and large spills, with or without dispersa nt use, based on the risk to subtidal habitats. H.9.5 Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Sect ion 4.3.5, oil spills can produce a variety of adverse social and economic effects. These adverse effects are generally not large when measured at the regional levels, but instead are typically felt in communities located near resources oiled by the spill. Specifically, large adverse effects are generally limited to those industries and populati ons that are affected by the spill. Some of the most visible and large effects are likely to incl ude effects on water- and shore-based recreation, commercial and recreational fisheries, and tourism. In addition, large-scale spills hold the potential to adversely affect the overall well-being of the residents and economies of coastal communities. This modeling considers the risk of adverse soci oeconomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreati onal activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceive d taint; closure of comm ercial fishing grounds or hatcheries, or reduced commercial harvests; and altered ma rine transportation patterns. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on social and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may cause changes in employment and firm re venues of resource-based businesses. While these effects are not quantified in this modeling, this disc ussion provides absolute and relative measures of the overall risk of advers e social and economic effect s of small, medium, and large oil spills using the basic respon se scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) in the Caribbean region. The methodology is de scribed in more detail in the Atlantic region (Section H.8.5). There is no existing standard for \"significance\" related to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface water must be oiled to be considered a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the effect will depend on a numb er of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, loca l), opportunities for resource substitution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of low concern if it is not of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-236 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the effects under all modele d scenarios would likely be small at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that did occur wo uld be expected to be localized in nature. The risk factor reflects the ratio of the percentage of the oiled surface wate r using the basic response scenario to the percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion. For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of ri sk equal to one-fifth that expected given response options limited to mechanical recovery and in situ b u r n i n g . U n de r A l t e r n a t i v e 1 , a r i s k f a c t o r o f 1 . 0 i s a s s i g n e d t o medium and large spills (small spills are assumed to have a negligible effect), indicating that no additional response options are taken in this modeled area. In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi from shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 3. In marine waters 3 or more statute mi from shore, the basic response scenario with the addition of chemical dispersion could be used under Alternative 3 in the Caribbean region. Potential adverse effects to coastal communities in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario are presented in Section H.3.5 and summarized in Table H.3.5-1 (the results in Table H.3.5-1 are included in Table H.9.5-1 for comparison) for oiled surface water. Table H.9.5-1 highlights the effects of small, medium, and large oil spills on the Caribbean region's socioeconomic resources by presenting estimates of resources oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute terms (area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of the total resource base in the modeled area. The threshold of concern for oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m 2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). This resource area is based on an estimate of the extent to which the coastal community in the modeled area potentially relies on each resource. For the Caribbean region, the length of oiled shoreline above the threshold of concern is not considered relevant. A single metric was selected for this region since (1) shoreline oiling results from the Florida Keys area were highly sensitive in the modeled spill location; (2) the ability to identify shoreline with characteristics amiable to use (i.e., sandy shore) was limited; and (3) area of oiled surface water above the threshold of concern was expected to provide a more accurate measure of expected risk, given the region's geographic characteristics.

For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of risk equal to one-fifth that expected wi th response limited to the basic response scenario. ** A 200-bbl spill is assumed to have negligible effect. This modeling assumes that the risk posed to the so cioeconomic environment by oil spills is directly related to the extent to which resources are affected above selected thresholds of concern \u2014for the Caribbean region, the square meters of marine water oiled above the threshold of concern. Comparing the absolute risk of adverse socioeconomic effects across spill scenarios, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understanding of the relative risk of adverse socioeconomic effects ac ross spill scenarios. Determ ining relative risk allows for extrapolation of site- specific results to the entire region. For example, the risk estimates presente d Table H.9.5-1 are based on modeled spills affecting the Florida Straits, wh ich is an appropriate su rrogate for the Caribbean region in this modeling. While any given spill may exhibit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic effects, the relative risk measures are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations, especially in island regions, as long as the spills occur in areas where chemical dispersion is feasible. In additi on, the conclusions reached for the Florida Straits are supported by results for other modeled areas\u2014 the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assumptions across spill sizes is similar in magnitude. For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life pot entially affected by an oil spill. Absolute and re lative risk are Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-238 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills discussed for coastal comm unities, demography, and employment; general economic status of a coastal community; vessel transpor and ports; recreation and tourism; and publ ic safety and worker health. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Coastal communities benefit from and rely on the marine environment to provide residents with sustenance, livelihoods, le isure opportunities, and shipping avenue s. Individuals who live and work in close proximity to the coast derive both social and economic rewards from the natural beauty, recreational opportunities, quality of life, economic re sources, and cultural attr ibutes associated with these coastal locations. These reward s are derived from asse ts such as National Parks, public beaches, fishing opportunities, and commercial and tourism-related industries. Thus, oil spills can affect any number of a coastal community's assets, leading to adverse effects on the economic benefits of community ac tivities. These effects, in turn, can impose changes on that community's demographic and employment patterns. In addition to direct employment and other adverse economic effects on marine resource-based economic sectors associated with oil spills, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on coastal communities. For example, because the Caribbean region relies on tourism for employment and earnings , plus the importance of maritime activities to various Caribbean coastal communitie s, coastal communities in this re gion are at risk from oil spills that affect tourism. Further, the importance of water transportation in delivering goods to the region's islands implies a heightened risk fr om an oil spill. Given their relia nce on marine resources, coastal communities on Caribbean islands are likely to be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of a spill than communities located on the mainland, whic h have a more diverse economic base. As a result of oiling, beaches in th e immediate vicinity of a spill may be closed to visitors, and fishing may not be permitted in waters exposed to oil, ca using revenue losses to the tourism and commercial and recreational fishery sectors of the coastal economy. These effects would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing short-term decreases in recreation and tourism; commercial and r ecreational fishing; and the empl oyment opportunities, income, and businesses these industries support. In addition, an oil spill may te mporarily reduce the appeal of coastal living in a given area. To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surfa ce water oiling, this combination of spill response options will act to reduce adverse effects on coas tal communities. The scope of potential losses is described in more detail in subsequent sections. For a small spill in the Caribbean region, the risk to coastal communities is negligible (Table H.9.5-1). Because of the small surface water area exposed to oil as a result of a small spill, marine-based economic factors such as local commercial or recreati onal fisheries may experience little or no effect. While the risks to coastal communities increase wi th spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion medium and large spills in the Caribbean region will have a spill area 1 above the corresponding thresholds of concern that will sweep approximately 99 to 101 million m2 and 282 to 332 million m2, respectively, of marine waters used by commercial fisheries and recreation activities (Table H.9.5-1). 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-239 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 3.4 percent of surface wa ter would be affected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spills. Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, industri es, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affected by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer dire ct and indirect adverse economic effects due to an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease revenue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses affect commercial and recreational fisheries: both the anglers themselves and related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated entire ly. Tourism and associated businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal areas decline and purcha se of area goods and services decrease because of perceived taint. A small spill that is 3 or more statute mi offshor e would have essentially no adverse effects on either the local or regional economies (Table H.9.5-1). There is little to no risk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikel y that any commercial or recreational fisheries would be affected. While the risk increases as spill size increases, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion, medium and large spills w ill sweep 99 to 101 million m 2 and 282 to 332 million m2 of marine waters, respectively, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.9.5-1). Despite chemical dispersion, a medium or large spill could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oi led recreational beaches, closures of commercial and recreational fishing grounds, and degradation of the appeal of coastal locations. While the adverse effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctan ce on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, could cause socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expect ed to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (r egionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be affected); an y adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlike ly to result from even the largest spills. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore are not likely to cause large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports. Local resources would ea sily handle whatever response operations are implemented. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commerce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft movement as a means of facilitating spill response. Vessel transportation is of paramount importanc e to the Caribbean region's trade and tourism Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-240 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills industries. Ports on each Caribbean island provide berths for the cruise ships that visit their shores, bringing tourists and revenue to th e islands. Disruption of transportat ion and cruises is as detrimental as disruption of the movement of cargo ships, which is also critical to island imports and exports. Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or increase in travel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities, as fewer goods are exch anged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. These advers e effects might be felt at a number of levels. For example, vessel operators may incur additional costs associated with dela ys and longer shipping distances; businesses that depend on timely receipt of feedstoc k or other goods may experience adverse effects such as production slowdowns; and individuals who work in adversely affected sectors may be displaced. To the extent th at businesses in other locations depend on the affected industries, a longer-term disruption of vessel transportation coul d yield adverse effects beyond the immediate spill area. However, given alternative ports of call, substitute suppliers and shipping modes, and the expected short-term nature of any di sruption in vessel traffic, such ad verse effects are not likely to be large. For a small spill, no high adverse effects on vessel transportation or ports are expected (Table H.9.5-1). While the risk to the vessel transportation industry increases with spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion medium and large spills will sweep 99 to 101 million m 2 and 282 to 332 million m2 of marine waters, respectively, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.9.5\u00ad 1). However, a spill occurring under specific locati on, weather, and tidal co nditions could adversely affect vessel transportation and ports and the industri es and communities that depend on this traffic. Any adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports would likely be short lived \u2014that is, even if shipping waters or ports are exposed to oil and ar e therefore closed, as soon as recovery efforts remove surface oil, these facilities would be expected to be reopened. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review, potential regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (r egionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be affected); an y adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlike ly to result from even the largest spills. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerable to oil spills because of both cl osures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to high losses for the commercial fishing industry, as well as related industries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from comm ercial fleets. By contaminating key waters, an oil spill may also disrupt employment in the commerc ial fisheries and related sectors of the economy. In addition, oil spills can lead to a decreased demand for fish from affected waters because of actual or perceived taint and can instigate alterations to fishing practices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or decreases revenues. Large spills can potentially injure fish nursery grounds and impose other risks that could reduce fish harvests in the longer term. For a small spill in the Caribbean region, the risk to commercial fisheries is low (Table H.9.5-1). While the risk to the commercial fishing indust ry increases with spill si ze, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion medium an d large spills will adversely affect 99 to 101 Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-241 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills million m2 and 282 to 332 million m2, respectively, of marine waters used by the commercial fishing industry, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.9.5-1). A risk of economic loss to the marine fishery w ill occur when waters exceed relevant management and/or thresholds of concern. For example, fishing may not be permitted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold, result ing in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting adverse effe cts would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing decr eases in employment, inco me, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, spill effects on the comm ercial fishing economy may be less severe. Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will no t generally be regional or national in nature, but could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commer cial fishing, in square meters of surface water oiled above the corresponding threshold of concern. The effects of an oil spill on recreational fishery-related activities will be felt more heavily by various populations, including recreational anglers, commercial tour boat operators, and firms that supply goods and services to recreational anglers. For example, recreational anglers fish for pleasure or sport, as opposed to monetary gain. In the wake of an oil spill, such anglers may choose to fish at a substitute location, may experience a reduced quality of experience, or may choose to forgo fishing entirely. The losses suffered will be related to these missed opportunities. In addition, while closing waters to recreational fishing will decrease the social welfare of recreationists, it would also be expected to affect the demand for boat rentals and other services co nsumed by fishing enthusiasts. For a small spill, adverse effects on recreational fish ing resources in the Caribbean region would likely be negligible (Table H.9.5-1). Medium and large sp ills may cause decreases in local recreational fishing activities and in the revenues generated from these activities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), pote ntial regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On averag e, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is aff ected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be a ffected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Subsistence Potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.3.5 and summarized in Table H.3.5-2 (the results in Table H.3.5-2 are included in Table H.9.5-2 for comparison). The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery alone. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-242 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Under Alternative 3, potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Caribbean region are low for small, medium, and large spills. Dispersant use may increase advers e effects on subsistence resources by increasing water column exposu re to dissolved aromatics; however, effects on intertidal subsistence resources may be reduced beca use chemical dispersion is expected to reduce the amount of oil that strands in intertidal habitats (Section 4.3.2.4). The risk ranking using the basic response scenario (current le vels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chem ical dispersion is presented in Table H.9.5-2. Table H.9.5-2 Risk Ranking of Offshore Oil Spills * to Subsistence Using the Basic Response Scenario with the Addition of Chemical Dispersion (Option A) in the Florida Straits Spill Size Response Option (% dispersant efficiency) Resources Affected (estimated %) Risk Score \u00a7 Small (200 bbl) Basic 0-1 4E Chemical Dispersion 4E or 80) 1-5 4D Source: Adapted from Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Caribbean region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Effects on subsistence resources for a small spill were determined to be small by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. With the a ddition of chemical dispersion at 45 percent efficiency for a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) occurring west of Long K ey and at high co ncentrations (100 - 10,000 ppb) occurring along the lower Florida Ke ys. Sediment exposure was expected to be negligible. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 per cent efficiency for a large spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at both low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) occurring west of Lower Matecumbie Key and high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) occurring along the lower Florida Keys west of Little Big Pine Key. Sediment exposure was expected to be negligible. The modeling showed similar results at 80 percent efficiency, with the ex ception of minimal sediment exposure in the lower Florida Keys. Although areas other than the Florida Straits fo r the Caribbean region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on subsis tence resources will fall within a similar range throughout the Caribbean region. Adverse effects on subsistence resources are not likely to be high on a regional level, but may be high on a local level. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-243 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potent ial regional adverse impacts on subsistence in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, but increase to minor with the addition of chemical dispersion. Historic Resources Potential adverse effects on hist oric resources in the Caribbean region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.5. Under Alternative 3, adverse effects on historic resources in the Caribbean region would likely be negligible, regardless of spill size, because most archaeological artifacts and some shipwrecks are buried under sediment and coral formations, and therefore would not become oiled or come in contact with dispersants (Section 3.2.5.6). Adverse ef fects on historic sites su ch as forts and walls, which are located on land, are protected from oilin g and dispersants by barr iers and proximity to shore. Submerged shipwrecks in nearshore waters ar e not likely to become oi led. Chemical dispersion may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, which will also reduce the amount of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to se nsitive historic structures. There are limited data that identify long-term or chronic degradation to cultural resources due to chemical dispersion. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expect ed to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Recreation and Tourism Oil spills can adversely affect a coastal community's recreational and tourism assets. The tropical islands of the Caribbean region provide visitors and residents with the opportunity to enjoy a number of outdoor recreational activities and scenic vistas. Beaches, National Parks, and marine sanctuaries are key attractions in the Caribbean region for water recreation and wildlife viewing. An oil spill would be expected to affect recreationists' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and economic implications of a spill would reach beyond these di rect effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment above and in Section H.3.5 for more details). For a small spill in the Caribbean region, the risk to recreation and tourism is negligible (Table H.9.5-1). There is little to no ri sk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. While the risks to recreation and tourism increase with spill size, th e effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion, medium and large spills will sweep 99 to 101 million m 2 and 282 to 332 million m2, respectively, of marine waters, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.9.5\u00ad 1). Despite chemical dispersion, a medium or large sp ill could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oiling recreational beaches, clos ures of fishing grounds, and degradation of the appeal of coastal locations. While the physical effects of even a large spill would Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-244 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, coul d cause socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be affected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts ar e unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are defined as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill, or through consumption of contaminated water or organisms. There are many areas in the Caribbean region with high population concentrations along the coast. However, adverse effects on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore for any of the spills considered, regardless of the response options \u2014mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to protect the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are re lated to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill response equipment can be dangerous, which is well- recognized and is the basis for the worker certification and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The ri sk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but it is minimized if safety standards are followed. There are also protocols in place for the proper application and handling of dispersants. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Caribbean region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. H.10. A LTERNATIVE 3 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE PACIFIC REGION For the purpose of this PEIS, the Pacific region co nstitutes the coastal area in which the states of California, Oregon, and Washington border the Pacifi c Ocean (Figure 3.1-1). The location selected for modeling and risk assessment purposes was a site offshore of the entrance to San Francisco Bay because it is in a high-traffic area at greater risk of oil spills. Modeling results from this location were evaluated relative to the geographic area in Section E.1.2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), herein referred to as the Central California Shelf. The Central California Shelf encompasses two biogeographical provinces: the Central California Coas t and San Francisco Bay. In general, the site is representative of offshore sites throughout the region and provides a basis for the modeling of potential environmental effects. The results of the modeling \u2014used to evaluate spills of concern in this risk analysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore) \u2014are presented in detail in Part E of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and summarized in this section. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-245 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Table H.10.-1 presents the risk ranking for the modeling of Alternative 3 in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chem ical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent recovery efficiency1 for the three spill sizes (small, 200 bbl; medium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). (Based on the discussion of Alternative 3 pres ented in Section 2.8.3, a 25 percen t increase in mechanical recovery capability would not change the effectiveness of th e basic response scenario under Alternative 1.) The risk scores presented in Table H. 10-1 are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional considerations; however, in any specific o il spill situation local concerns could be higher. Table H.10-2 summarizes the significance of the potential benefi cial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 3 in the Pacific region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for the average spill to the region in general.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Without the addition of chemical dispersion, th e results are unchanged from the basic response scenario (see the discussion in Section H.4). In summary, there is a minor or insignificant adverse regional impact to all resources, except for moder ate impacts on marine mammals and marine and coastal birds for all spill sizes, and to coastal water quality, plankton and fish, intertidal habitats, areas of special concern, and Essential Fish Habitat for larg e spills. A large spill could also cause significant, but localized, adverse, short-te rm socioeconomic impacts. Adve rse impacts occur despite the treatment or recovery of some of oil, but are reduced by those actions when they are effective. Further, as explained in the introduction to Section 4.7, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantly change the level of concern iden tified from those obtained when using mechanical- only recovery. Under the available response options of Alternat ive 3, the addition of ch emical dispersion helps mitigate, but does not eliminate, potential adverse impacts on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, and coastal habitat and shorel ine, especially for larger spills, without significantly increasing the risk to water column or subtidal resources. Chemical di spersion also greatly re duces the likelihood of adverse effects to socioeconomic resources. H.10.1 Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to water quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect wa ter quality are the soluble aromatics, MAHs (monoaromatic even with chemical dispersion. Thus, eval uation of potential adverse effects is based on degree of potential contamination by these comp ounds. Under Alternative 3, chemical dispersion could increase soluble aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in areas where dispersants are applied. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effects on water quality are low for small, medium, and large oil spills, regardless of the response option us ed (mechanical recovery with or without in situ burning and chemical dispersion). This is beca use of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid diluti on of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column, even after periods of extreme turbulen ce that induce relatively high dissolution rates. Dispersants would be applied to surface oil after much of the evaporation of the toxic components occurs because of logistics (i.e., greater than 12 hours after the spill), such that the resulting increase of concentrations of toxic components in the wa ter column would be relatively small. Overall, based on the modeling and risk assessment results, it is concluded that \u2014using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion \u2014adverse water-quality effects under Alternative 3 would be low in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Pacific region. If an offshore spill moved into shallow and confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills under conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence or in areas where oil collects for a few weeks to months after a spill. Chemical dispersion would not be used in shallow and confined coastal waters (less than 3 nm1 from shore) under Alternative 3, so 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-249 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills could only contribute to adverse water-quality effect s in those areas if the dispersed oil plume drifted into the area befo re being diluted. The variable used to determine the potential effects on water quality is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentrat ion for 1 hour or longer, which is less than all established water-quality criteria and thresholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected water volume increases with spill volume and the level of physical or chemical dispersion during the time of the spill. Natural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of contaminated water that is above the threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Since the volume of water contaminated increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume contamin ated for a small spill wa s extrapolated from the mean medium- and large-spill mode l results. Potential adverse wate r-quality effects in the Pacific region with using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.1 and summarized in Tables H.5.1\u00ad1 and H.5.1-2 for coastal and marine waters, respectively (the results for coastal and marine water quality are included in Tables H. 10.1-1 and H.10.1-2 for comparison). Coastal In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi of shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 3. In marine waters 3 or more statute mi from shore, the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion could be used under Alternative 3 in the Pacific region. If dispersants were applied offshore, the dispersed oil plume could move into these nearshore areas. Since chemical dispersion would not be used in these areas, the le vel and duration of exposu re would be negligible because of dilution. San Francisco Bay is used as a representative of coastal water for analyzing the Central California Shelf, as well as the Pacific region. Sa n Francisco Bay is approximately 1,733 km 2 in area and about 5 m deep on average, with a total volume of approximately 8,665 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) were compared with the total volume of the San Francisco Bay to determine the potential consequences of small, medium, and large spills (Table H.10.1-1). This approach was us ed both with and without dispersant use, and yields a very conservative estimate in that it assumes all of the contamination would occur in coastal water. Since dispersants could not be empl oyed in such areas, this would imply that the dispersed oil plume moved directly into coastal waters without dilution, which will not occur. and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-250 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of th e Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil may be incorporated into shallow water or intertid al sediments where, thro ugh leaching, it could become a continuing source of con tamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality wher e the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier I standards (beginning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concern to water quality would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have a small influence on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would apply whet her either response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, without or without dispersant use. For medium and large spill s, impacts are expected to be insignificant and minor, respectively, but increase to minor and mode rate, respectively, with the addition of chemical dispersion. Marine The Central California Shelf was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters in the Pacific region. The total surface area of the Ce ntral California Shelf is approximately 16,639 km 2, so the area of interest is much vaster for marine waters than for coastal waters. Water-quality effects Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-251 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water \u201430 m deep, which is much shallower than most of the Pacific region's marine waters. The results for the selected modeling location (Table H.10.1-2) represent conservative estimates of adverse water-quality effects using the basic response scenario (current levels of in situ burning when circumstances permi t) with the addition of chemical dispersion. Because of natural dilution, evapor ation, and biological processes, oil contamination levels would decrease rapidly even after a large spill, with or without chemical di spersion, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. The estimated vo lume of contaminated water \u2014and its variability \u2014 are generally applicable to spills of the same size throughout the Pacific region because natural and chemical oil dispersion into the water column an d dilution processes are similar in all areas. The results in Table H.10.1-2 are nearly the same (w ith some uncertainty refl ected in the variability of the results) for 45 and 80 percent efficiency because the amount of dispersant at 45 percent efficiency is sufficient to treat all dispersible surf ace oil, for spills up to 40,000 bbl. For a small spill, the volume of water contaminated would be the same as under Alternative 1 because, due to logistics, dispersants co uld only be applied after a small sp ill has mostly dispersed naturally. Chemical dispersion for medium or large spills increases the volume of water contaminated \u2014and the percentage of the area of concern \u2014that would be adversely affected by about a factor of six, which is still a small volume relative to that of the entire modeled area. In situ burning (in combination mechanical recovery and chemical dispersion) would not significantly change the volume contaminated or the effect on water quality since it would substitute for some of the mechanical response.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-252 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impact s on marine water quality in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (see Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an o il spill on air quality may involve al l volatile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are normally very localized and short lived fo r small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any potential adverse effect s: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. Chemical dispersion reduces the volatilization of unburned oil to the atmosphere to only a slight extent, so that effects are essentially identical with or without dispersant use. Potential adverse effects on air quality in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanic al recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.1 and summarized in Table H.5.1-3. Two possi ble sources of contamination to the atmosphere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilizat ion of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). As discussed in Section H.3.1, the results of the modeling show that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-only recovery; hence, the risk scores are virtually identical for medium and large spills. Vo latilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill site. Evaporation off the water surface and volatilization from the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocar bon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentrations in the atmosphere at the water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The atmospheric recovery time would be on the order of hours to days. Thus, a low level of concern is expected for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3, the addition of chemical di spersion does not change the results from those under Alternative 1. Chemical dispersion would disperse some of the volatile hydrocarbons into the water resulting in the volatile hy drocarbons entering the atmosphere over a larger area than would occur without chemical dispersion. Thus, dispersant s further dilute hydrocarbon concentrations in the atmosphere. The modeling show s that results are low for a spill of any size involving some combination of mechanical response and chemical dispersion at any spill site in the Pacific region. Adverse effects of in situ burning on air quality are summarized in Table H.5.1-3; these results apply whether or not chemical dispersion is used on unbu rned oil, and they do not vary by the location of the burn. Thus, the results for Alternative 1 apply to Alternative 3 for all areas in the Pacific region. The modeling was performed for weather conditions where dilution in the air would be relatively slow, so the estimated adverse effects are overestimated for other conditions. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning, with or without chemic al dispersion, would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via in situ burning. For small spills, it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disp erse too rapidly for it to be feasible Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-253 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills (Table H.5.1-3). The maximum area potentially ex ceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km2 for a medium sp ill and 11.1 km2 for a large spill (Table H.5.1-3). If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wildlife) are within these areas, they could be affect ed by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshor e in marine waters, a region of interest equivalent to the Ce ntral California Shelf (16,639 km2) would have less than 1 percent of its area affected, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. The addition of chemical dispersion does not change the results un der Alternative 1 in Table H.5.1-3. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on air quality in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without in situ burning. H.10.2 Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals Potential adverse effects on marine mammals in the Pacific region using the basic response option (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.2 and summarized in Ta ble H.5.2-1 (the results in Table H.5.2-1 are included in Table H.10.2-1 for comparison). Potential adverse effects on marine mammals are a serious issue in the Pacific region. There is a wide range of species, many of which would be at serious risk if a spill occurred in areas that they us e. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on marine mammals because larger spills tend to spread across a larger surface water area and have higher shoreline oil loading. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill, the contaminat ed surface water area is small when compared with the overall surface water ar ea in the Pacific region, so the likelihood of marine mammals becoming oiled at the surface or on a contaminated shoreline is minimal. Very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading woul d be light in most cases. Thus, the potential risk of oiling a haulout area or breeding ground is small. Pote ntial adverse effects increase as spill volume increases, with greatest concern for conditions where haulout areas, bays, estuaries, and known breeding grounds could become heavily oiled. If a local population of marine mammals is affected, it is estimated that it would take 1 to 3 years to recovery. Effective chemical dispersion could reduce this risk, but would not change the overal l risk score. The result s of the modeling for marine mammals are presented in Table H.10.2-1. Based on the area of appropriate habitat in the Cent ral California Shelf, the equivalent areas for 100 percent mortality using mechanical-only recovery only for cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sea otters are less than 0.001, 0.007, and 0.54 percen t, respectively, of th e available habitat for a medium spill. For a large spill without chemical disp ersion the values increase to 0.003, 0.04, and 2.90 percent, respectively. Chemical dispersion reduces all of these percentages, but except for sea otters the values are already so low that the difference is not important. For sea otters, chemical dispersion at 45 or 80 percent efficiency reduced the areas by approximately 35 and 48 percent for medium and large spills, respectively, but this impr ovement did not change the overall leve l of risk, primarily because of the expected recovery time. Pinnipeds are also at risk from shoreline oiling. The likelihood that oiling would actually involve a pinniped haulout area is low, based on the predicted length of shoreline contaminated, but does contribute to the potential risk (see the discussion on intertidal habitats). This risk is also reduced by chemical dispersion. Ba sed on the distribution of mammals in the Pacific Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-254 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills region, the potential level of concer n was determined to be low for sm all spills but would increase to medium levels for medium and large spills.

Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on marine mammals in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be minor for small spills, and moderate for medium and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On an overall regiona l level, for medium or large spills, adverse impacts are reduced when chem ical dispersion is used but remain moderate. Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal birds in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.2 and summarized in Table H.5.2-2 (the results in Table H.5.2-2 are included in Table H.10.2-2 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of spilled oil and the potential for adverse e ffects on birds; larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger area s. Potential adverse effe cts increase with spill volume; the greatest concern is fo r conditions when the more-sheltered interior wetlands and tidal flats become heavily oiled, and surface oiling occurs in areas where rafting birds congregate. The addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not reduce the severity of potential adverse effects or incr ease the risk to marine and coastal birds. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and oil loading would be light in most cases. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse effects on these habitats primarily by reducing the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4). Surface water oiling may also adversely affect rafting seabirds (Section 3.4.2.2), and chemical dispersion is expected to Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-255 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills reduce the extent of surface slicks that birds encoun ter. The risk scores in Table H.10.2-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates of 1 to 3 years for most bird species, as was the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2). For a small spill, predicted recovery rates were estimated to be less than 1 year because very small percentages of bird populations were estimated to be affected. For a small spill, shoreline oiling was expected to be light and to not persist. For a medium spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 45 percent compared with Alternative 1. The area of surface water oiling was reduced by 44 percent. There was little oiling of wetlands, but sand and gravel beaches used by s horebirds were more heavily oiled. The results for the 45 percent dispersant efficiency were similar to those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.10.2-2); some important staging, nesting, and feeding areas for shorebirds, waterfowl, and seabirds were still oiled, but the reduction in shoreline length and surface water area oiled would likely reduce adverse effects on birds.

Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-256 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficien cy, the extent of shorelin e oiling was reduced by 48 percent compared with Alternative 1. The area of surface water oiling was reduced by 49 percent. In addition, chemical dispersion in creased the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 1 (Alternative 1) to 4 (Alternative 3) out of 10 0 model runs (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). Oiling of wetlands and ti dal flats used by shorebirds and waterfowl and offshore islands used by seabirds occurred but was less extensive when chemical dispersion was used. The results for the 45 percent dispersant efficiency were similar to those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.10.2\u00ad 2). Although areas other than the Central California Shelf in the Pacific region were not analyzed, the results are consistent with those for other regions an alyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on birds will typically be reduced with chemical dispersion at either efficiency. The reduction of adverse effect s on birds when chemical dispersion is used is contingent upon whether the reduction of adverse shoreline effects coincides with heavily used habitats. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for medium and large spills, with or without dispersant use. For small spills, impacts are expected to be moderate, but are reduced to insignificant with the addition of chemical dispersion. On an overall regional level for medium and large spills, adverse impacts are reduced when chemical dispersion is used but remain moderate. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, ar e important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these groups are of high concern, particularly when chemical dispersion is considered as a potential re sponse option. As describe d in Section 4.3.2.3 and H.4.2, plankton and fish are adversely affected either directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil dr oplets mixed by wave s into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is di rect uptake of dissolved oil com ponents, originatin g directly from surface oil or dissolving from the microscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, adverse effects increase the larger the spill size. However, there is great variability related to the environmental conditions after the spill; plankton and fish suffer many more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather . In addition, many species utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they are more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved components when oil comes ashore. Sp ecies and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic components, with species from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stable locations more sensitive than those from polluted an d environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposures during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floating oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapi dly dilute to background levels. There may be longer-term effects if an offshore sp ill migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands wher e dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-257 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Juvenile fish are more abundant in salt ma rshes and seagrass and kelp beds th an in other shallow subtidal and intertidal areas, so these areas are of most concern (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 3, chemic al dispersion could not be used within 3 nm 1 of shore; therefore, it would not contribute to adverse effects on plankton and fish in these areas. The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percent loss multiplied by water volume exposed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes were translated to equivalent areas by multiplying by water depth at the spill site, allowing comparison with other resources such as birds and shorelines, which are distribu ted on a per-area basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniforml y distributed when expressed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by simi lar results for th e four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, offshor e Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco Bay (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) \u2014the equivalent areas of adverse effect on plankton and fish (both the average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in the PEIS. The modeled spill site was 30 m deep water: adverse effects would be smaller for deeper waters because of gr eater vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionately greater in shallower wa ters because of the restricted dilution potential and generally higher organism abundance. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much smaller. Thus, th e model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortalit y of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes am ong response scenarios. Potential adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of m echanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.2 and summarized in Table H.5.2- 3 (the results in Table H.5.2-3 are included in Table H.10.2-3 for comparison). The Central California Shelf, containing the waters between Point Conception and Cape Mendocino, was selected as representative of the Pacific region. Under Alternative 3, the results for 45 percent disp ersant efficiency were not significantly different than those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency beca use more than sufficient dispersant would be available under both conditions to disperse available surface oi l for spills up to 40,000 bbl (with some variability, as reflected in the results in Table H.10.2-3). For a smal l spill, based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality would be affected (Tables H.3-2 and H.3.1-1), the volume of adverse effect on plankton and fish wo uld be negligible for a ll response options under Alternative 3. For medium and large spills, the volumes and areas of adverse effect are up to four and ten times higher, respectively, than those without chemical dispersion. 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-258 2009 H.

Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery time would be less than 1 year. Overall, based on th e modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 would be localized to the immediate area around the spill site and sim ilar in all marine water areas of the region. Even without chemical dispersion, concentrations of toxic components could become high enough to cause concern for plankton and fish for medium or large spills if the slick moved into shallow coastal areas and embayments under conditions where storm-generated waves mix large amounts of fresh oil into the water column. Under Altern ative 3, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm1 of shore in enclosed coastal lagoons; theref ore, it would not contribute to such risk, and might even reduce concerns by dispersing portions of the slick before it can enter shallow waters. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spills, with or without dispersant use. Fo r large spills, impacts are expected to be insignificant, but increase to moderate with the additi on of chemical dispersion. 1 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-259 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Intertidal Habitats Potential adverse effects on intertidal habitats in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.2 and summarized in Table H.5.2-4 (the results in Table H.5.2-4 are included in Table H.10.2-4 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats in that la rger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mech anical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill, very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. Ho wever, the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats increase as spill volume increases, with greatest concern where mars hes and tidal flats become heavily oiled. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse effects on these habitats by reducing the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4). The risk scores in Table H.10.2-4 were based on adverse effects on the intertidal habitats of the Central California Shelf.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habitats for a small spill were determined to be small by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting recovery from light oiling to be rapid for all habitat types. For a medium spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the length of oiled shoreline was reduced by 45 percent, from 17. 1 km under Alternative 1 to 7.7 km under Alternative 3, which is less than 1 percent of the total shoreline in the area but 1 percent of the rocky shores. The results for the 45 percent dispersant efficiency were essentially the same as those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.10.2-4) . There was very little oiling of wetlands under any chemical dispersion scen ario for a medium spill. The habitats that were oiled \u2014rocky shores and sand and gravel beaches \u2014are expected to recover in 1 to 3 years. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-260 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 48 percent, from 45 km under Alternative 1 to 23.6 km under Alternative 3. However, approximately 1 km of wetlands was oiled, so the recovery rate was still expected to be 3 to 7 years (Section 4.3.2.4). The number of times that no oil stranded onshore increased from 1 (Alternative 1) to 4 (Alternative 3) out of the 100 model runs (te chnical report [F rench McCay et al., 2004]). The results for 45 percent dispersant effi ciency were very similar to those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.4-1). Although areas other than the Central California Sh elf in the Pacific region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on intertidal habi tats will fall within a similar range throughout the Pacific region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for large spills, with or without dispersant use. For small and medium spills, impacts are expected to be minor and moderate, respectively, but are reduced to insignificant and mi nor, respectively, with the addition of chemical dispersion. Subtidal Habitats Potential adverse effects on subtidal habitats in th e Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of m echanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.2 and summarized in Table H.5.2-4 (the results in Table H.5.2-4 are included in Table H.10.2-5 for comparison). In the Pacific region, there is particular concern for the possible effects to kelp beds near the shoreline. The addition of in situ burning does not change the potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. The risk to fauna and flora of the subtidal benthic habitat is minimal, based on the diluting effect of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate, rather than dissolve, an d the rapid dilution of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil re sidue potentially reaching the bottom substrate. Under Alternative 3, the addition of chemical dispersion does not increase the potential adverse consequences. For a medium spill without ch emical dispersion the sediment threshold concentrations for dissolved aromatic and for total hydrocarbons were never exceeded. For a large spill the sediment threshold for total hydrocarbon exposure was exceeded, but only in an area of less than 0.006 percent of the total reference area. Be nthic habitat was also a ssumed to be at risk if the threshold of concern for dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons affected stationary demersal species (those living at the sediment-water interface). With mechanical-only recovery less than 0.01 percent of the Central California Shelf was affected by water column concentrations above the threshold for a medium spill. For a large spill, the percentage increased to 0.01 percent. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 an d 80 percent efficiency for medium and large spills (Table H.10.2-5), the modeling results show th at sediment contaminatio n still did not occur for dissolved aromatic hydroc arbons, but very low levels were not ed for total hydrocarbon (less than 0.001 percent for medium spills and approximately 0.003 percent for large spills). The area of exposure of stationary demersal species to dissolved ar omatic hydrocarbon concentrations above the threshold remained at 0.001 percent for medium sp ills, but increased to a pproximately 0.15 percent for large spills, which is a very low level of exposure.

These results are consistent with those for other re gions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of ad verse effects on subtidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Pacific region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Se ction 4.3), potential regional advers e impacts on subtidal habitats in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Areas of Special Concern For this analysis, the risks to areas of special conc ern are assumed to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Section H.10.2), whichever are greater. Since the risk to intertidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Pote ntial adverse effects on areas of special concern in the Pacific region using the basic response scenar io (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.2 and summarized in Table H.5.2-5 (the results in Table H.5.2-5 are included in Table H.10.2-6 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on areas of special concern in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those of mechanical-only recovery. Adverse effects on areas of special concern for a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting recovery from light oiling to usually be rapid for all habitat types. For a medium spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by approximately 56 percent, from a pproximately 18 km under Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-262 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Alternative 1 to approximately 8 km under Alternative 3. The results for the 45 percent dispersant efficiency were essentially the sa me as for the 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.10.2-6).

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 48 percent. Therefore, the risk ranking was redu ced to reflect a potential reduction in recovery time. Under the 45 percent dispersant effici ency, the shoreline area oiled was similar. Although other areas in the Pacific region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for many other regions analyzed in this PEIS; theref ore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on areas of special concern will fall with in a similar range throughout the Pacific region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are ex pected to be moderate fo r large spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to intertidal habitats. For small and medium spills, impacts are expected to be minor and moderate, respectively, but are reduced to in significant and minor, respectively, with the addition of chemical dispersion. H.10.3 Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species Potential adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.3. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, fish, and sea turtles that are threatened, endangered, or candidate species are identical to those discussed in Section H.10.2 for these groups. There was no modeling data generated that directly addressed the potential risks or presence of threatened, endangered, or candidate species in the Pacific region; therefore, th e potential risk level to threatened, endangered, or candidate species was estimated based on data extr apolated from the marine mammal and marine and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-263 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills coastal bird analysis. There is often a direct rela tionship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species in that larger spills tend to spread across a larger surface water area and have higher shoreline oil loading. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. When chemical dispersion is us ed under Alternative 3 for a sma ll spill, the contaminated surface water area is small when compared with the overa ll surface water area in the Pacific region, so the likelihood of threatened, endangered, or candidate species beco ming oiled at the surface is minimal. Very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. Thus, the potential risk of oiling these species' br eeding habitat is small. Potential adverse effects increase as spill volume increase s, with greatest concern for co nditions where bays, estuaries, known breeding grounds of pinnipeds, sea otter ha bitats, or breeding areas for protected marine and coastal birds become heavily oiled. Although populations are sporadic and vary with migration, if a threatened, endangered, or candidate species were present in the area of an oil spill, the resulting adverse effects could be low. The severity of the effect varies depending on the sensitivity of the individuals present. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce the adverse effects to threatened, endangered, or candid ate species by reducing both the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4) and the amount of floating oil. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for medium and large spills, with or without dispersa nt use, based on the risk to marine mammals and to marine and coastal birds. For small spills, impacts are expected to be moderate, but are reduced to minor with the a ddition of chemic al dispersion. H.10.4 Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat For this analysis, the risks to Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Section H.10.2), whichever are greater. Since the risk to plankton and fish is greater, those risk scores were used. Potential adverse effects on EFH in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of me chanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are pres ented in Section H.4.4. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be in significant for small and medium spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to plankton and fish. For large spills, impacts are expected to be insignificant, but increase to moderate with the additi on of chemical dispersion. H.10.5 Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Section 4. 3.5, oil spills can produce a variety of social and economic effects. These adverse effects are generally not large when measured at the regional levels, but instead are typically felt in communities located near resources oiled by the spill. Specifically, severe adverse effects are generally limited to those industries and populations that are affected by the spill. Some of the most visible and large effects on the Pacific region are li kely to include effects on water- and shore-based recreation, commercial and recreation al fisheries, and tourism. In a ddition, large-scale spills hold the potential to adversely affect the overall well-being of the residents and economies of coastal communities. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-264 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills This modeling considers the risk of adverse soci oeconomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreati onal activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceive d taint; closure of comm ercial fishing grounds or hatcheries, or reduced commercial harvests; and altered ma rine transportation patterns. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on social and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may cause changes in employment and firm re venues of resource-based businesses. While these effects are not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and relative measures of the overall risk of adverse social and economic effects of small, medium, and large oil spills using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) in the Pacific region. Th e methodology is described in more detail in the Atlantic region (Section H.8.5). There is no existing standard for \"significance\" related to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface water must be oiled to be considered a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the effect will depend on a numb er of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, loca l), opportunities for resource substitution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of low concern if it is not of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the modeled effects under all modeled scenar ios would likely be low at the regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that did occu r would be expected to be localized in nature. The risk factor reflects the ratio of the percentage of the surface water oiled using the basic response scenario to the percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion. For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of ri sk equal to one-fifth that expected given response options limited to mechanical recovery and in situ b u r n i n g . U n de r A l t e r n a t i v e 1 , a r i s k f a c t o r o f 1 . 0 i s a s s i g n e d t o medium and large spills (small spills are assumed to have a negligible effect), indicating that no additional response options are taken in this modeled area. In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi from shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 3. In marine waters 3 or more statute mi from shore, the basic response scenario with the addition of ch emical dispersion could be used un der Alternative 3 in the Pacific region. Potential adverse effects on coastal communit ies in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario are presented in Section H.4.5 and summarized in Table H.5.5-1 (the results in Table H.5.5-1 are included in Table H.10.5-1 fo r comparison) for shoreline and surface water oiled. Table H.10.5-1 highlights the effects of small, medium, and large oil spills on the Pacific region's resources by presenting estimates of resources oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in absolute terms (meters of recreational beach oiled and square mete rs of marine waters used for commercial fishing oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a perc entage of the total resource base in the modeled area. For oiled shoreline, the threshold of concern is 10 g/m 2 and for oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). This reso urce area is based on an estimate of the extent to which the coastal community in the modeled area potentially relies on each resource. This modeling assumes that the risk posed to the so cioeconomic environment by oil spills is directly related to the extent to which resources are affected above selected thresholds of concern \u2014for the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-265 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Pacific region, meters of shoreline and square mete rs of marine water oiled above the threshold of concern. Comparing the absolute risk of adverse socioeconomic effects ac ross spill scenarios, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understanding of the relative risk of adverse socioeconomic e ffects across spill scenarios. Dete rmining relative risk allows for extrapolation of site-specific results to the entire region. For example, the risk estimates presented in Table H.10.5-1 are based on modeled spills affecting San Francisco Bay. While any given spill may exhibit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic effect, the relative risk measures are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations along the Pacific coast, as long as the spills occur in areas where chemical dispersion is feasible. In addition, the conclusions reached for the San Francisco Bay modeled area are supporte d by results for other modeled areas \u2014the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assump tions across spill size is similar in magnitude. For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life pot entially affected by an oil spill. Absolute and re lative risk are discussed for coastal comm unities, demography, and employment; general economic status of a coastal community; vessel transpor and ports; historic resources; recreation and tourism;; and public safety and worker health. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Oil spills affect the pleasure that coastal residents and visitors derive from coastal activities and the economic contribution that resources make to lo cal income and employment. To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning and chemical dispersion ca n reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water oiling, this combination of spill response options will act to reduce adverse effects on coastal communities. The scope of potential losses is described in more detail in subsequent sections. As a result of oiling, beaches in th e immediate vicinity of a spill may be closed to visitors, and fishing may not be permitted in waters ex posed to oil, causing losses in revenue to both the tourism and commercial and recreational fishery sectors of the coastal economy. These eff ects would be expected to reverberate through comm unities in the area of the spill, causin g short-term decreases in recreation and tourism; commercial and r ecreational fishing; and the empl oyment opportunities, income, and businesses these industries support. In addition, an oil spill may te mporarily reduce the appeal of coastal living in a given area.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a small spill along the Pacific coast, there is no risk of large adverse effects on coastal communities. In many cases, a spill of this size wo uld be expected to pose no risk to shoreline or surface water resources because the spilled oil w ill never reach the thresh old of concern (Table H.10.5-1). While the risk to coastal communities increases with spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion a medium spill will have a spill area1 above the corresponding thresholds of concern that will adversely affect 2,376 to 2,410 m of shoreline and 265 to 273 million m2 of marine waters (Table H. 10.5-1). A large spill will affect 7,538 to 8,612 m of shoreline and 432 to 476 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.10.5-1). Howe ver, when certain weather conditions and current patterns are combined wi th specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources either at all or at levels above the selected threshold. For medium and large spills along the Pacific coast, such conditions prevail in 44 to 52 percent and 13 to 18 percent of the time, respectively, based on modeled spills when the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion is used in the cleanup, regardless of dispersant effi ciency. For these spill events, no adverse effects on shoreline are expected. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3) , potential regional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large sp ills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resour ces in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 1.4 percent of shoreline and 6.6 percent of surface water would be affected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, indu stries, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affect ed by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer direct and in direct economic adverse effects due to an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease reve nue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisherie s, by both the anglers themselves and by related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated entirely. Tourism and associated businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal areas decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived taint. A small spill that is 3 or more statute mi offshor e would have essentially no adverse effects on either the local or regional economies (Table H. 10.5-1). There is little to no risk of oiling of economically important resources, and it is unlikel y that any commercial or recreational fisheries would be affected. While the risk increases with spill size, the effect s remain localized. With chemical dispersion a medium spill will adversely affect 2,376 to 2,410 m of shoreline and 265 to 273 million m 2 of marine waters (Table H.10.5-1). A large spill will affect 7,538 to 8,612 m of shoreline and 432 to 476 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.10.5-1). Howe ver, when certain weather conditions and current patterns are combined wi th specific spill response options, spilled oil is not expected to 1 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-268 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills reach shoreline resources either at all or at levels above the selected threshold. For medium and large spills along the Pacific coast, such conditions prevail in 44 to 52 percent and 13 to 18 percent of the time, respectively, based on modeled spills when the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion is used in the cleanup, regardless of dispersant efficiency. For th ese spills, no adverse effects on shoreline are expected. Despite chemical dispersion, a medium or large sp ill could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects because of oiled recreational beaches, commercial and recreational fishing ground closures, and degradation of the appeal of coastal locations. While the adverse effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on to urism, could cause socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 1.4 percent of shoreline and 6.6 percent of surface water would be affected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore ar e not likely to cause great adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports. However, an oil spill can di srupt marine commerce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft movement as a means of facilitating spill response. Vessel transportation is of paramount importance for many industries along the Pacific coast. Any interruption in the standard use of vess els or an increase in travel times over water can result in hardship for coastal communities, as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue streaming through the local economy fa lls. These adverse effects might be felt at a number of levels. For example, ve ssel operators may incur additional costs associated with delays and longer shipping distances; businesses that depend on timely rece ipt of feedstock or other goods may experience adverse effects such as production sl owdowns; and individuals who work in adversely affected sectors may be displaced. To the extent that businesses in other locations depend on the affected industries, a longer-term disruption of vess el transportation could yield adverse effects beyond the immediate spill area. However, gi ven alternative ports of call, substitute suppliers and shipping modes, and the expected short-term nature of any di sruption in vessel traffic, such adverse effects are not likely to be high. For a small spill, no great adverse effects on vesse l transportation or ports are expected (Table H.10.5-1). While the risk to the ve ssel transportation industry increa ses with spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion medium and large spills will sweep 265 to 273 million m 2 and 432 to 476 million m2 of marine waters, respectively, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.10.5-1). However, a spill occurring under specific location, weather, and tidal conditions could adversely affect vessel transportation and ports and the industries and communities that depend on this traffic. Any adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports would likely be short lived \u2014that is, even if shipping waters or ports are exposed to oil and are therefore closed, as soon as recovery efforts remove surface oil, these facilities would be expected to be reopened. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-269 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 ar e expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 6.6 percent of surface water would be aff ected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are un likely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerable to oil spills because of both cl osures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to great losses for the commercial fishing industry, as well as related industries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from comm ercial fleets. By contaminating key waters, an oil spill may also disrupt employment in the commerc ial fisheries and related sectors of the economy. In addition, oil spills can lead to a decreased demand for fish from affected waters because of actual or perceived taint, and can instigate alterations to fishing practices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or decreases revenues. Large spills can potentially injure fish nursery grounds and impose other risks that could reduce fish harvests in the longer term. For a small spill in the Pacific region, the risk to commercial fisheries is neg ligible (Table H.10.5-1). While the risk to commercial fishing increases wi th spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion, medium and large spills will adversely affect 265 to 273 million m2 and 432 to 476 million m2, respectively, of marine waters used by the commercial fishing industry, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.10.5-1). A risk of economic loss to the marine fishery w ill occur when waters exceed relevant management thresholds of concern. For example, fishing may not be permitted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold. These changes would result in reductions in commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting ad verse effects would be ex pected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, ca using decreases in employment, income, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, sp ill effects on the commercial fishin g economy may be less severe. Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will no t generally be regional or national in nature, but could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commercial fishing -- in square meters of surface water oiled above the corresponding threshold of concern. The effects of an oil spill on recreational fishery- related activities will be felt more heavily by various populations, including recreational anglers, commercial tour boat operators, and firms that supply goods and services to recreational anglers. For example, recreational anglers fish for pleasure or sport, as opposed to monetary gain. In the wake of an oil spill, such anglers may choose to fish at a substitute location, may experience a reduced quality Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-270 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills of experience, or may choose to fo rgo fishing entirely. The losses su ffered will be related to these missed opportunities. In addition, while closing waters to recreational fishing will decrease the social welfare of recreationists, it would also be expect ed to affect the demand for boat rentals and other services consumed by fishing enthusiasts. For a small spill, adverse effects on recreational fishing resources in the Pacific region would likely be negligible (Table H.10.5-1). Medium and large spills may cause decreases in local recreational fishing activities and in the revenues generated from these activities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Pacific region under Alternati ve 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On averag e, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is aff ected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 6.6 percent of surface water would be a ffected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Subsistence Potential adverse effects on subsistence resource s in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.5 and summarized in Table H.5.5-2 (the results in Table H.5.5-2 are included in Table H.10.5-2 for comparison). The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery alone. Under Alternative 3, potential adverse effects on su bsistence resources in the Pacific region are low for small, medium, and large spills. Chemical dispersion may increa se adverse effects on subsistence resources by increasing water colu mn exposure to dissolved aromatics; however, effects on intertidal subsistence resources may be reduced because chemical dispersion is expected to reduce the amount of oil that strands in intertidal habitats (Section 4.3.2.4). The risk ranking using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chem ical dispersion is presented in Table H.10.5-2.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Central California Shelf (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Pacific region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Effects on subsistence resources for a small spill were determined to be small by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 percent efficiency for a medium spill, the modeling results showed wa ter column exposure at low concentrations (1 - 100 ppb) in a more widespread area and at high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in localized areas outside San Francisco Bay. Sediment exposure occurr ed in small areas. The le ngth of oiled shoreline was reduced by 45 percent at 45 percent dispersant efficiency. Because of the increase in potential exposure to oil for water column resources and the decrease in potential expo sure for intertidal and shoreline resources, the risk sc ores did not change at 45 percent dispersant efficiency. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 80 percent ef ficiency for a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) in a more widespread area than at 45 percent dispersant efficiency and at high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in localized areas both inside and outside San Francisco Ba y. Reductions in shoreline oiling were similar to those for 45 percent dispersant efficiency, and sediment oiling was minimal. Because water column exposure at both low and high concentrations occurred in more widespread areas, the risk score in Table H.4.1-3 increased at 80 percent dispersant efficiency. The risk scores in Table H.10.5-2 reflect the predicted recovery rates for subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill volumes (Section 4.3.5.6). With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent efficiency for a large spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at both low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) and high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in more widespread areas th an under Alternative 1. Sediment exposure occurred in several areas in San Francisco Bay. The length of oiled shoreline was reduced by 48 percent when 80 percent dispersant efficiency was used, and the results were very similar at 45 percent dispersant efficiency. Because water column exposure at both low and high concentrations and sediment exposure in San Francisco Bay occurred in more widespread areas, the risk score increased when chemical dispersion was used for a large spill. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-272 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Although areas other than the Central California Shelf in the Pacific region were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for all other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on subsis tence resources will fall within a similar range throughout the Pacific region. On an overall regional level, adverse effects on subsistence resources are not likely to be high. On a local leve l, a large spill may cause high adverse effects on subsistence communities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potent ial regional adverse impacts on subsistence in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, with or without dispersant use. For medium spills, impacts are expected to be insignificant, but increase to minor with the addition of chemicals dispersion, depending on dispersant efficiency. For large spills, impacts are expected to be insignificant, but increase to minor levels of concern with the addition of chemical dispersion. Historic Resources Potential adverse effects on historic resources in the Pacific region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.4.5. Under Alternative 3, adverse effects on historic re sources in the Pacific region are expected to be negligible, regardless of spill size. Some archaeological artifacts occur on land along the coast, while others are likely submerged offshore (Section 3.4. 8). Chemical dispersion may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, whic h will also reduce the amou nt of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to sensitive archaeological sites and historic structures. Offshore historic resources are not at risk of becoming oiled or comi ng in contact with dispersants. There are limited data that identify long-term or chronic degradation to cultural resources due to chemical dispersion. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Recreation and Tourism Oil spills can adversely affect a coastal commun ity's recreational and tourism assets. Parks, seashores, beaches, and recreational fishing areas line the Pacific coast, and both residents of and visitors to the Pacific coast appreciate the recre ational opportunities offered to them by these resources. An oil spill would be expected to affect recreationists' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and economic implications of a spill woul d reach beyond these dire ct effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors ma y be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment above and in Section H.4.5 for more details). For a small spill in the Pacific region, the risk to recreation and tourism is negligible (Table H.10.5\u00ad 1). There is little to no risk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikely that any fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-273 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills While the risk to recreation and tourism increases wi th spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion a medium spill will adversely affect 2,376 to 2,410 m of shoreline and 265 to 273 million m2 of marine waters (Table H. 10.5-1). A large spill will affect 7,538 to 8,612 m of shoreline and 432 to 476 million m2 of marine waters (Table H.10.5-1). However, when certain weather conditions and current patterns ar e combined with specific spill res ponse options, spilled oil is not expected to reach shoreline resources either at all or at levels above the selected threshold. For medium and large spills along the Pacific coast, such conditions prevail in 44 to 52 percent and 13 to 18 percent of the time, respectively, based on mo deled spills when the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion is used in the cleanup, regardless of dispersant efficiency. For these spill events, no adverse effects on shoreline are expected. Despite chemical dispersion, a medium or large sp ill could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oiling of recreati onal beaches, closures of fishing grounds, and degradation of the appeal of coastal locations. While the physical effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, coul d cause socioeconomic effects to be greater. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 1.4 percent of shoreline and 6.6 percent of surface water would be affected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are defined as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill, or through consumption of contaminated water or organisms. There are many areas in the Pacific regi on with high population concentrations along the coast. However, adverse effects on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore for any of the spill sizes considered, regardless of the response options \u2014 mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to protect the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are related to direct oil exposure during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill response equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the worker certification and training requirements that are now in place. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The ri sk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. There are also protocols in place for the proper application and handling of dispersants. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), po tential regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Pacific region under Al ternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-274 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills H.11. A LTERNATIVE 3 - C ONSEQUENCES IN THE OCEANIA REGION Oceania is a collective name used for the islands scatte red throughout most of the Pacific Ocean. In its broadest sense, the term embraces the entire insular region between Asia and the Americas. For the purposes of this PEIS, the Oceania region will specifically cover the tropical waters surrounding the islands of Hawaii, Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Samoa (Figure 3.1-1). Midway, Jarvis, and Wake Islands are also included in some of the analyses. There was no location in this region for modeling and risk assessment purposes, but risks can be inferred from the range of effects observed in the five modeled locations. However, in some cases the modeling results for the Florida Straits (in the Atlantic region) were used because it has similar resources of concern. The results of the Florida Straits modeling \u2014used to evaluate sp ills of concern in this risk analysis (i.e., 3 or more statute mi offshore) \u2014are detailed in Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Table H.11-1 presents the risk ranking for the mo deling of Alternative 3 in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 and 80 percent recovery efficiency1 for the three spill sizes (small, 200 bbl; medium, 2,500 bbl; and large, 40,000 bbl). (Based on the discussion of Alternative 3 presented in Section 2.8.3, a 25 percent increase in mechanical recovery capability would not change the effectiveness of the basic response scenario under Alternative 1.) The risk scores presented in Table H.11-1 are based on the modeling results for an average spill and on regional consider ations; however, in any specific oil spill situation local concerns could be higher. Table H.11-2 summarizes the significance of the potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts associated with Alternative 3 in the Oceania region, based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for the average spill to the region in general. Without the addition of chemical dispersion, th e results are unchanged from the basic response scenario (see the discussion in Section H.9 in this appendix). In summa ry, there is a minor or insignificant adverse regional impact to all resources except for moderate impacts on marine and coastal birds for medium and large spills; moderate and significant impacts on intertidal habitats for medium and large spills, respectivel y; and moderate impacts on sea turtles and subsistence for large spills. A large spill could also ca use significant, but localized, ad verse, short-term socioeconomic impacts. All adverse impacts occur despite the treatm ent or recovery of some oil, but are reduced by those actions when they are effective. Further, as explained in the introduction to Section 4.7, the modeling shows that in situ burning would not significantly change the level of concern identified from those obtained when using mechanical-only recovery. 1 Recovery efficiency represents the operating effectiveness of the dispersant: the greater the efficiency, the more effective t he dispersant.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Under the available response options of Alternat ive 3, the addition of ch emical dispersion helps mitigate, but does not eliminate, potential advers e impacts on marine and coastal birds, marine mammals, and coastal habitat and shoreline, especially for larger spills, without significantly increasing the risk to water column or subtid al resources. Chemical dispersion also greatly reduces the likelihood of adverse effects to so cioeconomic resources. H.11.1 Consequences to the Physical Environment Water Quality Potential adverse consequences of oil spills to water quality are related to hydrocarbon contamination, as other constituents in oils are at concentrations that would not exceed thresholds of concern. The hydrocarbons that could affect wa ter quality are the soluble aromatics, MAHs (monoaromatic even with chemical dispersion. Thus, eval uation of potential adverse effects is based on degree of potential contamination by these comp ounds. Under Alternative 3, chemical dispersion could increase soluble aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in areas where dispersants are applied. No beneficial effects on water quality would be expected to result from an oil spill. For oil spills in marine waters, adverse effects on water quality are low for small, medium, and large oil spills, regardless of the response opt ions used (mechanical with or without in situ burning and chemical dispersion). This is because of the tendency for most chemical compounds of concern to evaporate, rather than dissolve, and the rapid d ilution of any chemical compounds that might enter the water column, even after periods of extreme turbulence that induce relatively high dissolution rates. Dispersants would be appl ied to surface oil after much of the evaporation of the toxic components occurs because of logi stics (i.e., greater than 12 hours after the spill), such that the resulting increase of concentratio ns of toxic components in the water column would be relatively small. Overall based on the modeling and risk as sessment results, it is concluded that\u2014 using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion \u2014adverse water-quality effects under Alternative 3 would be small in marine waters, even in the event of a large spill in the Oceania region. If an offshore spill moved into shallow and confined coastal waters, adverse effects could be locally important for medium and large spills under conditions where oil is mixed into water by strong turbulence or in areas where oil collects for a few weeks to months after a spill. Chemical dispersion would not be used in shallow and confined coastal waters (less than 3 nm 36 from shore) under Alternative 3, so it could not contribute to adverse water-quality effects in those areas if the dispersed oil plume drifted into the area before being diluted. The variable used to determine the potential effects on water quality is \"volume of water contaminated\" by more than 1 ppb of dissolved arom atic concentration for 1 hour or longer. That benchmark is less than all establis hed water-quality criteria and thre sholds of concern for effects on aquatic biota (Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.1). The affected water volume increases with spill volume and the level of physical or chemical dispersion during the time of th e spill. Natural dispersion increases with stronger winds and currents, lessening the volume of water that is contaminated above the 36 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-278 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills threshold of concern if in unconfined waters. Si nce the volume of water contaminated increases exponentially as a function of spill size, the estimated volume contaminated for a small spill was extrapolated from the mean medium- and large-spi ll model results. Potential adverse water-quality effects in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.1 and summarized in Tables H.7.1-1 and H.7.1-2 for coastal and marine waters, respectively (the results for coastal and marine water quality are included in Tabl es H.11.1-1 and H.11.1-2 for comparison). Coastal In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi of shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 3. In marine waters 3 or more statute mi from shore, the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion could be used under Alternative 3 in the Oceania region. If dispersants were applied offshore, the dispersed oil plume could move into these nearshore areas. Since chemical dispersion would not be used in these areas, the level and duration of exposure would be negligible beca use of dilution. Florida Bay is used as a representative of coastal water for analyzing the Florida Straits, as well the Oceania region. The risk scores are based on this modeling location, but are modified to reflect differences in water depth. Deep water occurs mu ch closer to shore in the Oceania region, and there is much more rapid dilution. Florida Bay is a pproximately 16,288 km 2 in area and about 2 m deep on average, with a total vo lume of approximately 32,576 million m3. The estimated total volume and area contaminated by more than 1 ppb of dissolved aromatic concentration for 1 hour or longer and by other chemicals of concern (regardless of location) was compared with the total volume of Florida Bay to determine the potential consequences of small, medium, and large spills (Table H.11.1-1). This approach was used both with and without dispersant use, and yields a very conservative estimate in that it assumes all of the contamination would occur in coastal water. Since dispersants could not be employed in such areas, this would imply that the dispersed oil plume moved directly into coastal waters without dilution, which will not occur.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the te xt) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling, but the calculations are modified to reflect differences in water depth. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biologic al processes, contamination levels would decrease rapidly even in the case of a large spill, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. Oil may be incorporated into shallow water or intertid al sediments where, thro ugh leaching, it could become a continuing source of con tamination over time. However, this would generally only lead to noticeable water-quality degradation in the locality wher e the oil collects. This is unlikely to occur with a spill that originates offshore. Because mechanical removal would begin within the required response time under Tier I standards (beginning about 12 hours after the spill), much of the soluble components of concern to water quality would have evaporated or dissolved. Thus, mechanical recovery and in situ burning would have a small influence on the volume of water adversely affected, and the risk score results would apply whet her either response is implemented. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on coastal water quality in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expect ed to be insignificant for small spills, and minor for medium and large spills, withou t or without dispersant use.

Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Marine The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the marine waters around the islands in the Oceania region. The total surface area of the Florida Straits is approximately 42,689 km2, so the area of interest is much vaster for marine waters than for coastal waters. Water- quality effects were calculated using a spill site in relatively shallow water \u201420 m deep, which is much shallower than most of the Oceania region's mari ne waters. The results for the selected modeled location (Table H.11.1-2) represent conservative estimates of adverse water-quality effects using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with the addition of chemical dispersion.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Because of natural dilution, evaporation, and biolog ical processes, oil contamination levels would decrease rapidly even after a large spill, with or without chemical dispersion, and recovery time would be on the order of days to weeks. The estimates of the volume of water contaminated \u2014and its variability \u2014are generally applicable to spills of th e same size throughout the Oceania region because natural and chemical dispersion of oil in to the water column and dilution processes are similar in all areas. The results in Table H.9-1 are nearly the same (with some uncertainty reflected in the variability of the results) for 45 and 80 percent efficiency because the amount of dispersant at 45 percent efficiency is sufficient to treat all dispersible surf ace oil, for spills up to 40,000 bbl. For a small spill, the volume of water contaminated would be the same as under Alternative 1 because, due to Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-281 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills logistics, dispersants co uld only be applied after a small spill has mostly dispersed naturally. Chemical dispersion for medium or large spills increases the volume of water contaminated \u2014and the percentage of the area of concern\u2014that would be adversely affected by about a factor of three, which is still a small volume relative to that of the entire modeled area. In situ burning (in combination with mechanical recovery and chemical dispersion) would not significantly change the volume contaminated or the effect on water quality since it would substitute for some of the mechanical response. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impact s on marine water quality in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expe cted to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Air Quality Concentrations of hydrocarbons of concern in the air resulting from oil spills and response operations were compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for adverse effects (see Section 4.3.1.2). The effects of an o il spill on air quality may involve al l volatile components of the oil. In addition, if in situ burning was used, particulates and other contaminants emitted from burns could become an air quality concern. However, adverse air quality effects from oil spills are normally very localized and short lived fo r small, medium, and large oil spills. The addition of in situ burning does not significantly increase any potential adverse effect s: the volume of oil that could be burned is not large, and the temporary smoke plume would be localized and rapidly diluted. Chemical dispersion reduces the volatilization of unburned oil to the atmosphere to only a slight extent, so that effects are essentially identical with or without dispersant use. Potential adverse effects on air quality in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanic al recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.1 and are summarized in Table H.7.1-3. Two possible sources of contamination to the atmosphere were evaluated for their potential effects on air quality: volatilizat ion of hydrocarbons from unburned oil and emissions produced by in situ burning. Concentrations in the lowest 2 m of the atmosphere were compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (USEPA's NAAQS) and other thresholds of concern (as discussed in Section 4.3.1.2). As discussed in Section H.3.1, the results of the modeling show that the potential adverse effects on air quality are low for all spill sizes involving mechanical-only recovery; hence, the risk scores are virtually identical for medium and large spills. Vo latilized hydrocarbons would not exceed air quality standards for human health at more than 1 km from the spill site. Evaporation off the water surface and volatilization from the water column create a plume of volatile hydrocar bon gases that disperses quickly after a spill, such that the concentrations in the atmosphere at the water surface would not exceed human health thresholds of concern at any location. The recovery time for the atmosphere would be on the order of hours to days. Thus, a lo w level of concern is expected for small, medium, and large spills involving mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3, the addition of chemical dispersion does not change the results from those under Alternative 1. Chemical disp ersion would disperse some of the volatile hydrocarbons into the water, resulting in the volatile hydrocarbons entering the atmosphere over a larger area than would occur without chemical dispersion. Thus, dispersants further dilute hydrocarbon concentrations in the atmosphere . The modeling shows that results are low for a spill of any size involving some combination of mechanical response and chemical dispersion at any spill site in the Oceania region. Adverse effects of in situ burning on air quality are summarized in Table H.7.1-3; Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-282 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills these results apply whether chemical dispersion is used on unburned oil, and they do not vary by the location of the burn. Thus, the results for Alternative 1 apply to Alternative 3 for all areas in the Oceania region. The modeling was performed for weather conditions where dilution in the air would be relatively slow, so the estimated advers e effects are overestimated for other conditions. Mechanical recovery plus in situ burning, with or without chemical dispersion, would increase atmospheric pollutants by the amount emitted via in situ burning. For small spills, it would be very unlikely that in situ burning would be used, as the oil would disperse too rapidly for it to be feasible (Table H.7.1-3). The maximum area potentially exceeding the NAAQS or thresholds of concern is 1.6 km 2 for a medium spill and 12.7 km2 for a large spill (Table H.7.1-3). If humans or sensitive resources (i.e., wildlife) are within these areas, th ey could be affected by poor air quality for a short time, on the order of hours. Since in situ burning can only be used offshore in marine waters, a region of interest equiva lent to the Florida Bay-Fl orida Keys area (42,689 km2) would have less than 1 percent of its area affected, and the atmosphere would recover in a matter of hours. The addition of chemical dispersion does not change the results under Alternative 1 in Table H.7.1-3. Based on the modeling results (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regi onal adverse impacts on air quality in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without in situ burning. H.11.2 Consequences to the Biological Environment Marine Mammals Potential adverse effects on marine mammals in the Oceania region using the basic response option (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.2 and summarized in Ta ble H.7.2-1 (the results in Table H.7.2-1 are included in Table H.11.2-1 for comparison). Potential effects on marine mammals are less important in the Oceania region than in some other regions because the only species of concern are cetaceans, which are not particularly sensitive to oil. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on marine mammals in that larger spills tend to spread across a larg er surface water area and have hi gher shoreline oil loading. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3 for a small sp ill, the contaminated surface wate r area is small compared with the overall surface water area present in the Oceania region, so the likelihood of cetaceans becoming oiled at the surface is minimal. The equi valent area for 100 perc ent mortality using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) for cetaceans at all five modeled locations (the only marine mammals of concern) ranged from 0.08 to 0.11 km 2 (average area of 0.09 km2) for a medium spill and from 0.46 to 1.33 km2 (average area of 0.85 km2) for a large spill. Relative to the surface area av ailable, this is a very small area, much less than 1 percent. Chemical dispersion reduces the already low exposure even more. Recovery would be relatively rapid, but could exceed 1 year, given that only sublethal effects, if any, would be expected. The results of the modeling for marine mammals are presented in Table H.11.2-1. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-283 2009 H.

Based on the modeling results (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential re gional adverse impacts on marine mammals in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be minor for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On an overall regional level, adverse impacts for medium and large spills are reduced when chemical dispersion is used. Marine and Coastal Birds Potential adverse effects on marine and coastal bi rds in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.2 and summarized in Table H.7.2-2 (the results in Table H.7.2-2 are included in Table H.11.2-2 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on birds; la rger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. The addition of in situ burning does not change the amount of oil removed, so it does not re duce the severity of potential adverse effects or increase the risk to marine and coastal birds. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill, very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. During oil spills in the Ocea nia region, the potential adverse effects on intertidal nesting, roosting, and foraging habitats for birds are of particular concern beca use a significant amount of shoreline habitat on an island or group of small islands can be oiled by a spill. As a consequence, there may not be alternative sites for use until the habitat recovers, particularly mangroves and sand beaches, which would lead to a high degree of adverse effects on birds. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse effects to these habitats primarily by reducing the amount of oil that Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-284 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4). Surface water oiling may also adversely affect feeding and rafting seabirds (Section 3.1.2.2), and chemical dispersion is expected to reduce the extent of surface slicks that birds encounter. The risk scores in Table H.11.2 -2 reflect the predicted r ecovery rates of 1 to 3 years for most bird species, as was the case following the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (Section 4.3.2.2). For a small spill, shoreline oiling was expected to be light and to not persist. For a medium spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 67 percent compared with Alternative 1 and would likely repr esent 1 to 5 percent of an island's habitat. Considering all modeled areas at 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the oiled surface water area was reduced by an average of 50 percent compared with Alternative 1. In addition, for the Florida Straits modeling scenario, chemic al dispersion nearly doubled the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 10 (Alternative 1) to 19 (Alternative 3) out of the 100 model runs (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). The results for 45 percent dispersant efficiency were similar to those for 80 percent efficiency in most modeled areas; in all cases, some important staging, nesting, and foraging sites were still oiled, but the reductio n in shoreline length and surface water area oiled would likely reduce adverse effects on birds.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the five modeled locations (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. For a large spill using 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the extent of shoreline oiling was reduced by 44 percent compared with Alternative 1. Considering all modeled areas at 80 percent dispersant efficiency, the area of surface wa ter oiling was reduced by an aver age of 60 percent compared with Alternative 1. In addition for the Florida Straits modeling scenario, chemical dispersion increased the number of times that no oil stranded onshore, from 12 (Alternative 1) to 18 (Alternative 3) out of 100 model runs (technical re port [French McCay et al., 2004]). The results for 45 percent dispersant efficiency were similar to those for 80 percent efficiency (Table H.11.2-2). Considering that shoreline and surfac e water oiling was reduced in all modele d areas, the risk scores for birds Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-285 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills decreased for both dispersant efficiencies in the Oceania region. In some regions (e.g., Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico), risk scores did not decrease wi th chemical dispersion for large spills because of heavy oil loadings in sensitive staging and nesting areas. Adverse effects on birds may be more or less severe depending on the time of year and locations of their habitats, as well as the extent of shoreline and surface water oiling. The Florida Straits modeling was evaluated as repres entative of the bird fauna of the Oceania region because of similar intertidal habitats and physical settings, and the species present have similar habitat use and behavior. The estimated results for the Oceania region are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of effects on bird populations will typically be reduced with chemical dispersion . The reduction of adverse effects on birds with chemical dispersion is contingent on whether th e reduction of adverse shoreline effects coincides with heavily used habitats. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on marine and coastal birds in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for medium and large spills, with or without dispersant use. For small spills, impacts are expected to be moderate, but are reduced to insignificant with the addition of chemical dispersion. On an overall regional level for medium and large spills, even though chemical dispersion reduces the risk score, the expected impacts remain moderate because of the extent of oiling. Plankton and Fish Plankton and fish, a diverse group of species, are important to the marine food web, ecosystem function, and fisheries. Adverse effects on these groups are of high concern, particularly when chemical dispersion is considered as a potential response option. As described in Section 4.3.2.3 and H.3.2, plankton and fish are adversely affected either directly or via the food web by the toxic effects of oil components that enter the water column \u2014the soluble compounds (MAHs and PAHs) and microscopic oil droplets mixed by wa ves into the water (French McCay, 2002; NRC, 1985). The most important pathway of exposure is direct upta ke of dissolved oil components, originating directly from surface oil or dissolving from the mi croscopic oil droplets in the water. Overall, adverse effects increase the larger the spill size. However, th ere is great variability related to the environmental conditions after the spill; pl ankton and fish suffer much more adverse effects in storm conditions where high waves mix unweathered oil into the water, which happened during the NORTH CAPE oil spill (French McCay, 2003), than in calm weather. In addition, many species utilize shallow waters and even the intertidal zone, where they are more likely to be exposed to oil and dissolved components when oil comes ashore. Species and life stages vary considerably in sensitivity to toxic components, with species from relatively unpolluted and environmentally stable locations more sensitive than those from polluted and environmentally variable areas. In marine and open coastal environments, small, me dium, and large oil spills do not cause large or long-term toxic effects to plankton and fish in the water column. The toxic effects of oil spills result from acute exposures during the time when surface oil is present and for short periods (days to weeks) afterwards. Once the source of hydrocarbons (from floating oil or the shoreline) to the water column is gone, concentrations rapidly dilute to background levels. There may be longer-term effects if an offshore sp ill migrates to nearshore shallow areas such as enclosed embayments, estuaries, or wetlands wher e dilution and flushing are slow. Many fish and other organisms spawn and develop through larval and juvenile stages in these shallow areas. Juvenile fish are more abundant in wetlands, coral reefs, and seagrass be ds than in other shallow subtidal and Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-286 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills intertidal areas, so these areas are of most concern (see discussion of potential effects on these habitats below). Under Alternative 3, chemic al dispersion could not be used within 3 nm37 of shore; therefore, it would not contribute to adverse effects on plankton and fish in these areas. The percentage of plankton and fish adversely affected by spills was estimated using the modeling results (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) of water volumes exposed to toxic oil components. Percentage lo ss multiplied by volume exposed was integrated over time and space to calculate an equivalent volume of 100 percent loss. These volumes were translated to equivalent areas by multiplying them by water depth at the spill site , allowing comparison with other resources such as birds and shorelines, which are distributed on a per-ar ea basis. The use of area is appropriate because plankton and fish abundance is much more uniforml y distributed when expressed on a per-area basis than on a per-volume basis since the ecosystem is driven by sunlight and plant photosynthesis at the water surface (French et al., 1996; Odum, 1971). As indicated by simi lar results for th e four modeled spill sites in 10 to 30 m of water \u2014offshore Delaware Bay, offshor e Galveston Bay, the Florida Straits, and offshore San Francisco Bay (Parts B, C, D, and E, respectively of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) \u2014the equivalent areas of adverse effect on plankton and fish (both the average and variable) are applicable to spills of the same size in any location of similar water depth in any region considered in the PEIS. The modeled spill site was 20 m deep water: adverse effects would be smaller for deeper waters because of gr eater vertical dilution of both oil components and organisms, and proportionately greater in shallower wa ters because of the restricted dilution potential and generally higher organism abundance. The model-estimated areas are those where there is a potential to affect the most sensitive species, which are two standard deviations more sensitive than the average of all species tested (2.5th percentile in rank order of sensitivity). For species of average sensitivity (50th percentile), the areas adversely affected would be much smaller. Thus, th e model-estimated areas should not be interpreted as experiencing 100 percent mortalit y of all plankton and fish; they are conservative estimates used for comparative purposes am ong response scenarios. Potential adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Oceania region using th e basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.2 and summarized in Table H.7.2-3 (the results in Table H.7.2-3 are included in Table H.11.2-3 for compar ison). The Florida Straits was selected for the modeling as representative of the Oceania region, because the ge ography (characterized by isla nds), bottom topography (steeply sloping off away from shore), envi ronmental regime (warm trade winds, occasional severe storms), and ecosystems (subtropical-tropical, areas of coral reefs, seagrasses, etc.) are similar in the two regions. Under Alternative 3 the results for 45 percent disper sant efficiency were not significantly different than those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency beca use more than sufficient dispersant would be available under both conditions to disperse available surface oi l for spills up to 40,000 bbl (with some variability, as reflected in the results in Table H.11.2-3). For a smal l spill, based on the evaluation of the volume where water quality would be affected (Tables H.7.1-1 and H.7.1-2), the volume of adverse effect on plankton and fish wo uld be negligible for a ll response options under Alternative 3. For medium and large spills, the volumes and areas of adverse effect are up to three times larger than those wi thout chemical dispersion. 37 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-287 2009 H.

Note: Green represents a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the te xt) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Since the adverse effects are in a small percentage of the area of concern and less than the range of natural variability, the recovery time would be less than 1 year. Overall, based on th e modeling, adverse effects on plankton and fish in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 would be localized to the immediate area around th e spill site and similar in all ma rine-water areas of the region. Even without chemical dispersion, concentrations of toxic components could become high enough to cause some level of concern for plankton and fi sh for medium or large spills if the slick moved into shallow coastal areas and embayments under conditions where storm-generated waves mix large amounts of fresh oil into the water column. Under Alternative 3, chemical dispersion could not be used within 3 nm 38 of shore or in enclosed coastal lagoons; therefore, it would not contribute to such risk, and might even reduce concerns by dispersing portions of the slick before it can enter shallow waters. Based on the discussion in Part D of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), if the adversely affected area is marine-water habitat or for water column organisms with broad distribution over all subtidal habitats, a risk score of 4E applies. A risk score of 3C applies to coral reefs, 4E applies to seagrass, and 3D applies to hard-bottom habitat organisms. The risk scores do not change with chemical dispersion. Given that many species and life stages of plankton and fish on and over coral reefs are more broadly distributed rather than restricted to the coral reefs (for 38 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-288 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills example, they inhabit hard-bottom habitats as well), and that these organisms reproduce on time scales less than 1 year, the overall risk score of 4D is assigned for plankton and fish for the basic response scenario (mec hanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) with or without dispersant use. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on plankton and fish in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small spills, and minor for medium and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Intertidal Habitats Potential adverse effects on intertidal habitats in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.2 and summarized in Table H.7.2-4 (the results in Table H.7.2-4 are included in Table H.11.2-4 for comparison). Potential adverse effects on intertidal ha bitats during oil spills in the Oceania region are of particular concern because of the relative scarcity of inte rtidal resources, a high degree of historical loss and degradation, and their ecological importance (Section 3.7.2.4). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the sh oreline, which can kill mangroves, and affect larger areas. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects fr om those with mechanical-only recovery. Under Alternative 3 for a small spill, very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases. However, the potential for adverse effects on intertidal habitats increases as spill volume increa ses, with greatest concern wh ere mangroves and sand beaches become heavily oiled. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce adverse effects on these habitats by reducing the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.3.4). The risk scores in Tables H.7.2-4 and H.11.2-4 were based on estimated advers e effects on the intertidal habitats of the Florida Straits. The Florida Straits was selected fo r the modeling as representative of the intertidal habitats in the Oceania region because they have si milar types of intertidal habitats (mangroves, coral/rocky platforms and rubble, sand beaches) and physical settings. Adjustments were made to the risk scores because in the Oceania region the risks to intertidal habitats are greater than in many other regions; a significant amount of shoreline habitat on an island or group of small islands can be affected by a spill. Thus, there may not be al ternative sites for use until the habitat recovers, which would lead to a higher degree of adverse effects. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-289 2009 H.

Note: Red represents a high level of concern; yellow, a medium level of concern; and green, a low level of concern. * Average spills. Current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit. Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the Florida Straits (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling, but the calculations are modified because a significant amount of shoreline habitat on an island or group of small islands can be affected by a spill and there may not be alternative sites for use until the habitat recovers, which would lead to a higher degree of adverse effects. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Adverse effects on intertidal habi tats for a small spill were determin ed to be small by extrapolating from the results of a medium spill and expecting lightly oiled habitats to recover quickly. For a medium spill with the addition of chemical dispersions, the effects on intertidal habitats would vary widely depending on the spill location and the wind and current patterns: spills on the leeward side of an island are not likely to strand onshore, while spills on the windward side could result in oiling of intertidal habitats. At 80 percent dispersant effici ency, the modeling in offshore areas resulted in a reduction in the length of shoreline oiling by 67 percent under Alternative 1, to 4.5 km under Alternative 3. In addition for the Florida Straits modeling scenario, chemical dispersion nearly doubled the number of times that no oil strand ed onshore, from 10 (Alternative 1) to 19 (Alternative 3) out of the 100 mo del runs (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). The extent of oiling of intertidal habitats would likely represent 1 to 5 percent of these habitats for an island. Chemical dispersion also resulted in lighter oil lo ading; thus, recovery was estimated to take 1 to 3 years. The results for 45 percent dispersant efficiency were similar to those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.11.2-4), except that oil loading on mangroves would be higher with a longer recovery time. For a large spill using 80 percent efficiency, the leng th of oiled shoreline was reduced by 44 percent, but the oil loadings on mangrove ha bitat were high enough to expect recovery at greater than 7 years. (The risk score in Table H.11.2-4 was reduced to reflect the reduction in shoreline oiling but not the recovery rate of oiled mangroves.) For the Florida Straits modeling, the number of times that no oil stranded onshore increased from 12 (A lternative 1) to 18 (Alternati ve 3) out of the 100 model runs (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). The results for 45 percent efficiency \u2014with the length Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-290 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills of shoreline reduced by an average of 39 percent \u2014were similar to those for 80 percent dispersant efficiency (Table H.11.2-4). Although no specific sites in the Oceania region were modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; theref ore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on intertidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Oceania region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on intertidal habitats in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be significant for large spills, with or without dispersant use. For large spills, even though chemic al dispersion reduces the risk score, the expected impacts remain significant because of the extent of oiling. For small and medium spills, impacts are expected to be moderate and significant, respectively, but are reduced to insignificant and moderate, respectively, with the addition of chemical dispersion. Subtidal Habitats Potential adverse effects on subtidal habitats in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of m echanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.2 and summarized in Table H.7.2-5 (the results in Table H.7.2-5 are included in Table H.11.2-5for comparison). In the Oceania region, there is particular concern for the possible effects to shallow coral reefs near the shoreline. The addition of in situ burning does not change the potential adverse impacts from those wi th mechanical-only recovery. The risk to subtidal benthic habitat using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) was minimal (Tab le H.11.2-5), based on the diluting effects of the overlying water (Section 2.2.2) \u2014the deeper the water, the lower the risk. Chemical compounds of concern tend to evaporate rather than dissolve, and the rapid dilution of any chemical entering the water column decreases the toxicity of any oil residue potentially reaching the bottom substrate. Relative to the results in the Florida Straits modeli ng location, the effects will be substantially smaller because of the much greater water depth in most of the reference area. This limits the exposure of demersal species to dissolved hydrocarbons, which was a concern in the Florida Straits. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-291 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the five modeled locations (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Chemical dispersion would not appreciably increa se adverse effects on subtidal habitats. There would be an increase in the amount of oil that is dispersed into the water column (Section 4.3.2.5), but the volume available for dilution would prev ent high exposures. The results at all modeled locations for hydrocarbon contamination in the se diments also indicates that this is low. These results are consistent with those for other re gions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of ad verse effects on subtidal habitats will fall within a similar range throughout the Oceania region. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Se ction 4.3), potential regional advers e impacts on subtidal habitats in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spills, and minor for large spills, with or without dispersa nt use. On an overall regional level, for medium and large spills, adverse impacts are not changed with the addition of chemical dispersion. Areas of Special Concern For this analysis, the risks to areas of special conc ern are assumed to be the same as those for either intertidal or subtidal habitats (Section H.11.2), whichever are greater. Since the risk to intertidal habitats is greater, those risk scores were used. Pote ntial adverse effects on areas of special concern in the Oceania region using the basic response scenar io (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.2 and summarized in Table H.7.2-6 (the results in Table H.7.2-6 are included in Table H.11.2-6 for comparison). There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on areas of special concern in that larger spills tend to have higher oil loading on the shoreline and affect larger areas. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-292 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechan ical-only recovery alone. Since areas of special concern are scattered among the islands and along their coasts, they are unlikely to be disproportionately adversely affect ed by the average spill. If an area of special concern was highly adversely affected, it is anticipa ted that the recovery time for the affected area would be the same as for other intertidal habitats. These areas are most at risk from floating oil and benefit from any actions th at reduce potential oiling. As the volume of spilled oil increa ses, the potential risk that an area of special concern may be oiled also increases. For small spills the risk to intertidal habitat was medium using the basic response scenario (mec hanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) (Table H.11.2-6), but effective chemical dispersion reduced this risk to a low level. For medium and large spills, the level of concern increased to high beca use of the possibility of affecting large shoreline areas. Chemical dispersion would reduce potential adverse effects for a medium spill to a medium level, but for large spills the potential impact s would remain high, although lessened (Section 4.3.2.4). This is also potentially beneficial fo r nearshore subtidal habitats like coral reefs and seagrass beds because they are at risk from oil that erodes offshore. Although tropical areas other than the Florida Straits were not modeled, the results are consistent with those for other regions analyzed in this PEIS; therefore, it is expected that the severity of adverse effects on areas of spec ial concern will fall within a similar range throughout the Oceania region.

Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), pote ntial regional adverse impacts on areas of special concern in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be significant for large spills, with Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-293 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills or without dispersant use, based on the risk to intertidal habitats. For small and medium spills, impacts are expected to be moderate and significant, respectively, but are reduced to insignificant and moderate, respectively, with the addition of chemic al dispersion. On an overall regional level for medium and large spills, adverse impacts are reduced when chemical dispersion is used. H.11.3 Consequences to Threatened, Endangered, or Candidate Species Potential adverse effects on threatened, endanger ed, or candidate species in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.3. Potential adverse effects on marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, fish, or sea turtles that are threatened, endangered, or candidate species are identical to those di scussed in Section H.11.2 for these groups. There are a number of very rare species that could be affected if the shoreline oiling occurred in an important habitat area. There is often a direct rela tionship between the volume of oil spilled and the potential for adverse effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species in that larger spills tend to spread across a larger surface water area and have higher shoreline oil loading. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse consequences from those with mechanical-only recovery. When chemical dispersion is used under Alternat ive 3 for a small spill, the contaminated surface water area is small when compared with the overall surface water area in the Oceania region, so the likelihood of threatened, endangered, or candidate species becoming oiled at the surface is low. Very little oil is likely to strand onshore, and the oil loading would be light in most cases, but because of the limited shoreline habitat, potential risk woul d still be medium. Effective dispersant application could eliminate this risk. Potential adverse effects increase as spill volume increases, with greatest concern for shoreline breeding areas for these spec ies. Although populations are sporadic and vary with migration, if a threatened, endangered, or candidate species is present in the area of an oil spill, the resulting adverse effect could be great. The severity of the effects varies depending on the sensitivity of the individuals present. Overall, risk scores were highest for marine and coastal birds. Chemical dispersion is expected to reduce advers e effects on threatened, endangered, or candidate species by reducing both the amount of oil that strands onshore (Section 4.3.2.4) and the amount of floating oil. Chemical dispersion w ill not increase the risk to protected fish or invertebrates because it is restricted to offshore areas where rapi d dilution will occur, even for large spills. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be moderate for medium and large spills, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to marine and coastal birds. For small spills, im pacts are expected to be moderate , but are reduced to insignificant with the addition of chemical dispersion. On an overall regional level for medium and large spills, even though chemical dispersion reduces the risk score, the expected impacts remain moderate because of the extent of oiling. H.11.4 Consequences to Essential Fish Habitat For this analysis, the risks to Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) are assumed to be the same as those for plankton and fish or for subtidal habitats (Section H.11.2), whichever are greater. The results for the two resources were very similar, but the risk to plankton and fish was slightly greater overall, so those risk scores were used. Potential adverse effe cts on EFH in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.4. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-294 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on EFH in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insi gnificant for small spills, and minor for medium and large spills, with or without dispersant used, based on the risk to plankton and fish. H.11.5 Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment As discussed in Sect ion 4.3.5, oil spills can produce a variety of adverse economic and social effects. These adverse effects are generally not high when measured at the regional levels, but instead are typically felt in communities located near resources oiled by the spill. Specifically, large adverse effects are generally limited to those industries and populati ons that are affected by the spill. Some of the most visible and high effects are likely to incl ude effects on water- and shore-based recreation, commercial and recreational fisheries, and tourism. In addition, large-scale spills hold the potential to adversely affect the overall well-being of the residents and economies of coastal communities. This modeling considers the risk of adverse socioec onomic effects posed by oil spills, which can include, but are not limited to, reduced recreation al activity because of beach closures, limited accessibility, or perceived taint; closure of commer cial fishing grounds or hatcheries, or reduced commercial harvests; and altered marine transportation patterns. In addition to these and other direct adverse effects, oil spills can have secondar y adverse effects on social and economic welfare along the coast. For example, an oil spill may caus e changes in employment and firm revenues of resource-based businesses. While these effects ar e not quantified in this modeling, the following discussion provides absolute and relative measur es of the overall risk of adverse social and economic effects of small, medium, and large oil spills using the basic response scenario (mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) in the Oceania region. The methodology is described in more detail in the Atlantic region (Section H.8.5). There is no existing standard for \"significance\" related to the socioeconomic effect of oil spills (e.g., how much shoreline or surface water must be oiled to be considered a \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" effect). The significance of the effect will depend on a numb er of factors, including the scope of the analysis (i.e., national, regional, loca l), opportunities for resource substitution (e.g., an unoiled beach or fishing ground nearby, alternative ports of call), and the duration of the spill event. Generally, a spill event would be of low concern if it is not of long enough duration to affect the financial viability of local businesses, and the affected communities are able to find substitutes to replace the oiled resources. For this PEIS, (1) the greatest effect modeled at the regional level was less than approximately 10 percent of available shoreline or surface wa ter resources (indicating the likely presence of substitute resources), and (2) resource use following these modeled spills (e.g., vessel transportation and fishing) would be expected to resume as soon as oil recovery efforts were completed. As a result, the effects under all modele d scenarios would likely be low at th e regional level. As noted in the text, any adverse effects that did occur woul d be expected to be localized in nature. The risk factor reflects the ratio of the percentage of the surface water oiled using the basic response scenario to the percentage oiled with the addition of chemical dispersion. For example, a risk factor of 0.20 would imply a degree of risk equal to one-fifth that expected given response options limited to mechanical recovery and in situ burning. Under Alternative 1, a risk factor of 1.0 is assigned to medium and large spills (small spills are assumed to have a negligible effect), indicating that no additional response options are taken in this modeled area. In estuaries and coastal waters within 3 statute mi from shore, mechanical-only recovery would be used under Alternative 3. In marine waters 3 or more statute mi from shore, the basic response Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-295 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills scenario with the addition of chem ical dispersion could be used un der Alternative 3 in the Oceania region. Potential adverse effects of spills to the co astal communities in the Oceania region with only mechanical recovery, or in combination with in situ burning, were presented in Section H.7.5 and summarized in Table H.7.3-1 (the results in Table H.7.3-1 are included in Table H.11.5-1 for comparison) for surface water oiled. Table H.9.2-4 highlights the effects of small, medium, and large oil spills on the Oceania region's socioeconomic reso urces by presenting estimates of resources oiled as a result of the average modeled spill in abso lute terms (area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern) and as a percentage of th e total resource base in the modeled area. The threshold of concern because of oiled surface water is 0.01 g/m2 (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). This resource area is based on an estim ate of the extent to which the coastal community in the modeled area potentially relies on each resource . For the Oceania region, length of shoreline oiled above the threshold of concern is not considered rele vant. A single metric was selected for this region since (1) shoreline oiling results from the Florida Straits were highly sensitive in the modeled spill location; (2) the ability to identify shoreline with ch aracteristics amenable to use (i.e., sandy shore) was limited; and (3) area of surface water oiled above the threshold of concern was expected to provide a more accurate measure of expected risk, gi ven the region's geographic characteristics. This modeling assumes that the risk posed to the so cioeconomic environment by oil spills is directly related to the extent to which resources are affected above selected thresholds of concern \u2014for the Oceania region, the square meters of marine water oiled above the threshold of concern. Comparing the absolute risk of adverse socioe conomic effects across spill scenario s, including variations in spill response scenarios, allows for an understanding of the relative risk of adverse socioeconomic effects across spill scenarios. Determining relative risk allows for extrapolation of site-specific results to the entire region. For example, the risk estimates presented in Table H.9.2-4 are based on modeled hypothetical spills affecting the Fl orida Straits, which is an appropriate surrogate for the Oceania region in this modeling. While any given spill may exhibit distinctly different patterns of socioeconomic effect, the relative ri sk measures are expected to be broadly applicable to a range of spill locations, especially in island regions, as long as the spills occur in areas where chemical dispersion is feasible. In additi on, the conclusions reached for the Florida Straits are supported by results for other modeled areas\u2014 the relative degree of risk reduction achieved under various removal assumptions across spill size is similar in magnitude.

For this modeling, the socioeconomic environment is divided into components representative of the major parameters of coastal life pot entially affected by an oil spill. Absolute and re lative risk are discussed for coastal comm unities, demography, and employment; general economic status of a coastal community; vessel transpor and ports; historic resources; recreation and tourism;; and public safety and worker health. Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment Coastal communities benefit from and rely on the marine environment to provide residents with sustenance, livelihoods, le isure opportunities, and shipping avenue s. Individuals who live and work in close proximity to the coast derive both social and economic rewards from the natural beauty, recreational opportunities, quality of life, economic re sources, and cultural attr ibutes associated with these coastal locations. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-297 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills Thus, oil spills can affect multip le aspects of a coastal community's economy, culture, and quality of life. These effects in turn can impose change s on an affected community's demographics and employment patterns. Oil spills can affect any number of a coastal comm unity's assets, leading to adverse effects on the economic benefits of community ac tivities. These effects, in turn, can impose changes on that community's demographic and employment patterns. In addition to direct employment and other adverse economic effects on marine resource-based economic sectors associated with oil spills, oil spills can have secondary adverse effects on coas tal communities. For example, because the Oceania region relies on tourism for employment and earnings , plus the importance of maritime activities to various coastal communities, coastal communities in this region are at risk of experiencing adverse effects from oil spills that affect tourism. Further, the importance of water transportation in delivering goods to the region's islands implies a heightened risk of adverse eff ects from an oil spill. Given their reliance on marine resources, coastal communities on Oceanic islands are likely to be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of a spill than communities located on the mainland, which have a more diverse economic base. As a result of oiling, beaches in the immediate vicini ty of a spill may be closed to visitors, and fishing may not be permitted in waters ex posed to oil, causing losses in revenue to both the tourism and commercial and recreational fishery sectors of the coastal economy. These effe cts would be expected to reverberate through communities in the area of the spill, causing short-term decreases in recreation and tourism; commercial and recreational fishing; and the employment opportunities, income, and businesses these industries support. In addition, an oil spill may temporarily reduce the appeal of coastal living in a given area. To the extent that mechanical recovery, in situ burning and chemical dispersion can reduce shoreline oiling and the geographic scope of surface water oiling, this combination of spill response options will act to reduce adverse effects on coastal communities. The scope of potential losses is described in more detail in subsequent sections. For a small spill in the Oceania region, the risk of great adverse effects on coastal communities is negligible. Because of the small surf ace water area exposed to oil as a result of a small spill, marine- based economic factors such as local commercial or recreational fisheries may experience little or no effect (Table H.11.5-1). While the risk to coastal communities increases with spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion medium and large spills in the Oceania region will have a spill area 39 above the corresponding thresholds of concern that will sweep approximately 99 to 101 million m2 and 282 to 332 million m2, respectively, of marine waters used by commercial fisheries and recreational activities (Table H.9.2-4). Based on the modeling results (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential re gional adverse impacts on coastal communities, demography, and employment in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large oil spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be affected); any adverse 39 The spill area incorporates all water and shoreline areas potentially affected by a spill at a given location under a variety of weather and current conditions. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-298 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Economic Status The overall economic status of communities, indu stries, and individuals that rely on coastal resources for sustenance, revenue, and quality of life can be affect ed by an oil spill. As noted above, coastal communities can suffer direct and indirect adverse economic effects due to an oil spill, as beach and fishery closures decrease reve nue and eliminate jobs. More specifically, losses will be felt in commercial and recreational fisherie s, by both the anglers themselves and by related industries as catch opportunities decrease or are eliminated entirely. Tourism and associated businesses will suffer economic setbacks as visits to affected coastal areas decline and purchase of area goods and services decrease because of perceived taint. A small spill that is 3 or more statute mi offshor e would have essentially no adverse effects on either the local or regional economies (Table H. 11.5-1). There is little to no risk of oiling economically important resources, and it is unlikel y that any commercial or recreational fisheries would be affected. While the risk increases as spill size increases, the effects re main localized. With chemical dispersion, medium and large spills will sweep 99 to 101 million m 2 and 282 to 332 million m2 of marine waters, respectively, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.11.5-1). Despite chemical dispersion, a medium or large sp ill could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oiling recreational beaches, closures of commercial and recreational fishing grounds, and degradation of the appeal of coastal locations. While the adverse effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, an y reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, could cause socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), poten tial regional adverse impacts on economic status in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (r egionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be affected); an y adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Vessel Transportation and Ports Oil spills occurring 3 or more statute mi offshore are not likely to cause large adverse effects on vessel transportation and ports. Local resources would easily handle whatever response operations are implemented. However, an oil spill can disrupt marine commerce if it occurs in and around a shipping channel or port and results in limits on watercraft movement as a means of facilitating spill response. Vessel transportation is of paramount importance to the Oceania region's trade and tourism industries. Any interruption in the standard use of vessels or increase in travel times over water can result in hardship for the Oceania re gion's coastal communities, as fewer goods are exchanged, transportation costs rise, and the revenue streaming through the local economy falls. These adverse effects might be felt at a number of levels. For example, vessel operators may incur additional costs associated with delays and longer shipping distances; businesses that depend on Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-299 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills timely receipt of feedstock or other goods ma y experience adverse effects such as production slowdowns; and individuals who work in adversely affected sectors may be displaced. To the extent that businesses in other locations depend on the affected industries, a longer-term disruption of vessel transportation could yield adverse effects beyond the immediate spill area. However, given alternative ports of call, substitute suppliers an d shipping modes, and the expected short-term nature of any disruption in vessel traffic, such adverse effects are not likely to be high. For a small spill, no great adverse effects on vessel transportation or ports are expected (Table H.11.5\u00ad 1). While the risk to the vessel transportation indu stry increases with spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion medium and large spills will sweep 99 to 101 million m2 and 282 to 332 million m2 of marine waters, respectively, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.11.5-1). However, a spill occurring under specific location, weather, and tidal conditions could adversely affect vessel transportation and ports an d the industries and communities that depend on this traffic. Any adverse effects on vessel tr ansportation and ports would likely be short lived \u2014that is, even if shipping waters or ports are exposed to oil and are therefore closed, as soon as recovery efforts remove surface oil, these facilities would be expected to be reopened. Based on the results from the modeling (see the te chnical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on vessel transportation and ports in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 ar e expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be aff ected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are un likely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Fisheries Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries are vulnerable to oil spills because of closures and perceived taint. A moratorium on fishing operations in the wake of an oil spill can lead to high losses for the commercial fishing industry, as well as related industries, including those that supply equipment to and purchase products from comm ercial fleets. By contaminating key waters, an oil spill may also disrupt employment in the commerc ial fisheries and related sectors of the economy. In addition, oil spills can lead to a decreased demand for fish from affected waters because of actual or perceived taint, and can instigate alterations to fishing practices in a manner that increases operating costs and/or decreases revenues. Large spills can potentially injure fish nursery grounds and impose other risks that could reduce fish harvests in the longer term. For a small spill in the Oceania region, the risk to commercial fisheries is negligible (Table H.11.5\u00ad 1). While the risk to the commercial fishing indust ry increases with spill si ze, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion medium an d large spills will adversely affect 99 to 101 million m 2 and 282 to 332 million m2, respectively, of marine waters used by the commercial fishing industry, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.11.5-1). A risk of economic loss to the marine fishery w ill occur when waters exceed relevant management and/or thresholds of concern. For example, fishing may not be permitted in waters swept by oil above the modeled threshold, thus reducing commercial fish landings for a period of time following a spill. The resulting adverse effect s would be expected to reverberate through Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-300 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills communities in the area of the spill, causing decr eases in employment, inco me, and the viability of businesses associated with the commercial fishing industry. To the extent that substitute fishing grounds are available, spill effects on the comm ercial fishing economy may be less severe. Recreational Fisheries Similar to commercial fishing operations, recreational fisheries are at risk of closure or loss in value as a result of oil spills. These adverse effects will no t generally be regional or national in nature, but could be high at the local level. For this modeling, the risks posed to recreational fishing activities are modeled in the same manner as risks to commercial fishing, in square meters of oiled surface water above the corresponding threshold of concern. The effects of an oil spill on recreational fishery-related activities will be felt more heavily by various populations, including recreational anglers, commercial tour boat operators, and firms that supply goods and services to recreational anglers. For example, recreational anglers fish for pleasure or sport, as opposed to monetary gain. In the wake of an oil spill, such anglers may choose to fish at a substitute location, may experience a reduced quality of experience, or may choose to forgo fishing entirely. The losses suffered will be related to these missed opportunities. In addition, while closing waters to recreational fishing will decrease the social welfare of recreationists, it would also be expected to affect the demand for boat rentals and other services co nsumed by fishing enthusiasts. For a small spill, adverse effects on recreational fishing resources in the Oceania region would likely be negligible (Table H.11.5-1). Medium and large spills may cause decreases in local recreational fishing activities and in the revenues generated from these activities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on fisheries (commercial and recreational) in the Oceania region under Alternati ve 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On averag e, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is aff ected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be a ffected); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Subsistence Potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.5 and summarized in Table H.7.5-2 (the results in Table H.7.5-2 are included in Table H.11.5-2 for comparison). Potent ial adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Oceania region are of particular concern because a significant percentage of an island's intertidal and nearshore habitats and resources may be adversely affected by a large spill, and there may not be suitable alternative areas for subsistence harvesting. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery alone. Under Alternative 1, potential adverse effects on subsistence resources in the Oceania region are low for small and medium spills, and medium for large spills. Chemical dispersion may increase adverse effects on subsistence resources by increasing water column ex posure to dissolved aromatics; however, effects on intertidal subsistence resources may be reduced because chemical dispersion is expected to reduce the amount of oil that strands in intertidal habitats (Section 4.3.2.4). The risk Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-301 2009 H.

Calculations are based on the appropriate portions of the five modeled locations (as discussed in the text) as representative of the Oceania region for modeling. \u00a7 The risk scoring process is explained in Appendix I. Effects on subsistence resources from a small spill were determined to be low by extrapolating from the results for a medium spill. With the a ddition of chemical dispersion at 45 percent efficiency for a medium spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) in more widespread areas and at high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in localized areas. Sediment exposure was typically negligible or only occurred in small areas. The length of oiled shoreline was reduced by over 65 percent at 45 percent dispersant efficiency. Because of the increase in potential exposure to oil for water column resources, and the decrease in potential exposure for intertidal and shoreline resources, the risk scores did not change at 45 percent dispersant efficiency. With the addition of chemical dispersion at 80 percent efficiency for a medium spill, the Pacific region modeling resu lts showed water column exposure at both low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) and high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in more widespread areas in the than at 45 percent dispersant efficiency. Results at both dispersant efficiencies were similar in the Alaska region. Therefore, the levels of conc ern were the same. On average, reduced shoreline oiling at 80 percent dispersant effi ciency were similar to those at 45 percent dispersant efficiency, and sediment oiling was negligible or minimal. The extent of oiling of intertidal habitats for a large spill using chemical dispersion would likely represent 1 to 5 percent of the intertidal habitat on an island. Because water column exposure at both low and high concentrations is more widespread at 80 percent dispersant efficiency than at 45 percent dispersant efficiency, the risk score increased (Table H.11.5-2). A more conservative risk scor e was assigned for the Oceania region because subsistence resources make up a substantial portion of some Native Islanders' diets; relocating to nonoiled areas may be impossible on a small island. The risk scores in Table H.11.5-2 reflect the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-302 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills predicted recovery rates for subsistence resources of less than 1 year for all spill sizes (Section 4.3.5.6). With the addition of chemical dispersion at 45 an d 80 percent efficiency for a large spill, the modeling results showed water column exposure at both low concentrations (1 -100 ppb) and high concentrations (100 -10,000 ppb) in more widespread areas than under Alternative 1. Sediment exposure occurred in several areas in San Francisc o Bay, but was negligible or minimal in other modeled areas so it is unlikely to occur in the Oceania region. On average, the length of oiled shoreline was reduced by 48 and 39 percent when 80 and 45 pe rcent dispersant efficiency, respectively, was used in the modeled areas. While intertidal resources are less likely to be adversely affected by chemical dispersion, water column exposure was more widesp read. On an overall regional level, effects on subsistence resources increase with spill volume. On a local level, a medium or large spill may cause high adverse effects on subsistence communities. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potent ial regional adverse impacts on subsistence in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant, minor, and moderate for small, medium, and large spills, respectively, with or without dispersant use. Historic Resources Potential adverse effects on historic resources in the Oceania region using the basic response scenario (current levels of mechanical recovery and in situ burning when circumstances permit) are presented in Section H.7.5. Under Alternative 3, adverse effects on historic resources in the Oceania region would likely be negligible, regardless of spill size because known cultural resources in this region occur mostly onshore or in shallow coastal waters (Section 3.7.5.7). Chemical dispersion may help reduce the amount of oil that strands on the shoreline, whic h will also reduce the amou nt of shoreline cleanup and potential disturbance to sensit ive cultural resources. There are limited data that identify long- term or chronic degradation to cultural resources due to chemical dispersion. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potenti al regional adverse impacts on historic resources in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Recreation and Tourism Oil spills can adversely affect a coastal community 's recreational and tour ism assets. The tropical islands of the Oceania region provide visitors and residents with the opportunity to enjoy a number of outdoor recreational activities. Beaches, water sports, and the natural beauty of these areas make them popular with vacationers. An oil spill would be expected to affect recreationists' overall social welfare; in addition, the social and economic implications of a spill would reach beyond these direct effects on visitors and into the community. For example, visitors may be less likely to visit and spend money in an area perceived as affected by a spill, potentially leading to loss of business revenue and jobs (see Coastal Communities, Demography, and Employment above and in Section H.7.5 for more details). Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-303 2009 H. Regional Impacts of Oil Spills For a small spill in the Oceania region, the risk to recreation and tourism is negligible (Table H.11.5-1). There is little to no risk of oiling econ omically important resour ces, and it is unlikely that any fisheries or recreational areas would be affected. While the risk to recreation and tourism increases with spill size, the effects remain localized. With chemical dispersion medium and large spills will sweep 99 to 101 million m2 and 282 to 332 million m2, respectively, of marine waters, regardless of dispersant recovery efficiency (Table H.11.5-1). Despite chemical dispersion, a medium or large sp ill could be expected to have short-term adverse economic effects as a result of oiling of recreati onal beaches, closures of fishing grounds, and degradation of the appeal of coastal locations. While the physical effects of even a large spill would be relatively short lived, any reluctance on the part of users to return to the coastal resources, especially in areas dependent on tourism, coul d cause socioeconomic effects to be higher. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts on recreation and tourism in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. On average, only a small percentage of the total available resources in the modeled area is affected for even the largest modeled spills (regionally less than 3.4 percent of surface water would be affe cted); any adverse impacts are expected to be localized \u2014that is, adverse regional or national impacts ar e unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios. Public Safety and Worker Health Potential adverse effects on public safety are defined as the risk to the public from direct exposure to oil or response activities as a result of the spill, or through consumption of contaminated water or organisms. There are many areas in the Oceania regi on with high population concentrations along the coast. However, adverse effects on public safety are unlikely from oil spills that occur 3 or more statute mi offshore for any of the spill sizes considered, regardless of the response options \u2014 mechanical recovery, in situ burning, and/or chemical dispersion \u2014used. The USCG has protocols to protect the public from risk during shoreline response operations, as well as on-water protocols to prevent the public from entering the response area. Potential adverse effects on worker health are re lated to direct exposure to oil during response operations. In addition, operating oil spill response equipment can be dangerous, which is well recognized and is the basis for the current worker certification and training requirements. There is also a health risk from inhalation of hydrocarbon fumes for first responders, which is recognized in current safety protocols. The risk is greater as the spill size and the corresponding intensity and duration of operations increase, but is minimized if safety standards are followed. There are also protocols in place for the proper application and handling of dispersants. Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), po tential regional adverse impacts on public health and worker safety in the Oceania region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small, medium, and large spills, with or without dispersant use. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil H-304 2009 APPENDIX I OIL SPILL MODELING I.1. INTRODUCTION A comprehensive understanding of the structure (s pecies composition and relative abundance) and function (energy flow and nutrient cycling) of aquatic ecosystems is necessary to understand the potential effects of environmenta l fluctuations and stressors such as oil spills. The structure, function, and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems can only be understood by considering biological processes at the level of individual populations acting in concert with processes over the domain of the entire community (Mann, 1988). Local processes at the spec ies level permanently change macroscopic properties of the system, which then impose new constraints on the species themselves (Mann, 1988). Thus, a holistic approach is necessary for the derivation of ecological patterns at the ecosystem level (Gaedke, 1995). However, the complexity of aquatic ecosystems does not allow the consideration of ecosystem dynamics in its entirety, forcing one to abstract fr om the particular situation under study. Therefore, ecosystem dynamics should be studie d from as many angles as possible . This task is facilitated by the use of conceptual and mathematical models. Models, as simplified descriptions of the real world, portray distinct features of the natural systems they are designed to aid the study of. Hence, mathematical models are essential in promoting an increased understanding of the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. Models are designed to either reproduce observed biological, physical, and chemical patterns, or to predict the effects of na tural or anthropogenic environmental fluctuations on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the structur e and function of the ec osystems they describe (Mantilla, 1999). Dynamic simulation models allow the unique possibility of studying the dynamic nature and spatio - temporal organization of aquatic ecosystems. In addition, they represent a coherent way to investigate direct and indirect cause-effect relati onships of a large number of dynamic interacting processes (Gaedke, 1995). I.2. Oil Spill Modeling Rationale The fate and impacts of oil spills will vary based on environmental conditions at the time of the spill and the biological and socioeconomic resources exposed to the oil. Th e available data from real spill Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil I-1 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling case studies are not suffic ient to indicate potential impacts on all resources in every combination of conditions that might occur. However, the information learned from past spills, as well as from laboratory and tank studies, has been analyzed and synthesized into oil fates and effects models, which represent an understanding of the processes and potential for impacts. Modeling provides quantitative estimates of the potential pathways and fa tes of the oil, and thus estimates of exposure to the water surface, shorelines and other habitats, water column, and sediments. These estimates may be used to evaluate potential impacts on wildli fe, aquatic organisms, shorelines, habitats, and socioeconomic uses of those reso urces. The alternative to modeli ng would be to make general statements about impacts, which would make the distinction between dispersant use versus no- dispersant use scenarios, for exam ple, imprecise and based on subj ective judgments using incomplete information. The modeling results provide quantitative best-estimate results that can be compared in an objective manner. The oil spill modeling was performed using the SIMAP model developed by Applied Science Associates (ASA). SIMAP contains both physical fates and biological effects models. In a recent review of oil spill models (NRC, 2003), SIMAP wa s found to be the most comprehensive model available based on the fates processes simulated, the inclusion of a biological exposure and effects model, and the ability to run the model in stochastic (p robabilistic) mode (necessary for ecological risk assessments). SIMAP has been validated for more than twenty case histories, including the EXXON VALDEZ and other large spills (technical repo rt [French McCay et al, 2004]; French and Rines, 1997; French McCay, 2003, 2004). SIMAP also makes use of a recently published oil toxicity algorithm that addresses the different toxicities of the various hydrocarbons in oil and their additive toxic effects (French McCay, 2002). SIMAP was developed from the oil fates and biological effects submodels in the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Coastal and Marine Environments (NRDAM/CME, Version 2.4, April 1996), which ASA developed for the U.S. De partment of the Interior for use in NRDA regulations 1. While the NRDAM/CME is focused on NRDAs for specific hindcasts, SIMAP is designed to evaluate fates and effects of both real and hypothe tical spills, including running in stochastic mode to evaluate a probability distribution of results, rather than just a single result for a specific hindcast. The oil fates model in SIMAP uses wind data, current data, and transport and weathering algorithms to calculate mass balance of oil components in various environmental compartments (water surface, shoreline, water column, atmosphere , sediments, etc.), oil pathway over time (trajectory), surface oil distribution, and concentrations of the oil compon ents in water and sediments. Hourly wind speed and direction data over a long historical period we re obtained from nearby meteorological stations for each representative location. Tidal and other currents were modeled based on known water heights using a hydrodynamic model based on phy sical laws, which conser ves mass and momentum. Geographical data (habitat mapping and shorel ine location) were obtained from existing Geographical Information System (GIS) databases based on ESIs. Water depth was available from NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) soundings d atabases. SIMAP was used to evaluate exposure of aquatic habitats and organisms to whol e oil and the potentially toxic components. SIMAP was run in stochastic mode to determine th e probabilities and degree s of exposure, assuming each of the response options being considered. In stochastic mode, a large number of simulations (i.e., 100) were run for each of the selected sites, oil release and oil response scenarios, varying the spill date and time, and thus the environmental conditions, for each run. The output of the stochastic model includes time histories of a large number of spill trajectories. These distributions are used to 1 The technical documentation for the NRDAM/CME is in French et al. (1996). Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-2 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling estimate the percentage of runs (weather conditions) where water surface, water column, and shoreline areas would be affected by a release from the given site; to determine the highest exposure in time for each possible environmental condition (each run); and to identify the distribution of degrees of exposure for all runs. The mean and standard deviation of degree of exposure for the 100 runs provided the estimates used in the risk assessment. There is essentially an infinite number of possible spill sites and scenarios that could be modeled, as well as a wide range of biological and socioeconom ic resources that could be impacted. The objective of the modeling was not to statistically describe th e universe of possible results for all possible permutations of model inputs and assumptions, as for example in a Monte Carlo design. Rather, the purpose of the modeling was to examine a manageab le but sufficient set of representative spill volumes, locations and scenarios to provide quantita tive estimates of impacts that could be compared among the alternatives and inform the analysis of risks. The ultimate risk analysis is expressed in relative terms, in recognition that the entire universe of impact results has not been quantified. Because oil spill impacts vary mo st by the weather and current transport conditions after the spill \u2014such that examining single arbitrarily chosen or historical scenarios would be biased and not representative \u2014the randomization in the stochastic modeling is to vary the spill d ate, and so the specific weather (wind speed and direction sequence and temperature) and current patter ns. Thus, the variability addressed is that related to weather and currents, but not to other uncertainties in the inputs such as the location of the spill, rate of release, and dispersion coefficients. SIMAP provided estimates of hydrocarbon mass lost to the atmosphere by volatilization. These data were input to an air dispersion model, which is part of the chemical fate and transport model CHEMMAP (Chemical Spill Model Application Package 2). The air dispersion model simulated the wind transport, turbulent dispersion, and degradatio n rate of hydrocarbons ev aporated from the spill, with an output of concentration in the lower atmosphere over time. The air emissions from in situ burning were evaluated with an empirical burning model developed by Fingas et al. (2001) that predicts air concentrations as a function of distance from the fire. The predicted air concentrations were compared with air quality criteria as part of the analysis. I.3. Oil Fates Model The oil fates model estimates the dist ribution of oil (as mass and concentrations) on the water surface, on shorelines, in the water column, and in sediments. The model is three-dimensional, using a latitude-longitude grid for environmental and geographic al data. Algorithms based on state-of-the-art published research include spreadin g, evaporation, transport, disper sion, emulsification, entrainment, dissolution, volatilization, partitioning, sedimentati on, and degradation. Oil mass is tracked separately for lower molecular weight aromatics (MAHs and PAHs ) that are soluble and cause toxicity (in reality and in the model), other volatiles, and non-volatile s. The lower molecular weight aromatics dissolve from floating oil and oil droplets, and are adsorbed to particulate materials in the water column and sediments according to standard equilibrium partitioning theory (French et al., 1996, 1999; French McCay, 2004). The algorithms and assumptions of th e oil fates model are described in French et al. (1999) and French McCay (2004), and summarized in Part A of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). 2 CHEMMAP is a model similar to the oil model SIMAP, but is used for modeling chemicals. ASA also developed CHEMMAP. Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-3 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling All but a very few oils are lighter than water at th e time they are spilled. If released under water, oil droplets are formed, which surface rapidly because of the buoyancy of the oil relative to water. Wind and currents transport the surface oil unt il it strands on shorelines . Oil may be entrained (mixed) into the water by high winds. Entraine d droplets may adsorb to suspended sediments and settle to the bottom because of the higher densit y of the combined material, which occurs most commonly in shallow waters with high wave activity. In addition to these processes, the model simulates dissolution of the toxic aromatic components from the entrained droplets and the fate (and effects) of these aromatics in the water column and sediments. The SIMAP oil fates model quantifies the following outputs, in space and over time, for each individual model run: Spatial distribution of oil mass and volume on water surface over time Oil mass, volume, and thickne ss on shorelines over time Subsurface oil droplet concentration, as total hy drocarbons, in three dimensions over time Dissolved aromatic concentration in three dimensions over time Total hydrocarbons and aromatics in sediments over time I.4. Biological Effects Model The algorithms and assumptions of the biological effects model are described in detail in Part A, Section A.2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and are summarized in this section. The biological effects model estimates the area, volume, or portion of a population affected by surface oil, concentrations of oil components in the water, or sediment contamination. The model calculates the extent and duration of exposure based on the outputs of the oil fates model. A rectangular grid of habit ats represents the area potentially affe cted by the spill, with each grid cell coded according to its habitat type. Habitats cons idered include various offshore, nearshore, reef, wetland, and shoreline environments that have unique assemblages of species. A contiguous grouping of habitat grid cells with the same habita t code represents an ecosystem in the biological effects model. Fish, invertebrates, birds, mammal s, and production rates of organisms lower in the food chain are assumed constant and evenly distributed across an ecosystem within the time period of the simulation. Fish, birds, and mammals are assumed to move at random within each ecosystem. Planktonic stages (eggs and larvae in the water column) move with the currents. In the biological effects model, su rface slicks affect wildlife such as birds, mammals, and reptiles. A portion of wildlife in the area affected by a slick over a threshold thickness \u2014area swept \u2014is assumed to die based on probability of encounter with the slick and mortality once oiled. Area swept is calculated for the habitats occupied by the behavior group. Species are assigned to behavior groups to evaluate their loss. The threshold is 10 micron (~10 g/m 2) thick oil, based on data and calculations in French et al. (1996). Estimates for the mortality probabilities are derived from information on behavior and field observations of mortality un der similar circumstances (French et al., 1996). Wildlife mortality is directly pro portional to area swept, probability of mortality for the behavior group, and species abundance per unit area. Percent mortality for a population of interest is calculated as the area swept times probability of oiling, divided by the area occupied by the population. Fish and their eggs and larvae are affected by dissolved aromatic concentration (in the water or sediment). Because exposures in the water column are short (hours to days), mortality is calculated Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-4 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling using laboratory acute toxicity test data (LC50) corrected for temperature and time of exposure, and assuming a log-normal relationship between percent mortality and dissolved concentration \u2014 the relationship of percent mortality to log(concentration) is the bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. LC50s for the mixture of the most toxic components of oil, disso lved MAHs and PAHs, are used to define the center of that log-normal function. The effects of the MAHs and PAHs are additive, and LC50s for the oil mixture are estimated using an additive (toxic unit) formula. LC50s for the most sensitive species tested are used in this study to provide a conservative analysis (French McCay, 2002). For plankton, fish, and invertebrates, movements of biota, either active or by current transport, are accounted for in determining time and concentration of exposure. Tracers representing schools or groups of animals move or remain stationary with respect to currents in the model according to the behavior of the animal type, and concentration and duration of exposure are recorded. Exposures are integrated over space and time by habitat type to calculate a total percentage killed. Behavior groups are used to represent species or stages within species. The following behavior groups cover the possible movement patterns (or lack thereof) for aquatic organisms (plankton, fish, and invertebrates): Planktonic (move with currents) Demersal and stationary (within 1 m of the ocean bottom exposed to water near the ocean bottom) Benthic (in the sediments and stationary) Demersal fish and invertebrates (on the ocean bottom exposed to water near the ocean bottom and moving slowly) Small pelagic fish and invertebrates (moving randomly and slowly throughout the water column) Large pelagic fish and invertebrates (moving rand omly and rapidly throughout the water column) The biological effects model tracks organisms in six habitat types, which are assumed indistinguishable to organisms occupying the same given habitat type. These six habitat categories account for the fact that fish and other aquatic biota tend to prefer one or more of these types: offshore (marine) open water, estuarine open water, marine wetland and seagrass, estuarine wetland and seagrass, marine reef, and estuarine reef. Mortality is calculated as percent loss in specified areas, which is translated into the equivalent area of 100 percent loss. That area is divided by the total area of habitat available in the region of interest to estimate a percentage of a population affected. The biological effects model has been validated using simulations of about thirty spill events where data are available for comparison (French and Rines, 1997; French McCay, 2003, 2004). In most cases, only the wildlife impacts could be verified because of limitations of the available observational data (French and Rines, 1997). However, in NORTH CAPE spill simulations, both wildlife and water column impacts on lobsters coul d be verified (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]; French McCay, 2003). I.5. Modeled Scenarios There are many possible spill scenarios that could be modeled, as well as an essentially infinite number of potential spill sites. However, the modeling was perf ormed for a finite number of Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-5 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling scenarios that is sufficient to provide understanding of the expected effects resulting from spills under the various response options. A stochastic (probabilistic) approach was used to allow the range and frequency of possible environmental cond itions to be examined for each possible spill site, spill volume, and response option. Long-term (decade or more) wind an d current records were sampled at random. Model runs were performed fo r each spill date-time selected, which provides a statistical description of the environmental fate an d effects that would result if a spill occurred. The alternative of examining selected individual model runs would not be representative of all possible events and would provide biased results. Moreover, it is impossible to determine a priori (before running many model runs) what particular environmental scenarios would be representative or worst case. In addition, what is representative or worst case varies by the resource examined. Stochastic modeling was performed in five modeling locations of the United States that are all high-risk areas and are broadly representative of the six geographic regions in this PEIS. The following five modeling locations were chosen to represent the major environmental and ecological regions in U.S. waters: Offshore of Delaware Bay representing the Atlantic region Offshore of Galveston Bay representing the Gulf of Mexico region Offshore of San Francisco Bay representing the Pacific region Prince William Sound representing the Alaska region The Florida Straits representing the subtropical and tropical Caribbean and Oceania regions 3 In evaluating potential impacts of spills in the six geographic regions considered in this PEIS, inferences were drawn from the modeling result s from all regions. For example, for the five modeling locations, the amount of water surface oiling and the water volume contaminated is similar for a given spill volume and the same en vironmental conditions. Thus, the results of a specific spill site can be extrap olated to other locations. With respect to the biological effects, the major ha bitats are unique to each of these five modeling locations. For example, south Florida contains mangrove forests, tropical seagrass beds, and coral reefs typical of the Caribbean and Oceania regions. The Atlantic coast contains salt marshes dominated by Spartina spp. and eelgrass beds, while the Pacific coast contains kelp beds and wetlands dominated by species other than Spartina . Alaskan waters, while also unique, have ecological similarities to the areas off Maine an d Washington-Oregon. The fish and invertebrates of these habitats also vary by these broad regions. In addition, the temperature and weather regimes that are input into the mo del will cover the characteristic ra nges of each modeling location. While these five modeling locations are broadly representative of major ecological systems, no one site can provide specific information for an entire geographic region. The purpose of the modeling effort is to examine generalities about the spills, based on the stochastic tr eatment, which can then be applied more broadly. For example, if modeling results for the Florida Straits indicate that water concentrations of concern for corals are never exce eded more than 1 mi away from the spill site, regardless of environmental conditions, then it is reasonable to assume that in any similar geographic region there may be a similar limited risk to corals. On the other hand, if the model results indicate that surface oil co uld significantly contaminate shore lines at significant distances, then a similar threat may exist in other areas of near equal distance from shore. These 3 In some cases for the Oceania region, the risks can be infe rred from the range of effects observed in all five modeled locations. Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-6 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling considerations were made on a resource-by-resource basis, as discussed in Sections 4.5 through 4.9 and Parts B through F of the technica l report (French McCay et al., 2004). Oil fates and biological effects modeling were used to provide data to be used in the evaluation of potential impacts of alternative response scenarios in this PEIS. In addition, air dispersion modeling was performed to evaluate potential impacts of spills and response actions on air quality. The objectives were to provide an assessment of the potential pathways and fate of the oil, thus estimating exposure to the water surface, shoreline and other habitats, water column, and sediments. These were used to evaluate potential impacts on wildlife, aquatic organisms, and habitats on a region-by-region basis. The spill site was assumed to be 7.5 statute mi from shore, which is the midpoint of the nearshore area as defined in 33 CFR 155.1020 (approximately 3 to 12 nm offshore). The nearshore area is the worst case location for currently pre-authorized di spersant use, as disper sants cannot be used closer than approximately 3 nm from shore 4, and dilution would be less than the dilution that would occur in waters further than 12 nm from shore. Results from the midpoint of the nearshore area may be used to infer potential impacts in the entire area, and the water column impacts will be worse than those that would occur if the spill were further offshore than 12 nm. Two spill volumes were assumed, for medium (2,500-bbl) and large (40,000-bbl) spills. USCG regulations (33 CFR 155.1020) define various spill si zes, and these volumes were developed from those definitions, as discussed in Section 4.1. The regulations define the WCD as the loss of all cargo from a tank vessel; however, the use of this volume would overwhelm any of the available response options and prevent any discrimination between the alternatives. On that basis, the \"large\" volume was selected to be the loss of cargo from two storage tanks, which is approximately 40,000 bbl. The MMPD is defined as 2,500 bbl, so this volume was used to represent a \"medium\" spill. The oil types modeled were South Louisiana crude oil for the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Florida modeling locations and Alaskan North Slope crud e oil for the Pacific and Prince William Sound modeling locations. These oils were chosen to be representative of shipping in each geographic region, and to be consistent from region to region to allow comparisons. Three response scenarios were mode led for each of the two spill volu mes and for each of the five modeling locations: Mechanical removal at present leve ls of capability, or with some of that removal accomplished by in situ burning Same mechanical removal response as above, or with some of that removal accomplished by in situ burning, plus dispersant application at 45 percent efficiency (based on minimum dispersant effectiveness criteria established in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan [NCP, 40 CFR part 300] 4 With the exception of several areas that have pre-authorizatio n agreements at different distances from shore, including Maine (>0.5 nm), Massachusetts (>2 nm), Puerto Rico (>0.5 nm ft depth), the U.S. Virgin Islands (>1 nm from shore or reef, if reef < 20ft from surface and >60 ft depth), and Hawaii (>60 ft depth), as well as areas such as Washington, Oregon, Connecticut , and large portions of Alaska, which have case-by-case pre-authorization agreements ( http://www.uscg.mil/vrp/maps/dispmap.shtml , last updated August 19, Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-7 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling Same mechanical removal response as above, or with some of that removal accomplished by in situ burning, plus dispersant application at 80 percen t efficiency (based on theoretically successful dispersant operation) The modeled response scenarios apply to one or more of the alternatives being considered in the PEIS, depending on the combination of response capabilities required. For example, for Alternative 1 in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific, and Oceania regions, only mechanical recovery or in situ burning would be used because appropriate response times cannot currently be met for chemical dispersion. Thus, the first of the three modeled response scenarios applies to Alternative 1 in these four geographic region s. For Alternative 1 in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, where dispersant capability currently exists, the modeled response scenario s involving dispersants also apply. For Alternative 3, where dispersant capability would be requi red, the modeled response scenarios involving dispersants wo uld apply. The applications of the modeled scenarios to the alternatives are described in Sections 4.5 to 4.9. The specific details of the re sponse scenarios mode led were developed by the USCG based on existing and proposed planning factors, as described in Appendix D. Mechanical removal (skimming) occurs in all water locations where surface oil is present and from hour 12 until hour 96 during daylight only. The light period is assumed 6 A.M.-6 P.M., a 12-hr day, which is a simplification for modeling purposes. Hourly mechanical recovery rate is 50 percent of the total oil available on the water at the beginning of that hour divided by 48 (the total number of cleanup hours in the 4-d response). The total amount of oil removed is calculated as the summation of the individual hourly rates of removal.. Thus, th e total amount removed e quals 0.50 (50 percent) divided by 48 hours, which equals 0.0104167, multipli ed by the amount of o il floating that hour, summed over 12 -96 hours after the spill (during daylight only). Percent mortality for a population of interest is calculated as the area swept times probability of oiling, divided by the area occupied by the population. Dispersant application also occurs only in the light period (6 A.M.-6 P.M.) and within location- specific pre-authorized agreement areas. For all locations, dispersants may be applied in waters greater than 10 m deep that are 3 or more nm from shore. No dispersant is assumed applied within Galveston Bay, San Francisco Bay (inside the Golden Gate), Delaware Bay, or within coastal inlets and estuaries near the modeled spill sites. Because it is proposed to allow in situ burning to offset the existing mechanical removal requirements by 25 percent, in situ burning is assumed to remove 25 percent of the available oil each hour while the amount removed using mechanical recovery is reduced by 25 percent. Thus, in situ burning replaces 25 percent of the mechanical removal when it appl ies, and both response options remove oil from the water surface with equal effectiveness. The amount burned is 25 percent of the model estimate of the amount cleaned up in a given scenario. It is assumed that burning occurs at a location 3 or more nm from shore, and that the burn volume is available in that area. Thus, for those runs where greater than 75 percent of the cleanup would occur closer to shore (in the absence of burning), the burned volume would be overestimated and provide a conservative (high) estimate of impact on air quality. The water surface, shoreline, and water column impacts are assumed the same, whether the oil is mechanically removed or burned. Burn residues are assumed to remain floating in the model and to behave as other floating oil. Based on existing or proposed planning factors (Appendix D), dispersants are applied in three tiers involving several aircraft sorties (flights without relo ading). For all tiers, application will be assumed to be made using one or more C-130 aircraft. According to the Response Plan Equipment Caps Review Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-8 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling (USCG, 1999) the C-130 is capable of delivering 5, 495 gal of dispersant per sortie. In the Gulf of Mexico region, Tier 1 would require delivery of 8,250 gal of dispersant in two sorties over the course of 5 hours starting at hour 7 or at the first hour of daylight. The first sortie is 5,495 gal, followed by a second sortie beginning 5 hours la ter of 2,756 gal. Outside the Gulf of Mexico region , Tier 1 would require delivery of 4,125 gal in one sortie at hour 7 or at the first hour of daylight. Tiers 2 and 3 each require delivery of 23,375 gal of dispersant in four sorties of 5,495 gal each and one sortie of 1,395 gal. Sorties occur at tier start time plus 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 hours. When sorties from two tiers overlap because of darkness, both sorties were assumed to oc cur simultaneously. Dispersant is assumed applied at efficiencies of 45 percent or 80 percent, referring to the percentage of oil treated by dispersant that is dispersed in to the water column. Thus, the model runs examined the worst case for oil contamination into the water. If dispersant efficiency is in practice lower than the assumed efficiency that was modeled, as might occur in limited daylight and very cold conditions, less oil would be disperse d into the water column per volume of dispersant applied. In the reduced efficiency case, the expected impacts would be between the results for the 45 percent dispersant scenario and the mechanical-only scenario. I.6. Unburned Oil The atmospheric concentr ations of volatilized hydrocarbons released by unburned oil as it weathers were modeled using the atmospheric dispersion model in CHEMMAP (described in Part A, Section A.5 of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]), since SIMAP only tracks hydrocarbons in water, in sediments, and on shorelines. The estimated concentrations at the water surface were then compared with air quality standards to evaluate the potential for human health effects and wildlife impacts. For unburned oil, MAHs, PAHs, and other volatile hydrocarbons will be volatilized over the first few hours to days after the spill. The amount of volatilized mass entering the atmosphere of each chemical (or chemical class) of concern was es timated from the oil spill modeling with SIMAP. SIMAP also provides the time frame over which the emissions occur. SIMAP runs with light winds that were used to estimate how long volatili zation occurs under a worst case situation for atmospheric exposure. The duration was the time for 95 percent of the volatiles to enter the atmosphere. The mass in the atmosphere was then tracked with CHEMMAP using an approach analogous to the in-water transport model for oil. In the model, the chemical is transported by the wind. Degradation is included for volatilized hydrocarbons at an empirical rate estimated for in air. The atmospheric dispersion model in CHEMMAP provided estimates of hydrocarbon concentrations in the air layer within 2 m of the water and land surface (or, within the approximate height of a person who might be exposed). Atmospheric dispersion was modeled for the major volatile compounds released from unburned oil that would be of concern to human health based on the available thresholds that are presumably protective of wildlife as well. The total ma ss and composition of volatilized hydrocarbons released to the atm osphere was estimated from the o il evaporation and volatilization totals estimated by SIMAP over the time of the majority of the release. For alternatives involving in situ burning, assumed to burn 25 percent of the mechanically removed oil, the volatile content of that oil was assumed to be burned and did not enter the atmosphere. I.7. Burned Oil Emissions Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-9 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling The atmospheric concentrations of compounds and particulates released by in situ burning were estimated using the models developed by Fingas et al. (2001). Atmospheric emission concentrations depend on both the distance from and the area of the fire. Fingas et al. (2001) generated such predictions and equations for more than 150 individual compounds. For each model scenario \u2014no dispersant, dispersants at 45 percent efficiency, and dispersants at 80 percent efficiency \u2014for a given spill volume and location, th e distance where concentrations would fall below a threshold of concern was estimated for each constituent in the in situ burn emissions. The thresholds of concern were the minimum concentration for which there is a human health criterion in U.S. regulations and guidance (described in Section 4.3.1.2). I.8. Evaluation of Relative Risk Given the inherent uncertainty associ ated with oil spills, it is very difficult to assess and compare the relative potential impacts and benefits of the alternatives presented in this PEIS. There are two areas of concern. The first is the absolute potential impa ct [of the oil spill?], and the second is the relative risks and benefits of using various response options. In addition, the anticipated impacts need to be placed in an ecological or socioe conomic context so that their significance can be estimated. The approaches used to interpret the modeling results to address these goals are described below. The discussion of the affected environment (Chapter 3) identified twenty-f our resource categories. These same categories are used for the evaluation of potential impacts, but not all could be quantified using the modeling results. The objective of the analysis is to compare the overall impacts and benefits of each alternative (regionally and nationally) for each of these resources. To make these comparisons, it is important to es tablish a frame of reference that pr ovides some standard basis. The analysis used a risk matrix approach to define leve ls of concern (as an indicator of significance) for the ecological effects (Appendix I) and an increm ental change analysis fo r socioeconomic effects (Appendix I). The matrix developed for this analysis allows the evaluation of two parameters, the extent of exposure versus the length of recovery time for th e resource. This follows the approach described by Norton (1991) and Harwell et al. (1994). The proportion of the re source (spatial scale) and time of recovery (temporal scale) provide sufficient resolution to effectively rate ecological effects. These parameters describe the level of effect for each possible interaction between a risk factor (such as dispersed oil) and a resource under evaluation. The entire set of risk scores for each option can then be evaluated and compared. For the purpose of this analysis, the estimates of ecological risk are based on the series of oil spill scenarios described in Section 4.4.2. These scenarios were designed to be representative of conditions where spills are likely to occur 3 or more nm from shore; they include estimates of effects for the various response options. The numerical results from SIMAP or CHEMMAP and the risk scores rela te to those particular scenario s and must be interpreted with care. Patterns across regions or with in scenarios, however, do offer insight into the absolute effects and the relative risks and benefits of the alternatives. The simplest risk matrix is a two-by-two square (Figure I.8-1). For example, consider a matrix in which the x-axis rates \"recovery\" and ranges from \"reversible\" to \"irreversible,\" and the y-axis evaluates \"magnitude\" and ranges from \"severe\" to \"trivial.\" In its simplest (two-by-two) form, the risk matrix is divided into four cells. Each cell is assigned an alphanumeric value to represent relative effect. Thus, \"1A\" represents an irreversible and severe effect, whereas \"2B\" represents a reversible and trivial effect (Figure I.8-1). Obviou sly, a two-by-two matrix does not allow much in Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-10 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling the way of resolution and is ineffective in rating effects. On the other hand, in large matrices, the scaling becomes challenging, and the resulting ranks are difficult to interpret. Figure I.8-1 Basic Ecological Risk Matrix RECOVERY 1. Irreversible 2. Reversible MAGNITUDE A. Severe 1A 2A B. Trivial 1B 2B The use of this approach in the context of oil spill response planning is described in Aurand et al. (2001) and Kraly et al. (2001). The process has been used by the USCG and various state and federal agencies for risk evaluations in San Fran cisco Bay, Galveston Bay, Santa Barbara Channel area of California, middle Chesapeake Bay, and Up per Florida Keys. Normally, four or five risk categories on each axis are expected to allow a re asonable degree of resolution (Aurand et al., 2001; Kraly et al, 2001). Once the detailed matrix has been completed, it is genera lly useful to establish simplified categories for comparison purposes, based on summary levels of risk (or significance). Figure I.8-2 provides the risk matrix used in this PEIS. It is based on an evaluation of two factors \u2014 the proportion of the resource affected by the action and the time for the resource to recover \u2014for each ecological resource included in this analysis . The proportion of the resource is obtained directly from the SIMAP results, while recovery time is based on the information gained from past research and actual spills (see Section 4.3). The scaling is based on establishing intervals that allow for discrimination of the significance of potential le vels of concern, as well as differences between response options. Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-11 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling Figure I.8-2 Risk Matrix and Definition of Levels of Concern Time to Recovery > 7 years (SLOW) (1) 3-7 (2) years 1-3 (3) years < 1 year (RAPID) (4) % of Resource Potentially Affected> 20 % (large) Adapted Part A of the t echnical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Note: Red represents a high level of concern; yellow, a medium level of concern; and green, a low level of concern . For this risk matrix, the summary scale was esta blished by expanding from the maximum level of concern (1A) and the minimum level of concern (4E) to establish high and low levels of potential risk. A medium level of concern was assumed for intermediate squares. The high level area was determined based on a consensus that any effect that took more than 7 years to recover potentially affecting more than 1 percent of the resource or any effect affecting 10 percent of the resource for more than 3 years was a high concern. Conversely, any effect that affected 10 percent or less of the resource and recovered in 1 year or affected 1 percent or less of the resource and recovered in 1 to 3 years was considered a low risk. The levels of concern are based on the consensus of the project senior professional staff using their experience at actual oils spills, damages assessment studies, and local ecological risk assessments for the Coast Guard. Developing a scale to differentiate high, moderate, and low environmental impacts is a requirement of both ecological risk assessment and NEPA analysis. This pattern is cons istent with those accepted by th e participants in the oil spill ecological risk assessments done in the risk assessments mentioned earlier. Frequently, these rankings are based on analysts' subjective judgments, which are difficult to evaluate. By using this system, the basis for the assignment is specific, and the additional information provided by the actual numerical risk scores allows a more detailed evaluation, if the reader feels that is appropriate. The alphanumeric ranking is also presented for clarity. All risk ranking systems, or sc ales for the determination of significance, are arbitrary to some degree. Harwell et al. (1994, p. 2-11) defines ecologic al significance as \"(1) wh ether a change that is detected or projected in the ecological system or its individual components of concern is a change of importance to the structure, function, or heal th of the system and whether the change exceeds a variance estimate (i.e., the context of natural variability) and (2) whether such a change in the ecological system is of sufficient type, intensity, extent, or duration to be important to society.\" The use of the risk matrix allows for the direct comparison of effects to diverse resources, and the summary scores are used to scale the significance of the potential effects, which can be interpreted against the above definition. As a simplified example of this approach, assume that a hypothetical oil sp ill could affect only two resources, seabirds congregating on the sea surface or a coral reef, and that there were only two Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-12 2009 I. Oil Spill Modeling response options, mechanical recovery and chemical dispersion. Further, a ssume that mechanical recovery is effective in removing 25 percent of the surface oil before the slick reaches the area where the seabirds are congregated, but that the remaining oil is still sufficient to coat a large number of birds with oil and most subsequently die. Based on biological data, the loss to the population represented about 50 percent of the regional population, and this particular species is long lived and has a relatively low rate of reproduction, so recovery will take 7 to 10 years. There is little to no oil found in the water column, so th ere is minimal risk to coral from exposure to hydrocarbons. In the other option, assume that chemical dispersion is highly effective, removing enough of the surface oil so that the slick largely dissipates before reaching the seabirds and many fewer die. Recovery is still slow based on their life history. There is also an elevated exposure to dispersed oil in the water over the coral reefs. Concentrations of hydrocarbons down to 10 m deep exceed levels that are reported to kill coral larv ae (but only based on continuous exposures for 96 hours in the laboratory); however, those concentrations are only present for 3 hours. All coral reefs are at depths below the 10-m level and are not exposed to high levels of hydrocarbons. Since adult coral polyps are less sensitive to oil than coral larvae, there is little risk to the reef itself. Table 4.4-1 shows a comparison of the two alternatives (mechanical recovery and dispersants) relative to their levels of concern for the two resource groups for this hypothetical example. Mechanical recovery leads to a high potential level of concern to birds, based on the removal of a large portion of a population that is slow to recover. It does not, however, pose more than a low level of concern for the coral reef, since the small amount of dissolution and dispersion that occurs as a result of natural processes does not threaten eith er the reef itself or larvae in the water column. When dispersants are used, the seabirds are expose d to much less floating oil and many fewer die. The number now lost from the population is similar to natural mortality in many years, and the population can be expected to recover in 3 to 7 year s. The coral reef area is exposed to enough oil that there is a risk to larval organisms in the water column, but the area affected, relative to the area where coral larvae occur, is not large. The adult co rals are not affected. Dilution rapidly reduces the risk. Based on the potential loss of some larvae, the level of risk in creases slightly but remains an overall low level of concern due to the rapid recovery rate of the larvae. Therefore, in this example, chemical dispersion reduced the potential level of concern for seabirds from high to medium, while the risk to coral reef s remain unchanged as low. Table I.8-1 A Hypothetical Example of the Use of Relative Risk Scores to Compare Response Options Resource at Risk Response Option Mechanical Recovery Chemical Dispersion Seabirds 1B 2D Coral Reef 4E 4D The evaluation required for the analysis of al ternatives is much more complicated than the example; however, the principle is the same. Fo r each scenario the appropriate thresholds described in Appendix I an d Part A of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) are used to estimate the potential effect to the resource grou p under consideration. The anticipated effect is then compared with the total resource present in the appropriate biogeographical provinces, as delineated by French et al. (1996) and presented in Part A, Tabl e A.4-2 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). Basic biological and life history data for representative species or habitats, as well as spill studies, were used to es timate recovery time (see Appendix I). Using these data, a risk score is developed for each option for each ecological resource, and the effectiveness of alternatives can thus be compared. Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil I-13 2009 I.

Comparison of Adverse Impacts of Oil Spills Under the Alternatives APPENDIX J OIL SPILL IMPACTS UNDER THE ALTERNATIVES J.1. I NTRODUCTION This appendix primarily addresses the impacts of oil spills, with less emphasis on the response options. Thus, it provides the background for the analysis of the impacts of alternatives based on response options in Chapter 4. This appendix compares the potent ial adverse environmental conseque nces of an oil spill under the alternatives analyzed in this PEIS for the physi cal, biological, and socioeconomic resources. Table 4.10-1 (in Chapter 4 at the end of Section 4. 10) displays the range of potential adverse environmental impacts of an oil spill under the al ternatives. As shown in the table and discussed below, the potential adverse and beneficial impacts of an oil spill under Alternative 2 are expected to be equivalent to those under Alternative 1, while the potential adverse and beneficial impacts of an oil spill under Alternatives 4 and 6 are expected to be equivalent to th ose under Alternative 3. J.2. A LTERNATIVE 1 - N O ACTION , WHEREBY NO CHANGE IN RESPONSE PLAN REGULATIONS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED Under Alternative 1, there would be no change to exis ting regulations. Aerial tracking capability would not be required, but it is usually provided by the oil spill response community. The cost-benefit analysis performed for the regulatory analysis determined that there is no net present value (NPV) cost or benefit of Alternative 1 (USCG, 2009). Current availability of oil spill response option s would remain unchange d. On-water mechanical recovery and in situ burn capabilities would be available in all regions. On-water dispersant capability would not meet required response ti mes except in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil J-1 2009 J. Comparison of Adverse Impacts of Oil Spills Under the Alternatives Consequences to the Physical Environment Insignificant to moderate adverse impacts on coastal water quality could occur if large amounts of oil become stranded in confined, shallow ar eas. Adverse impacts could be mitigated through offshore chemical dispersion; howe ver, dispersant capability would only be available in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions under Alternative 1 because appropriate response times cannot currently be met in other regions. Insignificant impacts on marine water quality are expected. Local adverse impacts of short duration could occur under extreme events where storms may drive oil into the water column, but no significant impacts are expected on the regional or national levels. Chemical dispersion would increase the levels of hydrocarbons in the water column offshore but not to levels of concern and only in local areas and for short periods of time. Insignificant adverse impacts are expected for air quality for all spill sizes, regardless of the response option used. Local adverse impacts of short duration on air quality (with or without the in situ burning) could occur, but no significant impacts are expected on the regional or national levels. Spill response already includes aircraft for tracking and vessels for response operations, so there is no anticipated change in emissions from these sources. Even so, relative to the evaporation from the oil slick, emissions from vessels or aircraft that are applying dispersant are a minor concern. Relative to the evaporation from the oil slick, emissions from response vessels are a minor concern. In the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, chem ical dispersion could reduce the potential adverse impacts on resources of concern without significantl y increasing potential risks because of the rapid dilution that occurs offshore. Consequences to the Biological Environment Insignificant to significant adverse impacts could occur for marine and coastal birds , intertidal habitats , and areas of special concern . The level of concern largely depends on the presence and distribution of the particular resource/species. Insignificant to moderate adverse impacts are expected for marine mammals , plankton and fish , subtidal habitats , sea turtles , and Essential Fish Habitat for all spill sizes, regardless of response option used. On-water mechanical recovery or in situ burning reduces, but does not eliminate, potential adverse impacts on sensitive resources from floating oil and oil stranded on the shoreline. In the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, chemic al dispersion could reduce the potential adverse impacts on resources of concern without significantly increasing the potential risk to plankton and fish because of the rapid dilution that occurs offshore. Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment Insignificant to minor adverse impacts are expected fo r most socioeconomic resources for all spill sizes, but could increase to significant levels of concern for commercial and recreational fisheries and, regardless of response option used. In all regions, insignificant to moderate adverse impacts are expected for subsistence resources. The primary cause of potential adverse impacts is the presence of floating or stranded oil. The p attern of adverse impacts was similar in all six geographic regions considered in this PEIS, with potential adverse im pacts being characterized by their local nature and short duration. However, it is important to note that the perception of damage by the local or regional populations is often as significant as the actual potential impacts. Areas heavily dependent on coastal resources such as fisheries could be affected the most. On-water mechanical recovery or in situ burning reduces, but does not eliminate, adverse impacts on sensitive resources. In the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, chem ical dispersion could significantly reduce the adverse impacts on socioeconomic resources. Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil J-2 2009 J.

In addition, aerial tracking capability would be esta blished and maintained. The cost-benefit analysis performed for the regulatory analysis determined that for Alternative 2, the NPV at 7% of total national cost is $84.56 million (USCG, 2009). Since current levels of mechanical recovery capability would exceed the new requirement levels, the increased level of mechanical re covery capability unde r Alternative 2 would produce no change from Alternative 1 (Chapter 2, Sections 2.6.2 and 2.6.6). Thus, current availability of oil spill response options would rema in unchanged. On-water mechanical recovery and in situ burn capabilities would be available in all regions. On-water dispersant capability would not meet required response times except in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. Consequences to the Physical Environment Potential adverse impacts are the same as those id entified under Alternative 1 (Chapter 4, Section 4.10.1.1). Consequences to the Biological Environment Potential adverse impacts are the same as those id entified under Alternative 1 (Chapter 4, Section 4.10.1.1).

On-water dispersant capability (Option A) and an in situ burn credit would be estab lished. In addition, aerial tracking capability would be established and mainta ined. The cost-benefit analysis performed for the regulatory analysis determined that for Alternative 3, the NPV at 7% of total national cost is $129.53 million (USCG, 2009). Current availability of on-wate r mechanical recovery and in situ burn capabilities would remain unchanged since current levels of mechanical recovery capability would exceed the new requirement levels. On-water dispersant capability would be uniformly available in all geographic regions considered in this PEIS. Consequences to the Physical Environment Potential adverse impacts are the same as those identified under Alternative 1, with the only difference being that under this alternative, dispersant capability would be uniformly available in all geographic regions considered in this PEIS, increasing the potential hydrocarbon levels in the water column offshore in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Paci fic, and Oceania regions. However, rapid dilution would prevent any significant adverse impacts on marine water quality since hydrocarbon levels in the water column offshore would increase only in local areas for short periods of time and not to Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil J-3 2009 J.

Insignificant to moderate adverse impacts are expected for subtidal habitats , sea turtles , and Essential Fish Habitat and minor to moderate adverse impacts are expected for marine mammals and plankton and fish for all spill sizes, regardless of response option used.

Consequences to the Socioeconomic Environment Potential adverse impacts are the same as those identified under Alternative 1, with the only difference being that under this alternative, disper sant capability would be un iformly available in all six geographic regions considered in this PEIS. In significant to minor adverse impacts are expected for most resources for all spill sizes, but could increase to significant levels of concern for commercial and recreational fisheries , regardless of response opti on used. In all regions, insignificant to moderate adve rse impacts are expected for subsistence resources.

R EGIONAL NET BENEFICIAL AND ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES As described above, the net adverse and beneficial environmental impacts depend on the size and location of the oil spill, and the effectiveness of the response option used. The net adverse or beneficial impacts of the response alternatives are determined by comparing the potential adverse regional impacts for each of the alternatives. Since Alternative 1 represents the basic response scenario or the currently available oil spill respon se capability in each regi on, Alternatives 2 through 6 are compared to Alternative 1 to ascertain th e net adverse or beneficial impacts of each alternative. For example, an improvement in the le vel of concern from a significant adverse impact to a minor adverse impact indicates that the response option employed had a net beneficial impact on reducing the adverse impact of the oil spill. As explained above, the potential regional adverse impacts associated with Alternatives 1 and 2 are equivalent, as are the potential impacts associated with Alternatives 3, 4, 5, and 6. Thus, the net adverse or beneficial impacts were determined by comparing the potential regional adverse impacts of these two sets of alternatives. Net Beneficial Impacts A net beneficial impact occurs under Alternatives 3, 4, 5, or 6 (which would ensure the uniform availability of dispersant capability in each region) in certain regions and certain spill sizes for several biological resources and one socioeconomic resource listed below: Final PEIS for VPRs and FRPs for Oil J-6 2009 J. Comparison of Adverse Impacts of Oil Spills Under the Alternatives Marine and coastal birds: Atlantic region (medium spill sizes), Pacific region (small spill sizes), and Oceania region (small spill sizes) Intertidal habitats: Atlantic region (medium spill size s and large [45 percent dispersant efficiency] spill sizes), Caribbean region (medium sp ill sizes), Gulf of Mexico region (medium spill sizes), Pacific (small and medium spill sizes), Al aska region (medium and large spill sizes), and Oceania region (small and medium spill sizes) Sea turtles: Caribbean region (large spill sizes), Gulf of Mexico (medium spill sizes), and Oceania region (medium spill sizes) Areas of special concern: Atlantic region (medium spill sizes and large [45 percent dispersant efficiency] spill sizes), Caribbean region (medium spill sizes), Gulf of Mexico region (medium spill sizes), Pacific region (small and medium spill sizes), Alaska region (medium spill sizes), and Oceania region (small and medium spill sizes) Net Adverse Impacts A net adverse impact occurs under Alternatives 3, 4, 5, or 6 (which would ensure the uniform availability of dispersant capabilit y in each region) in certain regions and certain spill sizes for one physical, two biological, and one socioeconomic resource listed below: Coastal water quality: Caribbean region (large spill sizes), Pacific region (medium and large spill sizes), and Alaska region (medium and large spill sizes) Plankton and fish: Pacific region (large spill sizes) Essential Fish Habitat: Pacific region (large spill sizes) Subsistence: Atlantic region (large spill sizes), Caribbean region (small, medium, and large spill sizes), Gulf of Mexico (large [80 percent dispersant efficiency] spill sizes), and Pacific region (medium [80 percent dispersant efficiency] spill sizes and large spill sizes) For the remainder of the resources, we analyzed a comparison of the alternatives and found that the potential adverse impacts would remain at the same impact level as under the currently available response option. J.9. N ATIONAL NET BENEFICIAL AND ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES Oil spill impacts on U.S. waters are mostly loca lized and generally short lived; therefore, the potential benefits associated with a reduction in oil spill impacts would also be localized and short lived. The potential benefits associated with the reduction in floating or stranded oil resulting from the alternatives are thus localized and short lived, and insignificant from a national standpoint. For the resources analyzed, the impacts were assessed on a regional level. The national-level impacts are extrapolated from the regional-level findings . Any change in the net beneficial or adverse impact levels can be attributed to a particular re gion and are expected to be localized; therefore, national impacts are unlikely to result from even the largest spill scenarios.

A hearing should have been held in the Seattle area at a minimum. The absences of a public hearing in the Pacific Northwest combined with the lack of consultation with the Makah and other Northwest Treaty Tribes renders the current rulemaking process inadequate. The Coast Guard notes this comment. Currently there are no dispersant pre-authorization agreement areas in the Pacific Northwest; therefore, the rulemaking would not affect treaty reserved areas. Establishing any policy for the use of alternative response technologies requires significant consultations with all affected stakeholders. These consultations are ongoing within the Oregon- Washington area. Public hearings were held in all major coastal areas. Budget constraints limit us in how many locations we can hold public meetings. Since only California and certain areas of Alaska have dispersant pre- authorization agreement areas, public meetings were held in those states. 7833-111 Ben Johnson Makah Tribal Council General Takes issue with the interpretation that the Coast Guard applied to the recovery of spilled oil from the environment as the unit of benefit in the cost-benefit The Coast Guard agrees with this comment. There are cultural, economic, social, and environmental costs associated with oil spills, which are considered Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 1 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page analysis. in the PEIS in examining tradeoffs. 7833-111 Ben Johnson Makah Tribal Council General Requests that the Coast Guard consult the Makah Tribal Council on a go vernment-to-government basis regarding this important rulemaking initiative. The Coast Guard notes this comment and will continue to consult with the Makah Tribal Council on any response issue that could affect Makah Tribal Council treaty-protected areas. 7833-105 (transcript) Tom Lakosh general public General The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement PEIS as presented is insufficient for public review and fails to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA), Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90), and National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). The Coast Guard narrowed the scope without considering the alternatives with respect to their environmental impacts. The Coast Guard notes this comment. We have broadened the scope of public examination and consideration with this PEIS in that the decisions to use alternative response technologies are made at the local level, and the PEIS brings the consideration of alternative response technology use to the public at all levels and areas. The rulemaking represents our effort to ensuring that dispersants are available to the local area oil spill respon se and natural resource trustee decisionmakers. 7833-108 (transcript) 7833-111 William Nichols USEPA Office of Emergency Management Ben Johnson Makah Tribal Council General Want to know if the EIS and/or rulemaking would address the 2005 National Research Council (NRC) report. The Coast Guard notes these comments and has added references to Oil Spill Dispersants: Efficacy and Effects (NRC, 2005). 7833-101 James Praza k The Dow Chemical Company General Proper procedures, guidelines, and agreements should be put in place so that the decisions (related to an incident) can be made within a pre-agreed framework. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment. Procedures and guidelines ar e in place as specified in the NCP (40 CFR Part 300.910). This PEIS and the rulemaking are intended to assure the availability of equipment and resources to implement decisions made in compliance with NCP requirements. All coastal federal regions and local Area Contingency Plans contain procedures for the use of alternative response technologies. 7833-94 Jean R. Cameron Pacific States-British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force General Alternative 5 ignores the fact that in situ burn may be prohibited even if approved by the FOSC and local counterparts. Must recognize the ability of the public to use the courts to impede or prohibit the use of dispersants and in situ burning when evaluating any plan to reduce mechanical recovery capability. The Coast Guard notes this comment, but it is outside the scope of the PEIS. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 2 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page 7833-94 Jean R. Cameron Pacific States-British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force General In Alaska, dispersants and in situ burning are pre- approved for parts of Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet, but would be difficult elsewhere in the state. Requirements need to be modified for areas outside of Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet. The Coast Guard notes this comment. Any changes in dispersant and in situ burn capabilities would only affect waters where pre-authorization agreements exist. 7833-94 Jean R. Cameron Pacific States-British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force General Would have preferred an al ternative that not only requires investment in both in situ burning and dispersants where pre-authorization agreements exist, but also increases on-water mechanical recovery equipment levels. Coast Guard should evaluate regional capabilities to respond to a WCD during future Caps reviews. The Coast Guard notes this comment, but it is outside the scope of the PEIS. 7833-96 Stephan Grenon International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited General ITOPF supports the implementation of Alternative 5 as the preferred alternative. We believe that the addition of a nationwide dispersant capa bility in the United States will complement the current suite of response options available by providing a means of rapidly treating spilt oil and, thereby, contribute to the protection of the environment during oil spill response. Our practical experience worldwide has demonstrated that effective contingency planning for dispersant use and rapid execution of such plans has yielded significant benefit when dispersants are used appropriately. Similar to the findings from the analysis carried out in the PEIS, the benefits of using dispersants to protect sensitive resources have often far outweighed any justifiable concerns about lasting environmental consequences. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment. 7833-96 Stephan Grenon International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited General We anticipate that the implementation of these revisions will be accompanied by training for OSRO and USCG personnel on the efficient use of dispersants. Our experience has shown that the decision to use dispersants must be given careful consideration to realize the benefits that they can provide. Operational guidance should be provided to avoid undesirable situations where damages occur from their misuse. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The decision to use dispersants is governed by pre-authorization policies that were carefully considered by the applicable trustees. The rulemaking does address training operational training for dispersant operations and aerial observers. 7833-96 Stephan Grenon International Tanker Owners General As for aerial tracking, we wo uld be in favor of ensuring that the aircraft used for that purpose are capable of The Coast Guard notes this comment, but it is outside the scope of the PEIS. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 3 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page Pollution Federation Limited communicating directly with vessels and spraying aircraft involved in the response. This would enable aerial observers to guide vesse ls and aircraft toward the main oil slicks and thereby improve the effectiveness of the response operation. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council General Exposure of biota to surface floating oil and dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons is measured based on average concentrations within a grid; therefore, the model does not register the potentially acute impacts of concentrations of oil. This has the potential to underestimate dispersed oil toxicity. The Coast Guard notes this comment; however, the model was not able to take into account areas that might have higher concentrations of oil. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute General Recommends that for future technical reports of this nature, the Coast Guard read, understand, and adhere to governmental guidance established by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), especially regarding length, clarity, and conciseness. The Coast Guard notes this comment. 7833-98 Michael L. Munger Cook Inlet Citizens Regional Advisory Committee General The Draft PEIS does not provide empirical evidence to support assumptions regarding mechanical recovery efficiency. The Draft PEIS directly contradicts the Caps review (USCG, 1999) and the Negotiated Rulemaking report, repeatedly stating that \"any increase in mechanical response equipment...would not result in increased efficiency or additional oil being removed from the water.\" This statement is cited back to the regulatory assessment (USCG, 2002). In reviewing this publication, it appears that this conclusion was drawn based on the opinions of a small panel of experts. No empirical evidence was cited to support this conclusion, yet the Coast Guard has framed its entire consideration of the 2003 equipment Caps on this subjective belief. CIRCAC recommends that the Coast Guard provide objective evidence to support the claim that a 25 percent increase in mechanical response capability would not improve the ability to respond to a WCD in adverse weather. In the absence of such evidence, the Coast Guard should revise the entire Draft PEIS analysis to consider the potential environmental benefits and costs of a 25 percent increase in The Coast Guard notes this comment. The objective evidence for mechanical recovery limitations are found in historical spill reports and in equipment providers' literature. It is widely known within the response community that mechanical recovery has a very narrow operating window. The panel of experts cited collectively had over 100 years of oil spill response experience. Professional opinion is valued but not solely relied on. Mechanical recovery limitations are well documented. One of the most critical limitations regardless of sea and weather c onditions is the slow rate of advance that must be maintained to prevent entrainment (oil passing under the boom). Often the ocean currents move faster that the rate of advance skimming vessels must use to collect oil. Collectively when factoring in mechanical recovery mobilization times, slow rate of ski mming advance, and the sea conditions that are most prevalent in open water areas, 25 percent recovery is considered high by the Coast Guard, as well as by the pr ivate and public response community. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 4 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page mechanical response capabilities for a WCD. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute General Strongly suggests that the text be revised to point out that in situ burning has been used successfully in shoreline and marsh applications. The purpose will be to show that the negative aspects of in situ burning portrayed in the PEIS scenarios are balanced with benefits seen in shoreline and marsh applications so the potential value of in situ burning for other types of response applications is not lost. The Coast Guard notes this comment; however, the analysis was for open-water areas and not for shoreline and marsh applications. 7833-101 7833-105 (transcript) James Prazak The Dow Chemical Company General Houston is a prime example of how industry can effectively work together to deal with incidents. We have all recognized that when it comes to an incident, it really doesn't matter who caused it, we're all going to be impacted. As a result of this, when the incident happens, the agencies and industry work together to resolve it as quickly and safely as possible. The relationships we build in these endeavors help us in every facet of our operation. It may be worthwhile to evaluate where we have ports that lack these types of cooperative efforts, and then use knowledgeable personnel from the agencies and industry to help spread this type of interaction in those areas. The Coast Guard notes this comment. 7833-101 7833-105 (transcript) James Praza k The Dow Chemical Company General Once the regulations are published, it would be beneficial for training to be conducted in the process for getting approval to use these additional capabilities, as well as in the techniques for assessing which should be used. NOAA has a lot of data available on their web site, and some Area Contingency Plans have info in them already, but insuring this info is out there and people know how to use it will be critical to the success of future responses. The Coast Guard notes this comment. 7833-107 (transcript) Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council General Has there been a major shift in policy and oil spill response away from mechanical response being the primary response method? There seems to be a shift from removing oil from the environment to dispersing it into the water or burning it into the air. The Coast Guard notes this comment. There has not been a shift of focus, but rather an assessment of existing response capabilitie s, as well as alternative response technologie s. Ultimately in any oil spill the primary goal is to reduce the environmental impacts of the spilled oil. In some spill scenarios, mechanical recovery will be the preferred method. In other spill Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 5 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page scenarios, alternative technology such as in situ burning in a marsh or the application of dispersants when mechanical recovery cannot successfully mitigate the spill would be the prefe rred response methods. 7833-107 (transcript) Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council General Where did the artificially low figure of 15 percent recovery rates for mechanical recovery come from? In numerous cases there have been rates up to a 95 percent recovery reported. There seems to be a lack of empirical evidence to support statements regarding mechanical recovery capabilities. If two different efficiencies were used for dispersants for effectiveness, we'd like you to consider using two different efficiency percentages for mechanical recovery rather than just the 15 percent. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The 15 percent figure was based on historical spill reports and real- world experience. The report that PWSRCAC funded does indicate several spills with a 95 percent recovery rate, but these cases involve on land spills from tanks and pipelines, and not open water spills. 7833-107 (transcript) Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council General We were also concerned that there was a 96-hour limit used for the technical background for the model. We find this artificially low in our region. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The 96-hour time period was used as a comparative value and is deemed satisfactory for most spill scenarios. 7833-107 (transcript) Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council General We also are concerned that in the model there was a delay for the start of mechanical response until hour 12, yet the application of dispersants would start at hour 7. The Coast Guard notes this comment. These times reflect the existing regulatory requirements for mechanical recovery and th e proposed requirements for dispersants. 7833-107 (transcript) Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council General We're concerned that there is an underestimate of the water quality impacts with the use of dispersants. The long-term acute toxicity of dispersants really has to be considered in this model. The Coast Guard notes this comment. 7833-107 (transcript) Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council General We're concerned that the use of the Valdez Arm is being representative of Prince William Sound, it doesn't seem correct. As a whole, Prince William Sound is a vast range of environments and physical characteristics, and the Valdez Arm is only a small area with minimal shallow water areas and no large freshwater sources. The use of dispersants, in terms of commercial fishing, will have an impact within the Valdez Narrows rather than considering an area like the Copper River Delta or some of the larger commercial fishing areas. The Coast Guard notes this comment; however, the area assessed is keeping within the current pre- authorization agreement areas, which for the most part exist primarily with tanker traffic lanes. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and General The proper name for NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Fisheries is NOAA's The Coast Guard notes this comment and has made the change in the Final PEIS. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 6 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page Atmospheric Administration National Marine Fisheries Service or abbreviated as NMFS. Please make the necessary edits to reflect this change. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration General Essential Fish Habitat should not be pluralized, nor should the acronym EFH. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration General NMFS remains concerned about the uncertainties associated with the use of chemical dispersants to treat oil spills. In the recently release NRC report Understanding Oil Spill Dispersants: Efficacy and Effects the report states \"in many instances where a dispersed plume may come into contact with sensitive water- column or benthic organisms or populations, the current understanding of key processes and mechanisms is inadequate to confidently support a decision to apply dispersants. Thus, such decisions regarding the potential use of dispersants in nearshore setting are creating a demand for additional information.\" (NRC, 2005, ES-3). NMFS feels that the potential impacts of chemical dispersants on EFH are still poorly understood and recommends a precautionary approach be taken in determining the use of dispersants on oil spills in areas that may adversely affect EFH. ( Comment 4 ) The Coast Guard notes this comment. As indicated in the PEIS, dispersant use decisions are carefully considered in consultation with the applicable resource trustees, including NMFS representatives. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute ES-12 2-10 4-79 Appendix D Assumptions on capabilities of response equipment are confusing and distort the actual spill response capabilities that industry has in place. Example is estimating efficiency rates that vary from page to page. Second example has to do with the delivery of dispersants from aircraft; the T ier 1 delivery schedule may need adjustment. Recommends that the USCG add specific text to the PEIS stating that the assumptions regarding equipment availability and equipment capabilities were made for convenience of calculations and scenario comparisons, and were not meant to represent current response capability realities. The The Coast Guard notes this comment, which refers to mechanical recovery rates that are used differently in the PEIS. In Chapter 4 higher rates are used for modeling to allow a best case scenario for mechanical recovery. Elsewhere in the PEIS lower rates are used to describe historical mechanical recovery rates, both in averages or actual examples. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 7 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page USCG should acknowledge that current response capabilities exceed current regulatory requirements, and may not represent the capabilities that would be sustained in the future. 7833-101 7833-105 (transcript) James Praza k The Dow Chemical Company Executive Summary While we do have to account for differences in areas, we should strive for as much standardization as possible. There should be some attempt to determine whether we can open up the possibility of using these techniques everywhere, and under what conditions we can use them. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. We will not establish national standards for dispersant use. Per the NCP, dispersant use is determined by local-regional stakeholders, including the natural resource trustees. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 1 para 2 para 1 4-2, para 4 If the section refers only to areas with pre-authorization agreements for dispersants, the discussion should clearly st ate so to avoid confusion regarding pre-authorization agreements for in situ burning. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management ES.3 ES-3, para 1 The document should include the Gulf of Mexico in this and other sections where pre-authorization exists. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The Executive Summary does list the Gulf of Mexico on page ES-4. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency para 1 Recommends adding \"Bays\" after \"Great Lakes\" in the last sentence. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Bays should not be added because it is a local decision if they are included in pre-authorization agreements. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management ES.3 1.4 2.6 ES-4 1-5 2-15 The last paragraph should be rewritten. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management ES.4 ES-5 Recommends that the discussion provide more detailed information on the nature of the public comments. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment. Public comments are part of the Final EIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management ES.7 ES-11, para 2 A more-detailed model for the Caribbean and Oceania regions would give better information, especially for the Gulf side where currents and water conditions are significantly different. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. For the Caribbean region, the Straits of Florida was used because it is an area of highest traffic volume and confined shipping lanes, therefore carrying a higher potential for significant spill incidents than other U.S. waters that might impact the wider Caribbean. For Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 8 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page the Oceania region, the Straits of Florida and/or the five modeled locations were used because of the enormous expanse of water and relative low risk of impact in the region. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management ES.7.1 4.2.1 ES-12, para 4 4-5, para 2 The assumption that mechanical recovery and in situ burning have efficiencies less than 15 percent is not supported for all spills. Also, questions if recovery and in situ burning are so ineffective, why were vessels required to have these capabilities? The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Mechanical recovery rates in open water on the ocean are generally less than 15 percent and the opportunity to improve beyond that is generally considered to be minimal. This is due to the nature of oil and natural forces in open-water areas. When oil is spilled on water, it tends to spread rapidly on the surface and is driven by the wind into very thin streamers and sheens on the water surface. By the time mechanical recovery equipment has arrived on-scene (in 6 to 12 hours), the oil has spread over very large areas. Nevertheless, recovering 10 to 15 percent of oil in a major incident provides significant mitigation of adverse environmental impact. For more information, see NRC (2005) and OTA (1990). 7833-109 7833-97 7833-107 (transcript) R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council ES.7.1.2 ES-13, para 4 The potential issues with the residues from in situ burning should be discussed as limitations to burning, similar to the discussion on the potential limitations of mechanical recovery. Recommends that the PEIS explain potential impacts from air quality and in situ burn residues. Coast Guard needs to consider a worst case discharge (WCD) in terms of air impacts of burning. The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments. Section 4.3 discusses potential impacts from in situ burning on air quality and from in situ burn residues. There would be little value in using a WCD for air impacts since the probability of use in situ burning in this type of spill is extremely low and impracticable. 7833-101 7833-105 (transcript) James Praza k The Dow Chemical Company ES.7.1.4 ES-14 The PEIS fails to note that in many cases\u2014at least with facilities\u2014the facility itself has the equipment available and provides the first response, then brings in outside resources, depending on the size of the spill. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. We recognize that there are significant mechanical resources available in the regulatory assessment (USCG, 2002) and have factored this into our selection of Alternative 5as the preferred alternative. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 9 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management ES.7.1.4 ES-15, para 1 The PEIS suggests that equipment would not increase as a result of increasing the required capacity. It seems counterintuitive that an increase in the required equipment capacity would not also lead to an increase in equipment needed and/or contracted by vessels and oil spill removal organizations (OSROs). The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Section ES 7.1.4 does not state that increased equipment would not result in increased recovered oil. The PEIS does indicate, as does the regulatory assessment (USCG, 2002), that increased mechanical recovery equipment will not result in a commensurate increase in oil recovered in the open- water environment. Increasing mechanical recovery equipment required would not result in an increase in the amount of mechanical recovery equip ment available. It would only increase the amount of equipment for which an individual planholder would be required to contract. Planholders would not acquire new equipment, but only establish additional contracts with equipment providers that are already providing support to other planholders. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA ES-15, para 2 4-94 The PEIS should provide evidence from actual spills to support the assertion that recovery occurs \"within days or weeks.\" The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has added Oil in the Sea: Inputs, Fates, and Effects (NRC, 1985) and Oil Spill Dispersants: Efficacy and Effects (NRC, 2005) \u2014both of which support this claim \u2014to this section of the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management ES.7.2 ES-16, para 1 It is difficult to believe a medium spill can have insignificant impacts as implied here and in other parts of the document. The entire section seems to suggest that impacts are at most minor. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. For the most part, medium spills in the open ocean do have minimal impact. First, because there are few active communities in that environment. Second, because the oil will spread, evaporate, naturally disperse, and otherwise biodegrade or diffuse fairly quickly below threshold toxicity levels. That is why for most medium spills in open water, often the best course is natural disper sion, evaporation, and biodegradation. 7833-99 Robert E. Duncan South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Executive Summary Recommends that Alternative 4 be adopted by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. While mechanical recovery remains the preferred response option in all environments, it has serious limitations in open-water areas. As indicated in the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 10 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page regulatory assessment (USCG, 2002) prepared in conjunction with this rulemaking, significant mechanical recovery resources exist in the United States. Increasing contracted mechanical recovery equipment levels is not justified because it would not result in an increase in the amount of oil that would be recovered. 7833-111 7833-112 Ben Johnson Makah Tribal Council Billy Frank Jr. Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission Executive Summary The Makah Tribal Council and the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission recognize Alternative 2 as the preferred option and would like to offer suggestions as to how this process can be improved. The assumed 15 percent mechanical recovery rate discounts the potential for improvements in removal equipment technology. Using two rates of efficiency for mechanical recovery would allow gear appropriate for the operating environment and sea state to be sufficiently incorporated in the analysis of alternatives. The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments. Mechanical recovery rates are variable but historically low, particularly in offs hore areas. The 13 percent recovery rate in open-ocean areas is an average that is consistent with past spill r ecovery efforts. It is also our opinion \u2014supported in Oil Spill Dispersants: Efficacy and Effects (NRC, 2005) \u2014that no substantive increase in mechanical recovery rates have occurred in the last 10 years. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Executive Summary Given the limitations of the supporting analysis, believes that Alternative 1 is preferable to the other alternatives presented in the Draft PEIS. This action essentially makes no changes to response plan regulations. This no action alternative could be further improved, however, by requiring that aerial tracking capabilities be provided by contract or approved means, as included in other alternatives. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Current market forces have not resulted in the establishment of a reliable dispersant capability anywhere in the country. Al ternative 1 leaves coastal areas at severe risk of oil contamination when large oil spills cannot be contained or removed by mechanical recovery. By ensuring dispersant availability by regulation, coastal communities will have an ensured and viable countermeasure to oil spills that cannot be effectively dealt with by traditional methods. 7833-101 7833-105 (transcript) 7833-110 James Praza k The Dow Chemical Company Jennifer A. Carpenter The American Waterways Operators Executive Summary Believes it is important to evaluate whether a vessel or facility could reasonably be expected to create an impact where dispersants or in situ burning could be used before being required to be able to provide those resources. Vessel owners should not be required to contract for response capability that they may be prohibited from The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments. The NPRM is currently drafted to include facilities and vessels that operate within dispersant pre- authorization agreement areas. Currently there are no facilities operating in disp ersant pre-authorization agreement areas, nor are there any inland water areas where pre-authorization agreement areas exist. Therefore, the dispersant requirement does not apply Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 11 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page using in the event of a spill.

The Coast Guard notes this comment and recognizes that there are large amounts of response equipment that exceed those required by regulation. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Executive Summary Recommends that the USCG revise the text of the purpose and need. The Coast Guard notes this comment; however, the existing language is satisfactory. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute 2.1 2-2 Recommends updating the definition of local response community noted in the text to be consistent with the one in the glossary. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.2 2-2, para 3 In overview of oil spill res ponse strategies, the text states, \"Other options \u2014including sinking agents, gelling agents, and enhanced bioremediation \u2014are less widely used or have major limitations.\" The use of sinking agents is illegal and should not be included. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.2.2 2-4, para 2 If Alternative 3, 4, or 5 is chosen by the Coast Guard, there will be a need for more SMART (Special Monitoring of Applied Response Technologies) protocol teams to monitor the efficacy and the possible environmental impacts of dispersants or in situ burning. What will happen to the SMART protocol data after these spills occur and data are gathered in the field? Can the Coast Guard provide data from past spills? Also, what are the economics behind maintaining the SMART protocol teams and their equipment, and are the costs accounted for in this analysis? The Coast Guard notes this comment. The Coast Guard and NOAA are set up for deploying SMART teams as requested by the FOSC. Data produced are publicly available. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.2.2 2-4, para 3 G-2, Should provide the correct full name as National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan Product Schedule or NCP Product Schedule. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 12 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page para 2 There are currently 13 different dispersants with varying toxicity and efficacy values on the NCP Product Schedule. More information can be found at www.epa.gov/oilspill under NCP Product Schedule and Notebook link. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.2.4 2-8 para 1 Paragraph mentions oxidation agents. The NCP Product Schedule recognizes five types of chemical countermeasures used on oil spills: (1) dispersants, (2) surface washing agents, (3) surfaces collecting agents, (4) bioremediation, (5) miscellaneous oil spill control agents. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.3 2-10, para 1 Should provide recovery rates for the combination of mechanical recovery and in situ burning. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The recovery rates are considered the same because in situ burning first requires collecting spilled oil using traditional mechanical collection methods. Therefore, the recovery rates are almos t identical. Using the two systems together does not increase the quantity of oil encountered and will not increase recovery rates. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.5 2-11 Environmental Risk Assessments (ERAs), as defined and practiced by the U.S. Coast Guard, are not technically Risk Assessments according to established and documented USEPA procedures for Risk Assessment that would apply to any government action. Risk Assessment is defined and is legally as well as scientifically defensible. The USCG ERA does not meet these criteria. This is not saying USCG's effort is without significant merit, but the name should be changed. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The Risk Assessments used by the USEPA have a different intent from the USCG ERA program. The USCG ERA looks at risk in broader terms relative to oil spills and their effect on habitats and select species (identified by local trustees). It then works through scenarios to identify the most appropriate response method that minimizes the risk to these habitats. It is true that the USCG ERA is more of a net environmental benefit examination, but the process still uses risk assessment relative to habitats and specific species. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.6.3 2-18, para 2 Regarding Alternative 3, the statement suggests that the use of dispersants would increase, and therefore resources needed would also increase. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The current wording is appropriate. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.6.6 2.9 2-23 2-28 Aerial observation can only give responders an idea of how effective a particular sortie of dispersants was, but cannot give a scientifically defensible The Coast Guard agrees with this comment. The majority of regional disp ersant pre-authorization agreements call for the use of SMART protocols, Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 13 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page conclusions that a dispersant was X percent effective. Therefore, Tiers II and III SMART protocols should be deplo yed at every dispersant operation. including Tiers I and II. However, it does not require that dispersant operations be delayed until Tier II systems can arrive on scene. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 2.6.6 2-24, para 2 The discussion is counterintuitive, as it implies that prevention is similar to mitigation. This is only logical if prevention is defined as preventing oil from reaching shore, not preventing the spill altogether. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The term \"preventive\" in this section is used in its normally defined way. The discussion is about why the Coast Guard would not accept decreases in oil spill response equipment for preventive actions taken by industry. Additional preventive actions may reduce the number of spills but will not eliminate spills or limit their potential magnitude. Therefore, added preventive measures do not justify reduced response capability. 7833-94 7833-106 (transcript) 7833-111 7833-112 7833-98 7833-97 7833-107 (transcript) Jean Pacific Columbia Oil Spill Task Force Yvonne Addassi Pacific States-British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force Ben Johnson Makah Tribal Council Billy Frank Jr. Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission Michael L. Munger Cook Inlet Citizens Regional Advisory Committee John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council 2.8.5 Do not agree with the Coast Guard's statement that there is essentially no benefit from increasing response requirements for mechanical recovery, nor with the estimate that a 25 percent increase in mechanical recovery equipment would result in \"no additional barrels of oil being removed from the water.\" OPA 90 requires the Coast Guard to address a WCD, and vessel cargo capacity has increased. A 25 percent increase in mechanical response capability standards would scarcely keep pace with the increases in vessel capacity, but would ensure that currant equipment is not removed or decommissioned. OPA 90 is not being carried out, and conflicting interpretations of the original intent of OPA 90 exist within the rulemaking process. The Coast Guard is not planning for a worst-case spill by not following the incremental increases in planning prescribed by the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee in 1990. The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments. The Coast Guard is following the intent of OPA 90 by requiring dispersant capabilities for offshore areas. These areas are most vulnerable because of the limitations of mechanical recovery, primarily as a result of physical ocean and meteorological conditions, not because there are inadequate mechanical resources. Dispersants provide local response communities with a complete and flexible response capability. The regulatory assessment (USCG, 2002) determined that further increases in mechanical recovery stockpiles would not result in a commensurate increase in oil recovered in open- water areas.

The statement that there are no benefits to increasing mechanical recovery capabilities raises the obvious question of why in 2000 the Coast Guard concluded that it was g ood policy to increase mechanical recovery capabilities, but is now reaching a different conclusion. Please provide justification for the determination that additional mechanical response equipment would not increase the amount of oil removed from the environment. The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments.

Find the proposal to allow offsets for investments in in situ burn equipment to be inconsistent with this position, however. All tools should be available, since we cannot know in advance which ones would be most useful or would provide the greatest environmental benefit in any specific case. Do not agree with the USCG rationale that mechanical and in situ burn equipment work in almost identical circumstances and are The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments. In the PEIS, in situ burning is compared to mechanical recovery in that the same collection methods are used and both have similar operating limitations relative to containment and collection. The Coast Guard recognizes that th ere are other limitations associated with in situ burning, such as safety and health issues.

Munger Cook Inlet Citizens Regional Advisory Committee Chapter 2 PEIS reflects a bias toward nonmechanical response technologies, which does a disservice to Alaska and other regions of the country where mechanical recovery is the preferred\u2014and frequently the only feasible\u2014option. Does not support an increase in dispersant capability or an in situ burn credit, and stro ngly discourages the Coast Guard from allowing th e use of dispersants to supplant mechanical recovery. The Draft PEIS appears biased toward dispersant use. The Coast Guard agrees that dispersants should not be given preference over mechanical recovery. While mechanical recovery remains the preferred response option, there are times when mechanical recovery will be ineffective or insuffi cient alone. In such cases, dispersant capability should be available if its use is likely to mitigate adverse environmental impacts.

English New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Chapter 2 Suggests getting a group to gether to develop a how- to manual on what options might be out there and how to make them work. Once the regulation is published, it would be advantageous to offer training in the process of getting approved to use th ese additional capabilities and in the technique for assessing which technique should be used. Also would like to see more training related to the use of dispersants and in situ burning provided to program and incident managers at the state and local levels. The Coast Guard notes these comments. The decision processes and guides for the use of alternative response technologies are addressed within Area Contingency and Regional Contingency Plans. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Chapter 2 Chapter 2 states that mech anical response cites 15 percent as the amount of oil \"likely to be recovered on water\" using either mechanical response or in situ burning \"regardless of how much equipment is employed.\" A 1990 report is cited as the basis for this estimate. This report reflects pre-OPA 90 response capabilities. An analysis of twenty-four U.S. nearshore spill responses during the period from 1993-200 shows that mechanical recovery rates in excess of 30 percent were realized for nineteen of those spills, with mechanical recovery rates as high as 97 percent. If higher mechanical recovery rate s were inputted into the models and used in the cost-benefit analysis, the preferred option may have worked out differently. The Coast Guard notes this comment. Historical oil spill recovery rates are what were used to arrive at these conclusions. The report mentioned here is still valid because its focus was not on the quantity of mechanical recovery, but rather the operating limitations of it. The analysis that the comment references was completed by NUKA Research and Planning Group for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council. Unfortunately this report is flawed in its methodology and reporting criteria in that the majority of the spills cited involved on land tank failures within containment areas, pre-boomed transfers, spills in ice, and on land pipeline releases. The report also does not provide sufficient detail to make objective evaluations of the various scenarios surrounding the mechanical recovery methods employed. Of the vessel spills that appear to involve a traditional mechanical recovery response, the rates of recovery ranged between 2.5 percent and 22.33 percent. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 2 Believes that the USCG mechanical recovery guidelines can be revised, which will help increase spill removal effectiveness. Specifically, requiring a balanced system (matching the pump with encounter rate and storage) would eliminate the possibility of a response plan being certified based on mere calculated pump capacity (i.e., a \"paper tiger\"), and it The Coast Guard notes this comment, but it is outside the scope of the PEIS. Removal capability for mechanical recovery systems are based on the derated pumping capacity of the skimmer, ignoring either the ability of the associated booms to actually encounter and contain oil for delivery to the skimmer, or the storage capacity of associated oil Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 17 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page would more closely represent a removal system's actual capabilities. storage devices. In practice both can limit recovery capability to less-than-advertised pumping capacity. 7833-111 Ben Johnson Makah Tribal Council Chapter 2 The Makah Tribal Council prefers a broader matrix of alternative scenarios be applied to the Draft PEIS alternative review process before the selection of a preferred alternative. We believe the USCG selection of Alternative 5 places the tribe's treaty-protected resources at greater risk of damage from untreated and dispersed oil by limiting our use of currently established response alternatives. The Coast Guard notes this comment. Currently there are no pre-authorization agreement areas in treaty-protected waters. Any change would have to include consultation with the tribes. 7833-101 7833-105 (transcript) James Praza k The Dow Chemical Company Chapter 2 Coast Guard should evaluate whether it is possible to incorporate some enhanced bioremediation into the use of dispersants to help the ecosystem get back to normal faster. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Bioremediation was not considered in the regulatory effort because the Coast Guard considers it an unproven response technology when used in ocean environments. 7833-101 7833-105 (transcript) James Praza k The Dow Chemical Company Chapter 2 It may be worthwhile to investigate the use of public resources to provide an initial response capability, with industry providing the support and training awareness for those public resources. The Coast Guard notes this comment. Public resources are not discounted in any response situation. However, oil spills are \u2014by the law (OPA 90)\u2014the responsibility of the spiller, and no relief is available from public resources. The basic premise of the Area Committee process is to bring public responders together with the private sector in advance of spills to plan, c oordinate, and train for the inclusion of public resources in spill response, when appropriate. 7833-101 7833-105 (transcript) James Praza k The Dow Chemical Company Chapter 2 It would also be worthwhile to develop a list of volunteer resources from industry, local first responders, and similar personnel who can respond to an incident and provide expert technical advice to a Unified Command regarding response alternatives, suggested techniques, and special concerns in the area. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The local Area Contingency Plans address available resources, both human and material, that can be called on for a spill response. 7833-104 Andrew J. English New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Chapter 2 Is concerned that replacement of mechanical recovery equipment with in situ burn equipment will allow oil to go from pollution of water to air. Therefore, support of the increased use of The Coast Guard notes this comment. The PEIS does not advocate one response method over another. The use of response methods is determined at the local level. Decision matrices and guides are Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 18 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page dispersants and in situ burning is contingent on the development of a decision matrix for use by the FOSCs.

Would like the opportunity to review criteria. contained in Area and Regional Contingency Plans. 7833-105 (transcript) Tom Lakosh general public Chapter 2 Refers to the 2005 NRC report, which clearly indicates that there is a need for a substantial amount of information before scientific analysis can be deemed complete and sufficient for consideration in application of dispersants. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Oil Spill Dispersants: E fficacy and Effects (NRC, 2005) states that sufficient informati on exists for supporting dispersant use decisions in open-ocean areas. 7833-105 (transcript) Tom Lakosh general public Chapter 2 There was no consideration of the adverse effects of in situ burning (the smoke, the fire, the plume, the stop of other operations) and dispersants (everyone has to leave the area when they are applied). The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Air impacts are considered in the PEIS in Chapter 4. 7833-105 (transcript) Tom Lakosh general public Chapter 2 Finds a basic flaw in the USCG Caps determination is that the Caps are determined by a set percentage of the nameplate pump and capacity with no reference to the ability of the effectiveness of efficiency or encounter rates of the mechanical removal equipment under consideration. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The regulation significantly de-rates the nameplate-stated recovery capabilities by recognizing the reduced operating capabilities in real-world situations. 7833-104 Andrew J. English New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Chapter 2 The Final PEIS should indicate how the availability of equipment in each region will be ensured. The Coast Guard notes this comment and will address this through the OSRO inspection program. 7833-104 Andrew J. English New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Chapter 2 Supports increasing oil spill removal capabilities and assumes that the existing agreement for dispersant use for Long Island Sound will not be affected by the final adoption of these regulations for areas inside the 3 nm areas identified The Coast Guard notes this comment. The coastal waters around Long Island Sound are not affected by this rulemaking. The rulema king will only ensure that dispersants are available for areas where pre- authorization exists. 7833-105 (transcript) Tom Lakosh general public Chapter 2 The Coast Guard must review all technologies \u2014 such as the hid skimmer and hid barge that proposed use of burning within the barge \u2014if it is to fully understand all possibilities.

For example, there are no requirements that in situ burning is available in all regions and dispersant capability is available in Gulf of Mexico and Alaska (assumed in Alternative 1). The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment and recognizes that there are both government- and industry-owned response resources that far exceed those required by regulation. 7833-111 Ben Johnson Makah Tribal Council Chapter 2 Please explain why the Draf t PEIS does not address the difficulties of dispersant application and its impact on the ability to continue mechanical recovery. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The PEIS does discuss the limitations of the various response methods, including dispersants. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 2 Recommends that the Coast Guard revise the PEIS to note that the baseline data used to establish the spill scenarios reflect a relatively small database encompassing past spill sizes and frequencies, and that updated or current data available to the Coast Guard were not included in setting up the modeling scenarios. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Past spill history is not a reliable predictor of future spills, both in terms of size and location. The spill scenarios used were designed to facilitate the analysis of potential impacts. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3.1 NMFS proposes a new subsection in Section 3.1, which would provide an overview of the EFH provision of the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Management and Conservation Act. Currently, background information on the EFH program is contained under the Atlantic Region Section (Section 3.2.4) within the Affected Environment Chapter (Chapter 3), but a similar overview of EFH is not provided in any of the other regional sections.

We question some of the sincerity toward Alaska and its scientific basis for the proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard notes this comment. In Chapter 3, there were no references to manatees, and all references to threatened and endangered sea turtles have been removed. In Chapter 4, the one reference to manatees was retained as it is part of a general section on marine mammals, and the one refere nce to sea turtles was deleted. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Chapter 3 The information on EFH consultation in Response to Comment 2 on page 3 of the NMFS Comments is applicable to the USCG obligation to initiate EFH consultations with NMFS during pre-spill planning, response, and post-response activities when adverse affects on EFH are possible to identify and incorporate plans and procedures to protect EFH during spill planning and response activities. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Chapter 3 NMFS remains concerned about the uncertainties associated with the use of chemical dispersants to treat oil spills. Oil Spill Dispersants: Efficacy and Effects (NRC, 2005) states \"in many instances where a dispersed plume may come into contact with sensitive water-column or benthic organisms or populations, the current understanding of key processes and mechanisms is inadequate to confidently support a decision to apply dispersants. Thus, such decisions regarding the potential use of dispersants in nearshore setting are creating a demand for additional information\" (p. ES-3). NMFS feels that the poten tial impacts of chemical The Coast Guard notes this comment. As indicated in the PEIS, dispersant-use decisions are carefully considered in consultation with the applicable resource trustees, including NMFS representatives. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 21 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page dispersants on EFH are still poorly understood and recommends a precautionary approach be taken in determining the use of dispersants on oil spills in areas that may adversely affect EFH. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.1.1 4-8, para 1 Recommends not using the term \"insoluble\" in the following: \"Most of the components of oil are insoluble in water, limiting the effects of oil on water quality.\" The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.1 4.3.2 4-10 4-32 Recommends that the negative impacts of dispersed oil be acknowledged, here and in other parts of the document. Negative impacts of dispersed oil must also be included in the analysis. The Coast Guard notes this comment. There are potential negative effects from dispersed oil, and each section in the analysis includes a comparison of the effects of using dispersants versus relying on on- water mechanical recovery, with or without the addition of in situ burning. The referenced sections mention the generic discussions concerning possible impacts to water quality and on plankton and fish. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office 4-2, last para 4-10, para 2 Case-by-case authorization is distinctly not pre- authorization. There is a discussion here about the ubiquity of pre- authorization. The di scussion should really differentiate between the two types of areas. We do not know that dispersants will not be applied outside of pre-approved areas, only that there are sanctions against those that do. The Coast Guard notes these comments. Case-by - case use in any area outside of pre-authorization agreement areas must be specifically approved by the USEPA and the state in consultation with federal natural resource trustee agencies for each spill incident. There are both civil and criminal sanctions against unauthorized dispersant use. The Coast Guard believes that these sanctions are sufficient to discourage that use. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.1 4-2 The Draft PEIS needs to provide a justification for the size of the largest oil spill included in the analysis and to discuss how response to a larger spill is served by this analysis. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.1 4-2, para 3 The PEIS should use the small spill size of 50 bbl noted in the regulation, not the less conservative size of 200 bbl. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The model would not support 50-bbl runs. This small a quantity in open-ocean areas presented a slick that would quickly degrade naturally. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute 4.1 4-3 The last few lines of the paragraph should be rewritten.

Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.2 4-4, para 5 Suggest deleting \" in situ burn\" from the first sentence of the paragraph that begins \"Dispersants and in situ burn use is restricted by decisions\". In situ burning is not restricted, only \"burning agents\" require Regional Response Team (RRT) approval. Also, dispersants are not restricted by the RRT, they are authorized, either ahead of time or on a case-by-case basis by the RRT. The restriction is in the NCP, which delegates the authority to pre-approve use to the RRTs. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. This section uses the term \"restricted\" in the context of RRT procedures for use, and it is the RRT \u2014through the authority of the NCP \u2014that dictates where the use of dispersants and in burn agents are used. The commenter is referring to USEPA authorized chemical agents that are included in the NCP Product Schedule. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.2 4-4, para 4 The last sentence should read \"... in parts of all six geographic regions\" to reflect that the pre-authorization areas are more limited in coverage than currently implied in the statement. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The pre-authorization agreement areas are far greater in size (3 mi from shore out to 200 mi) than the nearshore case-by-case areas. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA 4.2.1 4.3.1 4-5, para 2 4-10, para 3 To make the statement that removal and treatment are used interchangeably is inaccurate and misleading. Dispersants do not effect treatment. The oil characteristics do no change. Dispersants break the oil into smaller droplets and add, according to this document, 20 percent more product. Removal, in contrast, effectively removes, at the conservative end, 15 percent of the product. Mechanical recovery does this in a way that the oil is recyclable. Burning, unlike dispersing, changes the chemical nature of oil by degrading it to heat, plus some heavy ends that do not bum (simplistically). To use these methods and modes of action interchangeably in the PEIS does not make it easier to compare response strategies, but takes away the very thing that must be compared. This is one of the many references to dilution as the outcome of dispersion. The implication that \"dilution is the solution to pollution\" does not help the scientific argument that the oil is either being \"removed\" or \"treated.\" This reference to dilution is used repeatedly and actually argues against the premise that the oil is being broken down and The Coast Guard notes these comments. The PEIS uses terminology regarding oil spill removal as defined and applied in the NCP (40 CFR 300 et seq. ). In these definitions, \"removal\" is used to describe physical removal and other actions taken to minimize the oils impact on the environment. The PEIS uses this term to be consistent with the CWA and the NCP. In the short term dispersants \"treat\" and \"dilute\" the oil to facilitate more rapid degradation in the environment, and ultimately through this more rapid degradation oil would be prevented from impacting natural resources. Ultimately the dispersant use meets the intent of the CWA and the NCP in that it does eventually remove the majority, if not all, the oil from the environment.

Munger Cook Inlet Citizens Regional Advisory Committee 4.4.2.2 4-79, footnote \"treated\" or \"removed.\" So, which is it \u2014treated, removed, or diluted? Calling the dispersant proc ess \"removal\" instead of \"treatment\" is a misconception. When oil is chemically treated with dispersants, the oil is dispersed into smaller droplets into the water column. The droplets are not completely removed from the environment. Dispersion may, at the limit, be considered a form of treatment, but it is not considered removal. The terms \"recovery\" and \"treatment\" are used interchangeably throughout the PEIS. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute 4.2.1.1 4-5 The text that states, \"Mechanical recovery is the gathering and spatial concentration of oil (by booming) and its physical removal (by skimming) from the water. IT is the only response option that removes oil from the marine environment and places in back under containment\" should be rewritten. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The PEIS as written satisfactorily addresses the operational elements of mechanical recovery. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute 4.2.1.2 4-6 Because text is over collegial and wordy, recommend rewriting 4.2.1.2. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment, which describes how dispersants are used, their operating limitations, and potential benefits. It was not our intent to discuss dispersants in these terms in this section, but rather to address only the potential impacts of dispersants and not dispersed oil, which is addressed in another section. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute 4.2.1.2 4-6 The text that states \"The potential environmental impacts of exposure to dispersants alone are much less significant than those from exposure to The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 24 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page dispersed oil, but are often a concern and need to be addressed\" should be rewritten. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.1 4-8, last para The Draft PEIS should clarify the language in this section to indicate that the oil dispersion in the 1996 NORTH CAPE incident is very similar to what would occur with a chemical dispersing agent. The material should also be added to the sections describing the impacts of dispersal in Section 4.2 and to the Executive Summary. The Coast Guard notes this comment. Physical dispersion of oil droplets during storms may significantly affect the magnitude of the impacts. During the 1996 NORTH CAPE oil spill, which occurred on the south coast of Rhode Island during a severe winter storm, most of the No. 2 fuel oil was immediately mixed into the water column by the heavy surf, resulting in high concentrations of PAHs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) in the shallow water for weeks after the spill (technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]; French McCay, 2003). Similar high concentrations of PAHs could occur if such a large amount of unweathered crude oil were chemically dispersed into a shallow and/or confined water body. This would not, however, be the situation in the pre-authorization areas agreement zones covered in the PEIS. As there is no discussion of the 1996 NORTH CAPE oil spill or of concentrations resulting from either natural or chemical dispersion in Section 4.2, no similar clarification is needed in that section. The Executive Summary does not discuss the 1996 NORTH CAPE oil spill or any other examples of oil spill dispersion into surface water. This level of detail is appropriately discussed within the body of the PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of 4-9, para 2 and para 3 PAHs are not the lower molecular weight but the higher molecular weight. The lower molecular weight hydrocarbons are soluble, toxic, and evaporate easily. Nowhere in the document is there a description of how these interact when dispersed. In general they break down rapidly. A small percentage (generally 1 - 5%) of PAHs remains after weathering, and bioremediation. They are toxic and are quite persistent. There is no indication that they break down any more quickly after dispersion than they do The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. There is no discussion on page 4-9 about PAHs breaking down more quickly with dispersion. However, the footnote on page 4-5 says, \"While the use of dispersants, which break an oil slick into small droplets that then disperse into the water column, renders further manual removal attempts infeasible, the use of dispersants increases the opportunity for the oil to undergo natural bioremediation.\" Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 25 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page in the environment without di spersion. Their toxicity at low levels is quite well documented. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.1 4-10, para 4 The water quality impacts will be reduced by the amount burned and by the amount that is soluble in the water column. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.1 4-13, para 4 The argument used here is an argument against the use of dispersants, or an indication that we do not have an accurate way to measure contaminants. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. There are accurate ways to measure water contamination after spills, and the duration of water quality im pairment in open coastal waters is at most on the order of weeks, not months to years. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-20 Crustaceans are not included in the analysis. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Crustaceans are included in the subtidal habitat discussions. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-20, para 2 The discussion should also consider the effects of dispersants on fur-bearing marine mammals, in addition to those already noted. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The environmental effects of dispersants without oil are discussed in Appendix G. The possible consequences to marine mammals are discussed on page G-2, paragraph 4. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-24, para 1 Distinct points that should have been explicitly stated and separated seem to have been clumped together here. One point centers on the fact that removing oil from the surface of the water and dispersing it throughout the water column is a worthwhile action to limit exposure from surface contact. The second important point is that dispersing a slick helps prevent it from coming into shore where mammals congregate. Each point deserves to be discussed. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-27, para 1 It is a mistake to assume that because a bird kill is not globally significant, that it has no effect. It is an argument that leads us to say that only rare species are important and worthy of respect. Some species are useful because for their abundance. The removal locally, although recoverable, may damage the food The Coast Guard notes this comment. Our intent was to summarize data on population and community-level effects documented from a major spill. We did not specifically refer to rare species or state that they are more important than local populations of more common species. Food chain Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 26 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page chain in a particular area. impacts were not a focus of this discussion. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-30 Addressing fish and plankton together is very disturbing as they have very different life cycles and food chain niches. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Plankton and fish are the groups of organisms that occupy the water column of coastal and marine environments. Thus, direct oil exposure for both groups is via hydrocarbon concentrations in the water. Indirect exposure may be through the marine food web common to both groups. The mechanisms of hydrocarbon toxicity are very similar in all aquatic biota. In addition, plankton includes fish eggs and larvae, so many species are included in both categories. For these reasons and the fact that the issues related to the poten tial impacts of dispersant use involve increases of hydrocarbon concentrations in the water that might affect plankton and fish, the Coast Guard has chosen to discuss potential impacts on these groups in the same subsections. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-31, para 2 BTEX is not low in toxicity. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) compounds are in fact much less toxic than the other soluble and semisoluble aromatics, the PAHs. The LC50s (lethal concentration to 50 percent of exposed organisms) for species of average sensitivity are about 3 mg/L for toluene and ethylbenzene, 9 mg/L for xylene, and 29 mg/L for benzene, as opposed to 2 mg/L for naphthalene and concentrations less than 1 mg/L for all other PAHs (see Section 2, Part A, of the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]). These levels are consistent with water-quality criteria developed by USEPA based on similar data sets. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-31, para 4 Exposure does not merely depend on resident time in the water column. Because of the stickiness of the oil, exposure can continue from short-term contact but long-term adherence. The Coast Guard notes this comment. While it is possible that filter-feeding plankton and fish could accumulate oil droplets on gills and feeding appendages, as discussed immediately following the indicated section (page 4-32, paragraph 1), long-term adherence of oil \u2014greater than for the days to weeks Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 27 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page discussed in that section \u2014on those structures has not been observed, nor is it likely as organisms have mechanisms to slough off fouling materials. Thus, discussion of long-term adherence was not added to the text. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-32, para 1 and para 2 The text states that \"this has not been documented, and no quantitative data are available to estimate the magnitude of this impact.\" The impact of dispersed oil has not been researched or there was no effect? The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. The impact of dispersed oil has been researched and it has been found that most toxic effects can be related to hydrocarbon components dissolved into the water from the dispersed oil droplets. Microscopic dispersed oil droplets could also have a direct impact on filter- feeders by mechanical interference or via dissolution of hydrocarbons from ingested droplets. While some studies have shown trophic transfer of oil hydrocarbons, and presumably these bioaccumulated hydrocarbons would have toxic effects at similar tissue concentrations to those documented for waterborne exposure, toxic effects on biota exposed by this ingestion pathway have not been documented or quantified. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-32, para 1 and para 2 The text states, \"Once weathered, the toxicity of the particulates would be negligible, and the effects would be more mechanical than toxic.\" Except for PAHs, which remain after weathering and are acutely toxic. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-32, para 1 and para 2 This section does not answer the question of ingestion toxicity, only bioaccumulation. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-32, para 4 The description of the pre-authorization agreement as those \"generally demarcated as waters in the United States great than 3 nm from shore\" exaggerates the area of pre-approval. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The PEIS does not exaggerate the pre-authorization agreement areas. Most coastal waters have pre- authorization agreement areas. When considering coastal states and the waters 3 mi from shore out to 200 mi, pre-authorization agreement areas encompass the majority of U.S. waters.

Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-33, para 1 If dispersed oil reaches filter-feeders, there is no indication it will disperse from there. It has no repelling properties. Even though dispersants may not be as toxic as oil, they may not be benign, depending on the species. Most dispersants have surfactants which may have an adverse mechanical effect (as does oil) as well as a level of toxicity. This is not well researched. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.2 4-34, para 4 This paragraph is only true for plentiful species. Certain species populations are small or isolated and may have trouble recovering. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. The paragraph addresses recovery rates for marine and planktonic organisms in general. We acknowledge that geographically restricted or rare species might require longer to recover and have modified the paragraph to reflect that fact. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.3 4-45, para 2 Although rare species are di fficult to assess, one can generalize that the population as a whole is more at risk due to the limited numbers and the pressure on the reproducing adults. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. Protected species, if affected, would be more at risk th an other, similar species. Indeed, the opening sentence of the paragraph indicates that such species are always a critical concern. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 4.3.4 NMFS recommends that the first paragraph of Section 4.3.4 reflect the designation of numerous rivers and streams as EFH for federally managed diadromous species. Insert the text in Proposed Language in Response to Comment 6 on page 6 of the NMFS comments into the appropriate section. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 4.3.4 Suggests rewriting paragraph 2 using the bullet points in Comment 7 on pages 6 and 7 of the NMFS comments. The Coast Guard notes this comment but believes the analysis in the Draft PEIS addresses both plankton and fish, and intertidal habitats in a clear and defined manner. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy 4.3.4 The inclusion of the following statement regarding The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 29 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 4.7.3.2 the relationship between the amount of oil spilled that is naturally dispersed and the potential adverse effects on EFH is important. NMFS in concerned that such a statement should only appear within the section addressing consequences to EFH in the Pacific. We recommend that the modeling results be moved to the general environmental consequences section (Section 4.3.4) sin ce this information does not appear to be regionally specific. \"The results in Section 4.7.3.2 of the modeling for plankton and fish and subtidal habitats are applicable to EFHs. There is often a direct relationship between the volume of oil spilled that is naturally dispersed into the water column and the potential for adverse effect on EFHs. As the volume of dispersed oil increases, the potential risk of toxic hydrocarbon components being present in the water column also increases. Potential adverse effects increase as spill volume increase, with greatest concern for severe weather conditions and increased oil dispersion. The addition of in situ burning does not remove enough oil to reduce the severity of potential adverse effects from those with mechanical-only recovery.\" Based on the results from the modeling (see the technical report [French McCay et al., 2004]) and the scientific literature review (see Section 4.3), potential regional adverse impacts to EFHs in the Pacific region under Alternative 3 are expected to be insignificant for small and medium spill sizes, with or without dispersant use, based on the risk to plankton and fish. For large spill sizes, impacts are expected to be insignificant, but increase to moderate with the addition of chemical dispersion. ( Comment 9 ) made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.5 4-49, para 3 Tar balls on the shoreline can be a persistent problem. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The statement in the Draft PEIS to which the comment refers is not intended to imply that no longer-term effects on the socioeconomic environment can be expected Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 30 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page following a spill, but to highlight that the most intense and significant effects will occur in the short to medium term (e.g., beach and fisheries closures, disrupted marine transportation, impacts on the quality of life of coastal residents). Thus, the discussion of socioeconomic impacts in the Draft PEIS focuses predominantly on short- to medium- term effects of oil spills. Clearly, the socioeconomic environment of shoreline areas can suffer from chro nic exposure to tar balls well after an oil spill event. The extent to which such chronic effects occur will be a function of a variety of factors, such as the characteristics of the product originally spilled, the characteristics of the shoreline (e.g., high- or low-energy settings), and the time since the spill. The presence of tar balls can diminish the amenity value of an area, impacting recreational use, tourism, and the general well-being of residents. Paragraph 1 on page 4-49 talks about the perception of taint; such taint effects can result from or be worsened by the chronic occurrence of tar balls. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.5 4-50, para 2 4-52, para 1 These paragraphs describe the effects of the oil spill, not the effects of the cleanup activities. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. While the noted paragraphs describe the effects of oil spills in general, not the effects of the various cleanup activities, they are part of the general discussion of the anticipated socioeconomic consequences of oil spills. Each resource discussion in this section begins with an overview description of the risk to the resource in the event of an oil spill\u2014 in this case, to the socioeconomic environment. The consequences of using each response option being considered are discussed, and each section concludes with a discussion of thresholds and recovery patterns. This approach is intended to provide the reader with an overview of the issues involved prior to the issues being assessed in subsequent sections. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen 4.3.5 4-54 Additional current for this section could be added The Coast Guard notes this comment. The ATHOS Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 31 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page USEPA Office of Emergency Management from the impacts of the ATHOS I Oil Spill on the Delaware River and Bay. I incident occurred after the release of the Draft PEIS release. Economic costs of oils spills are well known and documented. The highest potential costs occur in nearshore and port environments where marine transportation and human use is the highest. It should also be noted that the ATHOS I was not an offshore spill and that the impacts occurred because of the spill location in the very upper Delaware Estuary. These impacts would not be expected from an offshore spill in the area of concern. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.5 4-62, para 1 In previous USEPA comments on Part A of the technical report (French McCay et. al., 2004), reviewers recommended that the Coast Guard conduct additional model runs that simulate conditions that better reflect fate and transport of dispersants and other response efforts in sensitive and nearshore environments. This was not included in the model analysis. Fate and transport of oil and dispersants could likely occur in nearshore areas. A nearshore scenario would offer a good comparison for situations where important resources could be affected such as subsistence areas, water intakes, and endangered and threatened species reside. The current model focuses on likelihood of a spill rather than the environmental harm. Only high-traffic shipping areas were selected as the model locations instead of the numerous sensitive areas that may be within one of the six regions in the PEIS. USEPA had recommended modeling an area that was a sensitive area such as a worst case environmental scenario area. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The PEIS scope is focused on the NPRM applicability, which does not include nearshore sensitive environments. In a worst case scenario a mix of response options would be employed in light of the fact that the spill response would last over many days. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.3.5 4-62 para 1 It is unclear what is meant by the terminology \"hauled out.\" The Coast Guard notes this comment. Shoreline areas used by marine mammals are referred to as \"haulout areas\" (see Chapter 7, Glossary, for a definition). This is based on the visual appearance of many species when they come out of the water, literally dragging or hauling themselves up on the Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 32 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page shore. The act of being in one of these areas leads to the term \"hauled out.\" 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen 4.3.5 4-69, para 1 USCG should clarify the context of the statement. Environmental justice is defined as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, or national origin, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of laws, regulations, and policies. The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. Overall, we would not expect enhanced use of mechanical recovery, or other recovery technologies, to significantly improve environmental justice. Environmental justice is defined as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of laws, regulations and policies. As noted in the section the commenter refers to, Executive Order 12898 (p. 1) states that \"each Federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.\" Especially relevant to this Draft PEIS, This Executive Order also identifies subsistence users of fish and wildlife as communities of concern. Oil spills do not impact poor and minority communities disproportionately to the general population. Exceptions to this include Native American and other subsistence groups who depend more on coastal and marine resources than average Americans, and possibly some ethnic groups who depend on commercial fishing (as described in the noted section). For example, oil spills do not tend to occur in poorer or minority areas any more than other areas; thus, reducing the impacts of oil spills would not be expected to significantly enhance the level of environmental justice. The noted section is specific to income and employment, so environmental justice would be impacted in similar ways to overall income and employment. Note that Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 33 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page there are no published or gray literature analyses to call on in drafting this section or in responding to this question. The statement to which the commenter refers is meant to communicate that mechanical recovery of oil following a spill would be expected to effect environmental justice in similar ways to the effect of this recovery technology has on general levels of employment and income in coastal communities (as discussed in detail in the preceding sections). The effects of oil spills can be direct, such as a loss of recreational and commercial fishing opportunities in the spill area, as well as indi rect, involving changes in employment opportunities and income following a spill. To the extent that mechanical recovery of oil lessens the impact of spilled oil on regional employment and income, it will also lessen such impacts of oil spills on low income and minority groups. Similarly, to the extent that oil recovery activities generate employment and income possibilities, low income and minority groups may find new employment and income opportunities. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office 4-71, para 1 4-72, para 3 Although we are not disputing the value of models to inform the understanding of physical processes, it is misleading to presume that modeling is free from imprecision and subjective judgments. Modeling can only be as complete as the underlying science, model capabilities, selection of model parameters and input values, and other decisions allow. It is a fallacy to believe that modeling is \"objective,\" when it is subject to many limitations and subjective assumptions and choices. To cite one example, situating the release at 7.5 nm offshore rather than at the near edge of a 3 nm offshore area is a highly subjective judgment that may have a large impact on the model results for coast al resources. Implying that modeling is objective misrepresents the basis and The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The text states the reasons we have chosen to use modeling to provide quantitative estimates of impacts. The use of models to help quantify impacts is a common tool in NEPA analysis, and is often used as the basis for regu latory actions of all sorts. Additional detail on the modeling approach is available in Part A of the technical report (French McKay et al., 2004), where all input parameters and assumptions are described in considerable detail. We acknowledge that modeling results are influenced by the assumptions used in the model and uncertainties associated with the assumptions are reflected in the results. However, with a documented and tested model such as SIMAP, and with a clear description Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 34 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page limitations of modeling. Additionally, it is not necessarily easier to understand the analysis, solely because a model has been used to produce the results. In fact, critical evaluation of model results may be complicated by the myriad of assumptions and choices made in the modeling. Results presented as being invariable do not provide an adequate scientific basis for decision making. Based on the statements cited above, one may be misled to believe that modeling has no limitations. Since this is not the case, we recommend omitting these statements, and including a clear discussion of the basis of the modeling and its key assump tions, limitations, and uncertainties. of the model algorithms and inputs (which are based on analysis of scientific studies, as presented in the technical report), these assumptions are at least defined and have been shown to provide results in agreement with observations. In contrast, when purely qualitative analysis is relied on, the lack of quantitative information leads the decisionmaker to make subjective judgments based on personal experience, personal knowledge and, unfortunately in some cases, preconceived notions of what the potential impacts would be for various scenarios. The quantification of results based on stated assumptions\u2014a model \u2014is an objective scientific tool that may be used to inform the analyst. This was the approach used by the Coast Guard in developing the PEIS. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office 4.4.2.2 4-72, para 1 and para 3 Usually models that have presumed predictive capability require calibration to actual data so that they are minimally verified to reproduce observations. Prior to calibration, predictive capability cannot be scientifically confirmed. The SIMAP model predictions for oil spill and response impacts have not been calibrated for all of their outputs due to lack of data and lack of knowledge of all effects. The evaluation of uncertainty is critical in determining how the model results may vary, given uncertainties in model inputs. We recommend that there is a clear acknowledgement of which results of the model are uncalibrated, calibrated, or extrapolated from the calibrated model results predict unknown conditions. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. The modeling approach was not to calibrate model results to observational data, as sufficient observations and measurements of dispersed oil fates and impacts do not exist (nor are they likely to exist in the foreseeable future). Rather, the modeling approach was to synthesize scientific understanding of mechanisms and rates of processes into a coherent set of equations that may be used to compute a set of outcomes that follow from that understanding. Many of the algorithms of specific processes that compose the model were calibrated to measurement data in experimental and field situations. These analyses are available in Part A of the technical report (French McKay et al., 2004) and the cited references therein. However, the whole model system is not calibrated as, for example, one might do with a hydrodynamic model application applied to flows in a specific water body where some current measurements are available. We were mindful of these uncertainties in Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 35 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page performing the analysis, and drew conclusions based on the generalities that would apply to broader areas and other conditions than the specific ones modeled. For example, the volume of water contaminated by oil hydrocarbons, and where plankton might be impacted, would be similar in many offshore locations given the same spill volume, currents, and weather conditions (which influences evaporative loss rate and entrainment into the water of the toxic and soluble lower molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons). In addition, the spreading and area swept by floating oil would be similar under these same circumstances. Thus, model results for one spill volume and offshore location are representative of what would occur in many other offshore locations, because those model results statistically describe the range of weather conditions that could occur. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.4.2.1 4-72 Recommends that the document clearly state which parts of the model were shown to reproduce field behavior and which have been shown to have predictive capability. The Coast Guard notes this comment. This information is available in Section 2, Part A, of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and references cited therein. The term \"validation\" refers to comparisons of model results to observational data not used to develop or calibrate the model. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Management para 3 4-76 last para The stochastic model (previously referred to as probabilistic) is limited because the parameters that are varied are only those listed: essentially the spill date/time, which is then used to select sequences of historical data on wind speed and direction. These are then used as the forcing functions that drive the simulations. The values of other model parameters are held constant. Parameters that might also be varied are the location of the spill, rate of release, dispersion coefficient and others. There may be many other physical and biological model parameters that are based on a variety of assumptions and/or limited data. These too could be included in a fully stochastic analysis, which would then support the The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS, as noted above. It should be noted that the objective of the modeling was not to statistically describe the un iverse of possible results for all possible permutations of model inputs and assumptions; rather it was to examine a manageable but sufficient set of representative spill volumes, locations, and scenarios to provide quantitative estimates of impacts that could be compared among the alternatives and inform the analysis of risks. Additional clarification of the purpose of the modeling has been added to the indicated section. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 36 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page presumption that the model results were unbiased. We recommend that the nature of the stochastic model be described in greater detail and that the discussion include an estimate of the uncertainty due to other model parameters. Without a fuller characterization of the model uncertainty, the SIMAP results used in the risk assessment may underestimate the variability of the modeled system. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.4.2.2 4-77 last para We recommend removing this material and reviewing the PEIS and background document to avoid overstating model capability. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The purpose of the paragraph is to explain how the model results, while not representative of every situation, may be used to examine generalities about spill impacts that apply more broadly than the specific modeled scenario. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.4.2.2 4-78, para 2 Recommends providing simulation results that demonstrate that the environmental impacts of the oil spill and treatment alterna tives are insensitive to the release location. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The simulation is not a WCD as defined in 33 CFR 154 and 155, but rather a situation that allowed the model scenarios as close to sh ore as possible, but still allowed dispersant use. Any closer would be questionable in terms of a clear pre-authorization scenario. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.4.2.2 4-78, para 3 Any release occurs over a given duration. A broad distinction can be made between catastrophic and chronic releases. A worst-case discharge is implied by the citation in this section, but the statement does not discuss the assumed incident duration. We recommend that the type of release and its duration be described and justified. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment because a WCD is not implied by this statement. We are not required to look at WCD under NEPA. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.4.2.2 4-80 Weather conditions or the time of the spill relative to daylight may limit the app lication of dispersant. We recommend that the analysis (including supporting model simulations) include cases where dispersant conditions are not so ideal. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment, which appears to refer to the first paragraph on page 4-80 (and perhaps others) describing the inputs used in the simulation of disper sant application. We do not agree with the comment that the model should look at cases where dispersant conditions are not so ideal. The modeling was performed assuming dispersants Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 37 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page would be used at their capacities and effectively, within logistical limits, to estimate a maximum potential effect of dispersant use. The limits placed on dispersant application in the modeling effort are based on realistic limits derived from operational experience \u2014daylight hours, in an approved zone, on oil of suitable thickness, and within acceptable operational limits with respect to weather. These factors would be key considerations at an actual spill, and are totally appropriate for the modeling effort. Additional detail as to the specific input parameters summarized in the section under discussion are provided in Section A.3.7 of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). If dispersant use were modeled with lower effectiveness and/or less ideal conditions than were assumed in the modeling, the differences between the mechanical-only and the with-dispersant model results would be less than those reported in the technical report. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.4.3 4-84, Figure 4.4-2 There seems to be no scientific basis for the numbers included in the risk matrix on population damage and impact. In the only case that is directly comparable to this study (San Francisco), the Environmental Risk Assessment was conducted with input from subject matter experts and indicated much higher population impacts (60 percent). The highest impact indicated in the Draft PEIS matrices is 20 percent, but there is no discussion of the basis of that impact. Are the impacts for the entire area (Atlantic Ocean)? The values should be qualified to clearly indicate what they are based on. The Coast Guard notes this comment and has revised the Final PEIS. The arbitrary nature of the designations is discussed in the Draft PEIS, which states that the squares to be included in the \"high\" and \"low\" areas of concern were based \"on a consensus.\" 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Management 4.5.2.1 4-96, para 1 Natural dispersion would depend on the water and air temperature, as well as wave action. The PEIS doesn't state at what water and air temperatures that dispersant use cannot occur. There is no discussion of how cold water and temperatures will affect dispersant application and in situ burning. For The Coast Guard notes these comments. In the modeling of hypothetical spills in Prince William Sound, the same assumptions were made as for other locations with respect to dispersant use and in situ burning. The focus was not, for example, how effective dispersants might be, but rather, assuming Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 38 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page 7833-107 (transcript) Tony Parkin Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council example, Price William Sound is used to represent Alaska; however, its cold water and possible ice could change the chemical and physical conditions o f oil before dispersant application and could alter the efficacy of the dispersant. Currently, multiple studies are being developed by the USEPA, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Minerals Management Service (MMS) to analyze and monitor the effects of cold weather conditions on dispersant application. Does not seem to adequately address the issue that are specific and unique to Alaska and omits or ignores fundamental physical and operating conditions such as the extreme of maximum and minimum daylight and the cold, ice-infested waters that dispersants are effectively used and that oil is dispersed with high efficiency (i.e., 45 percent or 80 percent), what are the potential impacts that could be expected? If dispersant is applied with lower efficiency than 45 percent, as might occur in limited daylight and very cold conditions, the expected impacts would be between the results for the 45 percent dispersant scenario and the mechanical-only scenario. Thus, the analysis is essentially a worst-case comparison of high dispersant efficiency versus no dispersant use, assuming the modeled scenarios and conditions. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.5.2.5 4-116, para 1 For the purposes of this PEIS, note that Pennsylvania is not part of the Atlantic coastline and would not be an affected area in the six regions covered by the PEIS. The Coast Guard notes this comment. Pennsylvania is included the Atlantic region of the PEIS because several counties in Pennsylvania are classified as coastal counties per the Office of Ocean Resources, Conservation and Assessment (ORCA), National Ocean Service (NOS), NOAA. Furthermore, there are pre-authorization agreement areas in the Delaware River (i.e., Big Stone Acreage). 7833-113 Susan A.

NMFS recommends that the following proposed language be inserted into the appropriate sections in replace of the current language: The emphasis on estuaries has been removed from the proposed language since it seems arbitrary to focus on one habitat type when EFH addresses any habitat essential for Fishery Management Plan (FMP) species for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. NMFS also recommends that references to the The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested changes in the Final PEIS.

The Coast Guard agrees with this comment and has made the suggested change in the Final PEIS. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory 4.5.6.1 4-241 In discussing water-quality impacts, states \"Chemical dispersion for medium or large spills increases the volume of water contaminated, but would not change the overall level of concern.\" This seems subjective. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The referenced section is a relative one in that it relates to the concentration of oil in different dimensions. On the water surface, the oil concentration would be very high but would affect a smaller overall water volume, as opposed to a dispersed oil plume with lower concentrations but with higher volumes of water being affected. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.7.3 4-346, Table 4.7-13 How were multiple threatened and endangered species and critical habitats modeled to generate the risk matrix numbers in the PEIS? Only sea turtles are shown in this table with the following footnote: \"Risk to threatened and endangered or candidate species are derived from scores of the marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, fish, and sea turtles. If such species are affected by an actual spill, the level of concern would be high.\" How was the spatial distribution of an endangered, threatened, sensitive, critical habitat species represented in the risk matrix modeling? It is not clear how the threatened, endangered species and critical habitats were analyzed in the dynamics of the model, especially for the uneven di stribution of endangered species throughout an ecosystem. The Coast Guard notes this comment. As discussed in the appropriate sections, the risk to protected species is assumed to be equivalent to the highest risk for either marine mammals, marine or coastal birds, fish, or sea turtles. The risk to EFH is assumed to be equivalent to the higher risk for either plankton and fish or subtidal habitats, and the risk to areas of special concern is assumed to be equivalent to the higher of the risk to intertidal habitat or subtidal habitat. Obviously, any given spill could threaten a specific resource, depending on the location. In this case, however, for a programmatic, regional analysis, our assumptions offer a re asonable expectation of the risk. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.7.3 4-346, Table 4.7-13 Although examples of plants like submerged grass beds, coral, and kelp forests were mentioned in Affected Environment sections of the PEIS, the Environmental Consequences section does not mention how or if they were modeled and ranked within the PEIS risk matr ix ranking. These plants could be considered critical habitats and essential The Coast Guard notes this comment. The analysis is based on habitat types rather than individual species, and each discussion indicates the most sensitive and/or important resource groups likely to be found in that habitat in a particu lar region. All groups listed in the comment are discussed in the section on subtidal habitats for the appropriate geographic Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 40 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page feeding grounds for many species. region. For example, kelp forests are only an issue on the Pacific coast and Alaska , while coral is only an issue in the Caribbean, Oceania, and a small area of the Atlantic. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.7.5.2 4-426, para 3 What is the basis for this statement? There is no reference cited. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The basis for the indicated statement is developed in Sections 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.2.3, with sp ecific analysis and citations available in Section 2, Part A, of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). 7833-99 Robert E. Duncan South Carolina Department of Natural Resources 4.10.1.3- 4.10.1.4 4-455- 4-458 Net present value (NPV) total national cost for Alternatives 3 and 4 should be recalculated to reflect the fact that the Draft PEIS no longer applies to inland or inshore areas. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. A final decision on the NPRM has not been made. These calculations must remain for comparative analysis. 7833-113 Susan A. Kennedy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 4.10.3.2 The Draft PEIS concludes in this section that a net adverse impact occurs on EFH under Alternatives 3, 4, or 5 (which would ensure the uniform availability of dispersant capability in each region) in the Pacific region for large oil spills. Th e Draft PEIS also states in the same section that \"Under any of the alternatives, potential adverse impacts from an oil spill are expected to be insignificant to moderate for subtidal habitats, plankton and fish, and essential fish habitats.\" NMFS would like to remind the Coast Guard that any potential adverse impacts on EFH that are above the insignificant threshold \u2014in this case minimal, moderate, or significant impact determinations by the risk matrix \u2014will require an EFH consultation. An EFH consultation with NMFS should occur in the planning, response, and/or post-spill response st ages to ensure that adverse impacts to EFH are avoided, minimized, or mitigated to the extent practicable. ( Comment 5 ) The Coast Guard notes this comment. Dispersant pre-authorization agreements have been developed in consultation with the appropriate resource trustees and agencies. Therefore, the Coast Guard will continue to consult in pre-planning, response, and/or post-response stages to ensure that adverse impacts will be avoided, minimized, or mitigated to the extent practicable. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council 4.14 Section 4.14 discusses cumu lative impacts of the proposed rule....The analysis does not consider the cumulative toxicity impacts of increased use of dispersants in U.S. waters. While the PEIS repeatedly The Coast Guard notes this comment. Dispersant pre- authorization agreement area s and dispersant capability already exists within the United States. The rulemaking will only ensure that a more effective dispersant Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 41 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page asserts the spill response decisionmaking (UC and RRT approvals) will occur on a case-by-case basis and that the preferred alternative is not intended to promote dispersant use, the fact that the Coast Guard is proposing to replace the scheduled 25 percent increase in mechanical response capability with a requirement to increase dispersant capability results in a de facto endorsement of increased dispersant use. In practical terms, this means it will be more likely that dispersants will be used in pre-approval areas at the very least, in years to come. The PEIS should consider cumulative toxicity impacts from increased levels of dispersants and dispersed oil in the marine environment over time, including sublethal impacts and the potential for increased cumulative toxicity through bioaccumulation or photo-enhancement. response capability exists. Having an improved capability does not necessarily equate to greater use. The number of dispersible offshore oil spills is minuscule when compared to nearshore and bay spills (as outlined in the PEIS); therefore, tryi ng to accurately predict the potential \"cumulative toxicity impacts\" would be very difficult if not impossible to accurately predict. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management 4.14.1 4-466, para 2 The reference to \"pollution absorption\" is unclear. Isn't the purpose of the oil recovery or treatment methods to prevent pollution from affecting marine and coastal resources? These areas can be considered depositional areas for dispersed oil transported by marine currents. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment, which asks for clarification to the reference to \"pollution absorption.\" The term pollutant absorption is being used in proper context. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Chapter 4 Chapter 4 states that m echanical recovery (and in situ burning) offers \"limited protection to physical, biological, and socioeconomic resources when compared with a hypothetical natural removal response option (no cleanup action).\" The report all but dismisses mechanical recovery, which is supposed to be the cornerstone of our national spill response policy, as only marginally better than leaving the oil to naturally weather and disperse. PWSRCAC recommends that this incorrect and biased statement be removed from the document. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Mechanical recovery remains our primary oil spill removal method since most spills occur in nearshore and protected waters. In the open-ocean environment, mechanical recovery has significant operating limitations. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Chapter 4 The model does not consider a WCD in adverse weather, which is the planning standard established in OPA 90 as the planning standard for the oil spill responses. The 40,000-bbl large spill size is considerably smaller than the 300,000-bbl planning standard in The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. WCD planning has been completed. The intent of the regulation is not to provide dispersant capability for a WCD, but rather to ensure this capability exists to compliment mechanical recovery. The Coast Guard Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 42 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page Alaska. PWSRCAC recommends that the PEIS analysis for the Alaska region be based on a minimum spill size of 300,000 bbl to provide a meaningful assessment of the environmental impact of the five alternatives proposed under the 2003 equipment cap rulemaking. feels strongly that current levels of mechanical recovery are sufficient, as was proven out in the nation's response to the numerous oil and hazardous material releases brought on by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Dispersants provide the response community with a viable option when dealing with a spill that can not be effectively mitigated by mechanical-only recovery. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Chapter 4 Appendix D The dispersant efficiencies \u201445 and 80 percent \u2014are not realistic for the PWS/Alaska region. Appendix D states that these numbers reflect test results from Texas and California; however, they are not valid for dispersion of ANS crud in sub-Arctic conditions. PWSRCAC recommends that the Alaska region models be run based on realistic dispersant effectiveness estimates for the prevailing conditions in Prince William Sound. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Cold- water dispersant testing in meso- and field-scale applications has proven to be effective, often exceeding the 80 percent rate used in the analysis in the PEIS. 7833-97 7833-98 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Michael L. Munger Cook Inlet Citizens Regional Advisory Committee Chapter 4 The model assumes that dissipation (through evaporation and natural dispersion) occurs outside the model and that emulsion take s place inside the model. Natural dispersion is not an instantaneous process, yet the model removes the dispersed oil volume up front. It should be removed gradually at a rate of about 1 percent per hour. The oil that evaporates and naturally disperses is the same oil that most efficiently burns and chemically disperses. Yet, the model removes this oil at the onset of the spill and then still presumes that chemical dispersion and burning will occur at their highest efficiencies. We believe that this assumption overestimates the total amou nt of oil removed under the dispersant model outputs. The Coast Guard notes this comment. Please see Part A of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004), which explains the model's underlying physical fate algorithms in some detail. Also \u2014and as stated in the PEIS \u2014the dispersant efficiency rates used for modeling dispersed oil were chosen to reflect what would be considered effective and ineffective dispersant applications. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Chapter 4 The biological exposure and effects model does not account for sublethal impacts, which may result in an underestimation of the biological effects of dispersant use. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The model does consider some sublethal effects, such as reduction of growth rate of plankton, which is nominal. As the exposure would be short, other sublethal effects would be small or negligible. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Chapter 4 PWSRCAC has concerns regarding the way that the percentage of resources potentially affected is calculated for PWS. The analysis considers the impacts to each The Coast Guard notes this comment. The modeling parameters were based on bio-geographic provinces to facilitate regional comparisons of risk and impacts. In a Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 43 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page resource and then considers that impact in the context of the entire PWS ecosystem. We are concerned that this level of meso-scale analysis leads to an artificial underestimating of certain types of impacts, because it discounts any negative impacts that occur within a confined geographic area or over a short period of time. regional analysis it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to examine all potential impacts to specific communities and/or individual species. For example, if a spill were to occur next to a seal rookery there would be some types of impacts to the seal population. If the spill occurred away from the rookery there would little to no impact. The question then becomes, how do you model the potential impacts to specific species within Prince William Sound, taking into account the myriad of diverse and geographically diffused species? No model can accurately predict impacts on specific species when conducting regional analysis. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 4 The PEIS makes frequent comparisons between modeled events and sever al rare, large spills; the effects reported from these large spill examples would not be expected from smaller, offshore oil spills of crude oil like those modeled for the PEIS. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The discussion uses information on historic spills when it can help clarify a point being made. Often this may involve large spills simply because they are the best studied. The comparison of the impacts for the three spill sizes \u2014200 bbl, 2,500 bbl, and 40,000 bbl \u2014 clearly indicates that small, and often moderate, spills that occur offshore often have little or no environmental impact on most resources. We acknowledge the point that the impacts from very large spills are not representative of the majority of oil spills. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 4 Suggests adding the resu lts of populations and community studies of oil spill impacts on water- column plankton that have been conducted in controlled test systems and as monitoring programs following actual spills into the text to demonstrate the rapid recovery of planktonic populations. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment and believes that the text adequately addresses the rapid recovery of planktonic populations. Section 4.3.2.3 addresses the recovery rates of plankton populations, and concludes that populations recover relative to their life span: For plankton, this is days to (conservatively) months. Further, and especially for plankton, the discussion points out that \"If the impact were very small, the changes in the population would not be mea surable or significant within natural variability by location and over time.\" This consideration appears to be the critical parameter in evaluating planktonic impacts, as it is unlikely for a spill, even a large one, to affect areas Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 44 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page large enough to be measurable given the large natural variation. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 4 Although the modeling approach is useful for comparative purposes, recommends that the text should point out that SIMAP toxicity assessments from environmental releases are theoretical model outputs which are likely to overestimate toxic impacts because of inaccurate input assumptions. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The toxicity model in SIMAP is documented in detail in Section 2, Part A, of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and French McCay (2002) cited therein. In French McCay (2002), bioassay data for individual aromatic hydrocarbons, including higher Kow PAHs, were used to develop the empirical toxicity relationship. (The octanol-wat er partition coefficient, or Kow, is the ratio of the concentration of a chemical in octanol and in water at equilibrium and at a specified temperature. Octanol is an organic solvent that is used as a surrogate for natural organic matter. This parameter is used in many environmental studies to help determine the fate of chemicals in the environment. An example would be using the coefficient to predict the extent that a contaminant will bioaccumulate in fish.) Moreover, the oil toxicity model \u2014based on the summed toxicity of each component aromatic hydrocarbon in oil-derived exposure mixtures \u2014was validated with 24 data sets of oil bioa ssays involving 291 species. Thus, the SIMAP toxicity model does not overestimate the toxic potential of higher Kow PAHs. The modeling is for short-term exposures of up to 14 days. Changes in bioavailability of sediment-sorbed PAHs do not occur on that time scale (or less, as the PAHs do not accumulate in sediments immediately after a spill). Thus, disclaimers as suggested are not needed. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 4 Recommends that the Coast Guard revise the PEIS to include greater use of cautionary statements. Although model results are useful for comparative purposes, impacts of actual incidents are likely to be much less than those characterized in the model due to the conservative nature of the approaches taken. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The impacts of actual incidents to plankton and fish are likely to be much less than those characterized in the modeling analysis because of the conservative assumption that all exposed aquatic biota would be as sensitive to dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons as Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 45 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page The reader should also be made aware that effects of most spills will be far less than in the several atypically large events discussed. the most sensitive species (i.e., toxicity inputs were set at the 2.5th percentile result for the range of species sensitivities tested). This conservative assumption was made because of concerns that water-column biota would be adversely affected by dispersant use, such that these resources would be protected in the risk analysis. The toxicity model and assumptions are described in Sections 2 and 3, respectively, Part A, of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 4 Toxicity data used by the Coast Guard in assessing the potential environmental impacts on aquatic life associated from the modeled oil spills are based on laboratory studies that tend to test the more sensitive species and the more sensitive life stages, and represent the worst-case assumptions regarding the potential for mortality. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The model inputs include the conservative assumption that all exposed aquatic biota would be as sensitive to dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons as the most sensitive species potentially exposed (i.e., toxicity inputs were set at the 2.5th percentile result for the range of species sensitivities tested). Aquatic organisms that have been tested include many insensitive, as well as average and sensitive, species. The conservative assumption was made because of concerns that water-column biota would be adversely affected by dispersant use, such that these resources would be protected in the risk analysis. The SIMAP toxicity model also corrects for the duration of exposure. The often short durations experienced after a spill, which are modeled, do not result in equilibrium being reached between the biota and the surrounding water column, such that the model-estimated toxic response is less than it would be for longer exposures. Thus, the toxicity assumptions are not worst case, but are conservatively protective. The toxicity model and assumptions are described in Sections 2 and 3, respectively, Part A of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) and in French McCay (2002) cited therein. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 4 The text should acknowledge that the SIMAP model's toxicity assessments from environmental The Coast Guard notes this comment. The wildlife impact modeling analysis did assume that animal Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 46 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page releases are likely to overestimate toxic impacts on wildlife, based on the cons ervative assumptions built into the model. density is evenly distribute d within habitats occupied by the species within the area oiled by the spill. The assumption of an even distri bution in the oil-affected area is a conservative estimate of mortality to the extent that wildlife distri butions are uneven and the oil misses some distributions. However, in cases where high densities of animals are concentrated within the path of the oil, impacts are underestimated. These potential biases were considered in the analysis of model results and estimation of risk. The wildlife impact model calculation was based on the area swept by enough oil to provide a lethal dose multiplied by the probability of an animal intersecting the oil on the water surface, which is less than 100 percent in all cases (for example, 35 percent for aerial diving birds and 5 percent for aerial seabirds). The equivalent area of 100 percent mortality summarizes these model outputs as a weighted sum of area multiplied by percentage loss in that area. Thus, it is not assumed that if one animal is oiled to a minimum extent, 100 percent mortality in the area occurs. The wildlife impact model and assumptions are described in Section 2, Part A, of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). The calculation of equivalent area of 100 percent mortality is explained in the introduction to Sections B-II. 5, C-II.5, D-II.5, E-II.5, and F-II.5, where the wildlife model results are reported. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Chapter 4 The model used as the basis for much of the Draft PEIS embeds judgment, not least in assuming constant values for stochastic parameters. The results therefore deserve to be interpreted with a degree of caution. The Coast Guard notes this comment. We admit that the modeling results deserve to be interpreted with a degree of caution and state so in the document. Since it is impossible to fully capture the complexity of field conditions, professional judgment was used to select the values and variability of input parameters. Because these judgments were made on model inputs and assumptions based on scientific measurements Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 47 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page and analysis, there is less subjective bias in the model results than judgments that might have been made regarding what impacts might occur without the basis of the quantitative assessment that the modeling provides. Nevertheless, in view of the uncertainties and the limited scope of the modeling, the model results were used to make generalized conclusions that were applied broadly. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute Chapter 4 Recommends that the Coast Guard review the data presented in tables, figures, and text and modify them to represent a realistic assessment of significant figures. The Coast Guard notes this comment and agrees that the statistical significance and certainty surrounding the modeling results are less than might be inferred by listings of data to more than two to three significant figures. However, standardized formatting of model outputs that allowe d for ranges of results spanning several orders of magnitude lead to some data containing more than three significant digits. Standardization of the number of decimal places in a single table was also used to simplify visual scanning of the results. No inference is intended as to certainty of those results. Notes and statements to this effect are included in Parts B through F of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004). 7833-111 Ben Johnson Makah Tribal Council Chapter 4 The matrix analysis used by the Coast Guard and this Draft PEIS does not incorporate the effects of each response option over multiple times of the year in multiple locations. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The risk matrix was used to evaluate the mean and 50th percentile results of 100 randomized modeling runs, based on historical weather and hydrographic conditions, which incorporat es seasonality. There are an infinite number of locations that could have been modeled for a programmatic analysis, and the basis for our selection of specific sites was described in detail in Modeled Scenarios in Section 4.4.2.2. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Chapter 4 The USCG Draft PEIS is more similar to a benefits analysis, than an environmental impact statement or environmental risk assessment. Model does not address the range of situations where dispersants may be used. The model does not address the impacts under the best and worst-case The Coast Guard notes this comment. While we do not believe that the analytical approach selected represents a benefits analysis, it is a form of risk- benefits analysis, in that the various response options selectively influence different habitats, and so the risks to one must be balanced against the benefits to Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 48 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page scenarios, or those that may be observed in sensitive and nearshore areas where dispersants may be used or transported. another.

There is always residue, especially in rough seas where aromatic compounds can become entrained in the water column under the action of waves.

The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The document referenced in the comment is a nearshore shoreline in situ burn guide and checklist. It does not specify any in situ burn pre-authorization agreements. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management D.4 D-24 There is no real data to support this assumption since it is based solely on small spills. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. Dispersant effectiveness rates are well documented in USEPA, industry, and OHMSETT (Oil and Hazardous Materials Simulated Environmental Test Tank) test reports, as well as in actual oil spills. Effectiveness rates vary considerably. The 80 percent rate is considered a conservative valuation for a successful dispersion application. The 45 percent rate is considered lower than what would be expected in the application time frames noted in the tables. 7833-100 Robin Rorick American Petroleum Institute D.4 D-24 Text states that the 45 percent efficiency is touted have scientific merit by stating it is \"based on minimum effectiveness criteria established in the National Oil and Hazardous Substance Contingency Plan.\" We recommend revising the text. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment. The rates chosen are a best estimate considering many variables. The rates are assumptions based on historical results and lab tests. The intent for Appendix D is to provide a comparative analysis in hypothetical spill scenarios using planning criteria that would be specified in the regulation. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Appendix D The model utilizes a range of effectiveness for dispersants, but only a single value for mechanical recovery. The central question of the Caps review is supposed to be whether or not to increase mechanical The Coast Guard notes this comment; however, to provide this answer, the model would have to be run again. The Coast Guard feels this is unnecessary as the mechanical recovery rate used is considered to be higher Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 49 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page recovery capabilities by 25 percent. Appendix D to the PEIS shows that the amount of oil remaining on the water surface at the end of the large mechanical-only response would be 14,519 bbl, compared to 13,098 bbl for dispersants at 45 percent effectiveness \u2014a 1,400-bbl difference. If the mechanical recovery rate was increased slightly, how much would this gap close? then what we would normally expect, particularly in the operating environment of Prince William Sound. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Appendix G The placement of this appendix seems curious given the importance of the issue to the PEIS. This issue should have been included within the main body of the PEIS document under environmental impacts from chemical dispersant use without oil being present. The Coast Guard notes this comment and agrees that understanding chemical dispersion's impacts on the environment are important. Since the use of dispersants will occur only during an oil spill, chemical dispersion is addressed in the PEIS, just not in the context of the alternatives. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Appendix G The following quote from Part A of the technical report (French McCay et al., 2004) should have been further addressed in the body of the PEIS report: \"The dispersant application adds more contamination to the water\" (page 56, para 5). It is also important to add that the use of a dispersant in U.S. waters without the approval of the FOSC is a violation of the CWA. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The negative consequences associated with dispersants are addressed in the PEIS. The PEIS references the various dispersant use policies, all of which are governed by the NCP and the CWA legislation. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Appendix G In the PEIS document, Corexit \u00ae products were used as the only example of a dispersant. Though it is stockpiled in areas of the United States, there are currently a total of 13 different dispersants on the NCP Product Schedule that have varying ranges of toxicity and effectiveness. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The rationale for using Corexit products throughout the PEIS is the majority of oil transported in the United States can be treated by Corexit. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Appendix G G-2, para 4 and para 5 Life stages of species were not fully examined in the PEIS document. According to Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) available from dispersant manufacturers, the risks can include inhalation hazards, dermal and internal tissue toxicity risks, and general absorption risks through mucus membranes. These are risks that could cause acute and/or chronic effects to species that are exposed to the dispersant alone. The Coast Guard notes this comment. The PEIS could not examine all species (and their life stages) throughout all U.S. waters. The PEIS and rulemaking reference and rely on the analysis conducted by the RRTs and applicable natural resource trustees. Because of the nature of th e rulemaking (national in scope, affecting most coastal areas) the PEIS had to examine the potential impacts of the response options being considered in the rulemaking. Biological impacts are addressed in Chapter 4 by Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 50 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page major species groupings. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Appendix G G-2, para 4 and para 5 The probability of a dispersant affecting water quality seems highly likely the longer the response time . . . . The longer the oil slick is floating on the water, the more likely that emulsion, evaporation, and spreading can create areas of open water where dispersants can directly enter the water. The Coast Guard notes this comment, which is true and noted on page G-1. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Appendix G G-3, para 3 It is understood that chemical dispersion of oil requires the physics of wave action, but would a dispersant necessarily be used in rough seas? The Coast Guard notes this comment, and yes, the rougher the seas, the more effective dispersants are. 7833-97 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Technical Report Table F.3.1.2-1 In the water quality analysis for the PWS region, the table shows up to a 20-fold increase in estimated adverse effects on water quality for a medium- volume spill treated by dispersants when compared to no dispersants, yet the risk matrix score for dispersants ranges from 4E to 4D, which is nearly equivalent to the score for mechanical-only response. The Coast Guard notes this comment. This is a result of the lower exposure time of dispersed oil. Dispersed oil plumes rapidly disperse and degrade as they move with the currents. Exposure time to species that could be impacted by the dispersed plume is very low due to the movement of the plume (for mobile species as we ll as benthic communities). 7833-97 7833-98 John Devens Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council Michael L. Munger Cook Inlet Citizens Regional Advisory Committee Technical Report Table 4.2.5.-1 In the fish and plankton analysis for a large PWS spill, the table shows the av erage percentage of large pelagic fish adversely affected by dispersants to be as much as 200 times the size of the mechanical-only response option, yet the risk score for dispersant application at either efficiency is 4E, the same as for mechanical-only response. Ecological Risk Assessment Methodology underestimates certain biological and environmental impacts. CIRCAC is concerned that the way in which the ecological risk assessment model calculates the percent of resource potentially affected may underestimate certain adverse impacts. The analysis considers the impacts to each resource and then considers that impact in the context of the entire ecosystem (in the Alaska technical analysis, the whole of Prince William Sound). This type of meso - scale analysis may underestimate certain types of environmental and biological impacts, because it The Coast Guard notes this comment. This scoring result is due to the low exposure time pelagic fish might encounter within a dispersed oil plume. Final PEIS for VRPs and FRPs for Oil 51 2009 Docket Name Location Public Comment USCG Response Number Organization Section Page discounts any negative impa cts that occur within a confined geographic area or over a short period of time. For example, in the Fish and Plankton analysis for a large PWS spill, Table F.4.2.5-1 shows that the average percentage of large pelagic fish adversely affected by dispersants to be as much as 200 times the size of the mechanical-only response option. Yet the risk score for dispersant application at either efficiency is 4E, the same as for mechanical-only response. This same discrepancy occurs in several places in the analysis, where adverse impacts are smoothed out over a larger data set. 7833-109 R. Craig Matthiessen USEPA Office of Emergency Management Technical Report It is understood that chemical dispersion of oil requires the physics of wave action, but would a dispersant necessarily be used in rough seas? The Coast Guard notes these comments. Since most of these comments apply to both the Draft PEIS and the technical report, the Coast Guard has responded to the majority of these comments in the Draft PEIS. However, USEPA must be aware that under NEPA, the Coast Guard is only required to respond to comments that are part of the Draft PEIS.
